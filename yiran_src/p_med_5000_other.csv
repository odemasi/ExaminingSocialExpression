This subreddit convinced me that I needed to get help, and then gave me the courage to go and get that help. I think without all the encouragement and support here, I'd be in a much worse place right now.

I scheduled a GP appointment last week and he diagnosed me with anxiety and panic disorder and referred me to a psych for further evaluation and medication and a therapist. My first therapist appt will be next week and I'm sure it'll be a long and hard journey, but I'm super excited! 

I feel like I'm finally getting my life on track again in terms of emotional health. I can't wait to do all the things I was too anxious or scared to do before - not now, but eventually.

My old doctor told me I had no other mental health issue and I had been doing much better, but now to why I am really posting. 

Recently my husband and I have been struggling with bills, getting school stuff together and saving to move out of the south soon along with that has come a new anxiety. I have been worried if I am happy enough in life, am I depressed, will I be one day, what if one day I kill myself at some point in life, something I hate the thought of. My husband (who has mild depression) says I am not depressed because I always want to go and do and can't stand laying about the house, and I am never sad until I think about these worries. I can't afford a consular right now or medication. So my question is do other people have this sort of anxiety because I haven't seen any post similar to this, and it would just comfort me to know others feel the same. I just can't tell if I am making a normal small worry huge or if I am truly becoming extremely unhappy, its hard to find reality in anxiety sometimes.

I realize this is only marginally related to anxiety but any information might help me get to the bottom of this.

From an early age I have been able to voluntarily cause an electrical shock sensation in my head, I told my parents but they didn't believe me and it turned into something I just kept to myself and didn't talk about. Though recently I heard that some people on anti-depressant medication experience a similar symptom.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome#Neurological

&gt; Symptoms described as ""brain zaps,"" ""brain shocks,"" ""brain shivers,"" ""brain pulse-waves,"" ""head shocks,"" ""pulses,"" ""flickers,"" or ""cranial zings"" are common withdrawal symptoms

&gt; Electric shock sensations have also been reported[24][25] with many patients describing the symptoms as ""brain zaps"". It has been suggested the sensations may represent an alteration of neuronal activity in the central nervous system.

This is roughly where I experience the electrical sensation.

http://i.imgur.com/SrfmQ2G.png

It is underneath the skull and I can make it last a second, it wears down after a few shocks, I very rarely bother doing this, though I did it just now in order to make that picture. Very occasionally I can feel a shock coming on its own and it is stronger than the others, I can suppress it at will as well.

Has anyone ever had a similar experience? I am by no means an expert so I'm not jumping to conclusions, I think it may be related to a low amount of serotonin receptors which may also be related to ADHD.",['compound'],0

I just got prescribed new meds Lexapro and lorazepam. I already know the shit side effects Lexapro can cause with sex, so I was thinking about disregarding it completely. I think I would be way more anxious/depressed if I couldn't get off with my boyfriend. Is there anyone at all out there that DIDN'T have anorgasmia/sex issues on Lexapro? 

Lorazepam - never had experience with this and would like to know more. My grandfather was appalled they prescribed it for me because at one point all of his friends (prescribed for sleep too) got addicted.

But when you're in the middle of a panic attack, when there is nonstop terror and nothing else in the world seems to matter or exist and you're fairly certain you may die, how effective is Lora? My doc said it was faster and stronger than the 0.5mg Xanax I've been using for emergencies. This 0.5mg Lorazepam was prescribed to me to use daily at night but I would like this as my emergency med.

35,35,0.5046298538265543,0.495370146173423,0.132,0.772,0.096,"Hi, I stumbled upon this group searching for some answers about GAD and itching. I have been having disruptive bouts with itchy skin for about 8 months. There have been times when I've felt about [ ] this close to a breakdown over it, and have often ended up crying and in a panic attack. 

I've gone through all the possible causes I can think of:

- I thought it was dry skin for awhile, but no creams/soaps/lotions/etc. help even a little bit. 

- I thought it was environmental, some allergen at my home, so my husband and I gutted our apt. had the carpets cleaned, washed everything with sensitive laundry soap, and still no luck. Also made no sense that my husband has no symptoms like mine.

- I finally went to my dr. and she thought it could be something I was eating... however this seemed very unlikely to me, as I have an extremely varied diet and I thought for sure I would have noticed if there was a link there. But, I did try to eliminate things I'd been eating more of, like coffee, and still no change.

So, long story short, I mentioned it to my sister, who replied, ""OH I had that too! It stopped after I finished school and quit my stressful job."" !! 

I have had a pretty intense year... over a year ago, my other sister left home and cut off our family, so that has been stressful. I've felt very discontent at work for over two years, and finally decided to go back to school online to get my degree and get out—which hasn't really helped with the situation presently, but has added extra stress/time constraints. I also recently saw my doctor about depression, probably induced by all these factors, and she subscribed 5-HTP which I have been taking for nearly three weeks now. 

So with that new suggestion, I've begun to see strong links between my stress and anxiety level and the itching. Since taking 5-HTP I've still had some itching attacks, but they are much more manageable. When I can get out of my situation, take a walk, drive, watch TV, BREATHE, I start to feel better almost immediately. When I'm in the middle of an attack, I notice my breathing becomes short and I cannot concentrate. The one time I had significant relief with no attacks for a week was when I was sick on the tail end of taking time off from work—so I was out for almost two weeks straight, and NO itching during that time. 

MY QUESTION IS THIS: I find relief from taking Benadryl, because it calms me down, but makes me VERY drowsy. And I do not want to take it for a long period of time. I am taking the 5-HTP and meeting with a therapist to try to help, but this week after my first meeting I have had even more attacks of itching (even reading this group to find some answer had me scratching all over). 

TLDR: So what do you (those who have these same symptoms) do to manage it in the meantime? Topical medications? Oral meds? Something else? Is it OK to be taking Benadryl consistently for this? I just need some relief so I can work on getting to where I can manage this anxiety.

We were talking about the various benefits which include improving brain function, possibly preventing neurological disorders later in life, it acts as a mild anti-depressant, among the obvious known benefits. So i told him i would try it and he wrote me a prescription for 50000 ui capsules once per week for 12 weeks. This seemed like a lot to me considering that most supplements are around 400 ui per day. So, naturally i did some research and found that this is a normal amount given to people who are deficient and because it stores in fat and releases over time that you only take it once per week. Also, in my research i read about the rare bad things it can possibly cause, even people reporting panic attacks from taking it. Great. Now, like every medicine i get i don't want to take it.

My insecurities have almost led to me destroying my relationship with my incredibly loving boyfriend, but thankfully his support and love has made us more stable than anything.

Looking back I have had three instances, where I have out of nowhere just fainted. The first time was on holidays, I was standing by a bus stop several years ago with my father and suddenly everything just went black and I fainted. after a few minutes of resting everything went back to normal. I cant recall the onset as it was so long ago but it was quite unexpected, my father just assumed it might be from the heat (38 degrees celsius) and being dehydrated.

Then comes another few instances, all in a social setting, most of the time alcohol was involved or even marijuana but both in moderation. Around friends I wouldnt call myself insecure in the slightest, so the one time I do believe it might have been too much marijuana and my body just temporarily failing. Again, after 10 minutes I was fine. (I do not use it anymore, as my anxiety keeps me away from smoking it nowadays, which is ironic because in places of legalization many people take it as remedy for anxiety.)

Then another time after a couple beers and having a marijuana joint, the same thing happened, all went black and I fainted for a good 3 minutes. My friends immediately put me in a cab home thinking I had drunk too much.

However, the reason I believe it is not CAUSED by , but merely made worse by alcohol &amp; marijuana is because one time it was without any intake of substances;
I was simply having a shower and freaked out because i thought i had noticed an abnormality on my body (which turned out to be nothing), My heart started racing, I freaked out and once again everything started to go black. I quickly sat down in the shower and after a couple minutes of breathing slowly I was all fine. 

Now having looked a bit into Anxiety disorders, it does sound a great lot like I suffer from it. I have always been very good at school, never had issues making friends and am not horrible looking either, but somehow I am extremely insecure and have no self esteem...I believe the neglect of hobbies plays a large role since doing things you enjoy and are good at and where endorphins are involved would certainly prevent such anxiety.

But as of right now, being aware I should increase hobbies such as sports, I would really like to know if I need to be worried. Sometimes when I overworry about something my heart starts racing and racing and I actively have to calm myself down.


A friend of mine who has similar issues has a psychiatrist for a mother and has been taking anti depressants and said they have greatly improved her quality of life, i am just interested what you all think, how do i go about this, it really does impact my life as my self esteem is just..awful and despite having supporting family and partner who tell me how good I am at things and how pretty I am those things just dont have any effect on me. 

I noticed I am over observant in social settings, as to how people act, and i think the fact that i am extremely empathetic is a key factor as well. If someone is feeling uncomfortable I immediately pick it up without even intending to. I always feel the need to make them feel better, its as though my brain just picks up all the uneasiness of others, makes them feel better and in return i end up stuck with all these shit feelings...

i dont know what to do and am honestly considering therapy or some medications that will just calm me down. Sorry about the lack of formatting and structure but I have never really talked to anyone about this so am a bit disheveled. 

Would appreciate ANY kind of advice and thoughts.
Much love,

It's been great reading other people's posts and knowing that what I feel isn't something that only I go through. Because of this, I decided I should reach out.

For reference, I'm a 22-year-old female living in the USA. I am currently taking Lexapro. The best definition of the anxiety I have faced throughout most of my life has been contained in the descriptions for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. However, lately, things have been a little different.

For more context, I'll kind of go over what anxiety has been like for me. As a child, my family moved around relatively often. I didn't notice how quiet and nervous I was until I was around 10. Everyone always said I was just ""shy,"" etc. By the time I reached high school, what had started as just a general inability to speak to most people (extreme social anxiety) had become more like depression. I felt that there was something wrong and broken within me and didn't know what to do. I often thought people would be better off without me, or that if I was gone, no one would miss me. This did not make my crippling social anxiety any more manageable.

This kind of went on through my first year or two of college. Though, I managed to make a little progress with the depression. It helped a lot to have such a caring support system behind me. But I still maintained the social anxiety, and actually began to have a lot of trouble sleeping, and be terrified of germs. The thought of even leaving my room was sometimes too much for me to handle. Going anywhere where there might be people sneezing or coughing made me feel intense panic, which made school difficult, and bus rides practically unbearable.

By January of 2013, it had all become too much. Friends could always see that there was something wrong, but finally, one close friend told me he was worried for me, and that he knew how I felt was a burden on me, and that I shouldn't have to manage so much alone. After this conversation, I talked to my mom, and we decided I should go to our family doctor to talk about what I was going through. He asked me a lot of questions, and ended up prescribing Lexapro. 

The Lexapro has honestly made such a difference in my life. I am much more willing to talk to people now, and have been able to make my fear of germs and infection at least manageable. Things were really looking up for a while, since the medication was prescribed. I do realize, though, that the pills are just a tool to help me find balance. They don't magically make everything better. I have to be willing to work on things too. And I have been.

As I said, things had been a lot better. That is, until I graduated from college last May. I am currently unemployed and am having a lot of difficulty in finding a job, especially one related to my degree. I've noticed a switch flip in me the past few months. I feel like I have reverted back into feeling depressed about 60% of the  time. I sleep for hours upon hours every day and have a lot of trouble getting up. It always seems like a better option to go ahead and aim for 10 or more hours of sleep, or even to just stay in bed rather than start the day. I've also been having panic attacks and getting angry. I'm not generally an angry person. I've always been very chill and calm, but lately I lash out at people for no reason, especially my poor boyfriend, who is so supportive, and someone I'm so thankful for. I find myself feeling so unreasonably angry for even the smallest reasons, that would never have usually made me upset. I feel immense guilt, and like a failure, over not being able to find a job, even though I realize that this is actually quite common anymore. 

I guess I'm just here hoping someone may have some advice for me. I'm wondering if this is just temporary, from my life changing so drastically recently (graduating, entering the ""real world,"" being unemployed and alone at home all day), or if it might be something more serious that I should do something about. I know no one here can tell me that for sure, or give me medical advice. But does anyone maybe have any tips for dealing with things like I've described, short of therapy or more/different medication? Anything you can say would be much appreciated. I know some people have worse problems than I do, and that I'm lucky to have what I have. I've debated about posting at all, worried about judgement and negative reaction, but I honestly just feel like I could use some help. Thank you so much to anyone who replies.",['conj'],0

So here's the back story: I recently started a relationship with a girl who used to simply be a friend that I made up every which reason for not being able to chase after her (was secretly crushing on her and we were close friends) and then she came and showed interest in me and I went right for it. I am madly in love with her and find her to be the greatest thing ever and know I am also a bit clingy.

I'm assuming this is a trigger for me as I've been in a relationship before where they showed interest and I perused to be lead on then dropped like a bad habit and blamed my self for it thinking i went wrong somewhere. Now I have a feeling of inadequacy and have that whole ""I'm doing something wrong and don't know what"" feeling and its acting as a trigger bring multiple break downs a day which I have been free of for about 3 years now. I have already talked to her about it and she told me that its not anything I'm doing things are just bothering her and she prefers not to talk about it. Regardless I cannot shake the feeling I'm whats wrong and every little thing she dose that feels like she's trying to distance herself from me acts as a trigger, it could be anything some thing as little as no response to a text I sent to her, or even receiving a one word response to a text I sent to her expecting a larger response. Anyways I cannot think of any solutions aside from breaking up with her which is the last thing I want to do and want to ask for any ideas on how to cope with this (no meds please).

I went to my DR and basically said I didn't like the high/crash constant pill popping of xanax and wanted something that I could take in the morning and be good for...a while. Keep in mind, I've never taken SSRIs as I don't feel I have a chemical imbalance, but mostly that I am under a lot of pressure most of the time and get overwhelmed, not depressed so much.

I got a precription for Klonopin 1MG twice a day (I only use it either 1 MG per day or .5, I just like being overprescribed so that I don't have to pay my psychiatrist each month or if I forget to make an appt I don't run out). As well as some xanax for breakthrough anxiety as needed.

I have to say that I'm really liking the klonopin. Here's my breakdown as I see it, and again, this stuff works totally different for different people and I'm not a doctor.

Xanax (alprazolam):

Pros-

* Great for breakthrough anxiety attacks
* Great for knocking yourself out on a airplane, although there will be a hangover
* Fast acting with a bit of a rush to know its gonna be okay
* Great to keep in your pocket to ward off anxiety because you know you can diffuse it
* If you smoke trees or do psychadelics, invaluable for getting you out of a freakout

Cons

* Very short acting, meaning re-dosing often and riding a bit of a roller coaster
* Very tough on memory, even .5 mg means I might get some brownout retrograde amnesia about what I did the previous day while on it.
* Makes my stomach feel kinda weird, like empty and just a little uncomfortable
* I don't drink much, but be careful with booze around xanax

Klonopin (clonezepam):

Pros-

*  Don't feel medicated, just feel rather normal and somewhat more confident, good for social anxiety
*  The long acting properties means you don't think about it which (if you have an addictive personality) means you just kinda take it occasionally, but there's no reason to be popping these more than once or twice a day (morning and night is a popular regiment)
*  Takes less than an hour to kick in, don't really notice it
* Great for productivity, doesn't cloud thinking in smaller doses and lowers inhibitions in a good way.
* Cuts off anxiety at its source, just seems to stop the worrying cycle
* Takes the edge of smoking trees without totally killing your buzz
* Nice warm feeling and relaxing
* Less amnesia
* Easier to get off of as it is longer lasting and tapers itself nicely

Cons

* Not great for instant panic situations, although you'll have less of them.
* Not very useful recreationally (yay!)

Having been using it for a few weeks now, I really really like it and how it helps me be the person I knew I should be. Meditation and talk therapy are also part of my regiment, but this is one medicine change I've been very happy with.

I find the strength to be somewhat comparable, but to me 1mg xanax feels like 1.5-2mg of Klonopin.

Best of luck out there, it's going to be okay.

Then I slept six hours but waking up I'm so dizzy I have to hold onto things to walk and my double vision is so bad that I can't read. Is that normal with Lorazepam? What should I do?",['conj'],0

Just thought that maybe I should share my story for no reason whatsoever. Perhaps so that others wouldn’t do the same things I am doing now. 

Actually, nothing is too bad. I do have a supportive family, a couple of friends, and I’m studying to become what I’ve always wanted, which is translation from foreign languages. I would never go to a therapist because nothing is bothering me on the inside – or more likely because I don’t want to admit I have any problems speaking to a doctor. It might all be just my imagination, after all. 

I’m 20, male, and I have Cystic Fibrosis, a chronic illness that is incurable and leaves me with a somewhat shorter lifespan than usual, but if I eat all the pills and do all the treatments, it’s going to be alright for quite a bit more years, aside from coughing a lot every single day. I’m living with my Mom, who has sheltered me from most of human interaction on the good grounds of that the more exposure to the outside world I get, the sooner I get ill and the shorter my life is. I’ve never talked to a cashier to buy anything, I’ve never went anywhere outside the house alone with only one or two exceptions I will tell later, I’ve never went to a school to talk with the kids.

I did, however, have three or four good friends in the summer, when Mom and the grandparents were at the summer house, since I was 5 or 6 until around 15. Thanks to CF, my hormones are a little bit off, and the puberty started quite a couple of years later than usual, and my peers mostly used me as a source of toys and an easy target for bullying. One day, they stopped coming to my house for there were other entertaining things, such as flirting and girls and booze and smoking, of all which I didn’t join them. Roughly that time was when I got my first computer and switched from teachers coming home-schooling by foot to teachers coming home in a computer screen. Obviously, I got some friends as a bonus as well.

Now, what’s the problem? The problem is, I’m dead scared to talk to any kind of people I have to talk to. I got a dog to go outside alright, and I was walking him almost every day (except for extremely high or low temperatures, or the sick times), up until some old lady said she didn’t want me or my dog walking anywhere near her cats, which is at the entrance of the house (and that’s a very urban city for you). Then, I never walked with the dog again, except for when Mom agreed to walk with me as well. 

Then, there is the university, which also is going strong through the Internet, and all the fellow students and teachers. I’m both extremely jealous of all them because they talk freely at the lectures and even communicate one another outside of them, and angry at myself that I can’t belong to the group, too, and be the cause of laughter, source of knowledge, or just a general student. A year ago, when the first year started, I talked with everyone at the lectures, and everyone seemed to love me, only that my heart was pounding and my feet and hands were dead cold every time I had to talk, and then, well, I just stopped talking. I'm still going to the lectures, but whenever my name is mentioned, I shut off the computer and just sit there not even feeling awful or guilty that much. I guess that as far as I do the homeworks meeting all the deadlines, they won’t kick me out (I’m still the best student out of the group, as the teachers say), so it’s all good, but I still wish I could be re-plugged into the network of other students again, or something.

I’m not at all concerned about relationships, but, sadly enough, I attracted a very nice guy to myself, and even though he’s great and very caring and passionate, I don’t feel anything back to him. Might be because I’m not gay (but most likely I am, because I’ve never ever talked to girls in my life or felt the need or desire to do so). We talked a lot, and I reciprocated his “I love you”’s and other things because I didn’t know what they really meant. He loves me utterly and completely, and I have no idea what to do about it. Therefore, instead of watching movies or TV series or playing games together there is that same outcome: I stopped talking to him using my voice, and am avoiding talking to him in text, even though I know that’s not fair at all concerning him and how he cares about me.

So, here I am, not talking to anyone but my family and one single best friend, being angry and confused since I can’t find a way to be more talkative and not shy again (even though I am on Atarax, the medicine one doctor prescribed me to use against the anxiety, it doesn’t seem to help much so far). I’m probably not even intelligible and talk rubbish and not what you really want to hear. Oh well, can’t help that. Maybe one day I will ask the doctor if I might have Asperger’s, since my AQ score is way over the top, but I don’t think that will be any soon. I’d better be off living as it is now than talking about myself and what I might feel and what opinions I have on things to any person at all.

After graduating I managed to find a full time, 40 hour a week job to help pay the rent for the two of us.

Her anxiety has gotten so bad that it's meant she's quit university without graduating (in her final year) which means we both have huge student loans to pay off. She can't find a job, she's been looking for just over 3 months, but her anxiety is so bad that she can't physically hand out CVs, answer the phone to strangers or attend interviews. We've tried counselling and medication, but we gradually lost hope in finding a 'cure'. She's currently staying at home 24/7 whilst I'm working, so I'm not sure if there are any jobs that she can do whilst at home. She's perfectly normal when she's at home, but as soon as we leave the house to find a job or go to the doctors she mentally breaks down and becomes very emotional in public, which can get quite embarrassing at times.

I've been supportive of this for years now, but it's gradually getting worse and I can't financially support both of our rent. I'm getting seriously depressed working for the sake of staying alive. The thing is, it's almost contagious, I've found myself being a happy guy to becoming socially awkward and upset a lot. I like to think i'm supportive, I have been the last few years but now I'm doubting our future together because everything is slowly falling apart. I've given her the ultimatum that she has to get a job before Christmas or she has to move out and live with her parents. I love her so much but I can't financially support both of us for much longer without her moving away for a while. I've seriously thought about breaking up with her because I can't handle the situation, but that would make me a weak and guilty person, which is something I can't live with on my conscience. 

I can't have fun or live with my girlfriend anymore, and it's killing me inside. Can anyone give me some advice?

Edit: I just realized that this post seems quite self-centered. I'm not upset because her anxiety is affecting me, but because it's having an adverse affect on our relationship.",['conj'],0

My parents were drinking a lot when I was young. There was a lot of yelling and hitting. I felt unsafe at school and at home. On the weekends when they were not drinking I felt ok. Not happy, I can’t remember a time when I was actually happy. There was always some kind of a problem, either medical or financial. They had enough money to provide essentials to me and my brothers. They just preferred to spend it on alcohol.

I have a couple of medical problems. Not sure if they were caused by my anxiety and depression or if it was the other way around. I have severe psoriasis on my scalp and in other areas on my body. My gums bleed despite flossing, brushing, rinsing and regular visits to the dentist. As of a week I have lost partial hearing in my left ear. I am pretty sure it is connected to my psoriasis but I have yet to consult a specialist.

I used to enjoy things. I have been very passionate about video games, books, music, TV shows and movies. I thoroughly enjoyed any kind of fiction. I used to come up with the ideas for books, TV shows and movies. Now I enjoy nothing. I have sold almost all of my possessions to have some sort of emergency fund. I have no debts, but since my health is not too well I consider it necessary. I also did it because I did not enjoy them anymore. I have sold all my gadgets. The only things of any value I own are a laptop and a phone.

I have not left the house in almost two years since I have graduated college. Except for the occasional trip to another city to visit my brother. I do not go out since I have no friends. I used to have one female friend. We used to hold hands together and generally talk about everything. But we had some differences and now we do not even talk anymore. I feel kind of indifferent towards females. My sex drive is at all times low. I rarely masturbate. Not because I feel the need to. Simply because I have read somewhere that regular ejaculation prevents prostate cancer. I work out a lot. But there are no gains in muscle mass or confidence. I do it because I feel like I need to, but deep down I feel like it is pointless. Like everything else.

I have not been able to get a full time job for the same amount of time. I had literally two job interviews since I left school. On both occasions I have heard the same thing: That I give of the vibe of someone extremely introverted and shy and that I might not be a good fit for their team. I have been deluding myself that I have some minor translation work going for me but I have not done anything with it for a long time. I might be able to start soon if I get accepted into another company but I will not be making much. I get intense panic attacks in situations which will affect my future. These include job interviews and meetings with new people and old colleagues. I do not think I am a hypochondriac. It prevents me from having the life I want. I cannot afford therapy or medication. Not until I get that good job. It is so bad that I am considering drinking before my next big interview.

I do not know what to do next. They tell me to live but I do not see the point to. Every situation, friendship, relationship feels temporary. Nothing lasts forever. I am terrified of growing old. I am scared of what other medical problems another ten years will bring. I fear being alone for the rest of my life. I am scared of being dependent on others for the rest of my life. But that is exactly what we all are, dependent on our employers and clients. I need advice. Please tell me what else I can do.

I know it seems slightly pessimistic and for all of the ""suffers"" probably a bit misconstrued because, ""we're actually inflicted!"". I have recently been tossing this idea around in my head considering that I have been in a struggle with what I believed to be depression/anxiety/ocd...etc, and I thought that my life wasn't in my own control anymore. It seemed that I might as well hand over my ability to reason to my newly anointed ""crazy, endlessly-running, sad"" mind. This was my exact thought process for a year and a half up until now. 

I found the idea to call myself mentally unstable after I seemingly lost control of my thought process and allowed dark, repressed thoughts to take the reins over a couple weeks time until one day where I caved. The year before this I had walked onto a Division 1 mid-major swim team without prior training aside from dedicating every minute of my previous summer to transforming myself into a grade A athlete. My mind was focused on nothing else and this was good for me, as I had finally found a way to disassociate myself from my half year of sadness after a breakup and a shitty freshman roommate. My sophomore year was promising, as I began the year with the least experience, the best build and a whole lot of room for improvement on the team. Come the third month of training and my season is plagued by a very fucked shoulder and I was forced to watch my teammates succeed from the bench, not to mention I had just recently tried to find happiness in one of the most beautiful girls I have ever known. I tried to repeat my prior relationship the same way as my first and immediately my infidelities came out. She obviously was excited at first but saw my sad motives and moved on. At the end of the year I knew that my athletic career was over and I had literally no clue where I stood with women, not to mention I had developed a weird anxiety where I was constantly checking to make sure I wasn't going to piss myself in class. God Dammit. I basically thought I had no hope for anything. Later on I broke down to my parents about how scared this made me feel while omitting the anxiety issues. I lost all hope for life and I was sad as shit. 

Enter the summer before junior year and I have started my first internship with a broken ego. My boss was quite possibly the most abusive person I think I will ever meet and one of my coworkers was a closet homosexual. I know that's a brash thing to say but it was discussed around the workplace and it was quite obvious. The reason that is relevant is because of a developed new thought process that made me terrified of becoming gay. Funny, right? I had never had these thoughts previous and became terrified of myself. The sheer thought of homosexuality destroyed my well being and it made me turn from a confident individual who had never had any issues being outgoing into a nervous, shy person who would have rather sat in my room and stare off into space. Fast forward past the summer and I had scavenged the internet for the ""answers"" to what was going on. This was on top of the fact that I had entered myself into a peer-pressured lifestyle of a fraternity. I unfortunately and fortunately am one of the better looking guys at my school and felt pressure from everyone I knew, even when it wasn't as present as I made it out to be. I would later on learn that this pressure was a self-pursued fantasy. Good-looking people can still be scared shit-less, when approaching the opposite sex when sober.

H.O.C.D. and Depression: ""A debilitating combo that affects very few OCD sufferers around the world. The normal patient has constant spikes in anxiety when placed in a situation involving sexual contact or where possible sexual connotations are present. Usually the patient is not gay and has never had previous desires for homosexual contact. The patient must go through a series of Cognitive therapy practices and medication must be supplemented to overcome these harmful thoughts."" Perfect, I found my answer. I was an OCD kid who simply couldn't get rid of some thoughts. Now remember, I was so deep into my own thoughts that the ""H.O.C.D."" was actually ruining my life. I kept reading deeper and deeper into my issues and decided to couple my new life with a bad habit of smoking weed 2/3 times a day, even after a previous bad experience with pot immediately following my first breakup. I thought to much, cast my health to the dregs and made bad decisions all year. I played friendship like it was an instrument and didn't really hold anything dear. It was like I had thrown in the towel and allowed my thoughts to capture who I actually was. 

I knew I needed help, so I went to see a therapist at school. It seemed like the perfect chance to take a step to recovery, even though I still had no genuine understanding of my issues but still a good opportunity. The only issue was that I was assigned a gay therapist. Perfect. I gave him half assed answers the entire time and eventually gave up on the sessions without disclosing my OCD fears. 

Fast-forward into the spring and was at a loss for what I was going to do with myself. I hated myself, It felt like there was nothing I could do and the fact that I kept reading into my issues from other peoples, similar but still subjective problems, did not help. The next summer came and my anxiety was at an all time high. I vividly remember having horrific panic attacks, where my body was almost uncontrollable. I hated where I was and I hated who I had become. 

This past fall, I finally found some courage to change my life. I went to a new therapist and a psychologist at school and told them everything. It felt good and honestly even though I honestly thought I was insane, I definitely noticed a change in my thoughts the day after my sessions. This revelation did come with a price though. The price was a new sense of purpose in life and my submissive anxiety filled character started to fade away. Once I harnessed that, I started smoking less and eventually became more engulfed in my health. I tried acid a few times too, which I thought was just going to make me crazy but it actually did the opposite, It allowed me to grow even when I did have one bad trip. Continue up to now and I have apologized to the people I have hurt, removed some bad seeds from my friendship group and stopped grasping others specific issues as answers to my own issues (I'm looking at you reddit). I have begun to write occasionally and although I still suffer from the occasional bad thought, I find it now more subjective in my case and I rely on myself to change my life and thought process. The things that finally brought me back to some sort of reasonable mental state were not relying on my thoughts to predict my happiness and making my actions key in defining who I actually am. I'm not going to say I'm happy all the time and I'm not going to say I'm sad all the time either, but I have changed and have embraced my growth from youth to manhood as a beautiful part of life, no matter how terrifying it is. I have also realized that being shitty to women and collecting sexual partners is a terrifying way to live life and it won't collect happiness for you, especially if thats not how you lived life upto college. Taking note of the world around me and not fitting all of my problems into each and every single moment of my life has proved key in my recovery. Moving moment to moment is better than continuing a thought filled, action-less life, but then again that's subjective for me. 

P.S. Acid is a beautiful drug and you won't go crazy from it unless you have a legitimate family history of schizophrenia or something of the like. 

TL;DR: OCD and other mental health issues are real, but become exacerbated to the point of finding yourself in a horrible pit of despair. Don't rely on reading others experience to change you, change yourself and trust your instincts over your harmful thoughts.

I have health insurance that covers what I would need to see someone about therapy or medication.

But if I do go (and I will depending) does my employer have to know? Is there any way they can find out I went to get treatment for mental illness? 

I'd really like to keep that a personal matter. ",['conj'],0

I feel I am the same person, but, awake, alive, and unafraid. I still feel anxiety/fear, although it creeps up I feel it recognize it and it goes away. I find this change to be incredible, strange, and wonderful. I used to have panic attacks that made me miss work, cause horrible painful swelling in my joints and skin. I would get a temperature and experience the most awful mental distress where I felt I was coming apart. I would self harm and wail.

So a few months back after a bad storm that made life at work hell (cops involved, people becoming ill and injured, other crap) and the decision that I was going to be moving out. I had the panic attack of all panic attacks. I had been inside wailing (that uncontrollable cry you hear from a mourner) It is distressing for all involved to hear that sound so I went outside sat in a chair (to be away from others) and slumped forward and I have no idea what happened. For 2 hours I sat on the porch. I had the strangest experience (probably from lack of oxygen) where I saw warm and cold light. The feeling of becoming super small, but also a feeling of ""Oneness."" I came out of it when someone came out to check on me. When I went inside I felt very VERY strange but everything felt very real, I was ready to get ride of everything I ""owned"" I did two weeks later donate bags and bags of things to goodwill and threw away trash bag after trash bag of junk. But since then, I have not had a panic attack, instead when I feel one, the need to cry or my heart going nuts, or my skin swelling- I become calm- I feel warmth and that ""oneness"" again I feel loving- still fearful but with a sweet undertone.  I know this did not happen on its own, I did years of therapy, studying, and medications (I am no longer on.) This event, altered the way I see the world and respond to it, it stripped away a part of my built up reactions to stress. 

So, any idea of what the hell happened? I do not miss the extreme anxiety. I do not miss missing work or school and I do not miss the pain and stress. But what the heck happened? How? I feel like a person who is stable. Like this is what living was supposed to feel like the entire time,,, wtf?",['conj'],0

The stress of it, on the other hand, resulted in me spending 20 minutes crying. The crying resulted in a pounding headache that I've had for 8+ hours now. I took an oxycodone to help ease it and am waiting for it to kick in fully, but I know it may not help the headache itself since different pain medication types work on different kinds of pain. I took it more in the hopes that it will relax me enough to lower my blood pressure. I probably should've taken a xanax instead, but I'm down to 2 left and I've been too anxious and tired to make another doctor appointment to get a new script.

I don't have a history of blood pressure issues besides stress headaches every now and then. I'm pretty much writing this in the hopes that putting it down in words will help me calm down enough to sleep it off. Mostly, though, I wanna throw up, cry more, and stick my head in the refrigerator in the hopes that the cold will stop the pain.

One thing I really want to know, though, is whether or not this is a migraine? I've never been diagnosed with migraines before, but I've been told by family and friends that migraine pain is excruciating. I don't like being overzealous with saying I ""have a migraine"", but this stress headache has lasted more than 8 hours, light seems to make it hurt worse, but lack of light doesn't do much to help.

I was able to clip them for the first time ever last night. Anxiety that once ran my life, and thoughts that once clouded my judgement and vision, have ceased to control my decisions, beliefs, and actions. To all of you brave souls out there who struggle day by day, I make this post to tell you that anxiety can be conquered. The struggle isn't easy; there were countless times when I felt unable to fight back. But each day it became easier and easier, where finally my intrusive thoughts are nothing but insignificant blips of random, fleeting images.

My struggle is my own, and anxiety is a many-faced monster that differs from person to person. But through the years I have found that there are so many ways to fight it. Therapy and medication are not to be overlooked, despite the unfair stigma that may surround them. Friends and family can help as well, but in the end we are the ones who know our own personal little shit monsters called anxiety the best. It is a fight, and it will be difficult at times, but it is this hardship that makes us stronger and stronger.

If anything at all goes wrong, it can and will ruin my mood at the moment, for the day, or even for the week. If a video-game session doesn't go exactly like I wanted, if the pizza I ordered isn't made the way I had hoped, if I want to play with my cat and she bites me because she wants to be left alone... things like these (mostly, but not always) make me want to crawl in a hole and cry, as if something tragic had happened.

Living life for me is like tip-toeing around a field of landmines everywhere I go, which makes me want to do the only thing I know won't set off my anxiety-- lay in bed, in the dark, and do absolutely nothing.

This, by the way, is with the help of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication. Which seem like it will turn into a pipe dream soon, since I have no health insurance and can't afford any since I'm unemployed.

Where do i start...

I am not sure why i am writing this, i just need to get it out.
I am 27 years old and live in Northern Ireland. I live with my parents. My mum is bedbound with MS and requires consistant care. 

Previous to last week this was provided by me and my dad. My dad is an alcoholic, after two years of sobriety he relapsed last christmas.

On saturday he stopped drinking and suffered a withdrawal seizure on saturday night. He was kept in hospital but got increasingly agitated and confused.
He is not the same, more irritable, his personality isn't him. He is mixing up what day it is, doesn't understand that he isn't well and also his mobility, which was already bad, is worse.

The doctor wanted to do a CT scan to check on the confusion, but said it was likely due to the withdrawal due to its sudden onset. 
My dad was throwing tantrums to get home and i got a phone call to say they couldn't keep him in as he refused treatment.
The doctors couldn't keep him in and even declared him fit to sign himself out tonight(!). My brother who lives nearby has been helping the past few days, but he has his own family, work and other things
which means i am the one here 24/7. 

Just now my dad went downstairs, dressed in his pajama shirt and trousers, looking to go to the post office as he thought it was 10am rather than 10pm.
Given his confused state and the fact it is still bright outside, i am hoping this was just a small mistake.
I am hoping and wishing so much that the confusion passes and that it is just a phase of the withdrawal.
I am calling my mothers social worker tomorrow to organise daily care for her, a social worker for my dad is supposed to call me tomorrow morning
and i will also call his own doctor to see if there is some type of monitoring that can be done, or medication to settle him.

I am on the edge, panicking, anxious, nervous and worried. I can barely handle taking care of my mum on her own, now to add a mentally confused alcoholic also...

I don't know what to do, i am on my own here, i haven't slept properly in four days and have barely eaten. When i ask for help no-one knows what to do, or cannot offer help.

I am thinking of just leaving and letting the social services do what they have to. At this point my patience for my dad is wearing thin, i am just concerned about my mum. Her mental
state is not really there at all and she is unaware of any of this. 

I had to leave my job a few months ago because of his crap and to make sure my mum was being looked after right, i feel stuck, trapped and like there is nothing i can do to get out of this.",['conj'],0

(Early 20s, living with fiance, diagnosed with bipolar, GAD and panic disorder. Taking lamictal daily and xanax as needed)


I got a new job a little over a month ago. A true dream job for me, everything I wanted. Everything went great at first, but each mistake I made just snowballed. I messed up a project, and even though the manager just corrected me, it still hung over me some. This kept repeating. My anxiety started to impact my work. My coworker, friends and family all kept telling me that mistakes are normal when you're new. That I shouldn't worry. 

Last week, my boss called me into her office for a performance evaluation. She struggled to come up with things I was doing well. She said that I was doing ""terrible in regards to both speed and accuracy."" That I'd ""been going two steps back for every one forward."" Direct quotes. Then she cut my hours by 25%.

Before this, none of my managers had mentioned a problem. Individual errors had been pointed out with increasing frequency, but I was always told ""it's okay, just do it like this next time."" I feel blindsided. I mean, I kept thinking ""omg, I'm terrible, I can't do my job, I'm awful, they're going to fire"" but I pushed those thoughts out of my mind. Well, those thoughts were right.

 I can't get by working just these new hours. I'm going to need a new job. It's like I was fired, except they expect me to keep coming in. If I just quit, I'll have to borrow money to make it through the next month.

TODAY

I went in to work today after a lot of handholding and encouragement from my fiance. Normally, I dread work up until I get there, and then calm down once I actually get going. So I just kept telling myself that all I had to do was get there, and I'd be ok. I had taken a xanax right when I woke up, which is normally enough to keep my calm for quite a while even at my most anxious. I was still shaking though, and none of my ""tools"" were working. (Mantras, deep breathing, acknowledging each worry then letting it go, etc. I've got a whole pile of tools like these stashed away that normally help substantially.)

I get to work, and it just keeps getting worse. It doesn't ease up as I start doing tasks. At all. I slip away to the bathroom and take another xanax. I keep waiting for it to kick in, to take the edge off, anything. (I can't even remember the last time I took two in one day. One has always been enough. Always slowed me down enough to use my ""tools."") I only notice it ""kicked in"" when I become a complete klutz. Very dangerous at my job. It was that almost drunken feeling like I got the first time I took xanax, before I got used to it.  But I didn't feel calmer. I just felt more panicked. I was fucking up even more than usual and nothing was helping. I hadn't had a panic attack in over a year until today. I went back into the bathroom, stayed there for a while, told my manager I was sick and had to go home, she told me to call tonight and let her know if I'll be coming in tomorrow. As I'm getting my things, I can hear her talking to my boss. My boss saying how she doubts I'll be back. My manager laughing. I rush out and go home, trying to keep myself together on the train. 

WHERE I NEED HELP

I don't know how to go back into work tomorrow. I just don't. I feel just as helpless as I did when I had my first panic attack. I'm seeing my psychiatrist Monday. I know, and genuinely believe, that things will be okay in the long run. I have job interview on the 7th. The job it's for is only ""meh,"" but I know I can get it if I want to and I'd be less demanding. So what do I do tomorrow? I feel like I can't go in. How am I supposed to tough this one out? Do I call in sick? Do I just stop showing up? Do I call and quit without notice? My normal answer would just be to ""work through it"" and go in anyway. But I really don't think I can. My tools, my medication, my stubborn attitude aren't enough this time. It scares me. I'm nearly freaking out now just trying to figure out my plan. Please help. ",['conj'],0

It was only a passing moment because she seemed more concerned with getting me through a really hard transition of colleges. It was a very helpful experience but it ultimately didn't work out too well. Because of this I'm afraid of going back to her because I initially went to wonder why I had been having so much trouble connecting with people. The problems is really getting out of hand. I'm a mid-twenties male. Only recently finished taking classes at a community college and never had a job. Constantly feeling hopeless, lost, and confused with just about everything involved with my life. I have enough friends and family I could count on one hand. Even so, I keep then only at arm's length. I can't go out and make friends because I'm horrible at conversation. Trying to find a job has been the worst feeling in the world. After reading some more into social anxiety, it feels likes so right to me. I sometimes get breathing problems, my mind will often become so overwhelmed with thoughts or emotions that I have to step back. I usually just have to go somewhere alone and curl up for a little bit. My chest gets tight feeling and I start to just feel entrapped. It's incredibly embarrassing and I'm so ashamed of the problem that I have trouble even reaching out for help. This shouldn't be a concern to anyone, I mean it's a part of life, and moving on, even if it's a transition. I can sit and rationalize through it as much as I can but sometimes I just act entirely on fear. I want help, I feel like I need help. If I can't find a resolve for things soon, I fear I may result to poor tactics that really damage ad ruin my life. It's become a horrible catch twenty-two with my life that I want to be alone and isolate myself for everyone but it's in that loneliness that things become the worst and I miss everyone I use to know.  
  
Alternatively, Are there any jobs that someone with social anxiety would be good for?

I have generalized anxiety with obsessive and focused worries. About a year ago my first serious girlfriend, and the only person I've ever loved, broke up with me. It was difficult (which is expected) and made worse by my anxiety (also expected) but I mostly dealt with it and have since gotten into a new relationship that is several months old.

For almost a month I have felt serious anxiety about relationships. I have felt unsure about my feelings for my new girlfriend even though I can rationally acknowledge that she's a great person and that things are going well and much better than my last relationship, which definitely had its problems. I keep doubting whether I feel strongly enough to be able to fall in love with her and ultimately take the next steps (moving in together, marriage, etc.), I doubt whether I find her attractive enough, etc. Basically I have this need to ""feel sure"" about so much despite knowing that I can honestly say she's a pretty and wonderful caring person who I get along well with.

Coming up against this is the fact that I still think a lot about my ex. Not in a heart-broken way exactly; I just think a lot about the relationship. I think back to fights we had, good times we had, ask myself lots of what-ifs, and imagine how she would respond to different things I think and say right now. Sometimes it's just a bunch of thoughts that run around my head, other times it's quite upsetting.

My therapist tells me that the problem is my fear over really putting myself in this new relationship and really committing myself (not commitment in the relationship sense, he means more my intentions towards her). He says this is why I keep thinking about and idealizing a past relationship that was ultimately not a very good one, and using it to convince myself that the current one isn't good enough.

I think this makes sense and I'm trying to work with it, but after almost a month of obsessing...I'm just so tired guys. I keep worrying and I keep doubting, and I think about it all the time. I try to do all the stuff I'm supposed to do to calm myself and change my thinking (therapy, changing self talk, mindfulness, meditation, medication, exercise, etc.). And it just doesn't seem to be changing anything. I'm just really scared about my current relationship, though I can't give a definite reason. We've been dating for four months so it's still early, but there have been no ""red flags"". But I'm scared about taking any next steps with her. At the same time I'm scared of taking any actions based on my irrational thoughts. But I'm sure you know that even when I can identify them they aren't that easy to ignore.

I'm starting to ramble, sorry. I guess I just want to know if other people deal with this in new relationships and if they can offer any advice or encouragement. That goes double for anybody who has gotten therapy for Relationship-based OCD, which matches a lot of what I'm talking about. Thanks.

TL;DR - I have had anxiety issues for years, and I am feeling all sorts of anxiety over a new relationship and whether I'm ""sure enough"" about it or it's ""good enough"" despite the fact that I know it is. I'm scared of things getting more serious until I can address or quell these thoughts.",['conj'],0

 I posted here a few weeks ago about my new struggles with anxiety. I knew it was anxiety because both of my parents struggled with it when they were my age and had told me about it. I was having panic attacks at school. Well, I've turned the corner. The first few days at school (college) after my panic attack I spent all day doing my best to fight off new panic attacks (which meant I couldn't talk to people and basically used all of my energy to fight the panic). The real turning point was a day when I had a bunch of tests on the same day. I'm good at tests (always have been),  and they focused me because I had less time to sit quietly and think. Because I was so busy, I literally forgot about my anxiety problems and just did my work. After that, I said to myself ""Well, you got through a whole day without any anxiety, so you should be fine today."" Now, whenever I start to feel panic set in, I say to myself ""no, that doesn't happen anymore."" I know many of you here have much more serious anxiety problems than I did, but when I was at my worst, I thought this was the new normal for me. I thought I would forever struggle with anxiety and that I would never be a ""normal"" person ever again. Here I am, no anxiety, no panic attacks, no medication, just a normal dude. It can and does get better overnight if you don't let it control you. ",['conj'],0

I’ve come to realize that I have a crippling fear of rejection.  It doesn’t matter by who or what, it gets in the way and makes me lose all ambition to do things.  I don't want to do anything but sleep.  I’ve started to realize this because 9 times out of 10 my weekends are spent sitting at my house by myself. I start by watching Netflix or playing PlayStation but eventually I wind up staring at the wall/ceiling depressed because I want to be out doing something with someone or anyone.  But I’m not.

I have a circle of friends.  I could probably find myself out on the town or at a bar with at least one of them with a few text messages.  But I can’t bring myself to contact anyone because I’m afraid they’ll say no.   It doesn’t matter who it is.  For example, I have two particular friends that I don’t see very often, but when we do wind up seeing each other to work during the day we always make plans to go out that night.  They tell me they want to see me more and they’re a call or text away but *I can’t bring myself to ask them because I’m afraid they’ll say no.*  

I’ve grown to hate weekends because they're always the same thing.  On Friday nights I hope I get to do something with roommates, roommates inevitably leave to go do their own things without me without asking if I want to come along (or there's reasons I don't want to go, like having to third wheel), and I’m left alone in my solitude to wish I was with other people.

Is this a thing I should go talk to someone about?  Should I seek out medical attention and maybe medication?  It’s been happening off and on for about a year now, but more on than off lately.  I have a great job, I'm making money, and all things considered I don't really have reasons to be unhappy and afraid all the time. But I’m really tired of it.  And I'm afraid of what could happen if I try to fix it. :/

I was working for a major insurance company and I lost my job due to depression. I ended up getting evicted and moved in temporarily with my grandmother. She is the only member of my family that has ever reliably been there for me. 

As I stayed with her I came to realize that she needed someone to take care of her. I talked with her and asked her if she wanted me to stay with her indefinitely and be her caregiver. After some consideration she agreed that things were becoming difficult for her and it would help her a great deal. After a short period of time her health began to wane. After being a smoker for 40 some odd years she had COPD and CHF, and then was diagnosed with a hereditary problem secondary pulmonary hypertension which affects the lungs. The long and short of it is that my grandmother retains water and requires a heavy dose of diuretics to get rid of the water. About 3 months ago, while in the hospital for one of her numerous stays she began to hallucinate. The doctors determined that the diuretics had taken a toll on her kidneys and she could no longer be ""aggressively treated"" for her water retention problem, and the hallucinations were due to her medication poisoning her. Since her health has been steadily declining and she now is in hospice care, and I'm scared as shit she's going to pass any moment. 

I've done the best I could to take care of her, but the past 3 years have been very difficult. I have had no income at all, and my grandmother only makes about $1500 a month. In the state of michigan, we did not qualify for any programs to receive any financial assistance to provide me with any form of income. We've been able to get by, but barely.

So I'm at a point where I'm watching someone I love die. And all of her children are already divvying up her belongings and getting ready to fight over pathetically small amounts of money. They already let me know that they would rather sell her car and split the money rather than let me have it. Which I don't honestly care about. I don't want to financially gain anything for the loss of my gram. But I'm furious that they would be so petty and wouldn't even wait for her body to be cold before laying claim to my grandmother's belongings. It just makes me sick, she didn't raise them to be like that. On top of that I am walking out of the situation the same way I entered it, broke with no where to go. But the very worst part, the part I can't handle, is the dread of knowing my grandmother can pass at any time. I lived with my grandparents from the ages of 2 to 5, and this was by far the happiest time of my life. I just don't think I'm strong enough to endure anymore. I feel like I am about to collapse.

As of yesterday, back on therapy, and meds (I hate that I'm on them, but we dicussed that they are for short term.) I ordered my own coffee yesterday. Without having a meltdown and crying for my twin to help me and get me out of the store. I then sat outside and a girl noticed my shirt (Shaun of the Dead) and I talked to her without having a panic attack and made an excuse on leaving.

It's the first time in over a year I have been able to do that. I don't think I'm on that pink cloud, because today I had to drive to a different town to go see a movie and I had to switch with my mother (I feel so childish, because i'm going to be thirty) to take over for me when I started getting in to San Antonio. She promised it was not a big deal, and she was glad to spend time with me. I then ordered my own movie ticket, and picked out my drink without thinking about it for 20 mins. 

It feels like things are finally starting to work for me. I just needed to share, because this sub has helped me a lot. I may not post in here, but I read it and don't feel so alone. :)

I was put on a 20miligram dose of Lexapro, has anyone else here had any success with it, are there any side effects that are uncommon that I should be super aware of? ",['npadvmod'],0

It starts like any other anxiety attack. A little nervousness mixed in with a little anxiousness. 
     Then, came the chest tightness and the lack of breath. It feels like my wind pipe is being gently hugged from the inside. My eyes start to go cross-eyed and blur. Everything is a gentle haze as I stumble down the hallway. I am unsure anymore, which way is up and which way is down? I sink to my knees and gasp for breath. Each breath catches in my throat. Too much air is going out and not enough is going in. My heart is singing a tune so loud that it feels like it wants to give up. I sink lower to the ground, my mind racing, trying to....make sense.

*This is just a panic attack, just a panic attack, nothing else, just a panic attack.         
This is just a panic attack, just a panic attack, nothing else, just a panic attack.*

This is my new mantra, as I drag my body off the floor and get up. I have to keep moving. I work my way towards the kitchen to get what my body needs. A glass of water and medicine. I find my way to the sink as my vision starts closing in. Everything is going dark around the edges and the edges are going out of focus. It's like a kaleidoscope without all the colors.
Filling my cup is a lot harder than it should be. My hands are trembling so much, that I have to fill it twice. I successfully open my pill bottle and down two pills. I wish it was like the movies. They have instant relief, as soon as the pills hit their mouth. That isn't the case here. I stumble my way back down the hallway and crawl in bed. Now, I just hope for sleep to over take me and I can rest. There is no need for me to set an alarm. I won't be late. This happens enough, that I have an alarm for that.",['conj'],0

I'm currently an 18-year-old full-time student and I've had anxiety my whole life.  But recently I've discovered that my dad has anxiety too, and even was prescribed medication (my mom made it seem like it wasn't a huge deal) but after a while quit taking it because he ""didn't want to be propped up on it his whole life"". 

Now, as for me, I've been anxious ever since I was a kid. I used to pick my fingers until they bled and nowadays I've moved onto my face which of course triggers some horrible self-worth problems on my part. I also had a few panic attacks back in high school to the point where I was sobbing to my mom trying to explain what was happening/what I was feeling but was unable to put it into words. She told me I was hormonal and kind of wrote it off. 

Anxiety affects me daily, to the point of where I can't wear both headphones in my ears because I'm afraid I'm breathing too loud or I have to assign memories to different tasks, otherwise I think I forgot them. (Ex: ""I remembered to turn off the curling iron because I was listening to this song when it happened, or I said ""Done."" or I pointed at it, etc. etc.) If I don't do this I think about it all day or even call my brother if he's home to go and make sure I actually turned off my curling iron.

Socially it's a bit different, and I think this is the root of why my parents don't think my anxiety is a big deal is because I'm outgoing. I have a lot of friends (God that sounds braggy, sorry) and I'm really involved on my campus. I think they believe the stereotype where if I have anxiety then I must be a loner who just sits in the dark all day. Still, I obsess over day-to-day interactions, I'm constantly afraid that others will find me boring or not good enough to be their friend. I have a phobia of spending the night at someone's house other than mine (although I have done it twice in the past year) and I've only ever had one relationship because I've convinced myself that if someone found all this out about me they would reject me, which would make me feel worse.

So what's the basic gist after this whole long diatribe? Well, basically I'm a little lost. I mean who knows, it could be hormonal teenager-y stuff I could look back and laugh at one day, but I honestly doubt it and I want to be able to talk to someone. The problem is  my parents don't support therapy for me right now. I searched the Free Clinic link and a lot of them in my area were for the homeless. (In the US by the way) Should I call anyways? How do I schedule an appointment? Since I'm still on my parent's insurance, is there a way to pay the co-pay without them knowing I was there? I just need some general guidance I guess. Thanks so much if you read this all the way down. It means a lot to me.

I was having such terrible anxiety at work and I started bringing up the bad things in our relationship and she started thinking the same. I had started taking medication weeks before this and it has completely made my thinking worse, and how I feel about things. I flushed them down the toilet, and told my doctor I'm not taking anymore.

But we broke up, and she asked for space. I panicked every single day and ended up texting her to remind her this isn't me, and it's the medicine that she even wanted me to take to help myself. This made her grow farther away from me and she ended up blocking me on everything. I had an abusive ex before her, and she blocked me in the end to hurt me more and my recent gf told me she would never block me. She said she had to do it until she got over me. We literally wanted to get married. 

Now she's sitting on tumblr everyday, knowing I use it every single day and you can't block people. She posts things that get my hopes up, and some things they make me feel bad, because I know she reblogs what she's feeling. 

Example today she reblogged: 
“Ten Steps on Loving a Girl with Anxiety:  Step 1. Her fears are very much real to her, never say that they aren’t.  Step 2. Don’t tell her to think positive, because sometimes she can only think of the worst possibility that could happen.  Step 3. Never tell her that she’s “overreacting” during an attack, because the anxiety gives her no other choice.  Step 4. Face to face confrontation isn’t always the best idea. If she doesn’t want to meet up, leave her be and don’t get mad.  Step 5. Don’t ever, EVER, tell her that you understand how she feels, because odds are, you don’t.  Step 6. Blaming her for having anxiety is never okay, no matter how mad you are or even if you don’t mean it. She didn’t choose to be this way.  Step 7. Don’t leave her alone because if you do, all she’s left with are her thoughts.  Step 8. Tell her things are going to be okay, because even though it’s not always true, it’ll give her some hope.  Step 9. Don’t make her confront her fears if she doesn’t want to. Sometimes it’s only going to make it worse.  Step 10. Love her. Love everything about her, especially her bad side. Because sometimes all she needs is for you to hold her hand and make her feel like she is worth more than her disorder, because she is.”
And other posts say get away from toxic people, or please text me I miss you.


And I don't understand.. I had one freak out that day and she's not forgiving me. I apologized so many times because I couldn't lose the one girl I've loved more than any other person.  

I don't know what she is thinking, she's sending mixed views because she knows I follow her. I'm having anxiety so much because I can't call or text cause she blocked me. 
But she has replied with anger, such anger towards me and I don't understand. I have done everything for her, and now apparently I'm toxic? After a very few amount of times of me having anxiety. 

I'm praying everyday, but I feel like I'm waiting and I don't know how to not wait. And she's in college 2 hours away where I'll be going close to next semester, and she comes home Tuesday so idk if she will even see me she said she wouldn't. ","['compound', 'attr']",0

I was 23 when I experienced my first panic attack and signs of anxiety, and since it was something I hadn't experienced before it scared the shit out of me. I have been seeing a therapist for a few months and about a week ago I met with a psychiatrist who put me on zoloft and neurontin. 

Anyway, since I started my medication my anxiety has been at an all time high. I actually woke myself up having a panic attack the other night. And today I went to the store for groceries and had a major attack. I took a neurontin while I was standing in line, but I freaked out and had to run to the bathroom until the attack passed. Though I felt a little better after about 15 minutes in the bathroom, I still didn't feel like the attack had fully passed. I just wanted to get the fuck out of the store. 

Anyway, I know the medication isn't fully in my system yet, I just worry about my anxiety being at an all time high since I've started taking it. And I know there are people who have been struggling with anxiety their entire lives and what I have gone through is very minute in comparison. But does it actually ever get better? 

TL;DR when do signs and symptoms of anxiety start to fade with combined therapy and medication? Will I ever feel like a ""normal"" person again or is anxiety forever part of who I am now? ",['conj'],0

It all happened one night, I was out with friends and we had a nice dinner at a restaurant. Later that night we had to take a bus ride about 45 minutes to 1 hour back to our destination. This bus was full of acquaintances and then just my one friend and I. (the two others stayed behind.) Anyhow as soon as the bus doors closed, I started to feel nauseous, like I had diarrhea coming on. I toughed it out but seriously considered jumping off the bus. Long story short I made it with some coaching from my friend. When I got back to my room I ran to the bathroom, but there was no diarrhea, actually nothing happened, I just felt relief. Since then, I have had anxiety for the last 10 or so years, with a break in the middle of about 4 years. 

How does this affect me? Well it makes it tough for me to walk across the street (about 1/2 mile R/T) with work colleagues for lunch. I rarely ride in someone elses car, unless I feel absolutely comfortable with them, like I could ask them to pull over and I could poop by their car and they wouldnt judge me. Airplanes are terrible for me. The whole sitting while waiting to take off, and the sitting while it taxi's to the terminal. I go out of my way to look for non-stop flights, even international. Overall I just get really strong feelings of uneasyness. I can deal with the stomach feelings, you know not really craps, not really pain, just weird feeling. Its the thought of having diarrhea and crapping myself on a crowded plane, bus, coworkers car, where-ever. Strangely, I feel like if someone I know closely is aware of my phobia then it doesnt creep up, but I am reluctant to tell the world. This has made me reluctant to take better jobs in life, I will never eat like Denny's greasy food for breakfast, mcdonalds, or stuff that I am not familiar with, even if I want that. I need to change it ASAP!

So I once took zoloft (depressed at the time, then changed jobs and luckily snapped out of it), I didnt like it, I lost my sex drive for like 2 years. I stopped with that one and havent tried again. I have considered hypnosis, even though I believe it is some charlatan stuff. I have found some success with like this self-hypnosis thing on youtube. (if you want the link just ask) Is there some medication I can take that makes it just go away, and I keep my sex drive? My biggest concern is to kill the feeling of freaking out on a plane, because my next job (already lined up) is going to require some travel.  

Anyone else have something similar? Please blow up my inbox, I need to know about others and what is helping them out. ",['attr'],0

After being sick, calling off a wedding, having a dream job shattered, and having a major surgery I noticed, people are selfish. My last fluffy pieces of faith in humanity floated away. Why wouldn't anyone come visit me while I was stuck in bed? All my friends know I have no family to do so.  Gossip at work (even from HR) that I was not even sick. Did I ever stew. Having all that time alone to think about what went wrong.

I have always been an animal lover. Have cat named Strudel, and a snake Diegs. But I was still lonely. Enter Panini my adorable Ragdoll. He was a Christmas present to myself. The only way I celebrated that year. Ok I am not out of control yet...Then I offered to foster for a local animal rescue. The lady called to come do a home check. She was an hour and a half late. She texted asking if could bring a puppy inside. This starved husky shepherd puppy had been left by the dump. I was going in for surgery in 3 days, but I couldn't say no to those blue eyes. Millie became a new temporary roommate.  Anyone who has been around huskies should know of their dramatics. I didn't get much peace.

What followed was incredible ups and downs with fosters I tried to rehabilitate. Wish could tell all of them here but would take me hours, and not sure anyone is as enthusiastic as me about them. If you are comment and I can leave little bios with pictures. I was having a stressful day last year. I had to go to the pet store to get dog food. I stopped at the hamster cage. Walked out with Falafel Phil. Who would soon become HBO for cats, and dogs. I am starting to develop a pattern here. Down in the slumps = new fuzzy friend.  

Then I got my guardian. Rescue lady called, there was a huge abused most toothless malamute shepherd who was at dog control. Overcrowding was not making his 4 month stay look like a very promising future. We know by now that I can't say no, right?  Within two minutes he had sat politely for me, and gently offered me a paw in exchange for a soft treat. The poor guy can't really chew milkbones and whatnot. He stood up, wagged his excessively fluffy doggy pants, and gave me the lowest little howl/talk saying thank you. I could not let anyone else adopt this dog. He talks to me! Rarely hear him bark, just a happy low chatter. We could go back and forth for hours. I called the rescue lady the next day and told her I wanted to adopt Wiley. 

Now I have this solid companion. Socially I am still very introverted. Only going for walks at night so I do not see people and whatnot. Wiley makes me feel safe though. No one is going to mess with a tiny 5 foot blonde, while she has a dog almost her weight with her.  I however underestimated Wileys good looks, and charm. People flock to him for rubs, and to ask me questions. Good thing I love talking about him! There I go starting to open up again. That dog has helped me train numerous other rescues, makes me laugh every day, and is just the loveliest example of what an abused animal can be.

Damp moment here. Falafel Phil the hammy died. Who I quickly replaced him with Crouton the dwarf hamster. Then my python of 9 years passed suddenly. Adopted a breeding pair of winter white dwarf hamsters this time, Miso, and Sushi. I know I have a bit of an addiction at this point. These animals are my therapy. I quit my high paying office job to pursue a career working with animals. I did get hired too, as a vet assistant. Making minimum wage. Bit of a rant here. I was assisting in surgeries, euthanasia, office work, janitor work, grooming, animal care, medication dispensing, and going to multiple unpaid meetings. I would not be given OT as deserved, or breaks. And a 12 hour emergency watch shift paid even less than my hourly minimum wage?  Forget to mention the Dr. I am working for has the shortest fuse ever. It pushed me back in to the depths of depression. One overnight shift I almost took my life right there as I had all the tools. But the reason I was there was an elderly dog who was suddenly having violent seizures. I couldn't leave her. 

Finally reached out to the guy I was dating, and told him everything. He was willing to financially support me if I would quit my job, and go talk to a Dr. I did both. That was a couple months ago. Today I am making plans with real people again. My work experience at the vet paid off too. Got hired as a part time doggy daycare trainer. I don't even care that I make minimum wage either. Wiley and I are helping animals every day without overcrowding our house any further. 

Thanks all :)

I thought I would never find a way to cope with my severe anxiety, despite having a loving fiance and family. I finally decided to accept medication, and I have been on cipralex for about 2 months. It has slowly but surely changed how I react to things. I am not here to advertise one drug or treatment over another. This is simply what happened to me.

I was diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) 3 years ago. I rejected the idea of medication because I didn't want to believe I needed it to be happy. I tried to cope any way I could, but I fell into self harming behaviours, and destructive behaviour like binge eating. I was later diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and I gained 80lbs, making me OBESE. The obesity pushed my depression and anxiety even further into the shit storm that was my mind. I almost gave up time and again. Finally I got medicated. It didn't stop the thoughts that plagued me, it was nothing near a cure all. But it kept my two feet on the ground when I felt like I was sliding off the edge of a cliff. It gives me a calmness. For the first time in years I can smile and be grateful about the minor joys in my life. I can accept the love my fiance has tried for years to give. I can begin to plan my future, without feeling like I am drowning in quicksand. I am sorry this is long, but it is my JOY. My PLEASURE to tell you that there is HOPE. Not just medication, but in anything that offers you some kind of peace. I am now getting my license, I am back in school, I am planning my wedding in a year. I don't feel anything near perfect. I still get depressed or sad. But I feel CAPABLE. I feel BETTER.

I'm 23. I've been diagnosed with GAD for 2 years, though it's likely I've been suffering from anxiety in some form since elementary school. I was in therapy (cognitive behavioral, no meds) for around a year but haven't been seeing anyone recently. I made a big life change about a year ago, moving across the country, and I've noticed the anxiety starting to interfere with my life more.
I'm female. I'm a full time graduate student and I also work full time. 

Today I came home and sat down for a while, did homework, etc. Normal stuff. I'm getting ready to go to bed and I notice on my night stand is a slip from the maintenance people at my apartment complex. Pest inspection. I wasn't warned about them coming in, so my apartment is a wreck. Part of my anxiety (depression?), I'm starting to realize, is the inability to clean up after myself or do normal adult type things. I'm not lazy- I do other chores and I'm always proactive at work and school. But I'll tell myself to clean and it just doesn't happen. I literally wait to clean my apartment until someone is coming over. I can't talk to my parents about this because I've just now started to convince them that I'm a responsible adult (even though I don't feel like one).
I don't think it was a citation that was delivered, rather a notice that I need to clean and that my apartment was treated for pests. 
Here's the bad part: I totally flip out. My immediate reaction was to clean, like doing it now is going to reverse what someone saw. So I did that. It's 75% cleaner than it was. My next instinct is to go down to the office tomorrow morning and confess, because the way it makes me feel is that I'm a criminal. (Something similar has happened before with a minor traffic accident where I was convinced I was going to be arrested even though it wasn't my fault). Any minor citation of wrong doing and I totally lose it. I don't know whether or not to go down there to even ask about if I will be charged for anything because I'm afraid they will make me remove my cat for the damages she causes and I can't live without her (cat is approved on the lease). I'm afraid that if I raise any issue with them they will have a list of all these things I've done unrelated to the current issue and act on them. My anxiety makes me pretty paranoid sometimes and nervous and it makes me seem like I can't be taken seriously when I do talk to someone about a problem I have with them. 
So, onto the real problem.
While freaking out for a good 2-3 hours, I noticed a thought come into my head that I've never had before. I've never been suicidal ONCE in my life, but, I thought ""God I am so tired of having all this anxiety. I wish it would go away. Anything is better than this, and if I remove myself from life it would go away. That sounds really nice. I just want to be done. I could take some pills right now and it would all be over with."" I didn't have to fight myself too hard to make the thought go away but I'm a little freaked out right now. 
I guess I just don't know what to do now. I want someone to tell me that this is such a small issue I shouldn't be reacting the way I'm reacting (I know that). Usually talking it out (what I've done above) really helps me, so I may just be using this format as a sounding board, like I do my friends. But this suicidal thought really threw me for a loop. I've contacted my grad school's free counseling, but the last time I was there I was referred out, and I don't have insurance that covers normal therapists. It doesn't seem urgent enough to be seen right away but I don't know.

Wow that was long. 
tl;dr I'm probably freaking out about nothing as per usual but I want someone to tell me it's ok?",['dep'],0

I have very serious anxiety. 3 years ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, major depressive state, OCD, and anxiety. It has always fluctuated. I will go through weeks where I am fine and then have a couple bad days, where I use Ativan to control symptoms. I can usually make a 30 pill prescription last 3-4 months.

For the past 3 months it has been horrible, to the point where I have lost 10 pounds. I have been having to rely on my medication. I get one month at a time and I can only make it last the month, sometimes a little less. This has gone from taking half a pill to maybe one full pill here and there, to taking half a pill to a pill in a half in a day. I am in therapy. I got 1-3 times a week. I really stump them with this problem. They don't know why I get the anxiety for the most part. We know I start to get it, and I get a lot of symptoms. One my of biggest fears is throwing up, and lucky me, my symptoms are mostly digestive.

I get a lump in my throat, dry mouth, I can't swallow, I will gag food up, my sense of smell becomes sensitive, I get gassy, nauseated, sometimes I will have the urgency to go to the bathroom (usually a normal BM), sometimes I dry heave, I feel pain in my stomach (but honestly I think that part is in my head), my heart races, I get sweaty hands, and I will either feel hot or cold. 


I can't live like this anymore. Usually I could keep it under control but I have lost it. I have pretty much felt sick everyday for the past three months. I am also exhausted. I will sleep for 14+ hours a day if I have nothing to do. I don't leave my house anymore besides work, I have no interest in doing anything, I am becoming agoraphobic because of feeling ill all the time. The medication is working, but it's a short term effect.. I need something to stop it.

I guess I want to know if any of you have the same symptoms as me and now to manage them. Is there any medication that works in the long term that you take, that you think I should ask my doctor about? Can you share some relaxation techniques that perhaps I have not tried? Anything? I honestly can't take it anymore..

TL'DR: Going nuts because of anxiety, can't handle it anymore. ",['attr'],0

I normally don't say this stuff but I just want to put it all out there, thanks ... 

I'm 16 and male. In 7th grade I started being late for school. People would comment, that wasn't too bad. But it felt awkward.. I open the door after class starts, it makes a loud creaking noise, no one is expecting anyone. Everyone turns and stares at you. You have to go to the front and hand in your late note, as if your pedestal wasn't big enough already, proceeded by making more of a scene settling in. And then once there I feel like I don't belong there. I feel like I'm supposed to be there when I make it on time, though. Also as for why I'm late. I'm tired. It doesn't matter if I sleep at 8pm, 10pm, or 2am. I'm tired. Once I'm awake, I go in the bathroom. I just sit there with my head down in the dark. My stomach hurts. Its somatic, it has to be. I know my diet is bad but I can't get stomach aches this often. Sometimes I make it to class on time, rarely. Usually I don't. Sometimes I time it right and my mom drives me in right in between the periods so it's less awkward. Sometimes that's better. But sometimes I can't even do that. I know I can't use the computer or have WiFi or service on my phone but I don't know. That doesn't motivate me. They take away the only thing I really enjoy in life, and not going to school is more important or something. I don't enjoy being home with nothing and everyone wondering where I am and my parents saying I'm not doing the right thing. I cant help it. It's not fair. I'm not even allowed to play a game and try to escape and distract myself. 

Sorry, I got off track. I guess I'm just trying to lay out my thought and ask for help.

So I miss days. I got psychiatrist. He was condescending and I feel like all of his clients are 8 years old. He gave me Zoloft and I made my way up to 75 mg. I got a therapist. She was okay. I miss a week of school in a row. I go to a mental hospital with the diagnosis of severe social anxiety disorder. Okay. I'm there for a few days whatever. I meet girls with lines on their arms and legs, a kid who hospitalized his father. We played puzzles and talked a lot. They were nice. I actually had fun. Nothing really changed for me though. My Zoloft went up to 100 mg. I'm 12 right now. 

things continue I guess. I miss a lot of school. I'm never really happy. I always longed for some pretty girl who lived near me or went to my school to like me and talk to me till I tell her about my issues and she stands by me and is supportive. I know that would make me happy, but that seems like a ridiculous fantasy. Now I'm in 10th grade. Its January first. I talk to her online. We don't have a lot in common, but we think the same way, and I've never met anyone who does. We talk. We argue about some stuff. I get sad because she's kissed people before and everything. Its fine I guess. I guess I get jealous. I try to help her and act happy. I told my therapist about her in august, my therapist urges me to tell my parents. I told them there. It was awkward. So I ended up going there and it was good. I got my first kiss. I was proud of that. Its 11th grade now. I was on Prozac for a bit. I don't know if it affected me. I'm already broken. I'm off meds now and stopped seeing the therapist I saw for 4 years. She broke up with me in November. I barely remember why. I think it was that too many things bothered me and all id do is complain. I had no one else to tell everything to. So I told it all to her. I guess I shouldn't have. I cried and got more depressed than usual. A week later I was casually talking to her because we tried to maintain friendly relations. She made out with a stranger at a party. I got even more depressed. Now basically everything makes me tear up. It doesn't even have to be that sad.

So I'm in 11th grade now. I'll recap the year. I missed a lot of school. My parents talk to my teachers and tell my friends parents and her friends about my issues. I tell her not to and she keeps doing it. Then I don't want to see anyone. Everyone will know. My friend saw my mom's email to his mom and told our friend circle. I told them I missed school because I was sick because it was longer than usual. They told me about the email. Its hard to talk to my friends because they make fun of people who cut themselves and tell people to kill themselves as jokes. Its not like I have a large pool of friends to choose from. I'm not too close to them in that I no longer really have a best friend. They do stuff and go out behind my back I know that. But my real issue is school. How am I going to graduate. My mom makes it worse. There's no one to talk to. No one in real life to talk to. No one to be myself with. I don't know what to do.",['npadvmod'],0

With therapy and medication, I've come to realize that those kinds of thoughts were caused by the anxiety, and were not an actual reflection of reality. I'm now pretty good at recognizing when I'm catastrophizing a situation and can nip it in the bud. 


My problem now is that I have come to fear the anxiety itself. I have so many memories of the panic attacks, and how scary they were. This is especially true regarding situations where I've had panic problems in the past. I can start out feeling calm and normal, but work myself into a panic with thoughts like, ""This made me panic before- what if it makes me panic again? That was so awful. But that won't happen again, will it? What if... Oh God, I'm starting to feel panicky. I think I'm having a panic attack!""

Just trying to figure out if my anxiety issues are something that y'all experience or if somehow I'm outside of that realm of anxiety. I think it's anxiety, but after taking a psychology class this semester, I'm also somewhat convinced I could be any number of things.  BUT, back to the post...

Recently, I've found myself feeling more and more anxious and picking up on things that I didn't even analyze as being anxious until now. 

- it affects my bowels- I either can't go or am frequently going. And I cannot get over anxiety about people hearing me. I have to make my boyfriend leave the room and if he hears things, I can't stand the thought of how he must think I'm disgusting and gross. I know he doesn't think that, but it happens nonetheless. 

- I cannot plan for the future without having anxiety. And I'm a planner. So in a few years after I graduate from grad school, everything is up in the air and that terrifies me. 

- I constantly feel like my symptoms bodily (headaches, stomach nausea or the feeling of urgency sometimes with bathroom things, the almost constant fatigue, even drainage) are somehow pregnancy related. Which they can't be because I'm not. But my brain says it is. This is probably partially because of the pill, but is also mental. It's possible that the pill exacerbates these things. 

-if I don't hear from my boyfriend for a while or if we have a discussion, it is sometimes like the end of the world. CLEARLY he doesn't love me, right?!?

- I cry. A lot. Over any size of issue, even dumb stupid ones. 

-I cannot enter into situations with people I do not know. My mother suggested that I make friends by talking to people when I lived alone on my college town or attend club meetings. A couple of times I even got in the car and drove partially there before I chickened out and went elsewhere or back home and justified It with a ""you didnt even want to go"".It's not like stores or anything frighten me, just places where I have to interact with people on a level that's more than everyday interaction. And it's not every day. 

-I used to be a state qualified speaker in high school. Now I can't speak in class without barely squeaking out the words and feeling scared. 

-Also, it feels like there's a duality between my rational side and my emotional side sometimes. My rational side says I'm fine, but my emotions are haywire. Is that something y'all ever experience?

I think I fit in here. If you have suggestions, that's awesome. I try to find motivation to exercise and I even love yoga, but by the time I'm done with school, work, and schoolwork, my body is spent. I don't feel like I need therapy or meds on a general basis as I am still functional. I guess I just need to know if I'm normal and what y'all do?

What follows is the turning around of my life, in the order in which I noticed:

* 1) My first thought in the morning was no longer death and panic.
* 2) My performance at work suddenly, and dramatically skyrocketed
* 3) I noticed the beauty in nature again
* 4) My husband and I stopped fighting, and started laughing more
* 5) I wanted to spend every minute playing, singing, and talking to my 2.5 year old son
* 6) I got back in touch with friends whom I haven't spoken to in months
* 7) I actually wanted to eat *salad* =O and EXERCISE?!
* 8) I started cleaning my house.
* 9) I stopped having nightmares... which is a big deal for me.
* 10) I realized that the moments in which I felt joy and happiness no longer dissolved into panic and guilt within seconds. In short, I came to the sudden and dramatic understanding that I actually feel *happy*; and I realized I hadn't felt truly happy in a painfully long and miserable time.

Viibryd is a new anti-depressant on the market, its simple and basic; serotonin only, which means no horrible withdrawal, and few if any side effects. I can have orgasms, I don't get shaky, no dizziness, no insomnia. I hardly noticed any side effects at all, just some mild nausea the first week.
It works by focusing on a specific receptor, and secondly, it mimics serotonin (if anyone has a better understanding of how it works, please jump in!)

Insurance info: Because its new, most insurance companies require a prior authorization from your doctor, which basically means the pharmacy faxes them a form to sign, and then it will be approved; simple!
My sister is a Physician Assistant, and she recommended it to me. She told me that she has prescribed it to about 25 patients with 'untreatable' depression, and has only had ONE person stop taking it (who was an alcoholic and complained of nausea).

I understand your pain, I have been chronically anxious for 15 years, and off/on suicidal off for 5. and I also suffer from autoimmune disease which leaves me in severe pain and fatigue most days. My biggest desire in life used to be to stay in bed, and to never, ever get up again. I thought it would be wonderful to just lay in bed, cozy and comfy, wrapped in blankets, forever. My first thoughts in the morning were utter despair. The world ending, cancer, death, hunger, murder, rape. Now, my biggest desire in life is to simply contribute, love, and live.

I struggle on and off with health anxiety after having health issues for about two years, including glandular fever, then a cyst that they couldn't find when I was feeling sick almost constantly. I'm only 20 years old, female, and relatively healthy (should eat better, exercise more, and sleep better, but who shouldn't, don't drink very often, smoke maybe a cigarette a month) and feel like I am finally healthier. 

I have had a period of feeling well and anxious for about six months. I had a period of time where I barely slept and started going to therapy and taking Endep 10mg to help me sleep. This helped with the sleep and I got off it after a month after it gave me the jumpstart I needed - I'm 20 years old and want to celebrate 21sts with my friends. I feel more relaxed being off medication than on it as I worry about medication side effects. The therapy didn't do a lot and due to money issues/not feeling like the therapy was doing much I stopped going. I now have the means to return however. I am also so sick of telling the same stories to people over and over.

But I still constantly have aches and pains. Headaches localised to the left side, numbness, backache, neckache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, and so on and so forth. I've been to the hospital around 3 times in the past 6 months, for a panic attack that I thought was an asthmatic/anaphylactic reaction, chest pains that were occuring over the course of months, and once when I thought I had meningitis. Nothing was found any of these times and I believe while the physical symptoms were real, all were triggered by anxiety. I never know what to pay attention to and what not to pay attention to. I have a crippling fear of death (even though I firmly believe that we have a contract and when our time is up our time is up and there's nothing I can do about it) and even though it has improved I still struggle with it.

I have tried meditation, breathing exercises, and therapy. I think the therapy would benefit me greatly if it wasn't for my pride. I refuse to admit to anyone other than my boyfriend just how bad the anxiety can get, and he's pretty much sick of it/me at this point and if I ask a question (i.e. Do I have a brain aneurysm?) I usually get a sigh in response which just makes me even more embarassed and ashamed. I know I am not weak and if it was anyone I knew I would encourage them to seek help with no embarassment - but because it's me I cannot stand admitting or talking about my problems beyond a very superficial level. 

So I'm curious, who here struggles with health anxiety, what scares you the most about it, and what helps you? I try and understand this problem as much as possible so I am not as plagued by it but it's much harder to find information on in my opinion than other anxiety disorders. ",['compound'],0

(How do I cross post?) So, I've had tinnitus for forever, only really started talking to doctors about it much this past year. This post isn't really about that though. As long as I've remembered I've always been REALLY paranoid about my health, mainly from a semi crippled dad always going off about it, getting mad at his 10 year old kids for hanging upside down on the monkey bars because ""we'll break our backs and be cripples for the rest of our lifes type of stuff. Hiding bruises because he'd get mad, ect. 

So, I've come to realize that I tend to obsess over these kind of things, and it comes and goes. For instance for a lot of last winter I was crazy stressed about my knee pain, then the past few months it was my weird finger I thought I had arthritis in. Now it's back to my tendonitis. I literally think about whatever part of my body I'm fixated on always. This clearly isn't good for my mental state at all, nor is it for tinnitus which everyone seems to say ignoring is the most beneficial way of dealing with it.

This brings us to today.

THE ANXIETY. 
I finally got an appointment with an ENT, and going to the doctors has always made me nervous, but today was different. I was sitting in the office, heart pounding, unable to sit still, every person who walked by I thought ""Oh god it's him/her"" WTF BRAIN WHY WAS I WORRIED ABOUT THEM COMING IN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME/THE REASON I'M HERE. (by the way he was useless...is a doctor even allowed to tell you he ""guarantees something won't get worse?"")

THE GOING CRAZY?

So the past couple weeks I think I've been inadvertently shirking away from sudden sounds, like thinking I ""feel"" it in my ear, when I know that's rediculous. just sudden ones though. Then at work today I realized...I'm going nuts. I was putting away a cardboard bus display thingy for back to school, and it had flashing lights you could turn on and off, so of course I turned them on to see because boredom. Well somehow (they made no sound at all) I swear I could feel like a pulsing cringe in my ""bad"" ear. And at that moment I was like ""holy shit my mind is actually so consumed by this, this isn't even making a sound that's impossible, you can't hear light""
So If I can't cure my ETD/Tinnitus/whatever, I guess I should work on my anxiety. Starting how?

TL:DR ENT says Eustachian Tubes (previous doctor said I probably have ETD) are pretty finicky and don't respond to medicine/there's really no treatment. So I figured I should probably focus on my anxiety instead now. Wat do.",['poss'],0

I'm scared of people, I'm scared of change, I'm scared of the unknown, and I'm scared of being scared all of my life. I have had anxiety all of my life, and in the past four or five years it has become depression as well. 

I've been at a job for six years that I hate. I work very hard, but since I am an introvert in a sea of extroverts, and I'm very much an outcast. I am also underpaid and overworked, and I know I could get a better job if I just got over my fear of change. I'm terrified of interviews, even though I have done many.

I've been thinking about trying meds again, but I have no idea what to try. I've gone through several SSRI's and currently take xanax. Several years ago I tried Paxil, Prozac, and Pristiq, but I could not stand the side effects. Paxil actually helped the most with anxiety, I was outgoing and spoke my mind. However, I was so tired and zombified that the negatives outweighed the positive.

I have also tried therapy for a year. I don't think my therapist was very good since we were constantly trying to find things to talk about. I don't think I got much out of therapy, but I was probably holding back a lot also.

I have to try something again. I've been looking for a psychiatrist, but my insurance is weird and I haven't found any that will take it. I've been thinking about meds again, but I am really not fond of SSRIs. I take xanax almost every day, but I will get dependent and have mush brain and try to stop for a while, only to go back. 

Any suggestions?

tl;dr: Tried meds and therapy, but I'm ready to try again. I'm stuck in life and ready to make a change, but I'm terrified. ",['advmod'],0

Then I went to college and got a Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I was recruited by a NASA subcontractor and worked on many projects that are now in space including the Mars Rover, Curiosity.

Then I met a girl. She made me fall in love with her. She moved in my house that I built from the ground up. We both loved animals and we made a wonderful zoo in that house. We got engaged. We starting making wedding plans. We talked about kids.

Then I went to work one day, and I had an email from her saying she'd be gone by the time I got home and I'[d never see her again.  ....And I never have and never want to....she destroyed me. 

She is the definition of pure evil. This was April 11, 2007.

Since then I have been on every imaginable anti-depressant and anti-anxiety med. I moved back home closer to family because I was suicidal. I managed to work another 8-9 years as an engineer, but racked up an enormous debt trying to buy some happiness. My house was foreclosed on in the housing crisis.

I still love the stupid girl that left me for no good reason out of the clear blue.

Last year (2014) I couldn't engineer anymore. I ended up in the hospital for a week. New meds, more therapy, move back home with parents because I can't be trusted to be alone. My two cats are the only thing keeping me on this planet.

Loving animals, I managed to get a part time job at a shelter. I mostly love my job, but it can be hard sometimes. I had to declare bankruptcy because going from making engineering dollars to shelter dollars does not pay the bills.

I'm 33, live with my parents, and work part time. All my friends are married with kids. 

Put simply, I have failed at life. I keep trying new things, like going back to school (twice) and failed at those and now have more student debt. I can't go back to being an engineer. It's too much for my anxiety.

I hate my life. I love my cats and my parents, and I love that sometimes I feel like I am helping animals and people at my job, but I see no way to progress from this stalemate.

I'm stuck. My anxiety stops me from trying anything new. I have to work extremely hard not to start abusing my benzos. I have no ideas for what to do to fix things. It's been a year since the hospital and I'm not much more functional. 

I'm a waste of space and resources. I used to work for NASA, and was good at my job, now I can barely function day to day, and I'm always one step away from getting fired from my job because of attendance due to all my various mental disabilities. Really I should be on disability, but I don't want to be. 

I want to be useful. I want to help animals and people. But My anxiety prevents me from growing any further other than the small good I am able to do at the shelter. And I will probably have to live with my poor retired parents the rest of my life.

Tl:dr: Had a house, fiance, worked at NASA, fiance blew it all up, and now I'm a husk of a 33 year old being living with my parents barely able to leave the house except to work part time at a shelter with animals as my only outlet to help and make myself feel good about myself. But I can't improve anything in my life because of my anxiety.

This semester just started and there have been a few people that seem happy to see me and I was personally invited to go to this Grad Student meet and greet/party at someone's house, but I'm starting to psyche my self out of going...I don't want to have an anxiety attack and then need to leave and make everyone have a terrible opinion of me. I would also have to go alone and that makes it super hard for me. I tend to go to more things if I have a friend or buddy.

Hello everyone. I am 29 years old. I started taking Lorazepam for anxiety when I was about 21, prescribed by my doctor. The dosage would often fluxuate, but about two years ago I was taking around 6 MG a day. After that I decided I didn't want to depend on the medication any more and started working with a Psychologist on my anxiety. We got me down to 2 mg a day. I have been at that dosage for a while now and she recommended I go see a psychiatrist to help me try something new.

The psychiatrist has me on Imipramine (Tofranil). I started it 14 days ago and I felt like it is the right medication to help me quit lorazepam completely. I followed our original schedule and Sunday was my first day with no loreazepam as we cut off .5 mg of it every 3-4 days. By Monday  I broke down and ended up taking a Lorazepam at 11 am. I lasted 48 hours without any at all for the first time in 7 years. With the help of Imipramine I thought I could ""tough"" through it, but from 7 am to 11 am yesterday were the worst 4 hours I have ever experienced. Pacing back and fourth, anxiety making my heart pound through my chest. my legs got so weak that I couldn't pace and when I laid down all I could do was overthink and make things worse. After severs bouts of an upset stomach and nearly throwing up, I had finally admitted defeat and took a pill. Those four hours felt like four days. I never want to feel like that again.

I just wanted to know if there has been anyone else here who has battled quitting a benzo (benzodiazepine) such as lorazepam (ativan) or xanex?

I am now 23, living with my SO, working 70 hours a week, and generally have a great life that I enjoy very much. I thought I had my medication in a good place until recently.

A few months ago, I started seeing a therapist again. After a few tries throughout college that failed, I was relieved to finally see some improvement with the right counselor. She helped me discover that I actually could find myself on the bipolar scale. After speaking with my psychiatrist about it, I switched from Zoloft to Lamictal (SSRI to mood stabilizer). My mood has been SO much better, but lately I have had increasing symptoms of GAD that have really been affecting my daily life. I can't relax, enjoy anything, or feel okay. I have always had Klonopin on hand for when I need it, but almost never used it until recently. I almost feel the need to take it every day now, which I know isn't a long term solution. 

I was so happy to get off the Zoloft and felt so much better without it, as far as my mood went. I called my psychiatrist yesterday, and she wants me to try adding back a small dose of it to help with the anxiety. I'm willing to do it, but am so frustrated because 1) It will take weeks to even help (if it does) and 2) I didn't have great experiences with it last time. Until then I have to sit here, feeling frozen in my own body every day until something happens (or doesn't).

Granted, I was on 150mg and now am trying 50mg. Mental illness is so much more difficult to treat than ""physical"" illness. You can't ""feel where it hurts"".

Ever since my late elementary school days, I've had absolutely horrendous grades in school, accompanied with Social Anxiety. My freshman year, I failed EVERY class. My other years haven't been much better, although recently (sophomore and junior year) they've been improving. At the risk of making it seem like I'm stroking my own ego, I'm a pretty smart guy. I tend to see myself intellectually superior to all of my high school peers. I recently developed full GAD and depersonalization this January, and my grades have been falling again, perhaps as a result.

I am placed in mostly special-ed classes. I am surrounded for most of my day by kids with no future, kids who aren't very bright, kids who have behavioral disorders. I sit in these classes knowing I don't belong there, I know I'm much smarter than everyone in the room, even the teachers. While they sit and talk about recent fights at the school and other mindless dribble, I sit in my seat and question life and existence, wondering what I'm going to do with my life, and hoping I don't end up going in the same direction as the others.

My parents have been beyond frustrated with me. They've tried everything to help me, therapists, ADHD medication (even though I feel  I don't have it). There is always a lot of tension in my house due to my poor grades. My parents see me as unmotivated, and lazy. Because I don't have a job (it's very hard for me to apply because of my SA), they refuse to believe my poor grades are due to anxiety, but since I developed GAD, the more I think it may be connected.

29, Male.  Been dealing with anxiety pretty steadily for the last 5 years or so, mostly generalized, but was triggered the first time by relationship troubles.

Fiddled with meds at first until they got the right combo, 10mg Lexapro daily, added 150 mg daily of Wellbutrin to help combat sexual side effects.  Been on that for about 2 years, and it's been doing well.  Outside of some reasonable anxiety (buying first house, talking to my dad for the first time in 25+ years, etc), I haven't really had any issues in the last year or so.

Over the last 4 or 5 months, however, I feel like the meds have been having *more* of an effect.  In various books I've read, they've talked about how with proper therapy over the years, your brain can start to actually reform some of the chemical pickups that are missing to balance everything out.  I feel like that's definitely where I'm at right now.  The SSRIs have gone from making everything something I can 'deal with' to making it seem like I've got nothing worth dealing with.  Just sort of blah, grey, takes the edge off everything.

After doing some reading, talking with my wife, my therapist, etc, I think I'm ready to taper off the meds.

Anyone have experience coming off?  In the past, when I've gotten out of the habit of taking my meds for a couple weeks, I've had a few symptoms of withdrawl (brain zaps, teeth grinding, etc).  Hoping to taper in a more reasonable way (appt with my Psychiatrist tomorrow to form a plan) this time, but wondering if anyone would be willing to share their experiences?

I have considered all other things that involve someone with a phD prescribing me meds that I can't pronounce and talking to a councellor but first I would like to gain some perspective on my situation. Here is my story: 

Growing up I was an only child. My dad worked late hours so I hardly ever saw him. He was physically and emotionally hurting me and my mother. There would be days I would see her being dragged on the floor with her hair. Then my dad moved us all to a new country. My mother stayed with him. His affairs got worse with other women. He was still violent and verbally abusive. There was a day I had to stay home because my room was messy and he hurt me and broke everything in my room. I know my dad has some issues that could be inherited from his father, who had anger management issues. Then, my father became better, he was not caring but the abuse did subside. He was mean to my mother, really emotionally abusing her. Lied about other women to her. Then he changed his appearance completely. Then he told my mother he was leaving us. He left us, I did not speak to him for months. I blamed my mom for not working on her relationship with my dad. I got physically and mentally screwed up. I began cutting myself as I did previously in elementary school. I attempted to kill myself one day when my dad had already moved out. That was my lowest point. Then I got better, my relationship with my mom was better and I was talking to my dad more. My mom gets diagnosed with cancer. My dad does nothing. I take a term of school off. Her health deteriorates. I take care of her, my dad comes around the last two weeks of her life. Promises her at her death bed he would take care of me. She passes away and then my dad finds out she left the marital home to me from her half title. My dad sues everyone who did that transfer, making me pay for lawyers. My dad stops paying for my education, car, room rental. And I decided to cut all ties off with him because of his toxic personality. Now I am having anxiety attacks and have feelings of depression. My boyfriend also lives 3000 miles away so no way to see him. I feel like an orphan because I have no one else. I am an only child. I have exams now and focusing on school. My stress that has always been suppressed is finally coming out.

I have had generalized anxiety since I started secondary school (That is as far back as I remember). I only sought help a few years ago and last year I started on sertraline and continued taking propranolol slow release. 
 
From about the start of this year I noticed that thought were creeping back, it was harder to keep up the front of a normal social person etc etc. Anyway me and my doctor decided to try a medication swap as I just wasn't functioning. 
 
I swapped over to mirtazapine and did a quick taper off the sertraline (cut my dose down over a week). I know this may not seem like a good move tactically but the sertraline was doing nothing for me. I also got diazepam to ease me through. It turns out diazepam does very little for me, even at a fairly high dose.  
 
I am running out of hope at the moment. I study a tough course at uni, observers would say I am a social and very easy to get on with person but inside I am collapsing in on myself, I don't have it in me to work so hard to be social anymore, I don't have it in me to focus on my degree, I'm mentally exhausted.  
 
I am so good at putting up a front that no one even knows(friend wise) I have anxiety, I'm alone with my mind.  
 
Last night I watched interstellar(pretty decent btw). I realized if someone came to me and said ""yeah you can go to space but you have to go now and you probably won't come back. I would take it.  
 
I feel ungrateful, I have so many friends but I feel none of them understand and that s my fault. I will never be able to tell them though. Even being friends with them is a struggle for me but it is a mental struggle I am willing to do. 
 
I hate my degree from all the stress (I'm pretty damn good at it but the anxiety has all but ruined the field for me). I have two people in the whole world I feel I can be totally open too about this. 
 
I have the doctor tomorrow and clearly the new drug isn't working and the diazepam didn't really help. I have no idea what to say, I involuntarily put up my front and find it so impossible to open up and say how I feel. How can I get help if I can't even tell my doctor what is really going on?

I've been taking things more personally than I normally do from work, so I can ""move up"" the corporate ladder. 

A major shit-show of a project rolled into work. You know what I'm talking about. One of those ""WE NEED THIS DONE YESTERDAY"" kind of projects, with little to no planning on their end. Normally, this wouldn't be such a big deal since other co-workers can and usually jump in to help the situation. But like I said, I'm really trying to ""showoff"" and they are busy with their own projects at hand.

On top of this, it feels as if my current girlfriend has been drifting apart from me. 
Normally I would move on, but I feel something special with her. Something different. without divulging into much, I tried to kiss her this morning before I left for work. She doesn't even look at me.

Feelings of shame, guilt, and insecurities as if I have done something wrong immediately come to my mind. It's an issue I've dealt with my entire life (and I'm currently seeking therapy for). I grow anxious that she's going to break up with me. I would do it myself, to avoid being hurt anymore, but I like her. A lot. Border-line falling in love with her. 

Recently I've started testosterone therapy as well, I've noticed that it did help immensely for several months, now it feels as if I'm slipping back into my depression and anxiety. I can't go back to that. It was a terrible time in my life. contemplating suicide and irrational thoughts.  I fear that I may slip back into that depressive state, that constant feeling of anxiety and ""unknown."" That feeling of ""chest pressure"" lurking over me. 

I don't wish to go back to drugs. I was taking several anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications for years. I managed to stop roughly 4 months ago. I really don't wish to move back onto them....

I have an extreme fear that I am going to get spiked with LSD/acid. 

I have a very hard time eating out because I think the person preparing my food put acid in it, if I step in a puddle outside I think that there's acid in the water, even if I make the food myself I will think the manufacturers put acid in the food. This goes for any other type of product (toothpaste, pop, lotion, medicine, etc.)

Right now I am SO hungry and I really would love to order a pizza but I am way too scared to do so because I think the chef/delivery guy is going to somehow spike it with acid.

I know how stupid this sounds and I realize how stupid it is, but it seriously is mind crippling. And whenever I do eat something/drink something, I sometimes have a panic attack because I get so scared I'm about to trip hard on LSD.

(This fear of acid is sprouted from a terrible trip I had from smoking weed. Since weed scares me, acid is absolutely terrifying to me.)

But I'm in constant worry, like now for example. I just can't simply not think about something that worries me.

I even didn't knew to post in /r/depression or here. I'm constantly thinking about me not being me, like depersonalisation/derealisation, that I will go insane, and If I will leave this untreated with meds , my brian chemistry will change forever and I wouldn't be able to feel again me.

Is it my brain chemistry fucked up? (I'm on 120 day of NoFap btw, and maybe a low in dopamine causes this) OR it's just a bad habit of thinking?

Can I overcome all these worries by trying to change my thinking habit? I'm not in severe anxiety or depression, I don't want to kill my self or something like this, but I can't feel all the pleasure in all I'm doing.

For example: I have now finished my exams with marks over 90% , I'm in the last year of medicine school. In September I'm marrying a beatiful wife that I love very much. Our parents are helping us now and we don't have any financial problems. And we are making our own house. All is perfect, I'm happy about it, I feel the happiness but I can' get over the worries.

I bought us some tickets for going in a Trip in Europe for 2 weeks, and we have our flight on Saturday.  And my brain is rushing with thoughts: "" OMG, If i will panic in the plane, I we'll crash?"" What if something goes wrong in the city, maybe accident or someone will steal our money or any other ""

Now, I'm worried that If I wouldn't be able to fall asleep. And If so, tomorrow I will be like a vegetable and depressed, and that will amplify my worries about the trip and all...

I don't want psychotherapy or meds. I just want to know CAN I OVERCOME these thoughts and CONSTAT worries by just changing my habit of thinking. Not necessarily ignoring it, but just get your head busy, meditation, chill out, going to gym, eat healthy?

Edit: Thanks for your replies. I have the full story of my life right here. Warning WALL OF TEXT! Just wanted to give some background. it's not very organized though but it's one of hte first time I was able to do this without getting upset recalling all the details. I was actually trying to get help but the help here is really shitty. I have PTSD because my parents sent me to the psychiatric ward and I got stuck in an abusive group home. Shit sucks. 

Thanks. 

For me it's not so much the idea of leaving the house, it's just I'm afraid of going out because I'm afraid of anxiety attacks. What's worse is that I have severe allergies brought on by a chronic sinus infection which feeds into my allergies. Even worse is that I'm (high functioning) autistic/aspergers so I have sensory integration problems, that I am using deep pressure input to prevent meltdowns, but it still feeds into agoraphobia. For example my front yard is not private. If things aren't private I just get uncomfortable. I have to shut all the doors in my house for this reason because it feels uncomfortable if door are left ajar. I always have my back to a wall and I can't sit infront of a door. My Doctor's office is cramped and has fluorescent lights and my glasses are too thick and I'm too blind to wear sunglasses so it all feeds into my agoraphobia.

Unfortunately when I was about 15 (23 now) my anxiety problems climaxed because I was overprescribed medications. I had a nervous breakdown because I was hallucinating and got sent to psychiatric wards where I became traumatized. 



In saying that I do physically leave my house once a week because of garbage day and I am trying to stick my head out the door or just chill on my porch more but the noise (Sensory problems, hypersensitive) and the fact my property just fucking sucks and it is not private makes me uncomfortable for non-agoraphobic reasons. When I was living at my parents house I was a lot more comfortable outside.

2 years ago or longer I was getting help from someone at a home care agency to help me get out of the house more. We were driving at least 3 times a week and going to a coffee shop a few times a week and also doing a lot of errands. Unfortunately since I was working with a BMS who was less than adequate to say the least I felt like I was forced to live with the workers because she treated me like a low functioning autistic person who could not make decisions or my own or a child. She was the one who got me sent to a traumatic group home where I was literally almost killed and traumatized for 7 months and she didn't understand that I just wanted to relax and get used to my new apartment and living on my own before I started adding to it with school, hobbies and shit. She was truly really shitty at her job. The BMS quit and I still stuck with the home care workers but there was no plan in place. The BMS' job was to have a plan so I end up becoming independent and not agoraphobic. So what happened was that my independence actually lessoned because before that point I wanted to do things by myself and I was getting out by myself. I ended up with only 1 home care worker because out of 4 of them two were grossly undertrained, the most trained and senior worker was burnt out from drugs and permanently fried from when he was younger and would sleep on my couch everyday. The last worker I worked with really well but we didn't really accomplish everything besides going out every day. Which was nice but I relied on her too much and my independence vanished. 

I was also walking almost literally every day or every second day. hen my home care worker left. The sinus infection has been here for 2 years and my allergies have gone wild and prevents me from going outside. It feeds into agoraphobia because if I don't get allergies, which I'm not exagerrating I get everytime I go outside anyways, I'm afraid of it so even in winter I am afraid of going out for allergy reasons.  It sucks because I predicted this would happen with the home care worker and she didn't give me any time before she quit and it just really screwed me over.

Around that time my therapist left even though I was telling her as much information as I am in this post about being agoraphobic. I told her I thought I had PTSD from the group homes and psychiatric hospitals and assault and attempted rapes and what not, but she wouldn't listen and we argued about it. Then she quit. 

Chronic sinus infection happened and I became bedridden. My allergies have been absolutely haywire. I stopped walking everyday. I got fat which added to my sensory integration problems.(I'm sensitive to touch so it's really difficult to get used to different clothes and I need new clothes cause I'm a gained like 50 pounds.)  I stopped going out of the house and everything fed into my agoraphobiaAround this time was when my therapist quit. I realized my family doctors were shitty doctors and had to find anew one by the change was too hard to deal with so I haven't seen him much.  My home care worker quit working with me because she wanted a better job. It's been like this for at least 2 years now. Had a friend but he moved to Europe. 



I have a new family doctor now but I haven't been able to see him. I'm talking to my family at least a couple times a week and my friend on the phone literally everyday. He helps me out if I ever have flashbacks or meltdowns and I'm able to talk about anxiety and stuff with my parents. My parents help me get groceries since I don't go out now, but I understand so much about myself to know it's not going to help my anxiety. But at the same time talking to htem everyday is going to help me when I start going out to get groceries by myself and the doctor. So it's a start, but it feels like its' so slow since I'm so fucking sick all the time. I have a lot of health problems and I feel like I'm going ot die a lot.

Feels like somebody dosed me, with my heart skipping around and running at twice it's normal speed and adrenaline pumping through my system.

But it's not fun, it's not a high. Instead of getting that last push or bit of energy from it from a short burst of adrenaline, it's actually quite draining because it's constant.

In case you were wondering, this is a small part of what having an Anxiety Disorder is like...and it's a lot more common than people know. This doesn't include the full blown attacks or having next to no control over what triggers it or being able to handle it once it does. It can also feed/amplify any ADHD problems you may have, making it incredibly hard to focus. Imagine how that can effect your school or work. Or if you have triggers from social situations (not my problem but I know those who do), or from flying, etc. Imagine how that can constrict and impair your life. 

Most medications they suggest for this tend to make you into high functioning zombies in my experience  so to avoid that if you can, all you can do is learn your triggers and practice coping mechanisms - like chamomile tea or meditation for me. If you're really lucky, that works; or if you're really poor, that has to be enough.",['ROOT'],0

I have terrible problems with nausea and vomiting ever since I was little.  I psych myself out whenever I'm nauseous and/or have to vomit.  Sometimes I will keep vomiting even if there's nothing left in my stomach. Its gotten to the point where I've been prescribed Zofran (vomiting/nausea medication given to pregnant women) for whenever these attacks happen.  These attacks don't happen very often, maybe once or twice a year.

Very recently, I got food poisoning when I was with one of my friends.  We were in her apartment, just hanging out with some friends and the dinner I had decided it didn't want to stay in my stomach.  So, went to the bathroom, vomit, then proceeded to get out of there as quickly as possible.  

Three days ago, she came over to my house and got extremely nauseous as I realized she was coming over.  I opened the door, walked her in, went to the bathroom and threw up my lunch (second time I've done this with her around).  I've been nauseous for literally the past 3 days. Hate this. 

SO! Now, every time I'm getting ready to hang out with her, I get extremely nauseous and my mind starts racing, ""What if I get sick with her? I have to sit on the end if we're sitting somewhere. Where's the closest bathroom? You'll be able to make it, you've barely eaten anything for 3 days. You'll be fine. But what if..."" All those thoughts come rushing through my head. 

So, anyone know how to fix this? This is the biggest problem I've had with anxiety in my life, especially since it seems to be linked with a person. I'm thinking a therapist would help, but then I also think that just taking a few days easy and hanging out with her when I'm back to 100%.

My biggest symptom is general uneasiness. I get a cold 'pit' feeling in my stomach, like something is about to go wrong. It causes me quite a bit of distress at times. I can still function normally, it just isn't comfortable to be on edge like that. I worry about the 'what ifs' constantly whenever I'm in this mood.

I've noticed that 90% of the time it happens in the late evening or night. I've been racking my brain trying to figure out what exactly is causing it. When I drink coffee later in the day, it makes it worse, but I get it on days where I haven't even had a sip.

I've also noticed that I tend to get more emotional as the day goes on. At noon I feel great and at the top of the world but at say 10 PM everything... just gets to me more.

Recently I took the drastic decision to stop taking my medicines by my own. The reasons I did it was the confidence I felt to do, obvious. I took many medicines together during the last years… Like litium, quetiapine and paxil… Among others. 
Therefore, one day I felt confident and so gave it up. I read about the problems with abstinence and I think I am dealing with all symptoms. I am angry, quiet, wakeful and the worst one: dizzy.
 Dizzy is bad. I had vomits too two days ago. I read all these symptoms will last around 2 until 6 weeks at least. 
My problem is: Everybody tells me I should have talk to my doctor before quit, because the process is slow. But she (my doctor) does not pick up my phones and kind don’t give a shit for my condition.
Well, so here I go:
1 – Can I survive abstinence without take even a little pill? Without doing the process slowly? 
2 – Should I do slowly?
Guys I really want to get away from these medicines, I’ve been taking pills for depression for so long, I got fat and kind dumb. Now I feel so well.

As a guy, I can't talk to anyone about this and when I mention this elsewhere they say I should seek therapy and medication.

I'm not really sure what to do. I don't want to self diagnose but my mental health has gotten pretty bad. I'm a freshman at a rather large university and I'm pretty far from home. I'm 19 and I've never really had anxiety issues until recently. Before I left for college I started smoking weed and I do it occasionally now that I'm in college. I don't drink alcohol and I live a pretty healthy life. I played football for 8 years so a lot of those habits have transferred with me. I really don't want to reach out for health because I'm afraid that there is nothing wrong with me and that I will be wasting peoples times. I lay awake at night playing over different scenarios in my head, which usually end with me dying. I still enjoy certain things but I can't interact socially. My girlfriend has noticed a change in me but again im afraid to reach out. My biggest fear is the medication people take for Anxiety. All I've ever heard is how addictive it is and I'm afraid I'll take it all my life. I've since given up smoking as it has no effect anymore. I'm scared and constantly paranoid that everyone is watching me. I often catch myself and settle these thoughts down before they get out of hand.

Check out my blog at: http://neverhaveieverblogged.wordpress.com

Follow me on twitter at: nhieblogged

1) Breathe - to settle myself down during strong anxiety attacks I need to breathe. Make sure you take very deep breathes and imagine all your stresses going away.

2) Watch Comedy TV Shows - make yourself laugh, as everyone knows laughing is the best medicine. Check out that 70s show, two and a half men, parks and recreation and friends.

3) TYPE A BLOG! - I've been typing up a blog for a while now and i write up how my day was in relation to my anxiety. It really makes me feel good writing down my thoughts onto paper, everyone should try this.

4) See a counselor - I was very nervous about doing this at first but when my girlfriend finally managed to drag me along I was so glad I did. It is very good to talk to someone about it and make you challenge your anxious thoughts.

5) Tell people about it - Even though this may seem like the scariest thing you can do it really helps. Having a larger support group is very good so you can have people to talk to when your significant other isn't around. I was terrified of talking to people about my anxiety but now my friends and family know it is easier to cope as I have more people to talk to ",['attr'],0

I'm 23 years old and have experienced anxiety since I was a young child. My particular anxiety comes from fear of failure, the unknown of the future, not having control, and decision making (I experience pretty serious analysis paralysis.).

I've never done anything about my anxiety. When I was about 20 was the first time I ever made my family aware of the severe anxiety that I suffer from, and I've certainly never mentioned it to counselors of any kind, or medical professionals. I'll be going to my family doctor to discuss my problem and hopefully get a referral to a psychiatrist in order to begin some form of therapy, perhaps medication (though, preferably not, but I guess we'll see), and whatever else. 

Last week I reached rock bottom and knew it was time for me to finally push through the anxiety I have about getting help (nothing makes me feel failure quite like the inability to handle my own emotions) in hopes of changing my life for the better. I feel like my anxiety is holding me back -- nothing about my life is the way I want it, even if there isn't anything particularly wrong with my life. My fears have stopped me from following any paths that I've ever considered for myself because I've been terrified of failing at it, and also been afraid of not knowing where that path will take me and whether it would truly make me happy. So I've allowed others to make decisions for me, which has resulted in me living a life I never would have chosen for myself. I'm not exactly ready to take my life back because the prospect is terrifying, but I can't possibly live this way anymore so I need to take it back, ready or not. I just hope I can...

I'm on a medical leave from work right now without pay.  I'm a contractor, so not paying me is legal.

My doctor has been a psychiatrist.  We discussed months ago that what we've been doing hasn't been working, we agreed that a new direction was needed, yet he never started me in that new direction.

Meantime, I saw a general practitioner to get a physical and labs done (if you're over 40 and male get your PSA!).  This was a new doctor and he basically just took my vitals than sat and said ""so what's going on?""  He already knew something was wrong because I had to do this as a house call.  I explained what happens when I have a panic attack, and then he went over my med and doctor history, etc.  I gave him my 20 year rundown.  After examining my med history, he asked if any of the meds helped the panic, I said no, and he asked ""then why are you still taking these?""

New doc gave me some different prescriptions (I'm on high benzos, Klonopin, so we started with the benzos first) and told me to start the new meds right away, and that we would be going a new direction.  Exactly what I wanted.  He even called me later in the day to ask more questions because he was researching things.  I like this.

I tried to get an appointment with my shrink because I wanted to know why we hadn't started in the new direction the shrink had promised, and also to tell him I had gotten a second opinion.  After 30 minutes of an appointment, during which time he ranted about my getting a second opinion and acted like a baby (""you seem set on this new doctor, just go to him"" even though I hadn't said I was set on anything and in fact was paying him handsomely for this appointment).  My fiance was listening (it was a phone appointment) and taking notes.

Her notes coincided with mine, but she added that she got the impression that the shrink just didn't care.  I thought about it and kind of agree.  My case is interesting to him I think, but there was no concept of my suffering while he waited to change directions or try new things.

After I told him, and I quote ""fuck the new doctor, this is between you and me"" he finally stopped going off about it and we got down to talking about my treatment, directions, and meds.  He seemed to scramble and gave me a list of meds, telling me that ""we can try anything"" since my current meds aren't working.  In other words, he didn't have a plan.  After giving me a list, I was tasked with picking a new med or meds.

NO.

You are the doctor, I pay you well for making me better, giving me a diagnosis and formulating a treatment plan.  I am not a doctor.  I don't know what these drugs do he listed.  I am not going to do his job because I am underqualified and I pay him to do it.

Old shrink, fired.  New GP, hired.  I now have a new respect for people seeing primary care physicians or physician assistants.  They get a bigger picture because they do the physical.  They seem to be bold, if you get the right one.  Mine spent a couple of hours with me and seemed unconcerned with how long the appointment took.

Don't be afraid to try new directions, and if that means firing your doctor and getting a new one, that's what may need to be done.",['conj'],0

Ever since I was 16 - 17 (worst years of my life) I experienced my own kind of hell all the time. Every day when I would go outside my heart would start hammering like a jackhammer. I wouldn't be able to feel and identify my own physical body (I'd feel seperate). My throat would always be hurting because I honestly felt like screaming in fear a lot of the time for NO reason except my anxiety. I would hardly ever eat. I wouldn't look anyone in the eyes. I'd hardly be able to speak above a whisper. I'd always think everything was going to change instantly into the worst kind of hell scenerio, I'd always be on the edge and clenching my jaw and looking scared all the time.

Nowadays I experience my anxiety differently (I'm currently on 40mg Celexa) and I'll have no warning signs of when the anxiety will happen. For example I'll go into a gas station and feel fine and normal except suddenly my body will be reacting like I'm terrified. My heart will go off so fast and my blood rushes to my face and my throat swells. I'll be utterly terrified of the person/people I'm near. My hands will shake and I can litteraly feel my face looking like I'm about to cry or like I need to run into someones arms for comfort. 

I don't know why it happens but I try to talk myself into a calm but I can never accomplish it until I'm out of the store and then wonder why the hell it has to be that way. It happens as well when encountering a friend or a group of people.

One weird thing though is that the anxiety is always triggered when I'm paying for something but the person or people around me are not saying anything. I get so ackward and anxious that I either feel like breaking into tears, screaming in panic, or smiling like I'm crazy and sad at the same time.

I don't know what is wrong with me to have that happen. Is it a panic attack? and shouldn't I be on another medication aswell as the one I am currently on if this is happening?",['compound'],0

For the past 6+ months, I've had trouble sleeping. I fall asleep after 2am, sometimes between 3 and 4, then force myself up at 9. I wake up during the night so the sleep I do get isn't remotely satisfying. It takes close to 10 hours of sleep for me to feel even slightly refreshed.

I finally got health coverage so I visited my doctor on Friday. He prescribed medication to begin work on shifting me back towards a normal sleep routine but last night, it totally failed. I was up nearly all night. I was definitely still awake at 2am and had given up on sleep by 6. In between those times, I may have, at best, drifted lightly into and then back out of sleep. I was way too aware of my surroundings and generally believe I just didn't sleep at all.

Unsure of what to do, I went to work early. I was even afraid to do this because *everything* has to be *on the schedule*. Even the part time laborer whose schedule is largely irrelevant. I was thrown under the bus for this a few weeks back - it's an unnecessarily long story about a minor mistake that my supervisor didn't talk to me about, instead choosing to report to a superior - so I was scared to even show up 30 minutes early but I didn't know what else to do.

I saw my supervisor's boss first and explained my situation. He said that was fine and since I'm supposed to report to *someone* above me, I thought I'd handled it. Later, he asked if I was leaving early so I said I would stay as long as I was awake. I didn't speak to my supervisor for at least an hour after that and by then, communicating that I'd been early and might leave early was out of my foggy mind. And on some level, I kind of figured since they are physically closer in the office, he would have updated her himself. Why didn't I just check? Because it makes me anxious. I don't know why. My theory is that my perception of her moods being peculiar has caused me to back away from her. Even then, I had still, IMO, done what I was instructed to do - tell someone above me.

At the very end of my shift, I wanted to go home. I was in pain. I asked my fiancé to pick me up 15 minutes early because I can easily work an extra 15 minutes tomorrow. My schedule literally has no impact on anyone else. So I explained that I had come in 30 minutes early and was heading out 15 minutes early because I wasn't feeling well. She just kind of said, ""...Ookkayy, feel better"" and then turned back to her work. So I stopped and explained the situation with my doctor and my medication to which she just said, ""Well, that's not good."" I awkwardly responded, ""No, no, it really isn't."" She turned away again so I left. Mind you, in a previous conversation I *had* told her I hadn't slept last night but I got the feeling she didn't really register this as all that serious.

For the past 2 hours, I've been stressing myself out over her reaction. I feel that she might be mad at me for not asking her in particular for permission even though I'd already talked to the first supervisor I'd seen that day. I also feel like she thinks I'm BSing her when I'm not. I've been complaining about being tired for months and even told her I was trying to cut caffeine to see if it would help. I don't know what to do because at this point, all of my issues and anxieties are feeding into one another from lack of sleep, to my weight, to anxiety itself.

**TL;DR** I may have offended my supervisor by not asking her for permission to leave work 15 minutes early. I'd already talked to another superior earlier and was operating on no sleep so I wasn't thinking clearly. I also get the feeling she thinks I'm full of shit. Her moods have caused me added anxiety and each problem - lack of sleep, anxiety, weight, etc. - are feeding into one another. I don't know what to do.",['conj'],0

I've been on ativan more or less for 5 or 6 years and I started to suspect maybe they were causing as much pain as they were saving me from. I'm not entirely sure, but it always seemed like the day after having to take one, would be another bad day enough so as to need another one. I'm not sure if that was the medicine getting me into a pattern or if that's just the nature of my miserable life. Either way, I quit taking them during a good time so it was fairly easy and have been off for a month. I haven't really noticed things getting any easier though, I just white knuckle it through the bad days more. So now I'm thinking, if I've been off this long and things pretty much are going to same, maybe the ativan wasn't causing any additional pain. 

So the problem is my life has taken a dive again recently and not taking them is getting much harder, especially if there would be no harm in it. I spend most of my day on the edge with an overwhelming feeling that I'm about to break down and lose it. Then the last 3rd of the day I'm exhausted and feel like I've been crying all day. When its this bad and this constant, I'm really always suicidal, but it gets much more aggressive. I start thinking overtime about dying or hurting myself and start getting closer to doing something rather than just passively wanting it. Which I'm sure is very bad for me to be stewing in. The ativan could turn that off. I could take one and spend the rest of the night detached and relatively content.

So which is worse? Taking the ativan again which I'm not sure is even having a negative effect, but still breaking my 4 week clean streak. Or refusing to take them,  staying like this and having it corrode me until, until what? This sort of thing never just passes, it culminates into something big and bad.

One of my main problems has always been public speaking. High School was challenging and College even more so. While I did have to fail and drop out of a few classes, thanks to my persistence and some accommodating teachers I managed to graduate with a bachelors degree.  


   Now I'm in the workplace. I work in a high end tech support center for a major company you are all very familiar with, making a modest wage. I am pretty knowledgeable and articulate- and have been utilized as a one-on-one trainer by my company for struggling employees. The imminent release of a somewhat revolutionary and confidential product has forced a job switch- and I am put in training classes once again. 


Now to preface I am terrified of the classroom environment despite my many years immersed in it. In college you could easily blend into the background of faces in the lecture hall- and in the advanced level classes where presentations and contribution were mandatory you could cut deals with the profs; an extra paper for instance. The workplace has no such luxuries. You drop the class you loose your job. You have a panic attack while on the platform everyone will know about it by the end of the day.


   So the first class begins and I am on edge despite the propranolol I took (this is basically a heart medication which tries to reduce the adrenalin dump we experience during stressful situations). Of course we begin the class with the most dreaded activity of them all: going around the room and introducing ourselves and saying something about ourselves. This is a class of about 30 or so people and I am #20 or so. This may seem weird but I have less trouble going first. The anticipation of waiting for it to be my turn feels like I am watching a clock tick down second by second to my execution. Typically what happens Is my anxiety increases, head races, face turns white, dizziness,  adrenalin dump, tunnel vision and incredible internal discomfort/pain. By the time it is my turn I will have typically fled the room or deliver the most awkward and labored brief introduction the world has ever seen- while on the verge of a heart attack. 

   As the class began going around the room I indeed began experiencing these side effects which grew progressively more intense as the focus of the group drew closer to me. This time however something switched. With about 5 people to go before my performance I developed an easy script for my presentation, administered some positive self statements and consciously returned myself to deep slow breathing. With 3 people to go I was surprised to realize I had the feeling of calm, confidence, and control which I had never experienced with impending and mandatory public speaking. I delivered my short 3 sentence statement without waver or discomfort and was extremely shocked and proud at my accomplishment, however, I would need to leave my comfort zone much further. 

I have completed a full week of classes now and am at a level of public speaking confidence I haven't been at for many years. This unnamed company I am working for adopted a new training technique which relies exclusively on participation of the students. With the goal of pushing myself I started with simple questions and one or two word answers. In a weeks time I can now articulate myself without a mental script of any sort and without anxiety for some time- a feat I have not accomplished since early high school. I have started integrating the same personality, eye contact and hand motions into my speaking that I use while speaking in small groups and with clients. I am still a work in progress for sure and will be pushing my boundaries next week even further. I have ambition for promotion (which I am certainly qualified for) but I see my phobia of public speaking as a major roadblock. 
   Anyway I typed this long and rambling account as a hopeful inspiration to those with similar problems and also as a venue for tips from those who have some insight into this disorder. I feel with public speaking TRYING is the first step. Even if you fail the attempt is a success. ",['attr'],0

I was a successful teacher, too—very popular and for all the right reasons. I gave the school five good years. Then I got in an argument with the principal (I was not diagnosed with ADHD at the time; I don’t even recall what I said). A week later, I was trying to motivate a student—a big guy, a football player. There’s a lot of context to the story, but let me be straight: I swatted the student on the shoulder. Backhanded. Hard. It didn’t hurt him, and no one else was there, but it freaked him out. I was trying to motivate him. I was trying to—maybe I was trying to be cinematic. I was stupid. The next day, I was fired.

For the past dozen years, I’ve cobbled together a miserable existence. One glorious full-time job that ended prematurely (thanks to the Great Recession), but mostly part-time garbage and unemployment. Humbling. Humiliating. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD. That helped. I learned a lot about myself.

I had been diagnosed with depression since I was in my early 20s. Took meds. Meds worked. But there was always something missing. ADHD kind of filled in that gap. 

A few years ago, the doc said, in a chance remark, “I don’t think your problem is so much depression. I think it’s anxiety.”

Immediately, the curtain lifted. Yes, it is anxiety! What was I thinking? How did I not know?  Social anxiety in college made me be afraid to go to class. I’m not taking anything for it—some klonopin—but I am trying to exercise and think rationally. It’s hard.

But here’s the thing. I might be getting my old job back. They know I have changed and they know I have paid the price. Purgatory? I’ve been through the Great Recession without a full-time gig. I could do a million years of Purgatory standing on my head. (Mmmm, and maybe a decade of hell.)

Like I said, I was a highly successful teacher.  I won a Major Award, the majorest major award in my state. I’m awesome at this.  And the students love me, too. But:

When I teach, I can get very anxious. I take the disrespect so personally. I lay awake at nights.  I only have three or four students per year whom I cannot handle. (I can handle most of them. But some of them….)

And I am scared shitless right now.

Don’t get me wrong. I am excited. Thrilled. Shaking!! My life, if I do get the job, will have so much more meaning. Turn me loose, already!!

But I’m scared shitless. 

What can I do? What positivity exercises, what thought processes can I work on? Are there texts that help? Sayings? Meditation? Who can point me to what I need? I’ll do this shit—I know I can overcome!  But how?

Sorry for the throwaway . . . but I need this to be anonymous. 

And I need your help.

TL;DR: I love teaching, but the anxiety produced by smart-ass and disrespectful students is scaring me. What can I do? I look forward to your responses. I need ya.

It's worked pretty well in helping me cope with anxiety and I can't say that I have any real complaints. However it seem that not long after taking it I suddenly put on some weight. Since then I've gradually put on weight. I'm fairly active and eat decent. 

10 years is hard to think back and remember exactly how I felt. But for as long as I can remember ...I've felt constantly tired and just overall sluggish so I've been kind of wondering if this could be the paxil as it is the only anxiety medication I've taken. 

So I've been considering making a switch to wellbutrin. I was curious if any of you guys have made this exact switch or any switch at all away from paxil and what your results of that were?

First post in this forum so be kind :)

I have been on Cipramil (Citalopram hydrobromide) for around 7 months now after suffering generalised anxiety disorder. I have had no obvious side effects from the drug at all - however, I have recently started taking Levlen ED (the oral contraceptive) and am wanting to know whether Cipramil interferes with the effectiveness of the Pill?

I'm finally heading to my primary care physician on Monday to discuss getting screened for mood/attention disorders. I have a random, unrelated muscular issue that I'm technically going in solely for, because I didn't feel comfortable about explaining the multiple issues I hope to bring up when I made the scheduling in semi-public. It's been a long time coming, and I'm already regretting not taking action sooner about the frustrations, issues, and hindrances I've faced for a long time. 

Unfortunately, now I have really no idea which is a primary issue, and how to go about getting screened for alternating symptoms that seem to me, at least, in my own research/self-observation like anxiety, depression, and attention deficit disorder. I'm a mid-20s adult, with a steady job, but I can't even begin to describe all the thoughts and emotions I am vulnerable to on a daily basis. It has significantly impacted relationships, my education, and my physical health in that it's had an adverse effect on my level of activity and diet. I don't know how exactly to describe this – only that it feels really confusing, and I'm not sure how to rank which issues are my chief complaints, medically speaking. I just know that there are things operating in tandem.

So, my question is, how do I bring this up to my doctor? What have you found to be successful? How long should I expect for a diagnosis to result in some form of treatment or medication (a lot of what I'm experiencing causes me harm on a daily basis – not to say that there's a huge rush for getting help as I'm not at risk for self-harm whatsoever, but obviously I would like to start moving in a positive direction as soon as possible). Should I notify my doctor before my appointment that I expect to be needing testing that may require external visits? Thank you for any help!!!

Everything began on February 2013 when my 20 years old mind starting going full crazy over some numbness on left hand making me think it's a heart attack or something that's imbalanced with me. To note it was the 5th month away from home living all alone and not really having any close friends. I called my parents cause i was really anxious and the doctor just told them that this is a little anxiety and told me to go on some magnesium pills, i decided to quit smoking at that time but i did not manage and kept on smoking and drinking, but i was working out 3-5 days a week. BAM after two months the numbness transform into a dizzyness, fast heart rates, numbness of the whole body, high blood pressure,etc. I just wanted to die i had never experienced a panic attack before and i just fell the world crashing on me. On May 2013 i jumped on 50mg zoloft, im very against meds but i couldn't handle anymore i was on the verge of suicide. The 1st week was terrible and even worse the negative thoughts were killing me, i kept smoking a lot but i quit coffee at that time cause i was scared to death if i heard my heart pounding a little faster cause i though i was gonna have a heart attack. 2 weeks after the meds started to take place and finally i could go back to collage and start working out again(had a panic attack in the gym) and the anxiety calmed a little on me but the panics attack ofcourse hit everyday, i tried meditating and taking long walks but it didn't make any big improvements. July 2013, end of collage year and back to my hometown smoke free and really healthier with a lot of less anxiety i was happy that i was going to spend my summer with friends and famiily, and so i did, zoloft worked great for me as even though every morning that i was putting it in my mouth i felt as terrible as the first day i took it, and the reason why it's because i was in my mind a lot. After two months i had to go back to the collage country and i started thinking of the terrible moments i had there and that i have to go again for a year all alone. I was shaking even thinking of it i hated the idea of going back because i really had a great summer. Semb 2013 decided to withdrawal zoloft and go without taking any meds. 9 Months later im meds free,smoke free and im living a healthy life. YES im still anxious yes panic can happen, but it's all in my mind, and since im controlling my body the mind can't do anything. P.S Sorry for my bad writing.

We are together basically 24/7 besides class. We are best friends and do everything together and when we see friends or go out it is together. We only have to be apart for breaks. Each break has been increasingly worse for me. I feel physically sick whenever I think about something happening to him. I think about car accidents, and all sorts of other crazy things that could happen to him. He does smoke and hang out with friends til late DJing at their houses often and I worry about his late night commute back home. He lives in a highly populated area in Los Angeles and I am a small town girl who is anxious about damn near everything. 

He left for spring break on Sunday and I dont have my break until next week. I decided to have my brother (15) stay with me for a few days so I wouldnt have to be alone and we could hang out, it did not help. On Tuesday I started experiencing rapid heart rate 125-150 before my class. I went to class but could not get my heart rate down during the entire 1 hour 20 minute class. My arm hurt and my left leg felt a little swollen. I immediately (duh anxious me) thought of blood clots because I have been worried about them as I have the birth control nuvaring which is currently being sued by thousands of women for not properly warning them about the rather large increase risk of blood clots that the birth control has. I have been worried about this for a while and obviously jumped the gun but the leg swelling really made me feel like it was legitimate. 

I had a friend drive me to the ER as my heart rate was not decreasing and my arm still hurt. My parents were an hour away and drove up to the ER as well. I got my blood drawn for the first time, urine sample, and they told me that my d-dimer was slightly high (which is the test that rules out or does not rule out checking for pulmonary embolism in my lungs from a blood clot. I take a cat scan and wait for the results. During this time my heart rate never falls below 125. 

I test negative and the doctor says I have tachycardia brought on my stress and anxiety and I essentially had a 6+ hour panic attack. I am prescribed a one time prescription for 15 tablets .25 mg xanax and am told to talk to my regular doctor at some point to get another prescription or to find something else. I feel like a fool in front of my parents for causing this scene, even though my mom, aunt, and grandmother all take anti- anxiety and anti depression medication including xanax. I'm pretty sure this was brought on my separation anxiety and I just want to talk to my boyfriend all of the time. Hes so forgetful and busy and I know he tries to keep in touch every 4 or so hours but at night (which is the worst stress wise for me )  he finds it hard and I find myself imagining the worst possible situations. Im not close with my family and have dealt with some emotional abuse from my mother as well as some other family issues, he is the first person I've ever felt cared about me as much as I care about him and I'm very scared of losing him.

I've been in a bad way for about 9 months. I've had a hard time with anxiety and depression for about 12 years but this latest attack really came on quickly and without warning. It is also the most serious and longest lasting spell I've ever had. Due to the health effects and a recent suicide attempt, I got into counseling, saw my primary care doc, and got into a care regimen.

One of the things that I really struggle hard with is hypochondria. Because of this chronic obsession about my health and those that I love, I have a hard time allowing myself to enjoy life thinking that some catastrophe is just around the corner. Well, about two weeks ago -- things were beginning to look up a little. I was taking better care of myself and starting to get out of my house a bit more, etc.

Then, my dog (who happens to also be the center of my world) got desperately ill one night. It all happened so fast, within an hour of thinking she was perfectly well, I was having to decide whether to put her to sleep or pay thousands of dollars in surgery fees to try and save her.

This is literally a hypochondriac's worst nightmare and the epitome of all my fears realized. Since the dog got sick, she's had one complication after another which has resulted in 10 days of me not eating, sleeping, or being able to be a rational human at all. I've been like a crazy person. My meds, my doctor, my therapist...nothing is helping. I just sit on pins and needles waiting for the next thing to happen to her and wondering if, after all we've done, she will die after all.

I'm literally back to square one. I don't care about anything anymore, and my life is comprised of almost nothing but fear and depression. I obsess over this poor dog and stay by her side all the time, even getting up at night to make sure she's comfortable. I couldn't even go out for dinner for my son's 15th birthday a couple days ago and I'm so ashamed of that. I cried that whole day over the dog and nearly ended up the ER myself. I ruined his birthday, but I just couldn't get control of myself and I don't know what's happening to me. My doctor wasn't much help; just prescribed more meds.

Any advice or help would be great. I'm so lost and afraid. What can I do to get out of this hole?

I am a diagnosed sufferer of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and I just have a few musings I'd like to see if anyone else shares. 

One of my greatest hurdles is romantic relationships. It has taken therapy, medication and a lot of willpower on my behalf to make even the smallest changes in my communicative and cognitive behavioral habits. I’m a lot better than I was, but sometimes my anxiety (triggered by something my SO has done that in no way justifies my reaction) will send me into a downward spiral of paranoia, irrational fear and insecurity. I will not act out these feelings; I will just implode and suffer alone unless my SO catches it. Sometimes I am able to communicate what I am feeling, but my trauma directly affects my ability to communicate thoughts and feelings and most of the time I physically am unable to speak.

 That being said, I have had an epiphany today. I have been a long time lurker of subreddit's like r/offmychest and especially, r/relationships. Initially, I thought I enjoyed reading these Reddits (I should stress I never posted) but I have come to realize habitually visiting them is actually CONTRIBUTING to my anxiety. I will sit and find myself clicking posts that sound similar to what I’m paranoid about or validate insecurities/anxieties I've been feeling in my relationships and all of a sudden, I'm convincing myself these issues are occurring in my relationship, too.

Today I have sworn off these subreddits. While I'm sure they're helpful to some, I do not think they are beneficial to me as I can be honest with myself and know if I extended the habit to posting, I would be digging myself a very deep hole. It's taken me a long time to see this but I instantly feel better with the realization. It's like a weight off my chest. One of my greatest struggles is self-sabotaging relationships because I have a dangerous combination of difficulties communicating and allowing my anxiety to create issues that are not actually there.

Marcus Aurelius hits home with his quote “Our life is what our thoughts make it”. I repeat this quote to myself a lot. So who else, whether from within or from outside influences, catches themselves in this sort of self-destructive cycle? And does anyone else experience the same struggles while in romantic relationships?

Thanks guys, any input is and will be appreciated – happy to have this subreddit.

Just some background, I am an 18 year old female with a previous history of anxiety who just entered my freshman year of college. While at first I was extremely thrilled to be at college, I noticed some anxiety setting in. Despite my past experience, I waved it off as jitters to the adjustment and tried to forget it since I am on a medicine that worked very well for me. But in the past week it has become unbearable. In the past 24 hours I've had 2 panic attacks and have been unable to go to class. I have a very good support system, my parents are very aware and understanding and my sister goes to a school near mine so she has been my shoulder to cry on. Despite this, all I want is to go home. I beg my parents to let me drop out of college and move back home. I know this is not the right thing to do, and so do they, but it doesn't stop me from constant panic attacks and sobbing into the phone for my mom to let me come home. I've contacted my doctor about upping my dosage and I've been talking things out with my support system, but what else can I do? What are some tips to surviving college with anxiety, and maybe even enjoying it?
Edit: thank you everyone for all the comments! I talked to an old family friend who happens to be a social worker today! She gave me some great tips for dealing with anxiety (particularly in college) that I'd love to share with you all.
1) develop an action plan for when you have an anxiety attack. Whether you're on the way to class, at a party, or in the bathroom you have a place you can go, someone to call if necessary, and something that will help you calm down. Knowing what to do when you have an anxiety attack takes away a lot of the fear of actually having one.
2) find a safe place. This means somewhere you can go to unwind, or also the place you go when you have a panic attack. For me this is a small room outside of the stairwell on my floor. It's very quiet there and all you can hear are the birds chirping and sometimes rain. This was a huge one for me because sometimes as a college student your room isn't a place you can be alone.
3) take care of your body. Get enough sleep, exercise, eat, drink enough water. This one was pretty self explanatory to me.
4) create a routine. This will keep your mind calm, because you know what is coming next.
5) this one is my favorite. When you're having a panic attack think of something that will make you laugh. It could be a video that will just make you giggle a tiny bit, laughter truly is the best medicine.",['attr'],0

I recently had a horrible time with Lexapro. Doctor suggested I take 1 mg a day. Pharmacist told me to take it at night. First night I wake up and 3am and can't get back to sleep. Feel hyper aware. I've NEVER had trouble sleeping at night, except for the night my dad died. I only took the meds one more night, and called it quits. Woke up every night at 3-4am every night, not able to get back to sleep. Weirdly enough, around 6am, when my daughter wakes up and my alarm goes off, I'm able to hit snooze and THEN I can go right to sleep. No matter how much noise she makes getting ready, or how many times I hit snooze, I got right back to sleep. So it must be in my brain, right?

After a week I started being able to sleep again, but now it's back the last two nights.

When I wake up, my body is tired, but I think my brain is now convinced I can't sleep at 3-4 am. The more I try to relax, or breathe, the more I think about it and the more I CAN'T relax.

I have had a LOT of anger issues over the years, a lot stemming from childhood trauma/physical and verbal abuse that was inflicted on me from my father. When I'm lucid, I'm a great person to be around, but when something triggers me, I go from ""okay"" to ""perturbed"" to ""homicidal rage"" in a very very short amount of time. I have had issues with anxiety, self esteem issues, and occasional suicidal thoughts (thankfully my common sense voice has stopped me from ever attempting it). Most of the time the suicidal stuff comes in when there is some other external stressor in place (i.e. starting a new job, moving, getting out of the military, etc.) One thing that has happened more recently (after returning from Afghanistan; note that I did not see any serious action to cause PTSD to be an issue), when I am at my worst, I get scary, and completely lose control of my emotions and let whatever stream of consciousness vile insult come out of my mouth and act as my weapon, as if defending myself from an attack that doesn't exist.

Four years ago, I met the woman who would change my life. My wife, let's call her ""E,"" has been thru thick and thin with me, but has been on the receiving end of many of my irrational outbursts. She is the strongest person I know, and the only one who has been able to call me out on my bullshit. I love her more than anything else on this planet, despite how I've treated her like shit at times. (It's as if, no matter how hard I've tried to not become my father, I keep descending down his path.) We recently made it through 3 years of marriage.

A year ago, we had one of our worst fights. I lost it, went completely irrational, and threatened to run the car I was driving us in off the road to kill myself and end it. (In my mind, I was only thinking about killing myself, and didn't even think of the fact that she would be killed too if something happened.) She told me to stop; I did and let her go. Our marriage almost ended that night. The only thing that saved us was that I vowed to get help, to go to regular counseling for the first time in my life. (Prior to the event I had seen counselors off and on, but nothing consistent.) The counseling helped us a little, but the anger issues were still there. My therapist suggested seeking medication, something I was deathly afraid of. I postponed, hoping the therapy would work and I would turn the corner.

Fast forward: 1.5 months prior to my transition off of active duty military service. Things came to a head once again. I had an irrational outburst, and E had had it. She left to cool off, stating that things were just about over. I lost it, felt suicidal once again and threatened to harm myself. She came back to stop me, and I broke down. I screamed, started crying out all the anger, frustration and rage that I had held back for so long came bursting forth. It was so bad that I couldn't move, I was frozen lying there on the ground. All I could think of was that I had lost the one person who I derived a lot of my personal strength from. It was then that I vowed to get medication. E told me she would stay with me, as long as I got medication to help my anxiety/anger. Only it had been too late for the military to help. They refused to give me a medication consult, stating that because I was getting out, they wouldn't be able to monitor the effects properly. So I had to wait...bide my time... until my civilian insurance could start (which was another long process I won't go into detail here).

E and I moved to where her family is from, away from everyone I know. I thought it would be a good place for a fresh start. Throughout the incident last year up until now, I've been doing regular weekly therapy sessions, and recently picked up a good therapist in our new home city. The earliest they could see me for a medication consult was the end of October. So again, I was forced to wait.

Here I am today. I've had issues trying to keep my anger/anxiety at bay, especially living with my mother in law temporarily until we can find a place. My wife wanted me to do everything in my power to keep my mother in law from seeing an outburst of mine, so I tried as hard as I could. Inevitably, I lost it last week, stormed out of the house. It was about the last straw then for my wife, and I barely convinced her to stay with me until I could get the help I need. Last week was rough, but we had a really good weekend. Thinks looked to be improving.

Then last night, I was at the Y in a fitness class, when some asshole walking by us was talking shit to me because I was struggling to get through the routine (I'm trying to get back in shape). I let it go until the class was over, found him and told him if he wanted to run his mouth he should come join the class and prove his mettle. He gets all huffy and puffy and wants to start a fight with me. I try and leave, he blocks my path, talking shit and baiting me, trying to get me to hit him. (Keep in mind if I had really wanted to, I couldve beat the living shit out of him.) I resist, the manager pulls him away and I wait until the coast his clear so I can leave. But the damage is done. I get back to my car, and I'm in full freakout mode.

I call my wife, thinking that she might be able to help me calm down, but I don't get the response I expect. I get home, and she is livid. To her, it's another in a long line of instances that prove I can't control myself. She insists we take a few days to separate, and she doesn't have any patience left. We are staring at the precipice of divorce.

Today was probably the lowest low I've been in my entire life. E and I agree to separate for a few days to sort things out. I leave the house to go to work, mother in law insists that E stays at the house and I leave until things get figured out. I was feeling like shit, and have a tendency to display how I feel on my face. Mother in law thinks I'm angry, starts pointing it out to E. (Which ironically I wasn't angry, but began to be irritated that she was trying to tell me how I was feeling just from a look. Overanalyzing my expression.) I've had it at this point. I get my stuff, go to work. Throughout the day, things have gotten progressively worse. To the point where I had my mind set that tonight would be my last night alive. The voice of reason that was once there to stop me was absent, I was determined that tonight I would end it all with my pistol in my mouth. Then I had a break; I got an appointment with a PCM for tomorrow afternoon for a medication consult. FINALLY. Slowly I've pulled myself back from the cliff, (it helped to send a couple texts between me my wife to keep communication lines flowing).

In not so short terms, help. I can't burden her with the knowledge that I was so close to ending it (as I'm pretty sure that would kill any chance I have left of salvaging things). E and I are taking it one day at a time, being civil, but things are very much still up in the air as to our future together.

What do I do? What do I say? I know that I am one step, one day away from getting the help I've fought for months now to get, and am determined more than ever to make things right, but I worry that it may not be enough to convince her to stay, no matter what I do. Even if things somehow work out, how am I going to deal with her mother, as we'll have to stay with her until we can get more financially stable? (Frankly at this point any ""we care about you's"" she's said are in question). How do I live with the knowledge that I'm not wanted?

E is all I have left right now. My own family is all but dead to me, and I have no family in my new home city. No local friends yet to turn to, nothing but her. So I can't accept the ""love yourself first"" or ""oh well, move on"" B.S. I won't accept it. Not after everything we've been through.

Sorry for the rant, but this is 20 something plus years of anger and sadness that has been simmering inside my soul.",['compound'],0

Long story short, my family has a history of depression and anxiety disorders. After a fallout with my last relationship (4 years that ended in February - if that matters), I broke. I was constantly in a state of anxiety and had constant panic attacks to the point that I got a therapist and began medication. My doctor said that I was showing classic signs of Major Depression as well, but that didn't effect me as much. It was the anxiety and intrusive thoughts that was the killer.

I was given 20MG of Citalopram, and for a while it worked. I'm never too sure if the anxiety went away because I ended and completely cut off the relationship or if it was the medication. At any rate, it did make me feel a bit better. 

However, I've recently begun a new relationship and everything was going well until we became ""Official"". After that (only been a few days -4?) I've been in the same constant state of panic and anxiety to the point where it I'm having intrusive and obsessive thoughts. My most ridiculous thought thus far is that I should end the relationship due to the fact that my now-SO has some small form of acne. I now find myself occasionally questioning things in this new relationship, that I would normally never pay attention to. These are things that before becoming ""Official"" or before I started having the renewed anxiety/panic attacks, I would have never cared about. However, they're all of a sudden an issue. Probably the intrusive thoughts are the worst.

I was thinking about showing this to my therapist later on (or at least reading it to him), but I wanted to know if anyone has experience anything similar?

Also, I was planning on talking to my doctor about either switching to Lexapro (or something else) or increasing my Citalopram to 30MG. Is Lexapro better than Citalopram with Anxiety? 

I'm just new to this and would really like some advice/help.

If this is at all confusing, I'd be more than happy to answer questions or provide a better explanation.

Thank you.

Got treated for it with Xanax XR and CBT while I was in college. I finished up the last year of college with no counseling or meds. I was felt fine when I graduated last May. I took the summer off for some much needed me-time and started an AmeriCorps position in October where I've been ever since. 

It's a full-time position at my local libraries where I teach people to use computers. I usually have 2-4 one hour appointments a day and 2 classes to teach a week. Those aspects I manage fine. The issue is the environment I'm working in. It's just not a good personal fit for me. My supervisor is a delight and understand, but the office of each library that I work in is just a large room with desks. It's your stand open office style setup. I'm very introverted so I've grown exhausted from always being surrounded by conversations. Headphones don't help. I can still hear everything and sometimes I need to be able to be interrupted for phone calls or drop-ins. When I'm not meeting with patrons, I generally just sit with nothing to do. I literally spend about 20 hours at the library here on reddit or facebook, because AmeriCorps mandates that we must serve 40 hours a week. 

Every day makes me more tired, grumpy and exhausted. I have no energy outside of work for anything I enjoy, which frustrates me to know end. As I grow tired, I also get anxious. The past couple of weeks have been constant anxiety with at least one panic attack a day. It sucks that I can't do anything to help myself and even the weekends don't leave me feeling recharged. I'm stuck here until August and my counselor said to just focus on surviving, but I'm past the point of feeling like I can survive this. I'm starting to have darker thoughts, which I never experienced before. Nothing suicidal, but I've certainly wished I could drive off the road and be hurt enough to get to take time off. I always hope for some escape. I can't just choose to leave. One, I'd lose my education stipend at the end and, two, I would lose my chance at good references. This is my first position out of college. I have my husband's emotional support, but he doesn't make enough that I could just quit this. The AmeriCorps stipend isn't much, but it is a help. 

I honestly don't know what to do now. I feel trapped and that I don't get to put my own needs first. Sadly, there's not even a quiet place I could escape to in the library, because it's turned essentially into a community meeting center instead of a place of solitude. ",['conj'],0

I am 27 year old female, 130 llbs, 5'7. I have an issue that I haven't been able to find the answer to online, so I am hoping that this subreddit will help me find the answers that I am looking for. I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder 2 years ago. My first ""panic attack"" happened when I was tripping on Mushrooms. I experienced all of the same characteristics of a panic attack; fears of impending doom, increased hear-rate, numbness in my extremities, half of my body going numb... then I had a full-blown seizure. My body convulted, my muscles spazed, I was shaking, contorted muscles...I kept feeling like I was going to faint but I tried with every ounce of strengh to stay awake as I feared that I might be having a heart-attack or might not wake up. It was the drowsiest I have ever been, and I remained awake while experiencing some of the worst muscle pain that I have ever felt. The seizure lasted about 15 minutes and I remained awake. As time continued, I kept getting more; usually not as bad and I could handle it. Finally one morning (out of the blue) I was watching TV mindlessly and had the wosrt sezizure of all. I went to the hospital and they diagnosed me with panic disorder, as I have already been diagnosed with major depression, GAD and PTSD; ""it only made sense that it was panic disorder"". When I entered the hospital (still seizing) and began banging my head on the wall screaming, the doctors took me back and kept asking me if I was a withdrawling alcoholic or if I was on PCP. I screamed no over and over again; they ran a drug test and it came up pos for marijuana from days ago. After they gave me xanex and I was cognizant, the doctor told me that weed most likley caused this. I laughed and in a kind way basically told him to fuck off. After that I went to a clinic and began medicine management. For almost three years I have switched between celexa and lexapro and now I take llexapro, lamictral, busperone and klonopin. Ironically, these are some of the same drugs that epileptics take. I still feel constant panic in my chest and I can feel sometimes that if I were unmediated that I would have an attack aka a huge seizure. When reading about the causes, I find it strange that my stress etc has been getting worse (body) and not better; as this is a trait that is common for those with panic disorder; and generally, epilepsy gets worse over time- which is what I feel like is happening to me. There are some grey areas that seem to overlap, as many of the characteristics are similar.



Here is what happens when I have a seizure: It will come out of the blue when I am not stressed out, though I do experience A LOT of stress. My body will go numb and I will feel pricks everywhere. Next my mouth gets dry and then my lips feel like they are smacking my gums. Next my face will go numb and I will start feeling ""out of it"" and warm, and cold, clammy and odd. Then my muscles tighten up and then they twitch and contort. They unstiff then become still again. Next I lose control of my body and I must lay down. I remain awake and feel pain. I shake and my jaw clatters. My heart-races and pounds like I am going to have a heart-attack and die. I feel like I want to pass out but I hold on with everything and remain awake. I feel like I am going to piss myself. This usually lasts 10 min-2 hours. I then feel sore as hell for about three days, and I am in pretty good shape.



I haven't had a full panic attack since I started taking benzos, but I still feel it and I am wondering if my medication should be changed; if I possibly have epilepsy. There are cross-overs that make me unsure of what is wrong with me. I have researched this like crazy and I have a medical degree, though it is an AA and that is not what I do. I feel like the best people to ask are real epileptics. I am wondering if I have epilepsy (maybe in addition to panic disorder, or maybe I don't have panic disorder or maybe I have an abnormal panic disorder that causes seizures, though there isn't much info about panic disorders and seizures in correlation). I am also wondering what type of seizure this would be classified as, or what type of epilepsy if anyone knows. It seems like a gran maul but I am awake and do not pass out. What are your thoughts? Does anyone have advice? Thank you all so much, I really appreciate the help. BTW one of my cousin's on my mom's side has epilepsy, though I am unsure if he got that gene from our side or his side.

A shipwreck of emotional roller-coaster with the energy of a 12 volt Energizer batter bunny, all rolled up in a 3 yr old body. I laugh from one minute and tears the next minute. I get picked a lot by my big sister when I was young, like all brats, we had our tantrums; its rare to find a kid who doesnt throw out tantrums. But in my case, my parents arent in the house 70% of the time, they go to work at the morning and get back late, prepare dinner and sleep, we had a baby sitter which also doubles as a nanny most of the time, but they can get selfish at times and leave the kids on their own. 

My sister is a genuine born teaser, her attitude was left unchecked later when my parents knew it was too late. It was due to her ambiguous character where she excels a lot at schools, plays, and even friends. It was a mask that shows 90% of the time during which 10% im being teased to death, she is the soul REASON i have built myself up from insecurity rather than confidence, she teases me out of my toys, my gifts, my personal happiness, even til now I see her as the embroilment of Schadenfreude.

Yet since I have no parents to cling to, nor a very reliable nanny to ask for help, I still crawl back to my big sis since she's the only person that is in there (blood-related) in the house. Then and there, I develop to become a kid who has hyper-emotional sensitivity. Even when I was CRYING IN THE TOP OF MY LUNGS my sister wouldnt stop teasing me calling me ""ulgy"", ""you look stupid"", or ""your a girl! cuz boys dont cry""... even the word ""weak"" came once in a while. 

I had no emotional support, no people to tell me otherwise, no one to tell me that all she said was lies just to make her self dominant and happy. So just like every human on earth, THEY DONT WANT TO BE ALONE, they always adapt to the groups character just to fit in, or off he goes. 

So I started accepting everything my sister said like its the rule even the bad and stupid ones... cuz due to my developed hyper-emotional sensitivity, i feel really insecure if she would leave me alone, all alone.

Fast forward to the future, people would think that childish things are left to childish days. But trust me, some things never change. Hyper-emotional sensitivity is a really hard to overcome! Though I had been chipping away most of the little things, but there are times that I grows back even stronger. Its a long process of reflection, self-conviction, meditation, and practice to overcome such things. People tend to belittle such emotional problems, BUT AREN'T EMOTIONS ALSO ONE OF THE DRIVING FUNCTIONS OF PEOPLE TO WORK, LET ALONE MAKE DECISIONS? Its really sad that people never accepts it and calls it bullshit, e.g. my sister (even when she's 26).

Most of my proudest achievements of overcoming such hyper-emotional sensitivity problems, is the ability to confidently stand in the stage, it was hard at first, but going to a lot of process of reflection and meditation, I can safely say that I have overcome the ""Stage Fright"" syndrome. I have little to less care about social skills and an easily talk to people just about anything, even to strangers. Despite having to overcome such things there a lot of things that were left still under developed... 

But the sad thing is, there are still things that are NEVER GONNA CHANGE! I kept myself out of responsibility, leadership, once in a lifetime events, and etc. cuz IM DEAD SCARED of getting emotionally hurt. People tend to point fingers and blame others over little things, and when the finger is pointed to me... I get PANIC ATTACKS, even the little problems. If I may trace it, my body and mind reacts to how the future might unfold when everyone hates me, dont wants me around, and expedites me out of the group, the fear that I had (a few paragraphs above) still HAUNTS to this very day.

I tried soo many things, from meditation, counseling, medication, and self-help. It doesnt go away, mind over matter, say your daily mantra, yoga and etc. I guess its here to stay, im guessing forever, might even be the cause of my early death... which I almost did. 

Sigh... It may be incurable for now, but prevention is 100x times better than cure. If you see kids teasing/dominating other kids or their siblings, try and stop them, a least your could slowly rid the world with problems like me and hopefully they can live a full life without missing anything...

THank you for listening...

I've always been very anxious and a couple of years ago this developed into a panic disorder. Back then it really skewed my view on who I was. With therapy and medicine I managed to pick everything back up and felt really stable. I've been living with my dad and sister.

I've recently acquired an apartment and was really excited about it. However, this is the second day and I feel so bad. I'm completely stuck in this anxiety feeling and constantly doom thoughts are coming up. Things like, I will stay alone forever, I will have no interaction with people anymore. I have this very strong urge to just rewind everything back to how it was. This however is not possible.

I feel like I'm in a dream-like state just waiting for time to pass. This all feels like a change I'm unable to cope with.

I am 6 months into a job and in the process of getting coverted to permanent. I won't have health insurance for another month and so I can't get therapy, which I desperately need, until then.
I thought I would ask for help here though to get me through this next month so I don't lose my job due to not being able to afford therapy.

I have pretty serious anxiety and all medicines I have tried just knock me out cold. This particular issue revolves around me being extremely anxious about losing my job and feeling like a failure. I owe well over 100 K in student loans and less than half is federal. If I lost my job I would literally be screwed and would have to make payments of 750 a month (federal would go into hardship based deferment) and if I couldn't then my cosigner (my mom) would be on the hook and she can't afford that. My debt looms over me like a mountain, making me feel like I literally am dependent on this one job (same kind of feeling as thinking you are dependent on a relationship). I constantly feel the need to seek reassurance that I won't be fired and that my transition to permanent is still going to happen.

The problem is this work place is very stressful. Everyone here acknowledges is to the point where in interviews they specifically look for whether the person seems like they ""would be eaten alive by this place"". 
I don't have very good coping skills to deal with the stress. Its a lab job where we do experiments for clients and so mistakes are frowned upon severly. This is my first job out of grad school and to be honest I have really struggled with learning how to be a good worker. I feel immense pressure to be perfect in everything I do because we are yelled at any time we make a mistake. I don't feel like my training is up to where it needs to be, but I can't tell them beucase my transition to permanent is dependent on them knowing that I can do my job. So everytime I go to do an experiment I feel immense anxiety that I will fail. I also honestly don't think I have the personality or traits to do well in science, and I have been trying to leave for a while but I can't seem to break into another field becuase literally all of my experience is in science. I am not a very careful person, adn I probably have ADD. Science requires extreme focus and precision and while I have definitely learned to be better these things don't come naturally to me.

This stress and lack of self confidence has gotten to the point where I literally feel like I can't do anything right. I feel like a total failure that I struggled so much at this job. Im 27 years old and I was in school basically until I was 26 and I was great at school but I feel like I suck at work.
Most people get transitioned onto permanent after 2 months, but they made me wait longer becuase they were concerned about my performance :(
To make matters worse my body seems to have shut down due to stress. I have had terrible IBS (probably due to stress and poor diet beucase I have been self medicating with food) and have been forced to take several unpaid days off of work.  My boss knows its due to stress and has expressed concern in the past that I can't handle this job. Im worried they are going to fire me over this or over the mistakes that I have made (I made about 3 separate mistakes in the past week. I don't usually make nearly that many and in fact was improving a lot, but the pressure got to me)

He talks to his friends while playing on the Xbox, and they try to encourage him in their way, and he is very upfront about what's going on, and always positive about going back to school, but he is unable to do it when the moment comes.

I don't know what to do.  His once a week therapy doesn't seem to have done much so far (4 months in).  He'll be doing Home/hospital study if this keeps up which means that tutors come to the house, but how can that help him if he is isolated?  I don't know how far to push him, because sometimes I don't think he pushes himself enough but I don't want to traumatize him any further.  I've started to wonder if there is some kind of therapeutic boarding schools, where he would get intensive treatment AND his education?  

The stories and comments I have read on this board all come from people who have dealt with social anxiety, but have managed to get through high school.  Does anybody have experience with what my son is going through?  ",['conj'],0

I'm 21 and I don't interact with people at all. I even get nervous chatting with strangers online. At one point I felt so ugly I didn't step out of my room for 8 straight months. I feel like everyone thinks that I'm ugly and fat. I know that eventually I will have to get a job but I thought I had more time.

My mom (who's in her 60s) has a high chance of losing her job despite being a stellar employee. My dad works too but we will not be able to live properly without my mom's job. I don't expect her to work if she loses this job and I know I will have to get one. I'm just so nervous right now that I can't do anything but think about how I'll be around people.

I have two more assignments to finish off for my online course and I can't even think of it right now... I'm thinking about all the panic attacks I will get and all the medication I won't be able to afford. 

I even had a bad binge last night. I ate right and exercised the whole week through but then I found out about my mom's job and I just panicked. I finished up a whole box of peanuts. I don't even taste the food when I binge, I just need to fill myself up.

I'm so scared. I feel like I will die right now and that there's no hope for me. I feel like a useless piece of shit. I have some important school work I need to finish but I can't concentrate at all. ",['conj'],0

Some background: My husband and I have been married for a year and a half, and our relationship is generally awesome. We're best friends, compatible in almost every way, great sex, lots of fun and laughter. Our only significant problems have stemmed from my trust issues/general anxiety. I'm doing everything I can to stay relaxed and healthy (therapy, medication, etc.), and in general, things are getting easier. But every once in a while I have an especially hard time distinguishing between when my anxiety is getting the better of me and when I have a legitimate reason to be concerned. 

My anxiety has been through the roof over the last three weeks because of my husband and his long-gone ex. They had a short, hard, on-and-off relationship (she lead my husband on a few times, messed around with other guys, etc.). But she and my husband were also compatible in a lot of ways (similar goals, interests, humor, intellect, etc.). So when their relationship was good, it was *really* good. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. 

Additionally (and maybe most importantly), she's just one of ""those"" girls. The gorgeous, successful, unattainable brunette with ambition/legs for miles, with what my husband described once as a ""fiery"" personality, and men falling all over themselves to be with her. She's serious ""the one that got away"" material, and despite my husband's hearty reassurances, sometimes I'm absolutely terrified of her. 

For the most part I've been able to assuage my fears (reminding myself that it didn't work out for a reason, thinking about all my husband's loving words/actions/reassurances, remembering that Facebook is not an accurate portrayal of reality, etc.). 

But for the last three weeks, she's been annoyingly ""present."" It started with my husband (out of morbid curiosity) researching her new ex-husband on Facebook. Not a big deal--I researched an ex's new wife once just because I was curious. But when he told me, my anxiety kicked in and I got upset. According to my husband, my upset-ness made him even more morbidly curious, and between that and deciding he was tired of treating his ex like a taboo, he added her on Linkedin, researched her on Facebook, and was considering getting sending her a message to catch up (getting in contact with her again). He also wasn't fully upfront about these things. He was in no way sneaky and certainly didn't lie, but I had to ask him if anything else had happened before he told me. 

In his defense, he said not only did he not hide any of this (I have and have always had access to all his accounts), he thought it was all so insignificant and meaningless he didn't need to tell me. He's not even sure why he told me about research his ex's ex-husband in the first place, because it's just not a big deal. The rational part of me can understand that, especially since I've researched ex's, too.

My husband and I have communicated about all of this, and he's been very reassuring. He hasn't been distant, sneaky, up at weird hours of the night, nothing. He agrees that if he were to get in contact with this ex, it would be important for him to tell me. Additionally, none the things he did are by themselves are concerning. But the fact that they all happened within the span of three weeks, paired with my irrational fear of his ex, have me seriously of wigging out. My anxiety hasn't been this bad in a while. (He also said he didn't want to tell me because I get irrationally upset. Also understandable.)

So, my question for /r/anxiety is, when is it okay to tell myself I have nothing to worry about, and when is my anxiety justified? Am I deluding myself into thinking my husband is being honest with me, or is my anxiety deluding me into thinking I can't trust him? What do you think is the best approach for handling this? 

Thank you very much in advance for commenting. I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. ",['conj'],0

**Rant**

I'm a 20 year old male &amp; I've struggled with social anxiety at least since I was in middle school, but it's been especially bad since I entered university last year.

It used to be that I would just freak out when I had to talk to someone unfamiliar, causing me to freeze up; I was known as a 'quiet' guy. I was really afraid of spanish class in high school because we had to partner with people we didn't know, and any class that involved picking groups or group work. I also could not talk to girls at all, &amp; other than one female friend who I managed to get to know senior year, that included casual conversation.

There are other examples but I think that gives the idea. Back then, reinforced by people around me, I just viewed my shyness as a personality trait; part of being introverted (I am somewhat introverted, but I think I am a lot closer to the center of the spectrum than I previously thought). 

After I came to college (for Computer Science), I made good friends with my two roommates (other engineers), and I hang out with my one friend from high school who goes here. 

Pretty much every college class is as bad or worse than the worst of my classes in high school, primarily because of the 10 minutes or so of sitting in the room waiting for the professor to show up. I also became increasingly anxious just walking to class, and I have issues keeping myself together as I walk past the hordes of unfamiliar faces. 

Not being able to talk to people in my classes was especially frustrating in my major courses, as I has always wanted to make friends with other programmers, and I could see opportunity after opportunity for that to happen pass me by. 

I mainly managed to keep it together the first few term, I got good enough grades &amp; still didn't think I had a problem. I did however ramp up my cannabis usage (went to multiple times daily from 1-2 a week) because it was one of the only things I could do to escape my anxious feelings. 

The next quarter I had even more trouble going to class. I kind of entered a vicious cycle of missing class, seeing the huge amount of work I had to do, procrastinating, and missing more class. When exam time came I forced myself to cram non-stop for the couple nights before. This worked somewhat at first, but the unpleasantness of the experience just made me want to procrastinate more and my grades steadily went down. I would've been academically disqualified last quarter if not for a loophole in the grading system (I failed a class I had already failed, so it didn't count against me again). 

All this time I just told myself it was from smoking too much, that I would cut back the next quarter and do better. Then a couple of quarters ago I cut the weed out completely and still faced the same issues (instead of being at home high all the time, I was at home depressed/anxious and feeling like total shit all the time). 

That quarter I recognized my social anxiety for what it was (a bittersweet realization), but I was still convinced I could take care of it on my own. I stepped up my meditation and bought a CBT workbook. It helped at first, but when things got stressful I still fell into the same procrastination / missing class cycle.

Being so freaked out about possibly dropping out last term (like I said I got off on a loophole) I realized that this was something I couldn't tackle on my own. At my counselor's behest I went to the free on-campus counseling (my academic counselor and the psychologist I saw at the counseling center are the only people I've ever told about my anxiety).

I went to an introductory session where they took stock of my issues, then went to my first 'real' session the next week. The thing is, the only thing the therapist (he was an accredited psychologist btw) wanted to talk about was events long past that really didn't carry any emotional weight anymore. He kept trying to read significance into them and was really interested in how I felt about my parents. Opening up to some of the issues was marginally helpful, but the effect wore off very shortly after the session (during the walk back in fact). 

After doing some research I saw that there isn't much evidence that a psychoanalytic approach to therapy is helpful for social anxiety and I became very cynical towards the whole counseling center. After I made my reminder for the next appointment on the wrong day &amp; missed it I was too anxious to schedule another appointment because I thought they would be mad about waiting for me (there are a lot of reminders around to cancel within 24 hours if you're going to miss your appointment).

This quarter the wheels came off pretty much completely. My symptoms seemed worse than before; I didn't go to class for 4 weeks (we're only 6 weeks through now), and missed all my midterms. Numerically, there is no possible way that I can pass any of my classes this time, so I've stopped even considering going. 

Last time I talked to my counselor he said that if I didn't make grades last time (which is effectively the situation I'm in now) I could appeal disqualification &amp; even if that failed, the university has a re-admittance policy that I may be able to leverage after taking a little time off for my mental health. I'm hopeful of this option, as I feel I could get a lot better if I invested some time with competently-guided CBT or perhaps medication.

**TL;DR:** I've been having bad social anxiety, causing me to be very close to dropping out of university (mainly from missing class). I'm ready to seek outside help now, but the only people who now know about my anxiety are myself, my academic counselor, and a therapist with a penchant for psychoanalysis down at the school's counseling center. 

**Help**

So that brings me to the main thing I need help with. As far as my parents know, I currently have a 3.1 gpa and am very happy here. I need their support to get through these issues but I have no idea how to break the news to them.

Initially I was going to send a long email (think this rant but about twice as long), but after I had written quite a bit (painstakingly, might I add, as I couldn't help think of their reactions the whole time) I found myself unable to continue. To put it in perspective, I hardly ever have full on panic attacks (I'm pretty good at avoiding anything that might possibly cause one) but I had two because of that email, one while writing and another when I tried to go back to writing the next day. 

I planned to email them on Wednesday, let the emotions settle a bit and talk about it when they visited this weekend, but I honestly don't think I'm psychologically capable of finishing what I need to say.

I'm now thinking I'll tell them in person, probably when we go to the beach when they visit (I don't really want to bring my little brother into this, &amp; there'll probably be a good chunk of time when he goes off to play in the sand when I could tell them). 

My plan is to practice like I was making a speech (ie memorizing the points I'm going to go over, not word for word) so my anxious brain doesn't completely toss out everything I was going to say.

Does anyone have any advice for this situation or tips for doing big confessions like this? I'd really appreciate any help / support I can get. Thanks &amp; sorry again about the length.",['conj'],0

When I think something is a normal concern, and everyone else wonders wtf my problem is, it's usually a sign that I'm having an abnormally anxious response to something. So... bear that in mind, I guess.

I also have a LOT of anger about this, which is new. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but the anger response isn't something I'm used to... I've been diagnosed with GAD, but never discussed any anger problems.

Anyway, my issue is that my fiance, whom I love dearly, bought me a ring I didn't want. I asked him not to spend more than a couple hundred at most on a ring, if he had to buy one at all. He ignored me, and spent a couple thousand. He is already chest-deep in debt with student loans, so this really wasn't money he had to spend. It's driving me crazy. To top it off, I really hate the ring. But please don't focus on that, like everyone else has -- it's salt on the wound. Even if I loved the ring, I would still be pissed.

We got engaged in September of last year, so I've been trying to get over this for a while. I don't feel angry/anxious every minute of every day but when I do it consumes me. I see that ring on my finger and it's all I can think about. I feel rage and anxiety beyond belief. I'm obsessed with trying to return it, but I know I can't. I fantasize about destroying it. I would give ANYTHING for these feelings to go away. I get it-- in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter. My brain knows this, but my feelings can't quit hating it. It's more than hating it's style, I hate what it represents (he excluded me and bought the ring out of pride), and the horrid anxiety it provokes in me. And NO, please please don't suggest it is doubt about my relationship, because that is absolutely not the case. It's been so frustrating trying to talk about this, because it really is the damn ring, not the relationship, but lots of people don't believe me.

This is really scary because I love him so much. He is completely perfect for me -- he's actually VERY fiscally responsible. This is such an isolated incident, he was unfortunately socially pressured to buy this ring, sadly. If only I'd known.

Anyway, it is stressing our relationship, understandably, and I'm terrified it is going to jeopardize something that is truly wonderful. Please help me. I saw someone this week (first appointment) and they  prescribed buspar. I will start taking it tomorrow, and I'm hopeful, but I'm worried it will be to little too late. Hah, worried my anxiety meds won't work, I just realized how cliche that is. :(

I appreciate any advice, I'll try not to be too defensive! And I will really really give these meds a shot.",['dative'],0

I called a therapist, and while he was very helpful, he told me he was worried about my financial situation and that he wants to find another counselor with much lower rates and for me to see them every week for several months. He also said that I need to see a doctor soon and get on anxiety medication. 

I'm really worried because I have no money. The last job I had, I had terrible anxiety dealing with money and I never cashed my checks because I didn't think I deserved it. Now it's too late to cash them at the bank, I would have to go and get the checks resigned. I'm extremely scared to go back to my old job and make them realize I never once cashed a check. 

How can I afford to pay for a therapist AND a doctor's appointment AND medication? I don't have any insurance at all, my family is very poor. They don't know about my problem, but would be putting such a burden on them while having this problem at a time when I don't have any health insurance. They have always told me to be very careful with my health since we can't afford anything, and I am already letting them down. 

I also have to pay rent and some upcoming student loans. I feel very trapped and paralyzed. I have a part time job now but the hours are much less than I anticipated. I would only be getting $100 a week, which is like one session of therapy for the ones I could find in my area. 

I can feel myself getting worse and worse because of all these decisions that I can't deal with. I don't know how to help myself because I feel like if I help myself, I'm burdening so many others and it's just better if I just sit here and not move. 

I really really need some advice, thank you.

The depression seems like it kind of went away on its own, and the anxiety was SO much better when I started medication.  My physical symptoms stopped almost immediately, and after a couple of weeks, I was fully functional.

Now I am still pretty functional, but I'm beginning to get worried about my health again and I've started to be convinced I have heart failure again, and to think that I'm going to die young.  I have also, after not cutting for maybe four months, suddenly started having intense urges to cut and sometimes followed through on them.  The weird thing is, there are some major ""life stress"" things that you would think would be stressing me out, but they really aren't.  I have a lot of free time this summer and I've been very relaxed and happy for the most part.

So what's going on?

Possible causes I can think of:

-I recently made plans to marry my boyfriend

-I will be student teaching in a month, and if I do well, I might land a teaching job in my hometown

-I'm waiting for results of genetic testing to see if I'm predisposed to ovarian cancer, which my mother died of.  

-I recently upped my medication from 50 milligrams of sertraline to 100 milligrams.

-The medication is just not as effective as it used to be.

-I've been drinking more alcohol lately.

Has anyone experienced anything like this after increasing their medication dosage?  It's not as extreme as I would think negative side-effects would be, but I can't imagine that this is due to stress because none of the things above are stressing me out.  ",['compound'],0

These have been tremendously exacerbated by some rather overwhelming recent events. I'm seeing professionals for help, but I am getting stuck, for many hours a day, on these thought loops where I imagine in vivid detail the worst case scenario for whatever is bothering me. If I don't have anything to latch onto at the moment, I just feel constant general physical anxiousness. Are there any methods that have worked for you to break out of a similar cycle/pattern? Not looking for medical advice, but for anecdotal advice.

I was recently prescribed an SSRI for the anxiety and depression but it's only been a couple weeks and has not started to help yet. There's some stuff going on in my life right now with my partner that I am focusing on, to the point where I work myself into a panic, obsessively researching medication side effects and horror stories online, and such, and I can't seem to control myself. Even if this wasn't happening my anxiety would latch onto something else though, even something trivial. 

I am not in a great place mentally, though I am not suicidal, I do often fantasize about having/wish for a stroke or heart attack, or an aneurysm or something. My therapist even says I am too negative for him to help me unless I can pull myself out of it a bit. I have tried meditating, but have extreme ADHD and it's not that meditation is hard, it's practically impossible for me. My partner and I have also been exercising at the gym a few times a week, but he doesn't feel like going sometimes and I am afraid of people, for the most part, and won't go alone (this doesn't really seem to help my mood anyway).

What I would like are any additional tips or methods or suggestion I can use to keep myself from spending the whole day dwelling on every negative thing that could happen, in horrific movie-like detail.

**Background:** I'm a 20F college student. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder a year ago. I take Cymbalta and after months of steady improvement with therapy and medication, I've tapered my dosage down to 20mg (lowest) where it will stay for a while. I haven't had a panic attack in months. :)

---

There is still one anxiety issue which my therapist and I have yet to address and that is driving. I have a terrible phobia of driving a car.

**About this driving thing:** It hasn't been much of an issue, really. I got my license when I was 18, so I have ID. At my school, parking is insanely expensive and there's rarely any need to drive, so a car is just a hassle. When I'm home for the summer I am completely reliant on others for rides, but aside from being a little embarrassing it's never been a problem.

The thing is... **my Dad is about to buy a new car and this morning he offered me his old car, and I turned him down.** I'd love to rationalize my decision by saying that I don't really need a car on campus, the insurance is expensive for someone who won't drive much, and the number of young people who die in accidents is crazy high... but we all know that the real reason I'm saying no to this is that I'm really friggin anxious behing the wheel.

My parents understand and have been incredibly supportive throughout everything. They know that having a panic attack prone person driving in complete terror is probably not safe (for myself and others). But I know that they want me to at least be capable in an emergency of exercising this admittedly necessary life skill.

And if nothing else, for the sake of self-improvement, I would like to overcome this fear.

So has anyone else had similar difficulties with driving? Any advice? (And I will, of course, also deal with this issue with my therapist).

I joined at the urging of a coworker, but didn't actually think to look at anxiety stuff until just now. I have never shared my full story with anyone, and I guess it doesn't matter much if no one reads this. But at least I will have put it out there and I can see it in its entirety. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am 2 years post-breakdown. I am 24 years old (female) and have dealt with anxiety my entire life. My mom tells me she ""knew"" something was up when I was two years old and watching Barney--they were going camping and a bear showed up, and I hid behind the couch. Granted, pretty sure a puppet bear is terrifying to ANYONE, ma. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Anyway, I have vivid memories of being afraid as a kid. Of everything. Things I shouldn't have had any concern over…. I was afraid of war at age 6 (we didn't go to Iraq until I was 11). I was afraid of my house burning down and my sister not waking up to the alarm. After 9/11, I was afraid of terrorists. I was afraid of any white powder for fear of anthrax. Even at the grocery store, my mom once told my therapist, I would be afraid of white powder… next to a bag of flour…. My dad went outside one night and I was afraid that he was putting a bomb on our house. Why? No fuckin clue. I have the kindest father in the entire world. The man would do anything to protect me. Irrational fear after irrational fear dominated my childhood. I developed a deep, deep fear of the WORD ""decapitation."" The word! I remember my mom sitting me down to try to work through my fear of aliens. It was heavy stuff for a little kid.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As I got older, it really manifested itself as hypochondria. I used to give myself time limits. ""If I'm not dead in ____ days/weeks/months, then I'm fine."" Talk about a stressful way to live. On top of my anxiety, around age 12, I realized (much to my horror), that I am gay. That set off a whole new kind of fear and self-loathing and depression. I did my best to deny it all throughout my teenage years, despite being completely in love with my best friend for 4 years.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When I left for college, my plans fell through. The school I had intended to go to was hit by a hurricane my senior year of high school, so my plans were out the window. I attended a small community college about 3 hours from my home town, just to go somewhere. I didn't know anyone, had an awful roommate and an ever-growing sense of anxiety. I was constantly alone in my room, the only place I felt mildly safe. I was 100% convinced that the apartment manager was stalking me, though I had no actual proof to back that up. I was paranoid everywhere I went that he was following me--he never was. My hypochondria was in overdrive and I thought I was dying or had meningitis every time I got sick. It was during this time that the most poisonous and damaging form of my anxiety began to manifest: intrusive thoughts and Pure O. Intrusive thoughts are the absolute worst thing I have experienced. From the ""I'm dying"" to the ""what if I just swerved and hit that person on the side of the road…."", they started coming. I used to ""hide"" my nail polish remover from myself so that I wouldn't find it and drink it if I sleepwalked (I have literally never sleepwalked). But I had no idea what I was in for. I sent an email to my mom and called her, crying, asking her to read it. In it, I explained everything I was feeling and how scared I was. She was so comforting and assured me that I was normal. I talked to my mom more often and things got a little bit better. Finally, that school year ended and I moved home. The thoughts became much less frequent and I thought I was fine.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The next year was reasonably mild, anxiety-wise. I enrolled in a University about 45 minutes from my parents house, which was a much better situation. I made friends, finally came to terms with my sexuality, and started dating a girl. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I shouldn't have started dating that girl. There were so many red flags that I ignored. But I thought, ""hey, here's someone who is a girl, who likes me! Go with it!"" Long story short, it took me 22 months to break off what quickly turned into an emotionally abusive (and psychotic) relationship. During that time, the intrusive thoughts began to come back. Occasional thoughts of hurting people around me, my general anxiety, and realizing that I had to do something about my ADD (informally diagnosed as a child, explains a lot). So my mom took me to a therapist who attributed my ADD to anxiety and put me on Celexa. My doctor was difficult to talk to and insisted that I didn't actually have ADD, just anxiety. Celexa had a crap load of side effects that just caused more intrusive thoughts. It turned me into an emotional zombie that made me question whether or not I was a sociopath. My mom was in the hospital at one point and we didn't know what was wrong with her. I felt nothing. And that bothered me. So I played with my dosage and weaned myself off a few times. I tried to go off of it completely at one point, but the shitty thoughts came back. I was sexually nonexistent, which put a strain on my already shitty relationship. I felt like there was no way out.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Once I broke it off with my girlfriend, I went a few months and then started dating a new girl. A really lovely girl. Things started to look up, in general. Decreased anxiety, decreased thoughts, so after 2 years on the stuff, I took myself off of Celexa. And life was great. For 4 months.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was house sitting for my parents. I got BBQ on my way over. I was watching TV. My dog, who I love more than life itself, was laying on the floor. Suddenly, I had a thought… what if I strangled her? And that was the beginning of my downward spiral.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have never intentionally harmed a soul in my life. But what followed that first thought was a descent into my own personal hell. If I thought that the occasional intrusive thoughts I'd had in the past were bad, this was more than I could handle. The thoughts became constant. Literally constant. Absolutely every thought was consumed with terrible, horrifying images. What if I stabbed myself? What if I stabbed my dad in his sleep? What if I elbowed my girlfriend in the face and broke her nose? What if I snapped her neck? What if I hit my head on that billboard that we just drove past? What if I enjoy these thoughts? What if these thoughts are my true self coming through? How do I know if I'm a bad person? How do I know if I'm not a sociopath? What if I lose control and act on these thoughts? What if I subconsciously WANT to act on these thoughts? How do I know? What's stopping me? Why can't I just die so this will end? …it got so bad that I finally broke down in class one day and had to call my mom. I was so riddled with anxiety that I couldn't even drive myself home because I was afraid I would close my eyes while driving. She came and got me, and I was pulled out of school for a week. I was terrified to be alone, so I went to work with my mom every day. The thoughts grew even stronger. What if I called my mom a whore? What if I yelled at her in the middle of this store? What if I called her a bitch? I couldn't handle existing. I didn't eat. I didn't get out of my pajamas. Finally, we got an appointment with a therapist. I cried through the whole thing. She told me that if I truly felt I might hurt someone, I needed to check myself in to a hospital. Thankfully, I never had to do that. She also told me that I would definitely need to give medication another try.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All the while, skyping with my girlfriend was the only thing that made me feel even a modicum of sanity. And soon, that began to diminish.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Finally, the day of my appointment with the psychiatrist arrived. My mom has been on Zoloft for quite some time, so the doctor decided to have me try that as well. Apparently, if something works for a family member, there's a good chance it will work for you. Zoloft. I'm little, so a low dose. ""50 mg once a day. It'll take 6-8 weeks to take effect so don't be discouraged if you don't feel anything for a while.""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Holy. Fucking. Shit. From day one, it was like the goddamn sky was opening up. It was like I could breathe again. It was nothing short of a miracle. I have this mental image of, literally, the clouds clearing and sunlight shining through. Of course, it didn't stop the thoughts, per say, but it completely stopped me from fixating on them. I started seeing the therapist twice a week and we talked about how these thoughts are a way for my body to tell me that something is wrong. And that something was that I was not handling my anxiety or stress well and bottling up all of my emotions. We developed ways for me to devote time to myself while making sure that all of my other needs are met. We also just talked.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That was two years go. I am so unfathomably happy to report that, though it was taken time, I am so much better. I still get intrusive thoughts, and they will occasionally last much longer than I'd like. But now, I know how to handle them. I just ignore them. It took years to recognize that these are not my own thoughts, but sporadic nonsense that my mind cooks up. If I ignore them, they pass. I am so proud of how far I've come. For the longest time, I was terrified of the notion of ""accepting"" the thoughts. But I finally understood that by accepting them, you take away their power. You simply go on with your life and know that the thoughts don't matter. If they start to happen frequently, I take it as a signal to step back and make sure that I am tending to my physical and emotional needs. Usually, something needs a'fixin. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Since all of this has gone down, I've also been formally diagnosed with combined type Adult ADHD and am on medication for that as well. It took an extremely long time to find the right one, and I'm still struggling with how exactly to manage it, but I'm getting there. And that's another story.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In case you are wondering, still with the girlfriend. She's still lovely as the stars are infinite. She is my best friend and my rock. We just celebrated 2 1/2 years last week! I couldn't have asked for a more understanding, kind, funny, intelligent, loving woman to spend my days with. She is one of the reasons I am okay today. If ever I need to be reminded that I am not a ""bad person"" or ""secretly crazy,"" she will literally repeat the words back to me ""you are not a bad person."" She'd go through hell and high water for me, and I'd do the same for her.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm terribly sorry for the length of this…. I left out as many irrelevant details as possible. Also, if it's a bit scattered or poorly written, again, I apologize. As I said, I've never told this whole story to anyone (besides my girlfriend) so it was difficult to keep it all in order.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I did suffer one more flare up about 4 months ago, but it wasn't thoughts-related, it was hypochondria. I was finishing my senior year of college, putting together my senior art portfolio, working 2 jobs and attempting to pass an art history class that I was failing, chest felt weird one morning and then lots of other symptoms…. wound up in the ER, everything checked out fine. Just stress. Needed to organize myself a little better.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I want to make sure anyone reading this understands that it takes effort to get better. A lot of effort. A lot of effort that seems frustrating and impossible. For years, I didn't want to talk to a therapist. For years, I didn't want to be on medication because I, like so many others, thought I should be able to ""handle it"" myself. That kind of thinking only causes you more harm. Seek help. It's worth it. I am on medication, but quite low doses. Be kind to yourself. Find people who care about you and let go of the ones who don't. Find a doctor who listens. My first therapist meant well, but wasn't the right fit. I do not have trouble focusing *because of* my anxiety, I have trouble focusing because on top of my generalized anxiety and obsessive disorder I **also have** ADHD. To fix the problem, you have to be able to identify the problem. Now that it is identified properly, I am managing it properly.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If anyone needs to talk about anxiety or medication or ADHD or anything, really, feel free to contact me. I am living proof that intrusive thoughts and anxiety can be overcome. I am still on 50 mg of Zoloft, very thankful that I haven't had to increase dosage. Very minimal side effects. Some sexual dysfunction but nothing a little creativity won't fix. 20 mg of Vyvanse (like I said, I'm small) with minimal and diminished side effects. Have experience with Celexa and Strattera (loads of side effects) as well. I still visit my therapist about once every 6 weeks or so, just to check in.

Thanks for reading!

tl;dr…. I gots me some anxiety, mainly intrusive thoughts. 2 years later, I done fixed my brain!",['conj'],0

I would probably classify myself as having issues with normal anxiety. Just some context here. I do tend to be a little socially awkward at work. My job requires me to be very social, and I'd much rather be locked in a room all day away from people. But I can get by.

I went to the doctor recently because I sometimes have issues sleeping normally. Sometimes I go to bed and I simply just can't ""turn it off"" and sleep. I'll be up all night basically counting the hours, thinking about problems, things I need to do. Etc. I was hoping melatonin would help, but it didn't. I was prescribed 10mg lexapro.

This seemed odd to me because, ive been reading that many people who struggle with much more severe cases of anxiety take this dosage.  Although I tend to be way over worried about job security (probably unnecessarily), I probably wouldn't have thought I'd medication.

What are your guys thoughts on this? Was I over prescribed?",['ccomp'],0

For the past few years, like a lot of you I've been suffering from crippling anxiety. Not just an occasional bad day, nor being slightly worried about something. You know what it's like. The sweats, the shakes, not leaving your home, avoiding people, palpitations, light headedness, nausea, everything that comes along with it. It ruins your life. Take a look at my comment history to see the extent I'm talking about. 

It's been like this for as I mentioned a few years now. I was always of the mind beforehand that if I was ever affected by some kind of mental disorder (For want of a better term) That I could pull myself out of it. We've had that speech before. Mind over matter and all that. At risk of this sounding like I'm trying to sell you something; some kind of miracle cure, after all this time I'm... getting better. It controlled me. It destroyed my life. I've lost a big portion of it due to me turning in to a completely different person overnight, but perhaps it was a blessing in disguise. I'm more compassionate now, empathetic, I have more time for people. I'm overall a better person than I was before so there's that hint of a silver lining at least.

It occurred to me a few weeks ago that I've been spending all of this time fighting the anxiety. I've taken so much medication that I rattle when I walk, everything from benzos, beta blockers, SSRI, SSNRI, self medication with alcohol. But akin to being in a fight with a person for a long time and reaching no resolution, sometimes it's better to decide that your time is more valuable than to stand there offering it up on a silver platter. You walk away. You decide that you're sick and tired of letting it control you. You're better than that.

Now these motivational posters you see with the sepia effect, some cheesy line. I'm just as much of a hater of those as the next person, but For a few weeks now I've been physically forcing myself to simply not care about the symptoms anymore, and I've noticed they're going away. Like an annoying person receiving none of your attention. It's all rainbows and unicorns, or at least it sounds that way. But after several years of quite literally having my life ruined by this, and what I've wrote about being the only single thing which has helped me, I feel it would be stupid of me not to write about it.

I've always been an advocate of mind over matter, and realising the true potential of what you're capable of when you consciously force yourself to quite simply not give a shit about the consequences where anxiety is concerned has to be the single best decision I've made. I'm smiling again, I'm happy.

It's not for everybody. I know that. But take it from a grumpy, naive, overanalytical twenty-something guy that it's not impossible. If any of you guys need to talk, send me a PM. That's not an empty invitation to fulfill my duties as a poster here, it's a genuine offer of an ear to vent to. One which will listen instead of just hearing. I know how valuable that can be, and if I can help any single person here struggling with what I've been crippled by for the past few years, it's a no brainer.",['appos'],0

I first noticed a problem when I was 19 or so and in college living in the dorms. I used to do a lot of obsessive checking, specifically to see whether my alarm was set or if the door was locked.  I worried constantly about grades, my family, sexual assault (not sure why), the future, etc.  I had sought counselling in high school for depression, but I did not ever get counselling or meds for my anxiety in college.  It just seemed to go away over time.  Later in college (when my anxiety lessened), I met my (now) husband.  He makes me feel safe.  I haven't had much trouble with anxiety beyond feeling like people wouldn't like me or that I would do a poor job.  Even when I went back to school to get my Masters' and was under the additional stress of school again, I was fine.

Anyway, that brings us to today.  Something over the last 6 months or so has changed in a big way.  My checking behavior is back and I can't get it back under control.  Every morning when I leave the house, I have to check the back door, the stove, make sure I remembered to let the dog back in the house (this one is particularly silly, because I  have never forgotten him outside), and then check the front door.  Sometimes I get to the part where I am locking the front door behind me, only to feel that I can't remember whether I've checked the stove.  I have to go back inside and check it, or I spend the rest of the day worrying.  I'll get into my car, start driving to work, and forget whether I've locked the front door.  Forgetting isn't really the right word for how I feel.  It's more like I'm not sure I did it adequately the first time or that I have a false memory of doing it.  At night, when my husband is home, I trust him to check the doors.  It seems to only be a problem when it's my responsibility.

Every day I feel a little more out of control and a little more like I'm crazy.  On top of the anxiety, I'm feeling depressed, withdrawn, irritable, and so so so tired.  I feel like I'm in a crazy depression/anxiety feedback loop where one is making the other worse which makes the other worse which makes the other worse.  I finally scheduled an appointment with a clinical psychologist, but won't be able to get in for another two weeks.  I've spoken to my husband about my behavior and how I'm feeling and he's been very supportive.

I guess I just can't figure out why this is happening now.  **Why now?**  I made a list of my symptoms and stressors in preparation for my appointment, and while the list of both is long... it's not like anything has changed dramatically in the last 6 months.  Three years ago I moved to my current location from my hometown 9+ hours away from family and friends, and I was fine then.  Work is stressful, but it always is.  My husband went out of town a couple of times back to back, but I did okay.  I just don't get it.  I can't trace this back to one thing or one event.  I suppose it could be a straw breaking the camel's back scenario, but I don't know.  Honestly, all making the list did was make me feel panicked, because I feel crazy.


I hate feeling this way, because I feel so completely out of control and helpless.  I've tried to stop my checking, but I can't.  I'm not even sure what I'm afraid of.  I mean, obviously, I don't want someone to get into our house, but that could happen whether I lock the doors or not.  I don't want the house to catch on fire, but that is beyond my control, too.  I don't want my dog to be left out in the elements, because I don't want to harm him.  (He's not an outdoor dog and I live in very warm area.)  I can acknowledge to myself that sometimes bad things happen whether I plan for them or take precautions, but all of the rational thinking in the world isn't making it better.

I've dealt with self doubt and anxiety without knowing what it was for basically all of my life.  I don't have many friends (and really none in town), I find it hard to meet people, I worry about how I am perceived, I find it hard to let go and have fun... but this is above and beyond what I am used to and what I can handle.


Anyway.  Thank you for reading.  I'm hoping my appointment in a couple of weeks helps and that the doctor can help me pinpoint either the cause or a mechanism for coping.  It does make me feel a little better to put this all down in text, although it's still swimming around in my head.  I'm really grateful that this community exists on Reddit!",['conj'],0

I'm 16 and I'd say I've dealt with anxiety getting increasingly worse for about four years. The anxiety stems from being overly passive and then feeling immensely guilty when I've not met the needs of those around me. I'm well aware this could come from codependency related to my mothers severe alcoholism but with all the therapy and medication I can't seem to change. I suppose this is who I am, I want to be helpful and I especially have a strong desire to be kind. Regardless of what I do or what I try to do to accommodate others I constantly feel sick to my stomach as if I've made a horrible mistake. I can't ever tell when others are joking and I cry nearly every day it seems. It's pushing everyone I care about further away.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year, he's been awfully supportive during my last breakdown/suicide attempt but I think he's tired of trying to help. With that in mind I've kept a lot of my developing anxieties to myself in order to bring less harm to him. I seem to blow things out of proportion, he once said I wasn't ""model beautiful"" or something along those lines and it felt like I had to lose weight or fix myself so he'd be lucky enough to have someone to show off rather than myself even though he said after that remark that he liked me fine as I am. 

The thought that he doesn't find me attractive is a constant headfuck but the idea of hinting I wish he made it more clear I was beautiful to him makes me want to vomit. I can't ask for something without it being a childish desire but I can't let it go without getting hurt.

Long story short I apologize profusely, I constantly ignore my own desires so I don't seem to impose even the simplest things, I feel like a complete dunce and constantly seek ways to improve so I'm less of an eyesore to others, and I annoy EVERYONE by being too hospitable or offering too much or acting too much like a doormat and I fear there is no hope.",['conj'],0

After 6 years together, and a month shy of a proposal, my SO decided to end things.  A major point of contention being her anxiety disorder and my inability to deal with it better.  Of course, by the very nature of the disorder, it took us blowing up for her to truly explain what it was that was bothering her.  Most times, she just keeps things to herself.

Now, things are pretty definitively over, but I myself was going through bouts of depression, which being isolating in its own ways, made it very difficult for me to reach out and help her as needed.  I've done a lot of research, and aside from seeing all the problems with 1) her therapy and approaches to her anxiety/making progress, and 2) my efforts in dealing with it and relating to her, I have some general ideas about better addressing and caring for someone with anxiety.

Who knows if working things out is in the cards? It sure doesn't seem like it is, but should we figure it out, I hope to be as prepared as possible to be a better partner in this regard.

So I was wondering: Have any of you dealt with this sort of thing in the past?  How did you and/or your partner learn to better address such issues?  What sort of changes were made? Either in therapy, medication, approaches...etc?  If you didn't, how did you guys cope?  Did you end up working it out later or did you ultimately learned it was for the better?

I have recently been suffering from quite bad anxiety. I have always been someone who stresses a lot but this is a whole different ballgame and really impacting on my ability to go about my day to day life.

It started with a minor car accident that I convinced myself was going to cost me tens of thousands of dollars. I spent days crying about it and barely sleeping. Ended up costing me $200.

The latest issue is auditing for a charity I'm on the board of. Completely convinced we've screwed something up (I just don't know what yet and some basic legal advice has said that is highly unlikely), that I will end up with a criminal record and won't be able to pursue my career or travel in the future. Just typing it I know it sounds crazy. But I'm 50% convinced now and in the height of my panic I'm absolutely SURE it's going to happen.

At times the anxiety is so bad that I have considered dropping out of university, not going to work, or even at one point had some suicidal thoughts because the idea of continuing on with this fear is almost unbearable.

Has anyone else had this problem? Honestly it's like hypochondria but to the world at large... So worried about EVERY potential problem and convinced it's going to screw up my entire life.

To explain: I am a high school student with a rather debilitating case of anxiety and panic disorder. Due to its suffering I had at one point become depressed as well as suicidal,and soon my school insisted upon me seeking treatment.
During the school year I attended therapy with a private professional,and was prescribed medication that I had to take at school instead of home because of my parents. 
Here I have arrived at the problem;my parents were and still are wholly against the idea for their own biases. I was only ever given my medication on campus because my mother purposely neglected to otherwise. Nevertheless,I was able to recover. 
But then the school year ended-and with it,the therapy sessions and medication intakes. 
I pleaded and even threatened my parents to allow me to continue treatment. But again and again I was dismissed. 
So now I’m on the brink of another relapse;I haven’t been outside to see friends,volunteer,or shop in months-because I’m terrified of having a panic/anxiety attack. Sleep is impossible;my mind is a revolving door and it’s like I’m stuck in an infinite loop,pushing and pushing and 	I’ve yet to discover where the freaking exit is. 
My therapist has relocated and I do not have her number. Besides that,I don’t have a car or phone of my own to contact her or such. 

This was more or less a last resort for me. Please help.
What can I do/say that will get me back to where I need to be?",['compound'],0

I am a 27 year old married female living in Southern California. I have dealt with anxiety since I was little, but I started having full blown panic attacks about a year ago. It all started when I had to get a bunch of dental work done for a few months, then I caught a flu and BAM. Health anxiety hit me with full force. This then led to depression and OCD (which is something that I have also dealt with before, but never to this extent).

I've tried therapy, self-help books, medications and just plain ol' doing it on my own. Each one has had it's benefits, but here I am today, and still struggling.

Before dating me she also had depression and was prescribed Sertraline aka general Zoloft.  She used to use it constantly but then got off of it.  

Fast forward to now.   She got a new job and her anxiety started taking major control.  It was making it hard for her to work so she started taking it again.  However this has had its effect on our relationship.  I suffer from anxiety as well but will not take medicine for it.  I refuse as I do not like the side effects and I have learned to control it.  In fact my gf has improved my anxiety so much that it shows up barely at all some days.  The side effects have gotten to her.  It took away her sex drive completely. The thought of sex with me disgusts her.  Anytime I make a move she pulls away.  This has started affecting me.  It drives my anxiety through the roof.  All I can think to myself is how I must be unattractive to her and that she no longer is interested in me.  I get depressed at times and I have a hard time confronting her since I know it is the meds and I do not want to worry her.

She does know though that I am not doing well.  I am very easy to read.  I have mentioned to her before my thoughts and we have talked about it many times.  However it is affecting her now too.  She randomly broke out in tears about how depressed she was because our sex life is not existent.  She feels terrible and doesn't know what to do either.  

If she gets off the medicine she wont be able to work.  We both need her working to keep living in our apartment.  We just don't know what to do.  We don't have the money for therapy or expensive treatments.
 The very thing that is supposed to treat her anxiety/depression is giving me and her anxiety and depression.  Yet if she quits taking it then we are SOL unless we can find a suitable replacement.

I want to get him help but I don't want to make it worse by taking him to the wrong place.  So your input is very welcome.

Kiddo is 10 years old.  When he was very small he had a speech delay due to hearing problems.  When he was six we got him ear tubes and this made a huge difference.  He has caught up with the other children developmentally now, only this one thing has remained.  He has a terrible time making decisions.  To the point of breaking down almost daily.  If you want to surprise him you have to make all of the plans in advance.  If you say ""Hey Kiddo!  We can go wherever you like for lunch today!"" it's terrible for him.  He cannot make a choice without tears, anger and frustration.  He is so worried he will make the wrong choice.  I can't even ask him if he would like to come to the store with me, anything.  It is not just with me either, but every adult in his life.  He will normally bounce back fairly quickly but to get so low over something so routine is hard to deal with.  I want to help him through it but nothing I say comforts him.  I'm just so worried about my boy.  

Its possible that he has inherited some depression issues from me and his father.  His father is bipolar and heavily medicated.  He also does not see his father more than once a year.  (He lives in California, we live in Kansas)  And with me, I have been diagnosed with PTSD and social anxiety.  My symptoms are under control after years of therapy and medication.  Is it possible that he has inherited something from us?  Is it possible that this is just part of puberty?

I have had pretty bad health anxiety since I was about 14 or 15.. Still do and now I am 22 yo. The usual: tumors, cancer, MS etc. I usually have a panic attack maybe once or twice a month and they usually aren't that bad and relatively manageable. Ive never felt the need to seek help or meds (but I am terrified of doctors so there you go). Usually (almost exclusively) at either work or in class, I will have an intense fear of passing out or having a heart attack, I get pretty dizzy, hot flashes, palpitations.. In class I usually just stick it out. I have very small class sizes and I don't want to interrupt the professor. At work, where I am constantly dealing and talking with customers, ill usually go to the bathroom and calm myself down. If I am really stressed I talk to my mom, whom I used to live with, and who also suffers pretty bad anxiety. But I rarely do this and she doesnt know the realities of my anxiety. But a hug from her usually does the trick. 

Recently I moved overseas for an exchange. I was really excited and Ive been here nearly two weeks. Anyways after binge drinking for like 4 days my roommate and I went to the flea market to look for bikes, I hadnt eaten yet that day and it was pretty early. Anyways had the worst panic attack Ive had in years; legitimately thought I was going to pass out, everything seemed so surreal, and I felt absolutely helpless. I dont speak the language and all I could think about is being carted away in an ambulance. I had to sit down because I really thought that I was a goner. My roomate had no idea, as far as he knew I was just sitting down and having a water. Anyways since then I have not been the same. My body just feels off, especially my head.. Fuzzy like I cant hold a conversation without freaking out, I keep getting dizzy and Im all shaky, nervous and nauseous. You know that feeling of anxiety, that sensation, kindof like butterflies in your stomach, a feeling of impending doom? I cant fucking shake it and I want to cry. Its this health anxiety coupled with homesickness.. I miss my family and friends but also a girl, Im affraid she will find someone else while Im gone. I really just want a hug but I dont really know anyone here well enough to talk to them about it. Ive been on the verge of a panic attack since the flea market on Sunday, so 5 days. I feel better typing this; I feel better now that Im in my room.  

Has anyone here experienced anything like this? Im going to call my mom as soon as the time difference will allow it. I will have health insurance hopefully next week so I can go to a doctor (it is that bad) but I dont know. Any advice or comforting words would be awesome.

Doing a search of Nardil and Phenelzine shows that almost no one, aside from me, has talked about it here.  So I feel it is my duty to mention it to other long sufferers of anxiety.

**I have been suffering from anxiety for basically my entire life.**  From an early age I was **very shy, and blushed** a lot.  Around puberty I started to get worse, and went into my shell.  This is when **shaking and sweating** started.  Things only got worse as my life went on, and as I added layers upon layers of methods to cover up my problem.  I won't go into **personality crisis**, but I will say that I tried to be a different person because I felt that I couldn't be myself.  Some (*not many I think/hope*) people thought I was gay because I was so meek and frightened that it made me have a slight lisp and (*I guess*) seem effeminate to them.

Fast forward to age 32ish.  I am losing hair fast from massive anxiety at work.  I am crying, and shaking incredibly at little things.  I feel like an embarrassment and a failed human being.  My entire day is non stop fight (no) flight (no) or fright (**yes**). My only vacation is sleep, and I can't get enough of that.  I called 911 when I  halfheartedly tried to jump off a bridge, and spent the night in a county mental hospital.

Later I saw a new Psychiatrist.  We ran through more and more drugs.  Basically every 6 weeks, for 2 years we tried something new.  I was smart and realistic enough to understand the placebo effect, and not stay on drugs very long unless I truly felt they were doing something.  Even then, every drug came and went.  This included SSRI (**fucking useless*), Benzos (*slightly better, still useless*), Beta Blockers (*also useless*), and other classes of drugs that I can't remember.  I have dozens of drugs in a drawer at this point, like many of you.  I even bought an expensive alpha wave CES/tDCS device.  I also spoke to doctors about Electroconvulsive therapy (*ECT*), but never ended up trying it.  I tried to get on a trial list for TMS, but wasn't able to.  I tried lithium bought in smaller over the counter quantities, didn't work.  I tested my testosterone level, and it was fine.  I even checked to see if I had a tapeworm in my gut sucking my nutrients out, making me anemic.  Nope.  I tried medidation, deep breathing.  I tried talking therapists, which did help of course but not much.  Looked deeply into radiosurgery in order to destroy part of my amygdala.  No doctor would agree to this procedure. 

We then started MAO's.  The first was Selegeline.  It didn't do much of anything.  The second was Nardil's generic...


**AND I TELL YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE AMAZING**.  My life is dramatically different.  I started last September.  There have been side effects, such as dizziness, constipation, anorgasmia, loss of strength.. basically all temporary.  There are 'severe' food warnings that my doctor stressed to me, and it all sounded scary.  In reality, it is just legal CYA.  I've never had a bad food interaction with anything I've ever ate.  I eat mountains of yogurt, for instance.

**I just went on 2 dates this past weekend and I was stupendous.**  Confident and funny in spades!  The lovely ladies surprisingly enough are both calling &amp; emailing and asking me to meet up again.  Life is truly different.  

Guys and gals.  I am 100% serious in this post.  I have not exaggerated one iota.  Everything I've written is absolutely true.  If you PM me, I will even give you my phone number, if you want to discuss things.  Of course I'm not a doctor.  Even so, I am really really hoping you read up on Nardil and at the very least mention it to your doctor.  Do some doctors not like having patients mention drugs? Yea, but who cares this is *your life* that is at stake.  

I really hope someone other there reading this will take my post seriously.  It makes me very sad to read the posts here when I'm not sure if you guys are even aware of the potential of this drug.

I'm sure it is not for everyone.  But if you are taking SSRIs and benzos and they don't do shit for you, I hope my post is a lightning bolt in your brain.  I hope that you will at least mention this drug to your doctor.  It is not prescribed before SSRIs for (*I think*) fear of food interactions, even though SSRI's barely do shit for a large amount of anxiety sufferers.

Does Nardil fix my problem 100%?  No.  I'd say about 60-70%.  Even so, sometimes I feel unstoppable after a life of non stop fear and depression.  This feeling is truly amazing.

I've tried doctor after doctor after therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists. Tried nearly 20 different medications for both disorders. All of who just tell me that I'm an incredibly hard case to solve. Having moved 8 times over the last 5 years hasn't helped me a single bit.  

Either way, I've all but given up hope on looking for help with my Major Depression. Sure, I can't find any joy in life and I constantly feel like a miserable piece of shit... but hey it's a lot better than dealing with shitty doctors all the time who seem to refuse to try something that effects my dopamine levels rather than drowning me in SSRI's an Anti-psychotics or Mood-stabilizers.  

Anyhow, dealing with that BS then moving away from my Klonopin prescribing primary doctor lead me down the path of becoming a drug addict. Now I don't exactly go out of my way to find drugs but I just have a way of ending up in the wrong groups of people. To put it simply, I loathe self-medicating but god damn painkillers (Opiates) and weed/booze make being alive and around people much easier to cope with.  

Which leads me to my current predicament. Klonopin and Xanax seem to be the only two medications that actually help my anxiety without the need for all the other shit. Yet it's so fucking difficult or rather damn near impossible to get a doctor to prescribe them to me once I go over my medical history and my rather poor coping mechanisms.  

I currently have about a weeks worth of Xanax (2mg's daily) that I got from an ER visit left until I'm fucked again. I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin. Does anyone know of a medical service I can use or get a refill or anything until I can get setup with another primary doctor? I'm not trying to doctor shop or abuse benzo's, they just happen to be the only thing that works for my anxiety outside of anything illegal.  

This wouldn't even be a huge issue if it weren't for the fact that I'm currently unemployed, broke as shit, uninsured and fucking moving yet again.

I started getting panic attacks a couple of years ago, which I can honestly say has been one of the most horrific experiences of my life, where I ended up in a and e thinking I was having a heartattack. Since that, it's really torn my confidence away from me. Not that self-esteem and confidence was that high before but somehow it made it so much worse.

Though my panic attacks for the most part have subsided, my recent and quite severe issue is fear of public speaking. I was always quite scared of public speaking but I'd mumble through what I had to say, be it small presentations in front of class mates and move on after a little bit of anxiety about it a few days before. Since the panic attacks though it has just go so much worse. I dread weeks, even months before a scheduled presentation. If it doesn't count for my course I'll avoid it at all costs, such as calling in sick because it's that much mental torture to me. Even now with assessed presentations I can't actually face them. I've even e-mailed professors to conduct them in more private environments.

Now I know that the only way to overcome them is by just doing them over and over. I do know that, but with intense anxiety it's never really that simple to face it. It's very taxing on my overall health and mental stamina, the constant worrying wears me out. I'm frankly sick of letting something so minor rule my life. I have been to see a doctor who has offered CBT and anti anxiety meds (citalopram / celexa). Though I'm quite sceptical if taking citalopram will help with stuff like this. I haven't started the offered therapy yet though due to horrendously busy university commitments.

So what I'm really asking is, fellow / ex sufferers what's your story? how did you deal with it? overcome it? etc. Did you ever do what I did and avoid them by calling in sick? And did the therapy I was offered help you? (even if not related to public speaking etc.)",['conj'],0

And... almost went to the hospital, for that matter, until I got an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist Monday.  I obviously need a med tweak.

It feels like it came out of nowhere; the constant panicking, again, and the suicidal thoughts.  My nurse practitioner who I see sometimes has said when this out of nowhere suicidality happened before that you don't just *suddenly* become suicidal, that it's lingering under the surface and just bubbles up.  Perhaps that is what is happening.

I was doing well.  I was happy for the first time in my life.  I thought I found the right med combo after four years of huge struggle:  Saphris, Klonopin, Viibryd, and Lamictal.

However, the stress in my life is really getting to me.  I can't even get relief in my sleep anymore.  I'm having constant nightmares that have me waking up gasping for air, in a cold sweat, with a stress-induced asthma attack, or worse.  I wake up panicking.  I panic at school.  I panic at home, in the car, in public.  I shake in class, in clinical (I'm in nursing school), and turn red and sweaty when I have to read in class.  I avoid eye contact and want friends but feel like no one likes me.  Nowhere is safe anymore.  I have constant feelings of dread, feeling like I'm suffocating with a tight pain in my chest, and just constantly feel like I can't cope with life.  I'm constantly sweating and my hands tingle.

I want to function.  I want to be normal.  Why is it so hard for me?

Nothing is bringing me happiness anymore.  Even music, my main coping mechanism.  I feel so depressed.  I just want to sleep all the time.  I've gained back 20 pounds in the last 4 months after successfully losing 15.  I'm higher than my highest weight.  I'm using food to cope, binging at night, and wake up with cramps and feel nauseous.  Anything I eat gives me heartburn.  I'm having stress headaches constantly.  I take ibuprofen like candy just to make it through the day.  My pulse gets up near 100 per minute.  I get heart palpatations.  I feel like I'm dying.  Also, my meds and my stress have made my sex drive non existant.  My doctor tried giving me something for it but it's not working, so it looks like I'll have to try something else, but I guess that's the least of my worries.

I'm in nursing school, my second semester, and just began having 16 hours of clinical a week in addition to 15 hours of class and 40 hours of homework.  It's exhausting and more than double my course and clinical load last semester.  I don't know how I can do it.  I got a 3.7 GPA last semester, so I know I can, in theory.  But I don't know, all of a sudden I'm just collapsing under the weight of my life.  I don't want to take a medical leave even though I feel like it would help because I have a crippling amount of student debt that would become due if I stopped attending.  But I don't know how I'm going to make it through this semester, or LIFE, for that matter.  How does anyone do it???  Nursing school is supposed to be my path to a better life for myself, a stable one, and as much as I love it, I feel like it's killing me.  But I have too much debt and no other choice to turn back now, lest I risk everything in my life.

I'm so tired all the time.  I can't even drink caffeine to help because it triggers my anxiety terribly.  I'm falling asleep in class and I've missed two school related things since Thursday because of my anxiety.  I don't know how I can go on like this, I just want the pain to end.  I freak out the second I feel a bad mood coming on, knowing that it will only get worse, and feel like it will  never get better.  I'm constantly hyper aware of my feelings.  I'm constantly thinking negative thoughts about what other people must be thinking about me.  I get into negative spirals where all I can do is dwell on the negative about everything and forget the positive.  All I can think about is a bad look someone gives me, a patient telling me I seem nervous, a critique I get at clinical or in class, anything anyone says to me I over analyze, and there's not enough time in the day to process everything that goes through my mind.  My mind feels like it's constantly racing lately.

Up until Thursday, my nightly meds (I take 0.25mg Klonopin at 9am, 1pm, and 6pm and the rest at 6pm) would immediately calm me down.  It's not even doing that right now.  My depression and anxiety is just through the roof.  I took extra Klonopin because I was so out of control, screaming and crying to my mom about how terrible I felt that she made me take it, basically.

I don't see my therapist again until the 17th.  The people in my life are getting frustrated with my lashing out and bad moods.  I don't have any friends to go to anymore.  I exhaust my boyfriend.  I'm so busy that I never have time to relax; or, alternatively, I procrastinate, feeling miserable the whole time, because looking at a book brings me to tears, so it's like I never relax.

I've been denying all of this, putting on a happy face at least for most of the day because I don't want to burden anyone, but I've been lying to myself.

I dont' know how to cope.  How to feel less depressed, less anxious, more normal.  Is it normal to feel the way I've described?  What can I do to cope and feel better?  HOW will I EVER function normally?  It really feels impossible.  My mom told me tonight when I was telling her how badly I wanted to die that I belonged in a mental hospital or a group home and that really didn't help things.  I don't want to be this way.",['appos'],0

I haven't been diagnosed or prescribed medication. The farthest I've gone for help is my university's counseling services. That didn't even last long.
Anyway, the stress and anxiety I feel is so overwhelming that I sometimes cry uncontrollably to the point where I hyperventilate, and just freak out in general. I've lived with my boyfriend for a year and have been away from home for three. My boyfriend is pretty much everything I want to be. He's calm, collected, composed. Yet, whenever I try to bring up what it feels like to be inside of my head, it seems that he takes it with a grain of salt. He seems to think it some sort of gender thing, where men don't get freaked out and I'm only feeling like this because I'm a woman. I just want him to understand the clusterfuck of thoughts that I am constantly thinking about. I've seen the mental illnesses that occur in my mother's side of the family. I feel like he has no clue about any of it. I know anxiety/depression doesn't know gender. 

So, I guess what I'm asking is: How have you all dealt with getting your boyfriend or girlfriend to understand the anxiety you feel? Will they ever really know how it feels?",['conj'],0

My condition is progressive - starting from diagnosis with diabetes in 2000, then nothing much happened until 2007 when a company &amp; product which I formed was stolen over a period of six months -- causing stress and anxiety to exacerbate the db symptoms.

I landed a couple of medium term contracts after that - but financial pressure and the anxiety really started to bite.  My 'retirement plan' had been stolen, and left me in debt as well!

I have a couple of extraordinarily capable and decent children: one finishing HS this year, and the other starting 3rd year at university.

The relationship with wife is pretty much zero after 22 years, but holding up (somehow) to get the younger through to university. 

Health: The most recent situation is that I have virtually no nerve sensation in my hands from the knuckles down, or in my legs from the calf down (typical effects of progressive diabetes).
Walking barefoot is a challenge, but with good-fitting shoes, the contact is transferred to the top of my feet and ankles - so I get  around reasonably well except with short steps or very irregular surfaces.

OK - add to that - I have diagnosed 'moderate to severe' depression, no income, no assets (we survive on my wife's contract salary) and nowadays no friends that I can communicate with on a daily or weekly basis. (sniff-sniff!).

My background is in complex systems design and engineering with local and very large multi-national companies - but since being out of the open workforce - initially in my own company from 2001-2008... my task-specific skills are a bit rusty. 

Although I was never formally certified in specific skills, the projects I worked on up to $50M+ applied very leading edge concepts, creating new, unique outcomes... hence there has rarely been a course or certificate available that addresses those skills. (In fact I often gave industry/task tuition to others in various disciplines!)

I have a number of other new developments on-the-shelf, which I can't seem to even get an audience - despite being offered research programs (at cost) to develop them... potentially worth billions of $$ per annum. 
The major obstacle to take-up of these projects (all with working prototypes) - is that corporations do not want to be exposed to IP which could potentially cross-over their own research, so they won't entertain discussion under NDA/confidentiality terms.

Anyway - that's the background.
Now try talking to social service organisations.  They all say that I don't fall into their scope for support!  

Why not get a simpler job at McDonalds or stacking shelves?  Because my now-significant disabilities would have me out within a week for low productivity, dizziness, or OH&amp;S risk to others.

Less than two meals a day (I feed the family first), can't get out as I can't afford fuel or travel fares.  Prescription medication sometimes gets dropped to sustain the meal budget.

The other suggestion is to participate in public social gatherings. Same problem money/fares/fuel.

So if you want to talk to a technical strategist that understands technology very well, and can adapt as fast as new platforms come along.  I'm not an app developer - I'm a systems design engineer.",['nsubjpass'],0

this will be a long one, but i'll try to be succinct.

i am 18 years old, female, and i have been experiencing panic attacks 5/7 days a week for the past month and a half. i had my first panic attack when i was about 12 and have had short bursts of panic since then.

i have diagnosed depression and anxiety, and could also possibly be bipolar II because i have had hypomanic episodes before and have a very very strong family history in its favour.

i am a strong and resillient person and i have pushed my way through this as best i could but some days i really collapse and can't handle it. i'm trying to finish up my first year of university here, and am working part time and i'm bending under all the weight of this. there have been many times where i've been on the edge and i've been thinking suicide is a good option, but i love my friends and family too much. i want to get better.

some triggers for my attacks are being in a place i can't leave, thinking about throwing up, performance (had an attack on stage last night), and meta-anxiety: worrying about my anxiety long term.

i think i might have low self esteem because i had a very very awful childhood, i was neglected and left alone all the time. i know that self esteem ties intimately in to anxiety issues.

i've been to my doctor about this but the only thing she has to offer me is a medication that i have a long history with. i was on 100mg of seroquel for two whole years in high school after going into the hospital for depression. i don't know why they gave me seroquel for depression, but it helped with the sleeping issues and it agreed with me pretty well. i guess it turned me into a complacent zombie who kept filling the prescriptions they gave me. last june, however, i successfully got off it and didn't take it again until january.

in january i went to my doctor to describe a hypomanic episode during which i stayed up really late and got a lot accomplished. apparently that calls to be medicated and i was okay with it because i like it for sleeping. i soon got off it for the same reasons as before.

i don't want to be on seroquel at all because it has the possible side effect of tardive dyskinesia. if you're not familiar with this, it's uncontrollable facial twitching/grimacing. i would kill myself if i came down with this. the chances increase with the time you're taking it for. i don't want to risk that!

anyways, she convinced me to take it again when i went in about 3 weeks ago for this problem. i was really reluctant but she kept saying just trust me, take the seroquel. so whatever, i did. i felt a bit better once it got into my system, i guess stable is the word. the panic attacks subsided a bit but still stayed around. then i had a panic attack where my eye wouldn't stop twitching so i started thinking it could be a sign of tardive dyskinesia and got off the seroquel.

it's been four days and i feel shitty but i'm not being given any other options. i feel very alone. i'd like to get a new doctor but that can't be done immediately.

i guess what i'm asking for is some support: anyone been through anything similar? what should i do? what are some non-prescription options to help myself? (diet, exercise, CBT exercises, whatever techniques you like)

to whoever read through my story, and to whoever replies, thanks very much. 

tl;dr: have panic attacks. doctor pushing seroquel for anxiety. do not want, what do?",['attr'],0

A year later it was thinking some of my moles were cancerous. 
Same thing as before.

Anyways, during these times I became very anxious, but a part of me was happier than before to just be alive. I would think I was dying, so I would be walking to class and would be amazed that people were getting worried about classes, homework, relationships, etc, because after all, they weren't dying!!! 

...

I was very appreciative of what I had in life, and I can remember so many times when I would try to bargain with God to just let me live and I'd be satisfied with any life I had - any life at all. After all, everything was beautiful, amazing, and pure.

It wasn't until I got my anxiety under control with therapy and medication (of which I'm now off) that I lost that happy feeling. It rarely happens anymore. Even when great things happen, I just think ""Well, yeah. Of course I got an A. Did you see how much I studied? Why should I be happy?""

I experienced minor ""brain shocks"" during the tapering which was expected, but for the last 72 hours I have had such horrendous symptoms that I am second guessing if I can do this. 

I have brain zaps so severe that they radiate through my body literally every several seconds. I am extremely dizzy/nauseous and I cannot focus my eyes on things for very long. I almost feel like I am in a dream-like state. Yesterday I pushed myself through work and came home and just sobbed on the couch. Today I made it half-way through work and had to leave early because I couldn't focus. 

I know that withdrawal symptoms are expected, but this is horrible. Does anyone here have any experience with supplements or anything to help me through this?

Tonight was the night of a huge party at my university. Me and my best friends had it all planned out for weeks. We all met at a friend's apartment to start things off with some other people.
And of course, as things were going well for everybody, anxiety had to kick in. You guys probably now how insidious it is, and how fast it goes from ""I don't feel so good"" to ""Oh non, I'm having a panic attack"". 
I never cured myself nor followed any treatment so I don't have anything to fight it back but my will power and some homeopathic pills, which don't do much when the attack is strong.

So there I was, sick as hell, when everybody around me was getting drunk and having fun. Eventually I had to go home, before even entering the actual party. I explained to my closest friend why I was leaving, and while they know about my situation and were very supportive tonight, I couldn't help but feel shame and distress. I feel like a fool, because I couldn't do anything. I gave up and fled home for everybody to see. I really feel like shit and hate myself for not seeking help or effective medicines.

I'm a fifteen-year-old girl in Texas with divorced parents. I had suffered from differing ""forms"" of anxiety for years, but nothing like my attack in late December. From as far back as I can remember, I would become anxious in social and other unexpected situations and would be hit with a crippling, overwhelming feeling of nausea. I've always had emetophobia, as well.

Before my first anxiety attack hit, I was having small signs of an anxiety attack coming on. At the time, I didn't know what an anxiety attack was, so I wasn't sure what was happening to me. It was almost like the ""calm before the storm""; I would sit in my bed and stare at the ceiling when I went to bed, trying to tackle what was going on in my head. It wasn't a definite feeling of ""oh god I'm going to die here"", but more of a ""something is very wrong and I'm not sure what it is"".

On Christmas Day, my stepmother was going to have her family over for Christmas dinner, so we couldn't open our presents right away on morning. My brother and I waited very impatiently until everyone arrived before we could start tearing through our gifts.

We unwrapped our gifts once all of her family had arrived. After all unwrapping and cleaning was said and done, we all migrated to our dining room and loaded our plates with food. I've always been a very picky eater, so I had the bare minimum on my plate: turkey, bread, and pasta. I picked my way around my food and was about halfway through before everyone became very talkative again. I overheard my stepgrandmother (that's probably not a term but it works) mention the pasta had crab in it (which I hadn't noticed), and all my previous feelings of doom slammed into me.

I developed claustrophobia in seconds and left the table after a couple minutes of enduring it. I had never eaten crab before and suddenly felt like I was choking (which, of course, I hadn't been). I sat down on my living room couch next to my stuffed sheep doll and cradled it, suddenly fearing for my life.
My various viewings of Mrs. Doubtfire had obviously not taught me enough about food allergies. I would've had an immediate reaction to the crab if I did, in fact, have a food allergy. Somehow, the thought failed to cross my mind.

Sitting on the couch, I started to cry like mad. Around the same time, my dad got something lodged in his throat and dismissed himself to the bathroom to clear it out, creating a small scene in the process. He was alright after a few minutes of hacking into a sink.

After dinner, the family hung around for a few more hours before we discovered that my dad (who was and still is a pilot) was being called in for work the following morning. I wasn't very close with my dad so I didn't mind, but the rest of the family was upset to hear he wouldn't be with us on New Year's. 

I had managed to compose myself, distracted in the mess of conversation around me and terrified of crying in front of family. My stepmother was very upset with my behavior and made sure to tell me so, instructing me to pull myself together when she saw me crying on the couch before I was able to manage doing so myself.
Once everyone had left, it was getting really late and I was still shaking like crazy. I retreated to my upstairs bedroom with my sheep doll (which quickly became my comfort item) and sobbed, confused and terrified about what could be happening to me. I was able to fall asleep after exhausting myself.

My dad left around 5am the morning after, so I was left with my stepmother. I realized after texting my mom about the situation that I was having an anxiety attack. She tried to console me through text messages, but it wasn't very successful. I would have returned to my mom's house, but she was with her side of the family for Christmas and wouldn't be back for another five days.

Throughout the week, I couldn't bring myself to move from the living room couch. I didn't want to leave the middle of the house, knowing people would be coming in and out so they would know if anything was wrong with me. I suffered from heart palpitations in the mornings, and I couldn't bring myself to eat a thing. I would burst into tears spontaneously, completely out of the blue. Later on, my hands and feet would start to feel numb. I had sensations of choking and breathlessness. 

Before the anxiety attacks started. I weighed around 96 pounds due to metabolism. I am 5'3"", so it was relatively normal. I had never had an eating disorder. 

I couldn't bring myself to eat anymore. I lost ten pounds, which was devastating to me and my health, of course. My hip bones were grotesquely protruding, and I could see my ribs more clearly than before.

When the anxiety attacks started, my stepmother was very supportive once I told her what was going on. It was strange to me, somehow. She was actually bipolar, which I was unaware of. 

All was fine with my stepmother in terms of her watching me until she started to become hostile on the fourth day I was suffering through it all. She would yell at me, asking what was wrong and if I was doing it all for attention. Eventually, she started to become more furious about the fact that I hadn't left the house in days, so she ushered me outside. She had told me that we would be gone for an hour at a supermarket, but she had lied completely. We ended up driving for an hour and a half to her mother's house to help her move furniture into her new house. I toughed through moving things, but I could feel myself slipping back into my previous state on the drive to eat lunch. 

We ate at a small family-owned Mexican restaurant. I couldn't eat anything I ordered. Initially, I had planned on only ordering a drink and not eating at all, but my stepmother forced me into ordering some food, so I complied. After we ordered, I broke down again and tried covering my face, but I couldn't help myself much. I knew I wouldn't be removed from the situation I was in unless I stood up and did so, and I knew that wasn't going to happen. 

My stepmom and stepgrandmother (I'm not sure that's even a term but I'm gonna go with it) were infuriated with me. My stepmom started shaking my arm and almost yelling, which attracted the attention of the few people in the diner. My poor brother, two years younger than me, was enduring it with me, though he was not exactly on the receiving end. I could tell he was extremely embarrassed, and I started to feel incredibly guilty. Even my stepgrandmother was berating me about it, and it only made me more upset.

After we were back in our car and driving home, my stepmom wouldn't talk to me. Even when we were home, she refused to help me through it, which only worsened the problem.

It had quite literally turned into a straight week of anxiety attacks.

The following day, both my mom and dad were returning from their trips, and I desperately wanted to see my mom again. After texting my dad and my mom about it, my mom was fine with it. My dad was not. 

He demanded at first that I stay another day, but when he got home, I protested until he gave in. He got home, changed clothes, and settled in. He wasn't comfortable for long; my stepmom dragged him into the kitchen, ranting to him about how ""ungrateful"" I had been the entire week. While she was doing this, I was texting my girlfriend Sam about everything that was going on. When my dad and stepmom were done talking, she came in and took my phone. Immediately, I knew deep down that the next few hours would not go down well.

My dad and I retreated to the master bedroom and talked privately about the situation. He didn't really understand anxiety, nor did he seem willing to try and understand, but he tried to comfort me the best he could. I calmed down considerably, but I was huffing and sniffling all through the talk. 

I stayed in the room and watched television for an hour or so, knowing I couldn't face my stepmom. My dad reassured me she wasn't doing anything on my phone. I stopped watching television and returned to the living room, and, surprisingly, everything felt unchanged, as if it were a normal day.

I retrieved my phone. I didn't have a passcode on my phone at the time because they were a nuisance to me and I didn't have much of anything to hide, but turning my phone on, I felt uneasy. 

I had every right to; immediately, my message history with Sam popped up, revealing a conversation between my girlfriend and my stepmother that had taken place through my phone. At one point, she had called Sam, who was trying to keep from crying as my stepmom was talking to her and putting me down over their phone call.

I ran upstairs, already in tears again. I texted my girlfriend about how sorry I was before calling her. She sounded okay but told me what she and my stepmother had talked about. It was mostly topics I had expected from her, but for some reason my stepmother had told my girlfriend about how she thought I was ungrateful for everything she'd done for me in our house. My girlfriend talked her out of that idea.

It would take my mom two hours to get from the airport to her house to my dad's house to pick me up once she landed at the airport. Through those two hours, I called her a total of eighteen times. I was desperate.
When she arrived, I was sitting on the porch with my dad. My eyes were puffy and red, but I waved to her eagerly, still extremely anxious even when she was right in front of me. 

Once I was in the car, I broke down again. My mom sped home. After calling our family doctor, she told us it was okay for me to take Xanax, so my mom gave me one pill to take. It calmed me down considerably. 

I sat with my mom in her room for the duration of the evening. We watched a few episodes of Friends and some movies. 

By the time I had finished watching two movies, I was exhausted. My mom asked me if I wanted to have my friend, Sam, over to help me through it (my girlfriend and best friend are both named Sam, but I'll just refer to her as my friend). I invited her over and learned she also had an anxiety disorder that I'd never known about. She stuck with me for the following week and even ran back and forth from her house to mine when I was indecisive on letting her leave my home and letting her stay to talk.

One night, I got terrible heartburn after managing to eat my first full meal. My friend was with me. It got so bad that I ended up letting my mom take me to the ER. They took chest x-rays as a precaution and told me nothing was wrong. I had been thinking something was wrong in my lungs or throat, so hearing that was a great relief. 

I got much better after that day and was able to eat much more. My friend was still walking me through everything. By Sunday, I was doing much better and was prepared to face school. She returned home and I went to school the next day feeling like myself again. 

One night, I noticed my dad had emailed my mom with a message titled with my name. When my mom went out to smoke, I snuck onto the computer and read through the email. I copypasted the contents and sent it to myself, where I saved the email on my personal computer and evaluated everything in the email onto a Tumblr text post (that, by now, is deep in my January archives). In the email, my dad called me socially inept because I was ""gay"" and called me an embarrassment. It didn't affect me much, personally; I had never really liked him, and that only furthered my dislike of my dad. 

After a few weeks back at school, my anxiety came back. I started to think my appendix had ruptured at random times in the day. It was an awful feeling, and I kept asking my mom to take me out of school. She resisted, telling me it was just another anxiety attack. Hearing this, I would try to convince myself I was alright. It was tough, but I made it through each day. 

I am relieved to be feeling much better now, though. I am trying to push forward and get myself through this. I've regained much of my weight back, and I've been able to focus better in school. 

As of today, I haven't seen my stepmother since Christmas. It is relieving, somehow. I've seen my dad twice since then, but I haven't been to his house. I hadn't come out of the closet to my dad myself, but both times I saw him after Christmas, I brought up my girlfriend with little to no reaction from him. I assumed my stepmother had outed me by then. 

I'm taking 75mg of Zoloft right now. It has helped somewhat, but I'm starting to think I either need a higher dose or a different medicine. Changing my prescription might help. I'm very lucky to have insurance right now. 

Now, it's just a matter of getting a little better each day.

I'm new to reddit (joined 5 mins ago) so excuse me if I do anything incorrectly. 


TL/DR: VS after head injury, please advice of experience, deterioration, medicine, cures, etc. 


What happened:
23/04/15 I was walking to the train station, crossing at a pedestrian crossing I was involved in a pedestrian v car accident at 60 kmph. The car hit me on my right side impact about thigh height, side of head hit windshield, then I went air born spun twice in the air then the back of my head hot the concrete. 


I was conscious the entire time, gushing blood as pieces of glass were imbedded in my head. At the emergency room post mri they also found fractures (C3/C4, C5/C6) in the spine near the neck. By all accounts I should be dead, such fractures so high isn't even compatible with breathing (quadriplegia is hopeful). 


Somehow I survived, fractures have healed and I can move fine, though slightly limited movement in my neck in the horizontal plane and more so in the vertical plane. 


I've seen neurologist and macula specialist, neither of which pointed me to VS. I suspect however this is what I have given my first explanation to the optometrist was like watching an old analogue TV with slightly bad reception (static) and also dark blotches in image (likely after images). 


My question is whether there is treatment, is there anything I can do to improve, does it deteriorate, medication? Etc.

The only downside is that my diazepam doesn't work in conjunction with the stimulant. So even though I have way fewer panic attacks, when I do get them there is nothing I can do (and I don't want to take multiple doses at once). My doctor completely ignored this concern, talk about a recipe for prescription abuse.

So I get home and I get a call from the doctors office that they want me to do an ECG to see if the stimulant is affecting my heart...queue instant panic attack. Even though I've dealt with anxiety most of my life, I am literally paralyzed in fear right now.

It's not the results I'm worried about, it's the actual process. After my first 100 panic attacks, I started to welcome a heart attack just for a change of pace.

Not only do I have problems with being touched by strangers, but since I'm a fat hairy dude they'll have to shave me too. I also have newer scars on my arms from my severe reactions from trying different antidepressants (I was the &lt;0.1% for side effects) a few months back that I am extremely self-conscious about because they are still bright red. 

I'll have to sit there like a half shaved, scarred up, hairy Jabba the Hut with electrodes all over me while expecting to remain calm for a proper reading.

The cherry on top is that I can only have the Adderall in my system, nothing for anxiety/stress relief. I'm having panic attacks just thinking about it. There is no way the results are even going to be anywhere close to useful, talk about an exercise in futility... complete waste of time.

[UPDATE]: I figured out how to edit/update my post via my phone.  I was at the hospital for 7 hours (mostly waiting) and I ended up being prescribed to Xanax for a month. It helped me sleep last night (first time without taking a sleeping pill and/or drinking). But I woke up this morning and am feeling anxious again. I took another Xanax today when I woke up, but waiting for it to kick in. I feel a constant under layer of anxiety and near breakdown. Now my roommate is gone too and I feel lonely (I don't have many new friends in the city I'm in and my family is 4 hours away).

[UPDATE 2]: I'm feeling a tiny bit more relaxed after trying to go for a run. I was given a number to call and try to make an appointment (which I'll have to wait until Monday for). I don't have insurance or a primary care physician, so it makes it hard to try and get consistent help and daily medication that will help besides Xanax.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF HOW I FEEL BEFORE AND DURING MY WORST ANXIETY ATTACKS: 
1. It usually starts with a jolt through my body, I tense up and try and fight off the flight or fight feelings.
2. My mind starts racing. I can't stop thinking about how I can't stop thinking. My stomach begins to hurt and I am constantly running my hand over my head and grabbing the back of my neck or the arm of a chair or anything.
3. I completely lose control. I run through all the worst case scenarios: I end up in an insane asylum, I get stuck in my head forever, Iose control of my body and feel disconnected (which happens really sometimes), i kill myself, I lose my job, I have no where to go. I will go to everyone that could possibly help me but the way I am can't be helped. I snap and hurt myself or someone else. These terrible things run through my mind and I feel destined to really go crazy. But not the good kind where you're just out of it, the kind where you're stuck in your mind and just want to be normal and live your life. I can't sit still and nothing makes me feel better.

I know I've left some stuff out and haven't been as organized as I intended with the bullets. But you know how it is with anxiety... Also, my friend thinks I may have borderline personality disorder too. Does anyone know if there is a connection between anxiety and depression and that?

I got over the skeletomuscular pain yet I still feel anxiety, it's starting to affect my sleep and I hate every waking moment. I feel so much better when I'm sleeping but even then it's difficult because I wake up with my heart racing( have had a few ekg's done and doc also a cardiologist said everything looked fine) but it still worries the hell out of me. I feel constantly depressed because I miss my family but that's complex because I grew up with an abusive father (who suddenly changed from an alcoholic to a holy man) and a complying mother (but goddammit I love her) and I find it extremely difficult to talk to them because they have a deep belief in God and I used to be atheist now theist but starting to think I only did it for them, to satisfy them. I used to stronger than this, emotionally independent and could say fuck that about anything I didn't like or want in my life but with my parents starting to age it's taken a toll on my mentality. My mother has been unemployed for quite some time (upwards of half a year) and I really wish I could help her but I'm knees deep in loans for school that I'm not even sure I'll complete anymore though I'm trying I just feel stupid sometimes.  I wish I could just take my parents pain and suffering away from them and give them all the happiness they deserve. I also have siblings ( an older sister of 26 and a younger one of 8) who I deeply love and miss badly (omg I'm on the verge of crying as I type this but I panic that if I do I'll starting having my panic attacks again). Tried seeing a therapist from school who can only pen me in twice a month which really sucks because I have no friends where I live(SF and all my close friends and family are in LA), not to mention I have practically no family only immediate family members because the rest of them on my moms end are drunkard selfish bums who don't even love themselves and on my dads end religious nuts who criticize you and judge every waking moment of your life as soon as you look away. But even that's difficult because my grandpa on my dads side was recently diagnosed with stomach cancer and can't be operated on because of ulcers and ultra sensitive arteries that will explode if they operate to remove the tumor, and that makes it more difficult for me to talk to my dad because I want to badly but I feel so resentful towards him for my childhood and I don't know how to let it go. The last time I went to the therapist I ended up calling my mom and exploding on her for defending him and I ended up sobbing and crying to her my friends and my sister about how bad I felt about making my mother cry about her beliefs. She recently got over her anxiety and depression which makes me feel even shittier about it. I also feel terribly bad for her because my grandma is now blind and bound to her home with no other children who care enough about her to visit or even call other than my mother and that takes its toll too. I don't know anything anymore I really hate life and despise others who seem to have it so much easier yet I admire those who work so hard for it. Ive tried breathing exercises for my anxiety but they never work for me, the only thing that seems to soothe me is the company of another human being. This is getting incredibly difficult and I'm sorry for the wall of text but how do you cope?!?! My doctor gave me anxiety meds(avitan) that I haven't taken in two days because I don't want to destroy my liver and i don't want to be dependent of any substance but it's getting hard to not use it when the anxiety is getting overwhelming. I've ordered a book someone recommended from my last post about nerves and anxiety and am awaiting its arrival, hope everyone else is doing a lot better than I am at this moment and thank you for all the responses. 
P.s. Not every day feels like this some days are alright like the past two days but once I start feeling the weirdness in my chest or heart whatever it is the anxiety settles in and I start to panic badly And think horrible thoughts that I don't want to think. ",['meta'],0

first some quick facts:

* Used to be very social. Loved doing presentations, embraced challenges and followed opportunities.
* anxiety started 3 years ago at a party where I had to throw up (no alcohol) and stayed in the bathroom. (presumably that day it was actual exhaustion). After that I got anxious in many social situations.
* 1-5 times a week I get anxious and mostly nauseous until I throw up.
* as a strategy I started to throwing up before doing anything to calm down and make sure my stomach is empty.
* Threw up multiple times in public. I accepted this fate and don't think about it much.
* 4 months ago I had diarrhoea while on my way home. I was panicking and shit my pants - luckily only 200m away from my apartment. Since then I have an even bigger fear about that.
* Started Therapy ~2-3 months ago. No medication. Still in the beginning, we are just talking

In about two weeks I have to do a 45min presentation followed by a discussion at university. I used to love doing that but now I'm so anxious about it. I know already how horrible that day will be.

Also in about a month I have 3 oral exams coming up. Which will be similar awful.  

But my biggest problem is this. I qualified in an online tournament for the finale which will be a 3 days event. We will have team-building activities, dinners, 2 day conference and competition, presenting solutions on a stage and possible public introduction on a stage.

I'm so terrified of it and I think about not attending. But if I would not go, then I gave up and I would be really disappointed about myself for not taking this great opportunity (old me would have been so excited). But I'm so scared of all those little activities with new people in places I haven't been before.

As I said, I got used to vomiting. And it isn't that bad. Usually you can go behind a corner or whatever and I have a plastic bag to make no mess. But I'm now much more scared of having to go onto the toilet or shitting my pants. The problem is that, when I get anxious and nauseous, my stomach and intestines seem to react to it and just rush out what's in there. I usually always get a little diarrhoea and the constant feeling that I have to poop.

Does anybody have any tips how I can survive this? Should I maybe not attend the big event because at the moment it seems too overwhelming and I should do smaller steps first?

I take online classes at my local university, I'm a sophomore. I took one ""real"" class my first year and had a panic attack within minutes of stepping into the room, it had 125+ students and I don't do well in situations with a lot of strangers. Needless to say, I switched right over to online classes. After my first year, I moved away from the city (but I was still 'attending' college via online classes) and moved in with my dad and his family in the country (I live in AL). I moved away because I was the victim of sexual abuse in the city and I didn't feel comfortable there anymore.


Moving along a year, I'm in therapy and it's going good. I've been physically assaulted twice in the last year, different guys and different situations, but I think I'm handling it well. I'm on antidepressants, anxiety meds, the works. I also work part time. I still have moments (a few times a week, at least) where I have a panic attack out of nowhere- it's like it's ingrained into my head that I'm a messed up kid with a messed up life, cue the panic attack. 


Here comes the part where I need advice: my brother (who is 21 and very very protective over me) asked if I wanted to move back to the city and be roommates with him and his two friends (who I've known pretty much all my life) at these apartments off campus. We all go to the same college, I'm just the one taking online classes. This is probably the part that I should mention that I have a fear of guys in general (because of the sexual abuse/assaults) so I don't even know if I could be roomies with two guys I've known all my life.


I have a week to sign the lease with them, to make up my mind. 


On one hand, I want to stay in my private own little world where nothing can hurt me and nobody can hurt me and I can just go on being an anxious depressed piece of shit.


On the other hand, I've never experienced the 'college life'. Should I put myself out there? I'm pretty much in the middle of a break down right now thinking about it. I mean, I wish I were normal, you know? I wish that I could just sign the lease and experience college and actually GO TO class. Maybe this is the push I need to get out of my little world I've created over the last year and experience life.


Any advice would be helpful.


Basically what I'm asking is: should I stay in my shell of a life, taking online classes?


Or should I sign the lease with my brother and his friends and try to overcome my anxiety about college and experience life?",['conj'],0

Well Paxil was great at first.... Then everything went to shit. I know I can't blame my medicine because everything was my choice but I ended up skipping more than 50% of my college classes and eventually dropping out and quitting my good job on a whim one day not caring about bills. I then tried to get off the medicine, I was at 30g and I stopped cold turkey...worst 2 weeks of my life. I then refilled my script and got off the right way, still a bad experience. 

I first started going for help with my adhd problems, she gave me medicine for my anxiety( my anxiety can be pretty bad) but i wasn't really wanting to fix that because I could live with it and I learned to cope with some things. I wanted help to do better in school and with life in general not do worse... Should I consider talking to my doctor about a new medicine? I would really like to try out an adhd medicine or something at least then I could see if it would help, or is there medicine that helps both? 

I want to add I don't have anxiety attacks, my anxiety I believe is at the high side of mild. I don't freak out a lot, but when I am around people I can not say a word. I can't even think about what to say, nothing pops in my mind at all to add to conversation.",['attr'],0

He had a heart attack that the hospital did not catch and the heart went damaged for a few days before they realized there was a problem. They had to go back in and do a bypass. He is now forever in heart failure and has a pacemaker in case his heart decides to give up. He is 17 today.

A year after the operation, he began experiencing pain in his stomach which would eventually become vomiting. He does not stop vomiting, at all. It is constant. He usually has to go to the hospital in which they do something to calm his body down and they restore his fluids. He looks like a walking dead zombie when he has these episodes.

I am only his brother, so I do not know everything, but after a long time they have ruled this as being a form of anxiety and an eating issue. Stress, excitement, etc trigger him and he begins to be in pain and vomit. In addition to this, things he eats also trigger it. There is a special list of things he needs to avoid consumption of and it is quite broad.

He is prescribed heart medications combined with Ativan and Zofran to combat his ""episodes."" He only takes these when a problem arises, and sometimes refuses and tries to fight it off.

Not only does this concern me, but what he does to personally fight it concerns me too. It is only until now that I and my parents have realized he goes into the shower and turns it on as hot as possible and lets it hit his back. He does not take his shirt off because of his scars, so he does not ever get sunburn on his back. His back the other day was completely red. As in, he had not been in the shower or burned by the sun. Our fear is he is burning his back with the shower and that it distracts him from the pain in his stomach, or the stress in his head.

The only path we have for helping him right now is sending him off to this rehabilitation place where we would not see him for something like a month. This would both be mentally exhausting for my parents and definitely fought by my brother.

Does anyone know someone who has experienced something even remotely similar? Do you guys have vomiting episodes? What did you do? Any help is extremely useful. I just want to see him live the normal life he has not had.",['attr'],0

There's been a lot of good go on with my GAD treatment. I had a meds change (I am now on Zoloft) and so far so good. I am just about done a five month DBT* lite program that has given me some great skills to help me control my emotions. My anxiety has been kept in check for a few months now, despite lingering financial difficulties. Most important, after being rejected in the absolute worst way possible, have a new boyfriend and its been just over a month since we met. 

(*Sorry, I can't format on my mobile. For anyone who doesn't know what this is: http://psychcentral.com/lib/an-overview-of-dialectical-behavior-therapy/0001096)

Tonight, however, I am feeling extremely mixed and troubles about a series of events that took place and I don't know where to place my energy. 

My boyfriend came over tonight and at age 28, I had intercourse for the first time. Why I took so long was because I truly was waiting for the right time and the right person; and even though I don't know where this relationship will head, I felt at peace with the decision to have sex with him, which was above all else important. At least when I am at peace with the step, if it goes down hill, I won't feel guilty for making the wrong decision. 

When we were done, we went for a swim in the pool on the top floor of my building; but we had to leave abruptly because the guy who rejected me prior to my boyfriend came in with the girl he rejected me for. It wouldn't have been so bad, but before they started in on their relationship, I confided in her about my attraction to him and my fears of getting myself into a state of anxiety that would scare him and everyone else in my circle away. By butting in, the anxiety was allowed to break though and take over. The depression got so bad in the year since it happened, I was sent to the hospital at least four times for having suicidal thoughts. My friends couldn't stand the outbursts and, although I understand suicide can be a very scary thought for those who care, they completely dropped their support from me when they couldn't handle it anymore.

Seeing my ""friend"" come into the pool while I was trying to have a peaceful moment with my new boyfriend could have really sent me into a tailspin, but I didn't let it. I just told him it was time to get out, we had to leave. When we got back to my apartment, we had a brief discussion on the matter and I explained how the whole thing and really ruined just about every relationship I had in the city. The thing is, I was very calm about it and internalised his advise for moving on and finding new friends. You know, wise mind at its fullest and for the first time with exact same advice everyone gives me. And it was reinforced minutes later when he told me he wanted to get me off again. Not himself, just me and he did. 

But now I am sitting here. Its super hot so I can't sleep properly and all that's going though my mind is how badly I am missing my friends. I want them to meet the new guy in my life and share in my achievements. But they don't trust that I can put a smile on my face anymore. 

Most importantly, all I want to just think of my new man in my life and how wonderful he makes me feel. He truly wants me to feel pleasure in bed far more than he does; and he just makes me feel so wanted for all the flaws. But I can't get the images of my friends out of my head. I fear that I won't be able to focus on him and my longing for reconciliation with my friends will disrupt everything. 

I go to my DBT group tomorrow, but I can't talk about things this specific (and there's certainly no way I can bring up the sex) and I just can't make sense of the feelings I am having. I can't describe them, I can't place them and I don't have the support I need outside of my treatment to talk about them straight and honest. 

If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate it. I really don't want my relationship to go sour before its too late to fix it.",['compound'],0

Write it down.

Recently I've been keeping a log of my anxiety. I have pages printed out that have columns separating different things. The first column is titles **""Situation""** and reads: ""Who? What? When? Where?"" 

Under that I normally write the date, the time, what was going on, and where I was. This helps you distinguish if there could be a pattern with the time of day, where you were, or anything of the sort. 

The second is titled, **""Anxiety Level""** and reads: ""What did you feel? Rate 1-10 with 10 being the worst.""

Under this I write what I was feeling, whether it be a symptom or an emotion, anything at all, and then I rate it. This helps you keep track of what you were feeling, common triggers perhaps, and how bad they were.

The third is titled, **""Automatic thoughts""** and reads: ""What was going through your mind JUST BEFORE you started to feel this way?""

Under this I write what was going through my mind just before I got my anxiety. As my panic set in, what thoughts were going through my head? This is important because you can start to find out what thoughts and feelings are giving you the anxiety. Were you thinking about a certain way you were feeling? Were you worried about the situation you were in, or something in the future?

The last and final column is titled, **""What did I do to calm down?""**

This could be the most important column, because we all want to get better, right? You might not fill this out at the same time you're filling in the other ones. I find that I'll usually fill in the first three as I am having anxiety, and come back later after it's gone to fill in what I did to calm myself. You may even already know what you do to calm yourself, but seeing it written down can show you a pattern, and you can find what most commonly calmed you.


I know this information may be painfully obvious to some, and this may not even be read by anyone, but I wanted to type it up and put it out there on the off chance it helps anyone, just by the slightest bit, now, or in the future. 

You obviously don't have to follow my chart, you can make your own, add your own titles, try to find other patterns, or scrap the whole chart and just keep a diary. 

I don't find this to be a solution for anxiety personally, but it does help me, even in the slightest bit, which I find to be completely worth it to do. If you're able to even discuss your findings with someone, whether it be a trusted friend or family member, or a therapist, it could be useful information!

So to anyone who read this, thanks, and I wish you the best of luck with your anxiety. It's tough, but **you WILL get through it.**

Keep your head up.

My preference is to ride my bike, but I do have access to a pair of dumb bells with adjustable weights (50 lb max / dumb bell IIRC). 

* Does anyone have any links to studies that explain chemical occurrences in the brain that are linked to anxiety? I'm tired so I'll rephrase that: I'd like to know if anxiety is purely psychological or not. I know that there are chemical imbalances associated with depression, but I'm not sure about anxiety. 

Basically, I feel like I'm coping with an imaginary cage that I feel like I've put myself in. Again, I'm pretty tired so please bear with me. 

I know that the common advice for anxiety is therapy and medication, but I'm far too anxious for the former and strongly dislike the latter. 

At this point I'm looking for the most effective exercises for treatment of social anxiety so I can move on to more ""potent"" social anxiety treatments. 

I'm just sick of being anxious all of the time.

I have mail that is many months old that I can't bring myself to open. I have literally zero debt. Not even a dollar. I go without food for up to 4 days some times because I don't want a cashier or fast-food employee to even see me or socialize with me. Even going outside sometimes when a stranger might happen to glance my way bothers me to the point I will not go out. I am not agoraphobic. I love being alone in the wide open outdoors etc. When I absolutely NEED to leave the house I have to psych myself up and fortify with some sort of mind altering substance. Nothing exotic. Usually just opiate pain medication. I don't have obsessive compulsive disorder but I feel I have like a purely obsessive disorder. I go over everything in my head days before it will happen. Not like precognition obviously but like obsessing over the details of every possible situation that might arise when I do leave the house to do something. I can also socialize normally for up to 30 minutes or so before I need to make an excuse to leave. I can fake it really well. I know there is something wrong though because normal people do not have to go through what I go through just to get groceries for example. So if anybody read this...how crazy am I?,['ROOT'],0

Whenever I have a change to my schedule like this, I get really anxiuos. But it doesn't sound like a panic attack, so I dunno.

I got 40mg Propranolol in January (taken as and when needed, up to 3 times a day) to help me with exam stress or other stressful events, which has worked up until now, but now it is doing nothing at all. I think this is because in the past, my panic was triggered off when I woke up with a racing heart. Now the Propranolol stops the racing heart, but I think my body has learned to adjust and gets triggered off regardless. Anyway, I don't have a short lived panic attack. Instead, for anywhere from 12 hours to 2 days before the event I'm worried about, I'll feel sick, dizzy, weak, tingling in my arm and fingers. Mainly I'm scared of feeling sick, because it seems no matter what I do my body defaults to feeling awful and sick, and being sick only alleviates it briefly. When I went to my Dr, she said that panic attacks won't actually make you sick...but I can and will be sick. Multiple times lol.

Is this a panic attack? The Dr made it sound like it would only be a temporary thing that lasted less than an hour, but mine can go on for days. I also struggle to sleep, and wake up with my head swirling, imagination out of control. Is it worth seeking councelling or new meds? It only seems to be getting worse.

It's made another resurgence in my life and it's gotten to the point where I'm missing a lot of school and I can barely go out at all.

It seems like the root of it is my fear of public vomiting, or just being ill in public in general. I'm afraid of being around people because I can't shake the thought of making a scene if I was sick. I'm also a bit of a hypochondriac. Maybe I'll get a bit of chest or arm pain, and obviously I'm having a heart attack. Both of these fears have led to a number of what I can only describe as panic attacks before.

The thing is, a month or two ago I was inlove with going out with friends and I didn't have any issues with going to school. Then for some reason it all came flooding back, because like I said, this has come and gone my entire life. I'm not quite sure if it's ever been this bad though. I love being social and having fun, but my incapability is getting in the way. The whole thing depresses me.

I'm starting university in a couple months in a completely different city, and getting to classes is going to require a lot of public transportation. These things terrify me right now. I'm going to be going from a 10 minute walk to a highschool I've been going to for years, to a university 5 hours away. I don't know how I'm going to manage surrounding myself with people for 30 minute bus rides, or sitting in lecture halls without having a panic attack.

So here's the problem. I don't know if I'll be able to get over this on my own in time to survive university. I don't know if I should try to get medication/therapy if in a couple months I won't even be living here anymore. I would feel terribly guilty if I committed all of this time and my parents money to something I could've dealt with myself. I'm freaking out and I don't know what to do.

Fun facts:

* I've never had a job because the idea makes me too anxious.

I currently don't have the money for a therapist or anything, and I'm also having issues with my mother, who happens to be the biggest trigger for my anxiety.

I'm finally coming to terms with the fact that I have an anxiety problem, but I've yet to visit a doctor. I've self-diagnosed myself as having social anxiety and hypochondriasis (possibly also GAD?), mostly because a lot of my anxiety revolves around health issues and social situations/human interaction. For example, around noon today I really wanted to walk over to the deli by my apartment to get a sandwich for lunch, but it took me an hour to convince myself to walk over there because I was afraid that the other customers would judge me for ordering lunch-y food so early in the day. Completely silly. I did CBT for awhile for my social anxiety, but I had to stop because my schedule didn't allow for it and I couldn't afford the sessions anymore.

In regards to the hypochondriac part, I've convinced myself that I've had a variety of illnesses ranging from AIDS (saw a documentary about ACT UP and thought the rash on my back at the time was lesions) to breast cancer (thought chest pains/swollen lymphs were tumors) up to the point in which I've spent weeks agonizing over them before going to the doctor. I'd spend hours at work researching symptoms online and scaring myself for no reason whatsoever. Naturally, my GP has found nothing wrong each time. 

I also find that certain general situations overwhelm me. If I have a lot of items on my to do list at work, I tend to shut down and go online instead of actually trying to work through them and get them finished. I've gotten lectured a few times by my highers up about this, and I do my best to avoid it, but sometimes it's just impossible. I also dread interacting with co-workers to the point in which I avoid going to the kitchen on my floor to get water or food for fear of having to talk to someone or wait for someone to finish at the water fountain. The thing is, when I'm around my friends I'm very sociable and outgoing. I don't understand it. 

Anyways, my anxiety has finally led me to horribly screw something up at work. I work in publishing, and as an assistant one of my jobs is to send orders from our customers to the warehouse. From there, various titles we put out are shipped to conferences, etcetera. I received a text from my manager yesterday saying that a customer was at a conference and that none of the books she had put a request for were there. She was extremely angry, which is bad since we have a rough relationship with this person to begin with. I searched my emails, and I couldn't find any record that I'd sent the order out, which leads me to believe that I didn't see the email. This was about a month ago, during what I remember was an extremely busy week, and also around the time that I started noticing what I thought was breast cancer. I was very panicked at the time, and I know that I just forgot to add the email to my list of things to do or something like that. 

This has happened a few times now, and I'm scared that my boss thinks that I don't care about my job or that I'm not invested enough in the work we're doing, which is not true at all. When they approached me in the past about this, I said that I forgot, which is partially true, but I didn't mention the anxiety part. The head of my department is very nice, but not very personable, and my manager is an extremely moody, so I can never really gauge how she's going to react to things, which gives me even more anxiety!

I'm planning on making another trip to my GP this week to discuss how I can better handle this (perhaps medication), but I don't know how to tell my supervisors what happened. Help me, r/anxiety?

**TL;DR: I have serious social anxiety and hypochondriasis, as well as possible GAD, and it's finally caused me to mess up something huge at work. I don't know how to talk to my managers about it tomorrow when I go into the office. Help?**

I've (24f) have been struggling with anxiety my whole life, but in the last two months it was just unbearable. Constant heart palpitations, sweating, shaking, crying - I couldn't deal with it anymore. So I got myself an appointment with a psychologist.  These appointments have been going great, and I'm proud of myself for finally getting the help I need even though most of my family still thinks it's ""all in my head"" which...well yeah, kinda.

Anyway, my biggest problem right now is that I feel like I have no idea what is real in my brain anymore.  I had been smoking marijuana pretty regularly before this bout of anxiety and then quit cold-turkey, which I'm sure didn't help the anxiety at all.  However, my intrusive thoughts are so overwhelming and realistic that I literally don't understand what's going on anymore.

I have a long-term boyfriend who I love very much and just moved in with, and he has been incredible at supporting me thorough the anxiety and doctor visits.  Moving out with him was stressful and crazy, but I am definitely happy and comfortable sharing a home with him.  The thing is, once I quit smoking weed and the anxiety kicked in full force, all I could think about was leaving him. My mind just spirals into negativity about our relationship, about our past, about what bad things could be awaiting us in the future.  I was (and still am) constantly battling my own brain because I don't believe I actually want to leave him at all, but my brain (or the anxiety) makes a very convincing point and it scares the crap out of me.  I just...I don't know which me is the real me anymore and it's driving me crazy.  I hold onto and try to remember how I feel on the days my anxiety has subsided - days where I remember ""oh yeah, I DO love this guy, my brain is just a little off.  there's no reason to leave him! how silly to think that.""  That gives me hope that, with work on anxiety through therapy (and probably meds soon), I will get back to that place of rational thought.

Until then, does anyone else deal with this?  Is my brain trying to tell me something that I'm not willing to accept?  Or are these thoughts wonky and unrealistic?  I dont know what to think anymore.",['advmod'],0

I have had social anxiety my entire life. I'm in high school now, and after being diagnosed with ADHD I was formally diagnosed with social anxiety. I was put on Prozac for a bit, then decided I wanted to stop it just because I felt I didn't want anymore meds in me than I already had (I take Adderall frequently - prescribed ofc). I'm starting therapy soon. 

Anyway, I'm not what you would define as a ""normal"" teenager. I don't enjoy exercise so I just don't do it, including sports (this may be part of the issue). I am absolutely obsessed with coding, design, networking, and basically everything having to do with computers. I don't really have anyone to share this passion with.

At this point, my anxiety is who I am. I get glimpses of the me without anxiety, but it's gone fairly quickly. I can't talk to anyone, even my mom sometimes. Since I've changed schools so much trying to figure out where I belong, I only really have two good friends I can trust with anything, one being my step brother, and the other being my neighbor. I have internal panic attacks every time I consider being around people I don't know. I start shaking even when I play a song for someone fearing they won't like it. When someone is interested in something I'm interested in, like coding, I can't bring myself to talk about it. My voice shakes. I don't know why, but I can't take it anymore. All I want is to be able to walk around school without fear, worrying the way I walk isn't normal, or my hair is messed up, or my shirt doesn't look good, or someone won't like my shoes (every time I get a new pair I get panic attacks when I wear them in). Gym class is torture. Not even that I'm not good at the activities, it's just that I resort to making people think I don't care so I can just not try. If I tried, I'd be afraid I wasn't good enough. 

I need help. I need to know what what the fuck is wrong with me and why I can't just be normal. I just want a normal life. I want to be confident about my appearance. I want someone to love me for who I am, to even be able to show them who I really am behind all these issues.

I have so much on my mind right now that I'm having a difficult time forming consistent thoughts. It seems like the anxiety and stress have been building up on a daily basis for some time now and no one I've talked to in person seems willing to help.

Problem 1: The neighbors. I'd rather not go into details here because they could be on reddit and end up reading this. Let's just say that I'm terrified of them now that they seem to have no problem turning a simple dispute into a physical confrontation. No serious damage occurred, but the fact that they stepped up to the next level absolutely terrifies me. I cannot relax at home, and when I'm at work I regret coming home for fear that I'll see them outside. There's no hope of resolution here. Let's just put it at that.

Problem 2: Work. My employer loves to sell vaporware. They've gotten by doing so for years now. I find it disrespectful to customers and a very shady way of doing business. The only reason they keep doing it is because management always finds someone willing to sacrifice everything to build a product at the last minute. Guess who is the latest sucker responsible for building a product out of thin air with no direction or design? I CANNOT work with this much ambiguity. I understand the mechanisms of the product, but for everything I'm worth, I cannot figure out what the ultimate goal is here. I feel like they deliberately put me on this as some horrible test of my abilities. The lack of a ""finish line"" is driving me insane and they aren't budging in terms of giving me assistance or more clearly defining the requirements...I think because even THEY don't really know. It's really just killing my motivation and contributing to...

Problem 3: Brain fog/depression/burn out. I admit I am contributing to this somewhat on my own since I'm doing a part time grad program while working full time, but if I hadn't been tasked with creating a product out of thin air, things would be quite manageable right now. But still, day to day I just feel so down and out and hopeless. It takes so much effort to roll out of bed in the mornings and the instant I begin waking up, I remember how I am terrified at Problem 1 and I replace depression with body shaking anxiety.

I do have a few things to look forward to, with some caveats:

1. The neighbor issue cannot be resolved. Blame me but I don't want to associate with those types of people or have to drop to their level to sort things out. I got a tiny hint of sunshine when I finally decided this weekend that I am going to move this summer. I have been saving up to move so I am not enduring any hardship in doing so, but in a way I am moving away because of them. My parents tell me that I'll only have more problems at the new house since I shouldn't run away from my problems, and I hate that they say this. It isn't fair because I am forcing myself to change a lot (moving is not a small thing!) so that I can hope for some hint of returning happiness. They aren't even suggesting that I try to resolve the issue with the current neighbors-- they're just saying that I'll always have problems wherever I go. The thought of this makes my heart drop so much and makes me want to cry.

2. The semester is up this week. I have one last final and I'll be free for the summer. This, combined with the previous point, seemed like a great opportunity to begin house hunting, hiring a realtor, and getting my finances in order. Just the thought of this makes me so happy inside. Until today. Remember the vaporware sale that I'm having to make up for? Apparently my horrible performance thus far is good enough to repeat because now my employer is considering putting me on more project work that requires travel. That means I can't be here to do the work to move to a new house. Which then means I'm stuck until the project is done. School starts again in August so I only have a 3 month window to move and my freaking employer had to pick the worst time! I scream inside when I think about this.

I just want to move on from everything and start over, but it feels like the world knows and is deliberately trying to keep me down. When I'm not shaking with anxiety, I'm depressed. I feel like utter crap inside and nobody I talk to is interested enough to hear me out. My parents only see me for whatever value I gain when I finish grad school, my friends/coworkers don't want to help me out because I guess I'm too whiny, and nobody is listening to me at work about this impossible product that I'm supposed to build.

Please tell me there is light at the end of the tunnel. I'm trudging through knee deep muck and it isn't getting any easier!",['appos'],0

It's a nightmare, it's been a nightmare, it still is. But it's not so bad to live with a fogginess for most of your life, that's the only way you know how to live.

I only recently discovered there was a term for it, derealization. I would always try to explain to others 

(It feels like everything is 2D..i see depth, just my mind registers it as 2D..maybe I grew up with computers too much and my brain developed this way?
It's like I'm watching my own life. I feel and control, but I'm also only a spectator.)

It's an almost impossible task to describe to someone who hasn't felt the interior of their minds in such a state what it feels like. 
It's like explaining to a kid the effect of being drunk, they won't get it.


When I was 16, it was the thing to do with highschool, everyone would be at the gym, protein shakes and all that sh!t. After a few months, I honestly felt a big difference, I was eating like a saint, exercising regularly, going to bed properly. At that moment, it confirmed to me, I wasn't crazy. I knew something was wrong with the way I experienced life and this was the proof. My mind could reach that plateau of self-awareness and lucidity per moments, and in those instances I knew.


Now this one will be addressed to most people here saying they got ""Derealization from weed"". I **strongly** disagree.
Like I wrote, I've had derealization since I was a child. When I first started getting into weed (19~20yo), I adored it, in that moment of highness, I could rediscover this feeling of lucidity. Ups &amp; downs of neurological clarity. 
I believe this is what you guys are feeling. Smoking weed made you perceive the difference.


I'm 23yo now, and I'm honestly sobbing at night, hoping this would change. I mention it to my SO but there's nothing she can ever do to help. 

I try to get back into proper routine and exercising, but it's nearly impossible in my condition. Sure, these are just excuses, but in practice I fail.

I only have 2 hopes left, I'm currently trying to achieve my dream career, perhaps this is what I've been stressing about and made me unable to be free mentality since my young age?

The other hope is medication...but I don't know where that could lead.

They were having a discussion about a play we had read in class, specifically on a character who was debated to have some sort of mental illness. This then turned into a discussion solely on mental illness and mental disorders, and how the western world has exploited the term and uses it as a copout to being a contributing member of society. They then decided to just go out and say it: ""Anxiety and depression are both first world problems, and people just seriously need to get over it. They aren't real ailments, so get the hell over yourself.""
Now, they all very well know I struggle with anxiety. They also knew I was in the room. I said nothing throughout the whole discussion, but 10 minutes later, I walked out of the house without saying a word.

Now, I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick and tired of people who have no idea what its like to live with a mental disorder judging others who live with them every single day. NO ONE who struggles with these disorders wants them, so what gives you the right to tell someone to 'get over it'? No. Not okay, and it will never be okay. I struggle with chronic GAD, and have been for a few years, and  none of them know the true extent of how much my anxiety has crippled my ability to preform in school. Its changed my personality, and has recently drawn me away from social situations. There isn't an immediate solution to 'fixing' a disorder that consumes you so fully. It can be so overwhelming, and these people don't get how hard it can be to live with it.

People all over the world deal with anxiety, and although it is proven that western countries have more treated cases, it doesn't give you a right to slap such a negative label on it. its a serious problem in a lot of lives, and needs to be treated delicately, just like you would any ailment.

Nobody wants anxiety, so to those of you who think we do this for attention, you can fuck off.

I'm gonna go cry into my pillow now.

Edit: Wow, I seriously wasn't expecting this many people to reply! Thank you all for your support, advice and words of wisdom. Unfortunately, I know these people will never truly understand where I am coming from, but I now know that there are many of you who get what I'm saying and live with the same disorder I do.

To this day I don't remember what caused it, I was just relaxing playing on my ps3 when all of a sudden I had a panic attack. Scared the shit out of me, and for the next 5 hours or so I kept having panic attacks over and over and over. 
I was freaking out in the bathroom, thinking I was dying or something, and trying to stay calm by watching a movie. 
I had panic attacks before that time, but they were different. They came with negative thoughts. I remember my first ever panic attack, I was 15 and I smoked a lot of weed in my bathroom, and I was just sitting and thinking and then I starting having one. I was scared, but I remembered reading up on panic attacks, and within 3 minutes, I calmed down completely. Anytime I had a panic attack again, it was over within 5 minutes. 
The panic attacks I experienced on october however were very different.. There was no cause. There was nothing bothering me, I was not in a bad mood, I was relaxing, gaming, and it came on and not only confused me, but made me afraid of myself. Afraid I was unable to control myself.
The next day I went to the hospital, they ran heart test and took my blood and all that. Told me I was fine. Followed up with my doctor they ran some test, checked my thyroid ect, he said the same thing, might be anxiety, but to follow up with a cardiologist. They ran a a bunch of test too, told me everything was normal, could just be anxiety.
They offered beta-blockers and some anti-anxiety meds, I said no. I read enough about how those backfire. Not sure if I regret that choice or not though. 
For last 2+ years its been hell.. I've completely changed. Everything makes me nervous, my body is jump as hell. I experience tremors and palpitations constantly. I can feel my heartbeat all the fucking time, and it makes me panic. I'm extremely health conscious, I feel weak most of the time. random pains. ect ect, the list goes on. Everytime I think something is really wrong and rush to the emergency, its nothing. They cant find anything, tell me its anxiety. I'm just tired..

I would be lying if I said I haven't slowly gotten 'better' over time, but whats better when it isn't normal? I dont feel like me.. I'm fighting to stay sane, and just want to feel normal. I shouldnt have to fight to feel normal.

So I'm a 21/F/college student who's dealt with feelings of things being ""unreal"" since I can remember. My therapist thinks it developed from childhood trauma, and I've seen a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with depression/general anxiety/dissociative disorder NOS.

Here are my main symptoms:


--Since I was probably 10 or 11 years old (basically, as long as I can remember) I've felt that I'm trapped in someone else's body constantly. I don't ever have moments of clarity where it's like, oh wait, that isn't true. I'm able to function/have healthy relationships because I bury it most of the time, but I truly do not believe that I'm myself and it makes me feel like I'm crazy. If I look in a mirror too long, I'll panic, because my reflection is a stranger and I am not her and I just need to find a way out. **easily my most severe, distressing symptom**

--wondering if things are real after they happen

--not being able to recall things that happened a few minutes or hours ago...all of my memories feel like they happened months ago

--going through periods where I don't feel any affection toward my parents/SO because they feel like strangers

I DON'T have any of the symptoms that a lot of DP/DR sufferers report, like feeling like I'm watching someone else or my life is a movie or like my body parts are distorted or anything. That's honestly discouraging for me. I've read two books on depersonalization, and the only parts I identify with are the things I've listed above. I feel like I'm going crazy because it doesn't seem like anyone else out there *truly, consistently* believes that they're trapped in someone else's body. Is this psychosis? I honestly don't know.

My psych just switched me from Zoloft (150mg) to Pristiq (50mg) after I explained these symptoms in depth. I also take Klonopin (.5 mg) twice a day. I'm still miserable. I still feel trapped. I still don't recognize myself EVER when I look in a mirror. I'm able to get ready every day by avoiding reflective surfaces and just trying to block my thoughts out.

Has anyone else ever felt like this? Does this even quality as depersonalization? Any meds/tips that have helped you guys? ",['ROOT'],0

Anyway to my problem now, I've recently for the past few months decided to change my life. I moved to a far away and new city for a job, so I feel like an active part of society again. I started adamantly working out, I am now more fit than ever before. I have started eating better, I feel healthier than ever before. I started dressing nicer, I feel more attractive than ever before. And for the big one, I've even started approaching girls and have hooked up with some, so I'm feeling sexier and more confident than ever before. Now that last bit of information may seem contradicting, fortunately for me I can hide my anxiety well and that's how I've been able to talk to the girls. 

However despite all that said, even the part with me gaining more confidence, I have not lost a shred of the anxiety. I'm still just as anxious as the old alcoholic, shit eating(as in bad food), physically weak version of me when I was in my old city half a year ago. I have the constant feeling of puking and shitting my pants when I have to talk to someone still. The ONLY difference now is that I don't succumb to my anxiety as easily. The whole repetition method of overcoming your fears does NOT work with me. Despite me saying that I've been with some girls, I'm still pretty lonely too(I'm sure that has a lot to do with the anxiety.) So much so that I've even attracted two gay men whom I've been having sex with. I honestly don't even know if I'm Bisexual or if I just crave attention because I'm lonely, and they shower me with attention(I'm not leading them on though just fyi, it's a consensual fwb thing, they know this and want the same.) One might say that I'm looking in the wrong places for attention(sex) and need real platonic connections. Two things with that, I do have one friend here who I've known for years, and I have just too much anxiety to hangout with him for more than like an hour. And also I have family here who've I've gotten to know again who've been out of my life for many years. I still feel lonely and anxious with all that said, and I've tried honestly every bit of advice to alleviate anxiety that I've ever heard, and not even a modicum of my anxiety has gone down.

I have been experiencing this recently.  It has happened a few times quite recently.  I get nervous.  I feel like my throat clenches up and I start crying or I get the thousand yard stare and I feel such a sense of dread and when I try to figure out why I feel that way I always make it worse.  I guess an example would help.  I tried to go to bed about an hour ago and couldn't.  My boyfriend and I were just talking and goofing around and all was good until the lights went off and I just got hit with...whatever this is.  And in an attempt to not work myself up, I say to myself, 'ok, let's just calmly figure this out.'  This doesn't work because the only thing I could think of was that some satellite coworkers are being flown in and my boss wants me to take them out to lunch, two at a time, for three days this week.  I have been so fucking nervous about this.  I have never met any of them, I just started this job about six months ago, I barely know any places in town to eat in the first place, I need to remember how to keep conversations going and not be really awkward...you get the general picture.  So this is the only reason I can think of for being so nervous, and I try to pep talk myself and say 'It's not going to be that bad, you should get over it,' and then I can't get over it, and my brain gets really mad at myself and tells myself that the real problem is with me and I should be better than this and oh of course you're not better than this or else YOU WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS, and then I decide to just get up and do mindless things on the internet/watch some mindless television because I have to distract myself somehow and get my mind to shut up.  I guess this time I'm trying to do something productive about it by posting here.  

Other ways my brain likes to fuck with me is by imaging very horrible and grotesque scenarios, such as my whole family dying in a house fire or me having inoperable cancer (I actually did have a cancer scare recently, turned out to be nothing, but now that is now another threat I have in my arsenal).  I get so worked up over imagining every tiny little detail, and I try to tell myself to stop it, but it goes on and on until I smoke it away or engage in mindless activity.  I always attributed those wonderful times to an overactive imagination.  The ones where I am just feeling gut-wrenched and can't breathe right are the ones I'm more concerned about.  It's happened at work.  I had to leave work and go home because I couldn't concentrate on anything other than how awful I felt.  Also I have some weird social aversion shit going on that pertains particularly to when I have to get to know people.  I have no issues going out on my own, and I have no issues going out somewhere with a friend or a boyfriend.  Really, when it comes down to 'people I'm already close to' or 'people that I won't ever see again and don't care about impressing,' I'm fine.  But when I have to make small talk with coworkers, for instance, or if I'm meeting up with friend-of-a-friend's, I just cannot relax.  It takes me a very long time to warm up to people, and until I do, I mostly just stay silent, which gets me pissed off that I'm so silent, which makes me feel even more anxious, and it's just a downward spiral.  I almost don't even want to go into work tomorrow so I could avoid meeting everyone.  I don't even know what I think would happen.  I know that my brain tells me that they are all going to judge me and think I'm a lame person and really bad at talking, and I know intellectually that this is realistically improbable, but I can't get that part of me to shut up.  Not to say that I am like this all the time, but when I open up to people it's more likely than not that I'm drunk.  I recognize that that's self-medication of sorts and I don't want to have to get drunk just to try to make friends.  And I want friends.  I am in sore lacking of people that I can get really close to and open up to, and it really sucks, because I really do want to make friends but get way too nervous.

I also will never open my door if someone knocks on it and it is not a food delivery person, and I screen a good 90% of my calls.  I feel a sense of pride when I do pick up the phone, and then I feel stupid because I shouldn't feel that proud about something like that.

I'm sure a lot of this stems from some issues with my self-esteem, but I don't know if that's a separate thing.  I'm trying to get better at that part, but I feel like any little progress I make into actually saying positive things to myself gets thrown out the window pretty quickly.

I just need some way to deal with this.  Is this even anxiety?  I don't want to assume it is when it is not, because that feels disrespectful on some level.  But I am pretty close to wanting to seek out some sort of professional about whatever-the-fuck this is.  I just don't know how to start.

I have lived in Australia most of my life, in very sunny weather including the winter. I moved to New York in 2013, and felt great... until one day in November 2013, overnight, I began hating myself. I also began to panic. About everything and anything. This got worse throughout January 2014 - March 2014.


I went back to Australia for a few months from June - August 2014. Doctor placed me on 25mg Valdoxan, and I began to feel really good again, gradually. Back to New York in August 2014. I feel incredible, really. 


November 2014, AGAIN, overnight, I am overwhelmed by anxiety and self-hatred. I have never truly been suicidal (meaning, I would actually go through with it) but holy shit, this made me come **close**.


Went back to Australia for 1 month (Jan 15) and officially received the diagnosis of Seasonal Affective Disorder. I have tried a SAD lamp, 20,000 IU of Vitamin D a day, 5-HTP, Antidepressant (Valdoxan). Nothing, not a single thing worked.


It has had a horrendous effect on myself and others. I came close to giving up my university, career, routinely picked fights with my amazing girlfriend, gave up on friends. Shit sucks.


I came on here to see if anyone suffers it also. I understand it is quite common, however, the effects I am feeling are fucking *insane*. If I don't find a solution, I am may have to move back to Australia (and break my poor girlfriend's heart, and miss some great career opportunities).

1. First, when I think I am sick with the disease that is bothering me at the time, I often start to feel real symptoms associated with the disease.  Im sure this is the case with most of you.  Do you have a problem like me where no amount of logic, probability, or even a medical doctor can dissuade this feeling?

2. I want help but I dont know which to see.  Therapy, medication, or both?

3. If medication, anything I should steer clear of?  Ive gone to a psychiatrist before and they prescribed Celexa, I hated it with a passion.

Some years ago I decided to see a doctor because I had horrible depressions, crying everyday and thinking about suicide.
The doctor prescribed me a medicament called Remeron which I took over a year.
Remeron helped me to get over my depression by totally killing all my feelings. I am an asshole not able to show love to anyone. I don't care about anything and was not able to cry for years, so I think medical support fucked my life totally up.

Now I try to recover from that and suffer some kind of anxiety.
I am scared around people, even when I know them for a long time. I don't go to public places if I don't really need to.
Social interaction makes me horribly tired so I can not hang out with some friends for a long time without getting weird or angry.
Even I sleep well and long, I'm getting tired after a few hours doing my job. Most time I only go to public bars etc. drunk.
From Monday until Friday I just work and sleep.

I think I need something that let's me call down from my inner restlessness, which only a doctor can give me. So I'm going to see a doctor. But because of my bad experience with doctors and their medicine I'm very sceptical. 

So I ask you my friends, what are your experiences? What did help you most to go over your anxiety?",['conj'],0

After hearing about Reddit for years and visiting from time to time, this is my proud first post to this magical website. 

Ever since I was little I’ve struggled with this deep well of fear/anxiety inside of me. I would call it the “fast feeling” as a child when I would start to spiral out of control and into a panic attack. The breaking point was going away to college at 18 to a new town with no friends, and being hit hard with panic attacks and depression. Finally with the help of a counselor and some meds, I put a name to the fear that had followed me all my life and found some solutions.

I’ve been able to conquer a lot of the panic and high-level anxiety through the years with mindfulness and checking into reality, what I can change and what I can’t. I’ve gotten off the SSRI and have been med-free for a couple of years. 
Fast forward to age 26. I haven’t achieved any of the things I thought I would by this age: complete a college degree, get married, travel outside the US, writing regularly. And I feel like I have this low-level constant fear in my life that holds me back. Fear of not living life to the fullest, of dying as an old lady and regretting so many things, of never “succeeding”, of always feeling this fear, of letting people down, of being alone, of being rejected. SO MUCH FEAR. I know the fear “isn’t me”, and I believe I am an eternal spiritual being that is just here for learning and loving. But the anxiety is like a thorn in my side, always there, always making me doubt myself and doubt life. Always whispering “you can’t handle it, you will probably fail, you will be all alone someday, you’ve messed your life up and that’s it.”

I have a great boyfriend (love him so much but it causes me anxiety to care so much and what does the future hold and what if we break up and what if we get married and then get divorced and what if what if), 
a loving family (I don’t get to see them nearly as much as I would like and I’m sure if anything happened to my mom or ever happens to her I will be completely destroyed emotionally, she is like my rock, so fears of her or anyone else in my family dying are in my head a lot), 
a decent job (it isn’t my passion, it is mildly at odds with my personality and real dreams for life, but fear keeps me in it and fear keeps me at a distance from it and not really giving it my all).

I somewhat realize I will never get rid of the fear completely, that really I have nothing to fear but fear, that life is always ok and I’m always safe overall, I can't control anything but the present moment, that everything will be ok, but I don’t want to feel fear always anymore, I don’t want it to make me feel less and  timid and afraid. I want to live brightly, true to myself, sharing and loving and giving and NOT fearing.

I am just wondering if anyone connects to this, if they empathize, if they have any tips or ideas for how I can overcome this.

Thank you everyone for your time if you read this, I wish you all a beautiful day full of peace and little moments of joy that make you smile.

I have been feeling really strange for a few weeks.  I made an appointment to see my primary today, but it turns out it was only a nurse visit not a doctor visit.  I didn't know they made separate appointments and I would just see the nurse prior to seeing the doctor like I usually do when I go, but it makes sense that they schedule them differently if the doctor doesn't *have* to be there.  The doctors are probably more expensive.

I told the nice secretary on the way out that I wanted to see the doctor, too, and she has me scheduled for an appointment on next Tuesday, and I'm just so terrified of this feeling.  I feel nauseous and tired and just generally not well.  I noticed there's a bruise on my left side, and while I'm thinking it's ""just a bruise"" you all know how the anxious what if thoughts go.

I've had many tests done over the past few years (29 year old male) and like to think that I keep myself in relatively good health at least with consistent doctor visits to keep on anything that **may** be slipping.  

I'm so burnt out mentally.  I was on anti anxiety and depression meds, but took myself off of the depression meds a bit back because they left me feeling nothing at all, and am off the anxiety meds and run instead.  The running works well.

I'm just burnt out mentally from all these negative health thoughts.  I feel like I'm dying and I'm trying to take care of myself.  I was in therapy this morning (she knows all this) and saw my doctor today, so I'm doing what I can do for myself.

It's always been a problem, but in college it got much worse. After a panic attack during a presentation which involved a lot of handshaking and hyperventilating, I decided to see a therapist. I had always wanted to try medication since I feel strongly that my reactions to public speaking are an autonomic nervous system response that I can't control. It doesn't matter how prepared I am or how many positive thoughts I think, my brain just goes into flight-or-fight mode and I can't help it. However, the clinic associated with my university was a behavioral therapy and not a medication type place. It didn't really help that much but it got me through my final year in one piece.

Two years later, I'm back in school now for my masters and I know I'll have presentations next semester. I really really want to try beta-blockers. I would only take them like 2 times a year for presentations only. I'm meeting with a Primary Care Physician tomorrow- it's a new doctor since I'm in a new city. 

So my questions are 1. Can a PCP prescribe beta-blockers and would a doctor be willing for a new patient or would I need to see a specialist? 2. What should I be prepared for, what kind of questions will she ask? 3. Also if you take beta-blockers only occasionally for situational anxiety, what has your experience been?",['compound'],0

And I have come to understand that I have irrational thoughts and my mission is to ""re-train my brain"" to have more rational and supportive thoughts. My therapist has been telling me that what I truly need to do to address my anxieties is to learn to re-focus and stop obsessing on my negative thoughts; that being more mindful of my present experience and what is going on will help counterbalance all my negative thinking that I obsess over. 

OK, got it. That's pretty straightforward and I do largely agree with it. But here's my problem: it's not working. 

Just telling myself ""you're being irrational, focus on these more rational thoughts"" feels like throwing pebbles at a wall to make it fall down. And I have such a strong obsession on negative and anxious thoughts that you might as soon ask me to walk outside and fly as ask me to change my focus in such a meaningful way. 

I guess what I'm saying is that these are fairly easy concepts to understand, but very very complicated to enact on an ongoing basis. At least that's how my experience has been. So I'm curious to hear if any of you have had more success. Do you have daily habits/activities for retraining your thoughts and improving your attitude that not only help in the short term but lead to the longer-term change I understand takes time and patience. I just really get caught up at the point where I try to start thinking differently and more rationally; it just feels like a weak defense against my greater anxieties and it's super hard to keep up.

Any advice on how to help this stuff stick and not get discouraged when anxious would be great. And FYI, my current coping strategies include exercise, meditation, therapy, journaling, medication, and talking to friends/loved ones.

She fell into sickness quickly, a combination of heat (we had a heat wave on monday), dehydration, stress from a loud thunderstorm, age, and hereditary disease. I spent most of Tuesday tending to her, not leaving her side until late in the afternoon to run errands.

With my nursing she drank water from a syringe, ate, and mustered up eventual strength to go on a few walks that grew in length. But, upon returning a couple hours after running errands, she had reverted back to where we were at 5 am when I discovered her. 

So I took her to the vet who kept her overnight. She was put down today, in my arms, as the vet said that she was in pain and that it would likely never go away. 

This has been hard on me. I feel so many regrets that in many ways defy logic:

1) I didn't give her enough love, walks, and attention when she was around. With a new kid it's been tough having to put her on the back burner, and while she was always mellow about it I worried that she wasn't feeling loved.

2) I let her down by leaving to run errands. With my help she was getting better, but I had to pick up my son from daycare and she had improved so much. I feel terrible thinking yah maybe I could have done something.

3) I should have spent thousands to keep her alive longer. How am I supposed to live with the fact that if my family could afford the $3k for more tests, longer hospital stays, and expensive medicine, she could possibly still be here. Am I the worst person because I didn't do this? Did I let her down?

This is eating me up inside, and logic should be telling me to grieve like a normal person and stop beating myself up. But this is how the anxiety worry machine works for me. I haven't eaten in a day and usually I eat way too much (I could stand to lose 25 lbs).",['conj'],0

I feel extremely unfocused and fatigued, and I'm plagued by nausea and cold, tingly extremities (mostly feet and legs). Then, usually between 4:00 and 6:00 PM, I start feeling semi-normal again. I feel confident enough to do things, and I at least sort of feel like things are getting better. The cycle invariably repeats itself the next morning.

I'm in a pretty bad place, mentally. Depression, anxiety, social anxiety. I don't know how severe I'd say any individual aspect is (it all varies), but even if I'm not really ""miserable"" I hardly feel like I'm alive a lot of the time. It's so strange; I can identify things that I care about and even things that I enjoy, but I have no motivation to pursue any of it most of the time. I know I should get back to therapy to get better, but I just don't have the motivation to do it right now. I keep making excuses, even though I totally have time for it.


The point is, I'm too apathetic (not the right word really, but whatever) right now to do the really helpful stuff like therapy or consistent exercise/sleeping habits. So what sort of things do you guys do to make yourselves feel better in general? I'm not looking for life-changing shit like therapy or medicine -- that honestly sounds like too much for me right now, as stupid as that probably sounds -- I just want to get some ideas on things to make the day-to-day grind a little happier, more interesting, etc. Seriously, anything. I'm tired of either feeling nothing or feeling sad all the damn time. Video games get boring more quickly than they used to, my anxiety keeps me away from most social stuff... Even ""sex"" (solo, obviously, since I lack the confidence to look for dates or hookups or whatever) isn't all that great a lot of the time.

I'm writing this post for a different reason. I've dealt with anxiety my entire life to varying degrees, but I grew up with a severely manic depressive mother and, in my eyes, if my symptoms weren't as severe as hers, I was doing fine and was not diagnosable or ill. I was just overreacting. I was just taking longer than most other people to develop coping mechanisms. 

In a sense, I felt that I didn't *deserve* diagnosis, treatment, or medication for something that was essentially meaningless compared to people with ""real"" disorders.

I was wondering how many of you have had your anxiety reach so far as to make you feel that you don't deserve to be diagnosed as having an actual disorder. Is this common? 

My recent breakdown has been a long time coming because I've been over-analyzing everything and harshly judging myself since I was old enough to understand what it meant to be deficient and unaware. As soon as I saw a therapist, he immediately recognized what I was suffering from. Before I even had a chance to tell him, he told me that he was aware that I would have obsessively researched mental disorders and that, while I may have more knowledge of the subject than the average person, I was in no way qualified to decide whether or not I had a diagnosable disorder. He confirmed that I was absolutely suffering from an anxiety disorder, that it had very clearly been impacting my life for many years, and that I deserved help. That was extremely freeing for me -- to know that I deserved diagnosis and treatment and that I wasn't overreacting.

Also, have any of you ever felt intense guilt for having to take off of work due to your disorder? Personally, I'm terrified that my co-workers think that I'm overreacting and being lazy, which contributes to the anxiety I feel about returning to work.

It wasn't always like this, I remember this becoming very common only about two years ago. It happens in all kinds of situations, ranging from having to read something out loud in class to being asked a question. A lot of times if I need to read something out loud like a passage from a book or an essay of some sorts and, I slowly begin to feel this burning sensation creeping up my face until I know, partly from me feeling uncomfortable and from the amused looks of people in my class, that I'm blushing. It happens so often that I'm basically renowned for that, both within my grade and the school. It also happens when a teacher talks to me about something. I remember when one of my teachers asked me whether or not I was going to take AP Physics the next year. An extremely simple question containing no reasons whatsoever to feel anxious about. Nevertheless, I again felt this burning sensation creeping over me and there it was again, a face as red as a tomato. One of the most annoying times it happened was during sex ed in school. We had to read something out loud about what to do if you get your girlfriend pregnant etc. and what the proper way to use protection was. I read one of the things and there it was again, the blushing. What really annoyed me the most about that scenario was that I acknowledge myself as a mature person, a person who wouldn't need to feel embarrassed about reading something like that, yet I still was for some reason. 

I also just want to add that though I'm a shy person and I have this dilemma I still have a lot of friends and I'm quite popular. I'm also captain of my high school soccer team, so it's not like I've in anyway retracted from a social life. I'm still very much an average person when it comes to being social except for the fact that I have this constant fear of embarrassment. This has then caused me to feel anxious in many situations in which I knew there was no reason to feel so. I just don't know why this happens so much and I'm starting to feel afraid of basic social interaction because I fear that I'm going to embarrass myself and blush. 

Do you have any advice? Have any of you personally experienced this? Is there any medicine for getting rid of blushing? 


Also, three potentially important things that I've realized: 

1. I don't blush when speaking French. 
So I'm bilingual and I speak both French and English fluently. I've realized that when I speak French and encounter certain embarrassing situations in which I would normally blush when speaking English, I don't blush when speaking French. 

2. I don't blush when I'm on stage. 
I take part in our school plays regularly and I've never blushed on stage.

3. I don't blush when publicly speaking in MUN.
I'm also in my school's MUN club and when I speak in front of other people I don't blush. This is only within MUN, though. For some reason I still blush when reading aloud something as insignificant as a passage in a book.

I've been having anxiety/panic attacks starting roughly 2 years ago, but it got to the point where i can't even go outside of my room and I was afraid to sleep on my bed as it gave my panic attacks. Ended up going to the ER and I decided to finally put my entire effort into fighting it.

I hope this helps the rest of you as it did for me, here is the post:

---

I made this account just to post here. I know I am a late comer but I personally have dealt with panic attacks and have tried a ton of things to address them, ultimately I can say I am close to being completely ""cured"" of it. I really hope people will be reading this as I tried a ton of things already written here as well as having gotten a ton more insight into the matter itself, as I am very introspective by nature.

Now I have not taken the medicine route (except I did take B complex when I felt drained of energy which sustained my panic even further, but don't need to anymore), there was a point which I felt that if I have exhausted every other option possible then I would, so there is nothing wrong with it.

Started having panic attacks, successively stronger to the point where I can't sleep, eat and even going outside my room (which I was also afraid to be in) without feeling anxious. I will write a step by step log of what I did during my ""battle"" with my panic, in as much of a chronological order as possible.

1) Having panic attack: choose three-five objects, any three-five and simply look at them and keep an awareness to them. Keep feet to the ground and feel the sensations of the feet. 

2) Slow breathing BUT do not breath deep, and do not inhale right as you exhale

3) Get yourself checked physically to rule out anything physical by nature that can lead to panic. pulse checking, I did that before as well to remind myself that the heart pumps by itself and I don't need to worry about it

4) Get help - talk to anyone, counselling sessions etc

5) Three rules about panic caused by overstress - a) stress adders (stuff that adds to stress), b) stress capacity (how much can you handle stress), and c) stress releasers (what do you do to release stress). Figure them out, handle stress properly first

5b) When you are in a state of anxiousness/stress, your body and mind prepares yourself for a dangerous situation. People understand where the increased heart pace/adrenaline/breathing comes from, but what they usually miss out is how the mind constantly thinks up on all of the worst case scenarios and generally thinks up negative thoughts as a way to prepare you for danger. This is the way your body and mind is trying to protect you, just understand that and don't be too hard on yourself.

6) Once the physical tests rule any physical problems, remember that the heart pumps on its own and is behind a rib cage. If you feel chest tensions/tingly sensations, chances are it's on the chest muscle and not the heart.

7) Remember that panic attacks themselves do not and will not kill you, therefore you can start to tackle each symptom individually. Induce different symptoms of panic and feel/be confident that you can handle them (shortness of breath, nauseousness, heart racing, etc).

8) Replace any discomfort on areas leading to the panic (feeling something on the throat, chest etc), by working out excessively on them. I.e. chest is tingling, do a ton of pushups. Throat feels like it is out of breath, run until you can't breath. Remember, this requires some mental preparation along with 7).

9) Let things be. It's okay to have panic attacks, and it's okay to feel this or that. Trying to get feelings to get away makes them persist.

10) After 1-9, by now you are mentally prepared for the next step, which is actually bringing panic attacks to yourself on purpose. Want it, love it and from now on you are actively looking forward to it. The symptoms of a panic is not too much different than symptoms of excitement, you just need to have the right mindset.

11) From 10, if you got to this point the full blown panic shouldn't be able to come back anymore, wanting panic makes it easier for the heart to pump and the extra energy is available in the form of excitement. This doesn't make the symptoms go away but it resets your outlook towards panic

12) Face your fears, do whatever you did before and they should bring onset of panic (or feelings of it), gotta rewire your mind to understand that those things aren't scary. The more you do them and relax and rinse/repeat the less the strength of the panic. Be positive with yourself. Every little improvement, pat yourself on the back and encourage yourself that you are going to get through this.

13) Breathing techniques can be applied now, I used the 1:4:2 rule instead of 4:4:4, 7 seconds inhale, 28 seconds hold, 14 seconds exhale. Change the timing but keep the ratio. This should alleviate a ton of tension in the mind for when you are in anxious environments. Also, diaphragm breathing - can google it to look up on some exercises to train them. Once I trained my diaphragm breathing I basically lost all sensations of ""having trouble breathing""

14) I was unlucky in that I also learned to be afraid of my breath and afraid of losing the concept of ""control"" for my body. This requires a bit of philosophizing, but just trust me that letting your body and mind do its thing is also a form of control, as in  you are always in control even if you think you aren't.

15) Now that we've reached this point, it is time to talk about habits gained from panic attacks and habits that existed that lead to panic attacks. Good habits are easier to break than bad ones, so be patient. Keep in mind that the saying ""fake it until you make it"" actually applies here, apply positive response to any stimulus that normally gives a negative response. This requires patience and repetition. Each individual has different ones so be aware of them, and this leads to the next step, which is...

16) Meditation. I tried meditation over the course of the previous steps, however it was more unsuccessful than successful and I do not recommend you doing it without a proper mentor/direction as it can worsen or give you new things to panic about. I will skip all of the mistakes I made and give the overview that worked for me thus far:

The meditation I am using requires an anchor, I used the breath in the beginning which gave me a panic attack and gave me hell of a long while. The anchor is unique in that it has nothing to do with body sensations, i.e. sound, sight, smell, taste. And sometimes people choose stuff outside themselves to focus their attention on. I can write a ton about it, but I will try to summarize what I do here as concisely as possible: Pay attention to the anchor and let the body and mind take care of  the rest, all discomforts, all thoughts, everything even if it's anxiety etc. How does that work? Let loose and if you are going through what you think will lead to a panic attack, let the body handle it and just pay attention to the anchor. Do not think about whether the feeling will go away or not, just let things be and relax even if you feel like everything is going haywire.

What I realized is that panic/anxiety can not exist at the same time as relaxation/being rested. And your body/mind typically always settles to that state unless you consciously work it towards the former state (anxiety/panic). Let your breath do it's own thing, let your heart do it's own thing. DO NOT FOCUS ON ANYTHING AND PAY ATTENTION TO AN ANCHOR OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE REGIONS THAT DISCOMFORTS YOU. If you pay attention to the regions that makes you uncomfortable you are going to amplify them and it won't help but make things worse.

Okay I wrote a lot, but by now I am well on my way on working towards replacing bad habits with good ones and slowly letting my mind/body naturally remain rested. I am also actively getting myself into anxious situations to train my ability to ""let loose"" in those scenarios as well. It takes a while to retrain myself to finally ""unlearn"" panic but as I said before, good habits are easier to break than bad ones.

There are probably a lot more things I did over the course of my fight. I can't remember all of them as the past is too blurry right now. But I can tell you that I did virtually (almost) everything that was written here and a ton of personal philosophizing. I actively seeked help and tried everything possible. I know that while it might not lead to any result but that's the only way I could actually get this far, and I encourage that all of you who are facing it currently to keep on trying new things to tackle it.

I hope this helps. Putting cold water on my body is something new that I never thought about, will add that to the list!

Oh right, I forgot to mention how this applies to my battle with depression? Well along the way I learned a lot about the nature of what caused the anxieties/panic in the first place and how my mind/body reacts to certain stimuli. Through my self-inspection I started to understand the nature of my depression (and perhaps how other depression might've formed/persist) and came up with ways on handling them as well. Guess the panic disorder helped me get into the road of taking care of my depression as well, so I got that going... although still panic attacks are nasty stuff.",['compound'],0

Three weeks ago I decided my anxiety is too much to handle on my own so I went to psychiatrist who diagnosed me with recurrent depression/ anxiety disorder and immediately prescripted me meds. I have been given SNRIs, pills called Elify (known as Effexor/Venlafaxine in US) and immediately after first pill I've suffered side effects like jaw clenching, shivers and anorgasma (amongst MANY others including nausea, headache and constant yawning). I've taken the meds for 7 days and since the side effects kept only getting worse, I quit the pills. There was also no notable psychological impact, except I started having crying fits in addition to anxiety attacks. All the side effects were gone within 3 days.

 Now today I was at my psychiatrist who prescribed me Cipralex (=Lexapro,SSRI), telling me it has least side effects and zero impact on sexual abilities. I've been given Cipralex drops so I can take small doses (7 drops at the moment) as my doctor thinks I might be a bit sensitive. Yet few hours after taking the first dose, I immidiately experienced return of jaw clenching, headache, and mainly anorgasma. 

I want to give Cipralex(Lexapro) a chance and try to withstand the side effects until my next appointment (which is in three weeks), but the side efects with Elify(Effexor) were really annoying and mainly the anorgasma was frustrating as hell (as there was no drop in libido, only the inability to orgasm even when succesfully ejaculating =&gt; zero satisfaction, total exhaustion) and I'm afraid they might increase in annoyingness as they did over the time with SNRIs.

Has anyone else a similliar experience? Is it possible that I might be hypersensitive to both SSRI and SNRI? Or is it just a problem in my head, maybe caused by how meds were demonized by people around me? Should I go to my psychiatrist ASAP or wait the three weeks if the effects dissapear?",['nsubjpass'],0

Occasionally (every 2 months maybe?) I will have this thing where I wake up suddenly, either shortly after falling asleep or after an hour or two. It seems to happen only when I take a nap or fall asleep in my chair accidentally. I wake up with a sudden jolt, in a panic about not exactly death itself, but the idea of being dead forever. Like the fact that someday I will have no consciousness whatsoever for as long as the universe exists and I'll never know anything after I die. I'll get up suddenly and yell an obscenity a few times, pretty much involuntarily, but then I'll be ok after only a few seconds when my head clears and the adrenaline comes down. However during that time it's sheer terror like I'm in a different reality. What's odd is before I became an atheist I would have the same panic about the idea of existing forever and what that even meant (which I think is much worse). I'm not really afraid to die in my everyday life, it's just these ""existential brain spasms"" that happen sometimes.

It seems like I have some weird combination of a hypnagogic jerk and waking night terror, but I'd appreciate any insight or if someone has had anything like this happen to them.",['conj'],0

Whatever it may be. Whether its OCD, Social Anxiety, PSTD, etc. I always wondered whether anxiety really is a choice. Or an inherent issue. Or environmental. In my opinion, I think its a combo of all three. How you grew up, how you perceive the world, and maybe chemical imbalance issues(debatable). Regardless, its important to know that ALL anxiety issues have a solution. ALL. And its not medication. Most if not all anxiety stems from perceptions of fear and even anger. All anxiety issues have a source in your mind. We all want to feel reassured when something is bad is happening. But reassurance sustains the fear of any anxiety. Especially ""avoiding"" thoughts. You can't avoid thoughts. No one can. If I told you stop thinking about red cars, whats going to happen. The exact thought. Over and over. You might not know this. But there is NOTHING wrong with the thoughts you have. Regardless of what it is or how you see them. They're JUST thoughts. Its how you FEEL about certain thoughts. Get to the basics of what is actually happening in the mind. Write your frustration out. Express it. Then practice ""letting things be."" Exposure and Response therapy is phenomenal. Face your fears and let them be. Let them stay in the mind. You'll realize its just a pattern. Don't resist your own thinking. Resisting is what sustains the fire. You don't need to judge yourself just because your conscious is projecting a ""bad"" thought. Judging thoughts is pointless. Let them be. Breathe and just go with it. Nothing bad will happen. See some Joe Rogan videos guys. He really puts the nonsense of anxiety into perspective. Take care fellas. Your fine.",['conj'],0

Even practicing the techniques, I still feel anxious and helpless. Benzos stop the feeling, but they stop everything with me. I liken my benzo use to putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound and taking an advil over going to a hospital. It helps then, but the underlying cause is still there. I really just need to talk about this with anyone. My friends don't understand. They see me as a flaky, flighty, girl. My mom thinks everything can be solved with diet, exercise, meditation, and the healing power of crystals. She refuses to see it as my brain isn't wired like hers or my sister's. 


Today, I broke down because I nearly missed the train and the woman at the information kiosk was incredibly bitchy to me. I tried to explain to the security guard that I couldn't buy a ticket, but I needed to catch the train to go to class. I'm in hysterics as he's lecturing me.  If I didn't have a book I borrowed from a classmate, I would have just gone home, climbed back into my safe bed, and forgotten about everything. I had missed seeing my classmate last week because I only went to class one day out of that week. Not really anxiety related, I had a toothache and had to get emergency dental work done. I explained that to her, and told her I'd give her the book today. I'm on the train, I'm crying still. I'm thinking about how behind I am in classes because of panic attacks, my tooth, everything. Ticket check. I didn't have a ticket. I'm hyperventillating. I dig through the blackhole I call a purse for my ID, consigned to my warning for no ticket. This security guard gave me a pass. ""You're having a bad enough day. I'm not going to write you up. Feel better, sweetheart."" I nod feebly and go back to staring out the window. I take a xanax, and wait for my stop, Boca. I have 3 stops to make myself passable for just grumpy. I have a hard enough time talking to people at school, I'd rather not have strangers ask me what's wrong, or why I look like I've been crying.

Finally get to class. Feeling a bit better. I give my classmate her book back. I'm still shaken from everything on the train. I decide to skip my 2nd class of the day and get lunch. My second class is a bit stressful for me to go. I'm the only woman in a 50 person class. The room is cramped, and small. It feels claustrophobic. Everyone says that class set up is typical of a Computer Science classroom. The other people in the class are very cliquish. It's hard to even ask one of them about the assignment. I feel very, very, alone in that classroom. I transferred to FAU this semester. I know no one. I don't have my safety net. I really need one for this class. The coursework is mindless, but it feels like highschool. I hated highschool. I feel like if I kill the curve, the rest of the entirely male class will further ostracise me from the group. I have 2.5 years longer to spend with these people. I dislike group dynamics, but if I'm forced into one, I want to be comfortable. I'm really not. The lectures are posted as videos online. I decide to watch it later, skip, get lunch and get ready for therapy. 

I missed therapy today. The reminder email never says the time. I thought it was at 2, not 1. Bad day continues. I had been told over the break that the psychiatric department's head wasn't comfortable with helping me with treatment. I can go for therapy, but not medication. I at least need to restock on bandaids. My therapist sees me for a few minutes anyway. She knew I was frazzled at best. I can tell that she also doesn't feel comfortable treating me. She tries to convince me to go back to South County or Jerome Golden. The low cost mental health / substance abuse clinics. I really don't want to go back to either. South County is a hell hole, and I watch my mother get Baker-Acted 3x to Jerome Golden. South County keeps trying to push lithium on me. Neither offer therapy. I'm shit out of luck again.

This isn't the first time that my panic attacks have kept me interfered with me going to school or work. The first time, I was young. I had just moved out to Orlando on my own. I failed out because UCF would not let me take a hardship or medical withdrawal despite diagnosing me with anxiety and panic disorder. I was unable to leave my room, let alone go to class. I see the signs of this happening again. It's killing me. I feel like my only option is to really just get through my bachelors by continuing with the bandaids. Do this, until I get a real job. One that gives benefits, and then go to a psychiatrist, one that doesn't push lithium, one that tries something and doesn't think I'm too crazy for them, and get real help again. I want more than anything to have a doctorate in CS or engineering, but I feel that dream slipping away with every panic attack, plans cancelled, or day of work/school missed because of the anxiety. 

Sorry for the stream of consciousness style. It's the only way I know how to write without sounding robotic. I really needed to get this all out.  ",['conj'],0

Always there always torturing me from my first memories. I remember night terrors as a child where i would wake up screaming. I always thought that this was perhaps the beginning of a life of fear. 
	The fear always had a way of changing, I have never been able to beat it.  In third grade do to my low grades they took me aside and tested me for learning disabilities. Judging from my lack of skill in typing this you can tell i was never much of a student, always never applying myself or listening. When they tested me for a disability they took me into a cold office and made me arrange cubes into shapes that were on flash cards. This worried me so much, for i thought i was going to be held back and depending on how i did on the tests i would have to repeat the 3rd grade. I obsessed on it for the rest of the year. Now just being afraid of being held back is a logical fear in its own. I was given a random test of intelligence and i somehow gathered in my mind that i was not up to the 3rd grade level and had to possibly repeat the grade. Actually they wanted to put me in special ed and coast me through my education. I got a lot of those tests in years to come but always tried and never was aloud in special ed do to my scores. 
	The fear of getting held back was logical in my mind. Well somewhat logical but not completely irrational. What sticks out in that particular episode was the ruminating thoughts of failure and inability of thinking about anything else.  Complete and total obsession, and paranoia.  I spent hours upon hours thinking about it. When you wake you scan and remember this obsession and start all over.  It was a endless cycle. 
	Of course i went on to 4th grade and wasn't held back and i stopped obsessing on getting held back. But that's the thing, through my whole life it has been a never ending obsession on something negative impacting my life. Fear of the future. I don't know if i will ever get better and if i don't my life will probably result in homelessness or loneliness as the people i see gradually begin moving onto bigger and better things while i am stuck alone and afraid. Afraid to make moves do to future tripping. Always working around the next panic attack or obsessive fear. I could go through a list of things i trip about some bat shit crazy and others logical but of course over thought. 
	Well recently I had more illogical obsessions about getting arrested (for what? i do not know) Turning into a monster killer (never even been in a fight.) and others. I realize i have a anxiety disorder although sometimes the illogical thoughts (which i only half believe) seem so whack-o i think i am infact completely insane, and possible paranoid schizophrenic. I don't hear voices, i don't ever think impulsive things where i believe my irrational thoughts. I always know what is reality and what isn't. I just worry a lot. Working around these things has proven to bring my life to a complete stalemate. I recently left my job do to panic attacks and am currently afraid of working and being rejected. I.e. bad at the job or hated by employees. I have no education, no job, but a very supportive family who are currently most likely enabling me. I also have a loving girlfriend who told me last night that if i cant get a job she will simply get a second job and i can stay home. This breaks my heart to no end. I Currently am on celexa which seems to make me think a little less like a crazy person. The tornado of thought is now a lot more cloudy. Ive been unemployed for about a month while the meds side effects slowed down and am going to a therapist on the tenth. I guess my question is through all this babel is this worse then anxiety? Am i far worse off then a curable anxiety disorder?

I would love it if she were willing to try an SSRI or some medicine other than xanax (which as I understand only treats the symptoms). But she's resistant because she heard one of the side effects is digestive issues, which she's obviously sensitive to. 

So please, if you have some words, some experiences, some advice... I just want her to feel joy in this life. ",['conj'],0

I'll keep it quick, i'm 18 at university, and recently i've been battling with anxiety issues. My course is going great and i enjoy that side of college life. However i sometimes get flushes of anxiety out of nowhere.

For instance this week i plan on going out with a friend of mine to a electronic music event, i know it'll be enjoyable, but i suddenly get anxious about the idea of my parents worrying about me, and am i going to be okay when i go. 

I also sometimes get quite anxious over strange things like going into the shared kitchen, although all my dorm are very nice, i get nervous and panicky about am i looking okay, will i say something silly etc. 

Planning to go to the docs tomorrow and get talking to them, i don't want to start and meds. 

Anyone else experience anything like this? I'd love to know and tips of how to deal with it, as it's starting to really get me down. I just want to feel young and free haha. I do break out of my anxiety, and feel fine after it and never feel massively depressed. 

Have looked at this sub before, i wish everyone the best of luck :) 


**TLDR; At university, getting anxiety attacks about silly things like worrying if my parents are worrying about me, kinda holding me back fully experiencing it all. any tips would be amazing.** ",['conj'],0

When I was younger it was about my single mother not making enough money to live on. Now that I am older I still find myself facing the same problem. I recently had a panic attack over something very small. I mentally understood that it was not a big issue, but I felt like my mind was betraying me and I could not calm myself down. I think I am getting to the point that I cannot control it anymore.  I was laying in bed the other night contemplating whether or not I should see a doctor about this and at that moment I found myself worrying about my own anxiety. My main concern about being on medication for anxiety is that if I get on it what would happen when I get off it. I am I going to lose my coping mechanism that I have establish all these years? I tried working out but find myself becoming obsess about it in a unhealthy way. Soon working out became a source of stress itself. I am afraid to meditate because I'm scare of own thoughts. I am not depress and definitely not suicidal. I am just constantly living in my own mind. Sigh I am actually stress about writing this, haha.

He said if he had to give me an initial diagnosis it would probably be generalized anxiety disorder, mild social anxiety and depression which he also believes is caused by the anxiety. He put me on a starter dose of 10mg/day of citalopram/celexa for 10 days and then bumping up to 20mg after that. I've never taken any psychiatric drugs before(other than to calm me down before surgeries) and have only taken one half dose of the citalopram. I also got a referral to a therapist that specializes in CBT at my request, I really want to finally address my problems and do everything I can to fix them.

I was prescribed this because it's supposed to be a well-tolerated drug, and was instructed to take it before bed due to it's sedative properties and I experienced the exact opposite. I got the prescription after work and took it when I got home and tried to get to sleep. I work nights, and saw the doctor in the day and then went to work a few hours later on about four hours of sleep. I did my 12 hours and tried to sleep after taking the medication and I wasn't able to get to sleep for several hours. When I did I had a nightmare maybe a half hour later and woke up feeling absolutely terrible, I've never felt anything close to this ever before. I was extremely angry(almost feeling violent, very uncharacteristic of me), feeling very confused, dizzy, grinding my teeth, sweating, nauseous(I threw up later), I wasn't cold but I was shaking like I was shivering, had some muscle twitches, dilated pupils, headache, and sweating that came and went.

I called the doctor's office to explain my symptoms, and a nurse called me back telling me to just take it in the daytime. I told her I really didn't even want to take it again, and I would have to call in sick for work because I didn't feel safe driving or operating machinery(I work in heavy industry around molten metal) and would be unable to function at all. She said she'd talk to the doctor, I didn't hear back the rest of the day.

This morning I got a call back and was again told to take it in the daytime, I explained there was no way I would take it again after such a bad reaction. She asked if I would be willing to try another medication, I told her possibly, but I was very leery after what had happened.

She called back after talking to the doctor, and I got an extremely patronizing attitude. She told me how proud the doctor was of me to be willing to consider trying another medication and how happy they were for me for seeking treatment. I was still very irrationally angry and it took a lot not to just berate her, I hate being talked down to. She said he wants me to try another SSRI, this time peroxetine/paxil again at a half dose so I don't have another bad reaction. I voiced my concerns that this was another SSRI, and I already had a bad reaction to a half dose. She asked if I wanted them to fax it into the pharmacy and I told her to go ahead but that I wasn't sure if I would get it filled.

I really don't want to have another bad reaction and am very reluctant to try another SSRI. I've never felt so horrible in my entire life and the anger I felt honestly scared the shit out of me. I'm genuinely worried I might blow up if somebody even looks at me the wrong way. I'm still feeling the side effects from the citalopram which I took yesterday morning, I'm starting to calm down a little finally. I just want to be able to sleep and feel normal again. I seriously considered going to the ER to get some emergency anxiety medication so I can calm down and sleep. I've had valium and xanax once each before for some minor surgeries and they calmed me right down. 

Since I've been unable to sleep I've been looking into reactions like I've had that others have had with SSRIs. I've read in more than a few places that when people have reactions like this to more than one SSRI they often assume you have bipolar disorder and treat you accordingly. I've seen bipolar disorder before and know for a fact I don't have it, and don't want to be given even more medication that will fuck me up even worse. 

Anyway, I'm not sure what to do now and am just looking for some input. I'm sure a lot of you have tried multiple drugs and wanted to get some opinions on it. This medication and treatment thing is all very new to me. Sorry if this is long, disjointed or rambling, I'm still not feeling very well. Thanks in advance for anything you can say either way. I'll also be posting this in the depression sub, I think this could fit in both and I'd like to get as many opinions as I can.",['nmod'],0

It is just anxiety. I know this, and it is stupid. But now I've got an even more troublesome worry that I can't get out of my mind.

I have a really good job, a really wonderful girlfriend, everything is going great. Except for the fact that my new worry is developing Schizophrenia...

I am not really hearing anything asides from loud thoughts, there is nothing talking to me. But say for example, I'll hear my aquarium bubbling. For a second I'll think it's someone talking and then I will become alarmed and realize it's my aquarium filter bubbling about. Well if I am thinking I am hearing shit all day it almost feels like I actually AM hearing shit. It is difficult. But it's also stupid. Has anyone else ever dealt like this?

I want them to know that I truly appreciate everything they do but its difficult when everyone around me spends money like it grows on trees.

The job place I have to drive to for a preliminary interview, it only involves some highway driving and I have been there before so I am not too worried. There is a back way I can go which only takes a bit longer, I'm on and off the highway in less than 60 seconds.

But the actual job I start at the end of this week is a 45+ minute drive on the same highway. I'd say it's nearly 20 minutes further down the highway than this place, and at one point I have to merge onto another highway (going the wrong way will take me way out of the way). After that it's driving down further on another highway until I eventually get to the town, and then I have to find the place. THEN I have to find my way back home at the end of the work day. Between the stress of waking up much earlier, adjusting to a new job and getting to the place, I am a huge mess.

This sounds **terrifying** to me. 

Let me give you a bit of background: I am 27, male, no medications. I've always been an OK driver and I usually do better the more times I have taken a particular route. But highways have always made me very anxious and depressed and scared, even if I have been on that route before. I have to admit I always avoid them and they are probably the only legitimate phobia I have besides dentists (another phobia I reluctantly face).

In either of the cases of highways or dentists, I almost always have to bring someone with me or I completely lose it. There are times I have had to tough it out with highway driving and I just do it, but I never feel better, and what's worse, I **never actually get better at highway driving**. I am never sure of my driving. I actually feel like I drift. I go too slow sometimes. I have a very real problem with making split second decisions (should I merge now? Will I crash?) or reading signs or understanding exits, signs, lanes and U-turns until I have missed them- and then I get even MORE confused and nervous. The strange thing is that I have driven on highways dozens of times in my life, sometimes completely alone, sometimes in the pouring rain, but I suppose I never did it consistently enough to get used to it.

It's very hard for other people, even family members, to understand where I'm coming from. I have had a driving gap for the past few years until very recently as I didn't have my own car for a while, so I only back into driving last week. I'm going to test drive on the highway (I did today) as much as I can for the next few days with someone coming with me but I really need any help I can get to make this safer and more relaxed for me...please help.",['attr'],0

I'm don't know. It just feels like my default state now.

I've had OCD (diagnosed) since I was 8. I visited a psychologist two years ago, who confirmed I also have generalised anxiety disorder. I stopped going because, funnily enough, a thing I said at a session sent me into spin-out mode.

I went back to a psychologist today. She said it was important not to talk about the episodes that lead to anxiety in the sessions, but rather, to concentrate on mentally acknowledging and then dismissing the thoughts as they occur. She also gave me mindfulness and meditation activities to practice.

I mean, I'll give them a shot - my field is tangentially connected to psychology, so I'm familiar with mindfulness and the massive amounts of support it has - but I can't shake the feeling that it simply won't work for me. How will taking 10 deep breaths a day while thinking about my weight in the chair negate the constant dread I feel? How will thinking about how my feet feel in my shoes and how my coffee smells dismiss a panic attack?

I really want to talk about the stuff that makes me panic. There's a whole bunch of other layers in there that I now can't really talk about - how I feel inferior to everyone, how I'll instantly accept I'm wrong about something the moment I'm challenged *even in my field of expertise when questioned by someone unfamiliar with the field*, how I feel like a fraud, feel worthless, how it takes me thirty minutes to draft an email stating a simple, undeniable fact because of self-doubt, how I regret everything that comes out of my stupid mouth at meetings, how I feel that, while I'm aware no one actually gives a shit about me, people's faint awareness of my existence is coupled with dislike and annoyance. 

**Does mindfulness work for you? Does avoiding talking about it work for you?**

To be honest, and I know this is going to sound really stupid, I just want someone to talk to, and maybe some medication that'll make the dread go away and calm me down when I'm in panic mode. ",['dep'],0

I am hoping to get some advice on how to proceed with readmission at my school. I was put on academic probation the spring semester of my junior year. I am writing an essay for readmission and I am not sure how personal I can be. (Prompt is after tl;dr)

I understand that my anxiety and depression influenced my inability to function in a healthy manner. I was anxious about class, assignments, and my peers. The worry grew exponentially until it was crippling. I had my first panic attack that led to some mild ptsd symptoms. 

I started having panic attacks and anxiety when I was 20, two years ago. 
It’s very new and I am not comfortable explaining it to my parents. This disorder is intricately connected to my studies and my self-worth. I can’t explain it to my mother without confusing her and ultimately scaring her. She’s suffered from depression after my birth but she’s not familiar with anxiety. 

I completed the final presentations but I did not turn in my final paper. The fact that I didn’t turn in the final exams is tough to explain. I was going through a bad time and I waited beyond finals. I had final presentations due a week before the final paper. I did not contact any of my professors offering any explanation. 

What does this look like to the outside? 
If someone has anxiety in my department they could recognize my behavior. If I completed 90% of my work but not the final 10%, which is one paper in each class, then it’s not a healthy sign. It looks like someone is crashing under the pressure. 

What should I include in my essay? I have to address an understanding of the circumstances and choices that led to required withdrawal. 
How do I make the leap from what I actually did to how I’m going to prepare differently? 

To be honest I’m fearful of the future because I don’t feel like my anxiety or depression is completely controlled. But I am rightfully anxious about returning to school because I do enjoy it. I enjoy my major and I’m very close to finishing. I feel ready to go back to school. 


A quick breakdown of how many requirements for my major remaining:

For the spring semester 2012 I did not turn in any final exam for my 5 classes. 

I did complete 90% of the work the rest of the semester. 

I had completed every paper that was assigned (mostly B average). 

I did complete final presentations in all classes. 

There was only one class that had sporadic writing assignments given once or twice a month. This was the one class that I did not attend the majority of the semester. 




I also am required to talk to my major advisor at school. What should I include in my email?
How honest can I be with her? They want me to discuss my academic program. Would a list of the failed classes and remaining requirements satisfy that? 


I plan to start in the Fall and complete my degree in the Summer or Fall of 2014. I can attend summer classes if I maintain a B average during the fall/spring semesters. I will be left 4-5 classes to complete during the Summer and I will graduate. If I can’t attend during the summer I will just postpone it until December. 
I plan on making the B average and being able to register for Summer classes. I will be able to retake most of the classes that I took in the Spring of 2012. 

I’m planning on asking her to write my recommendation for law school. How honest can I be with her? I’m not sure what is revealing too much information.
I don’t want to reveal too much information over email? I’m not sure what the proper etiquette is with professors and revealing emotional/personal issues. 
I understand if I was hospitalized/prescribed medication I would include that. 
I will be able to meet with her in September and have the chance to explain further. 

Are these questions that she should not be bothered with?
Anything else that I can include? 


They want to know that I understand what actions led to my withdrawal. I do understand but how much should I reveal? 

In the 2.5 years I attended I did receive good grades (above 3.0). I had an A- average for the classes I took for my major. 

Feel free to offer any advice that might be helpful in the readmission process.  If I missed any information please let me know.

*HI MODS, I tried to abide by all the guidelines but if I missed anything please let me know. Please PM me before you delete the post. 


tl;dr: University student, failed classes and had to withdraw for a year. I am suppose to contact the Committee and be readmitted. I am unsure of what to include in my essay. I am not comfortable writing about my anxiety/depression. Do they need to know? 

This is the prompt: 
I.	A personal letter explaining the circumstances surrounding your Required Withdrawal. Your letter should address, in detail, your preparedness to return and demonstrate a thorough understanding of the reasons for your Required Withdrawal. 
II.	A proposed plan of study for the first two semesters following readmission. Your plan should incorporate those courses which you know will be approved and required by your major department. In addition, students are encouraged to inform their faculty advisor of their intention to return to full-time study and to discuss their academic program.

It affected almost all parts of my life, from not being able to use public transport to not being able to go to places like the cinema or even busy shops. At one point it was so bad I was unable to even Skype my parents, for fear of something bad happening which would provoke a panic attack.
Anyway, I saw a counsellor for a while, and am also taking Citalopram. 
Through my uni they offered me to see a hypnotherapist, which I was very skeptical about at first, but have found it to be really helpful! I've only had a couple of sessions, and what happens is an amazing state of relaxation that I would never have been able to achieve by myself. When I am under, the hypnotherapist talks me through situations, says different mantras and explains things to me, which at the time I can kind of concentrate on, but is mostly getting through to my sub conscious. 
I really believe it has helped me. Obviously I can't tell you how much of it is the hypnotherapy, or the meds, but day to day life is so much easier now and I feel so much calmer, so I am able to tackle uncomfortable situations. I can get on trains almost fine now! It's so great.
So yeah, basically my message is, if you have the opportunity then definitely try it!! Just go for any extra help you are offered :) If you have any questions I'm more than happy to try and explain things more clearly.

Most of the time it comes on very suddenly and I will not be able to focus my attention, and walk and bump into walls and furniture. This is also accompanied by too many thoughts happening at once and I feel a little buzzed/over stimulated.
This was bothering me a little bit and I had been trying to brush it off and deal with it, however, within maybe the last 3 months I have been feeling rather nauseous, dizzy and fatigued after eating. Breakfast is always ok for me and never makes me sick as I am a very happy and energetic morning person, but anything around lunchtime, evening or night just gives me dizziness and the other symptoms mentioned before. I have also been experiencing an accelerated heart rate with very sudden onset, rather randomly and suddenly for about the past month or two.
Overall I am feeling very fatigued and depressed, with me feeling really motivated and happy every now and again (one good day, then as the day goes on I feel increasingly fatigued and depressed). I have in the past been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and Depression, as well as having low blood pressure. I currently take the Levlen contraception pill (for four years and have never experienced problems with it) and no other prescription medication.

We agreed to meet at a little bakery with pretty large tables that would accomadate all of the people I thought were going to show up inside at noon. 

I was the first to arrive and I was really anxious getting out of my sister's car. It looked like there were a lot of people inside and I started panicking. My sister calmed me down a bit and I got out and walked inside.

I began looking around to see if they were there and I tried to casually around. That is when I began to panic really badly. Breathing became extremly hard to do, and I felt like everyone was staring at me. I felt like something was off about me and everyone was staring at me. I ended up fast walking outside to an outdoor table in the cold because I couldn't handle looking around with all of the people in the bakery. I literally felt sick and really scared and at that moment I kind pf embarresed myself and began to study alone after I figured that no one showed up. And I was right cause the first guy didn't show up until 10 minutes after. 

When the second guy ended up showing up we then waited an hour for others to show up and ended up moving to barnes and nobles to study after no one else did.

When we got there we found a table with two seats so I had to find a third as the other tables were taken. I began panicking pretty badly with that too. I don't like talking to people and most people scare the shit out of me as I am afraid I'll say something really stupid. 

I ended up asking for a chair and getting one though I kinda fucked up with stutters and other stuff. 

I came home once we were done with studying and I told my mom that I panicked and (after more than just this situation occurring in the past) and she just told me that I need to cope better when I am sure that I need some form of medication. I've talked to my therapist about it and he is very so so about giving it to a 17 year old as he isn't sure of what would happen based on the fact that the medication is tested on adults and not teenagers or children.

I guess I really just don't know what to do. I've always been just scared of things and people and I don't feel like I know how to cope with reality or people so I seal myself off from the world most of the time and escape into fantasy and other things to find comfort and not have to confront anything.

I assumed that when I graduated from college and landed a ""good job"" I'd be happy and my anxiety that I struggled with in college would just go away and I'd be a Real Adult v1.0.

That has not been the case.  As long as I can remember I have hit my head with my hands or on a wall whenever I got frustrated.  About a month ago I was upset at myself for something I forgot, and beat myself with the pointed ends of my keys until I had 20+ bruises all over  my thighs.  I get 4 free therapy appointments through work, so I went to them.  I was diagnosed with GAD, which I think fits.  Anyway, last weekend I got upset with something else I forgot and I took a pen and jabbed it into my thighs again until I had about 10 bruises.

I went back and told the therapist about it on my 4th and final session with her.  While we were doing CBT, she has said I should look into DBT.  I looked it up online, and I am just not sold on the idea of group therapy.  I don't have social anxiety.  I can go anywhere I want, hang out with whoever I want, and make friends with anybody.  I don't feel that meeting as a group would make any of my symptoms better, as I don't feel that I need to ""practice"" containing myself (I just wait until I'm alone to freak out and self harm) and I don't need to have forced social events.  My main anxiety is work and how I'm doing at work, not social situations.  I get ""flooded"" when I feel that I have failed at something, or forgot something like a bill or an item of mine somewhere else.

I am going to a GP tomorrow to talk about medication options.  I am now finished with the 4 sessions and I am at a crossroads.  Do I try to enter back into CBT, or try DBT which I am really not sold on due to the group aspect?  I also need to find a new therapist-- while she was helpful, I heard a little bit too much about giving myself over to God and accepting a higher being.  That's fine, it was just through work and I can go to someone else now.  She has given me a few tools, offered to refer me, and some information, and I'm just trying to figure out where to go from here.

It's not even the fear of crashing that gets to me; it's the idea that I'm flying through space and time in a metal tube in the sky.  Its being that high up (I have a fear of heights in general), confined to a small seat and space.  UGHHH.  Cue panic attack. 

I have a supply of Ativan, which of course I will bring just in case.  I'd really prefer not to touch it, both due to rebound panic in the following days and because I remember just how awful those withdrawals were.  I'm considering taking Benadryl.

I've recently been diagnosed with GAD and I suspect I have a little social anxiety as well. My doctor gave me a low-dose (10 mg) paxil script and xanax for any panic attacks. I personally am of the belief that there are natural answers (aka not pharmaceuticals) for health issues. I know that many people DO need these, I'm not trying to downplay the usefulness and need for these prescriptions for everyone. For myself, however, I don't like the idea of being on antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications.

I've made the decision to use EFT or ""tapping"" to help me process and constructively examine my emotions and what might be contributing to my anxiety issues while I am on paxil. I am hoping that this will allow me to cope in a healthy way so that the paxil is only a short-term solution in my case.

I'm almost 28 now, still on benzos, still stuck in my house, and with increasingly worsening tics. Every doctor I've ever seen has refused to comment on the tics, aside from the occasional ""it might be a medication side effect.""

The tics I have are all sort of breathing centric. They all make a noise. I don't feel that I can control them no matter how hard I try, and they are ultimately what lead to and in turn fuel my panic attacks and a great deal of my suffering.

-sniffling in and out (started using nose plugs sometimes)

-forcefully inhaling through my nose in attempt to clear it, resulting in somewhat of a snorting sound

-throat clearing and coughing

-(the worst by far) expelling air from my lungs forcefully and sort of making this ""huh!"" sound, similar to a person reacting to something at least mildly interesting, i.e. ""Huh! You don't say!"" or the kind of one syllable laugh you'd do when you're not really laughing but not remaining silent.

-edit: I left this one out because it's related to the above tic but is actually more frequent. It's a more of a ""hmm"". Pretty much exactly ""hmm"", actually, and it's done on a vast majority of exhales (nose or mouth breathing, doesn't matter)


All of these tics turn into fits daily. Frankly, my lungs and every muscle involved in exhaling are exhausted and hurt like hell. My quality of life is zero and I've missed out on almost 5 years of my life now.

I'll give you an example: Today I wanted to go check out a lecture/lunch at my university. I knew I would probably be the only student there, in a room filled with professors, grad students and researchers. My thought process? I didn't want to appear to be the odd one out, because I was the only student there. I also didn't want to run into my old professors and be forced to have conversations with them. All of this because of my anxiety. So what did I do? I walked all the way across campus, through the building, and then walked right past the lecture hall, like I was merely passing through. I can't help this behavior. I don't know why I do it, but I found it absurd that I can't even attend a simple lecture for fear of standing out or social interaction.

I always believe that I'm not capable of excelling in many aspects of my life, but more often than not these beliefs are completely unfounded, and they are the roots of my low self esteem and anxieties. I can't seem to shake them though. 

I also struggle with a porn and masturbation addiction. I can't get rid of this as hard as I try. 

I have friends who I cling on to too much because I have no other social outlets, really. I can't seem to make any more because I can't push myself to try. 

I'm seeing a therapist, but I've only had one meeting. She immediately suggested I meet with a psychologist who can prescribe me anti-anxiety medication. I think this is the best way to go.

My dad was entirely emotionally absent apart from his episodes of extreme anger. He would break down my bedroom door, punch walls, and hit me. He also sexually abused me when I was very young. Again I was always blamed. My grandmother who lived with us acted like she despised me, and found fault in everything I did. She would chase me around the house and hit me with a stick. Once she pushed me threw a glass door and my wrist sliced open. I bled so much I soaked three towels in blood. No one took me to the hospital and I still have two huge gashes on my wrist.

I'm starting to realize I was neglected too. My house growing up was filthy and disgusting. I had reoccurring boils because no one ever bothered to make sure I showered regularly. I remember having to spray my clothes with air freshener because they were so dirty they stank and I got yelled at if I tried to use the washing machine. I remember getting made fun of at school for this on several occasions. I slept on a mattress on the floor on dirty old sheets that never got washed. The food in the house was always old and stale. I went to bed freezing every single night because my parents refused to turn on the heater (I live in Canada BTW, winters are fucking cold) and they also refused to buy me adequate blankets. As a result I was sick all the time. There was black mould, filth, and grime everywhere. These are things I have never told anyone. I carry around a deep sense of shame over the environment I grew up in. It was a disgusting way to live and I am still overwhelmed with embarrassment.

I was painfully shy in grade school and bullied a lot. I had no self-confidence or self-worth. I never really considered myself a human being. I was something less than that, something subhuman. When things happened to me I just accepted them. In highschool I got into drugs, heavily. I did everything. Starting at 14 I went to raves and did esctacy, LSD, cocain, alcohol, weed, ketamine. I was basically addicted to esctacy for about two years and did it almost every day.

I had this female friend who I partied with a lot. We went to a fetish party one weekend and I let her spank me. That was OK. The next day she was in a poor mood because she didn't get laid the previous night. She tied me up and basically raped me. I told her to stop but she basically told me to shut up and take it. I froze and just let her. Afterwards she was angry with me because I couldn't satisfy her like a guy.

Throughout highschool I dated older men, all were abusive. My first boyfriend was controlling and physically abusive and raped me when I was drunk and begging him not to. I left him the next day. Another boyfriend raped me almost every time we had sex. After I confronted him he started to blame me for it. I must have been asking for it because I invited him to sleep over, or because I gave him a look, or he couldn't help myself because I was so hot.

My worst experience ever was when someone I was casually seeing tied me up, put headphones on me, blindedfolded me, and kept me in his bedroom for hours. I couldn't see, hear, or move. It was terrifying. He raped me, burned me, cut me, beat me. I could still smell the smell of my burning skin. He took off the blindfold and earbuds and tied a noose around my neck. I know he was trying to kill me. I passed out and came to later to him freaking out because he couldn't commit murder, it would ruin his academic career, he couldn't go to jail, he couldn't loose everything he worked for. I am 100% positive he is a clinic psychopath. I still have scars from this experience.

My last abusive boyfriend was chaotic and emotionally and physically abusive. I told him details about my past and he purposely re-enacted them because in his fits of rage he knew that would hurt me the most. He burned me once by holding me down with a lighter to my arm. Another time he put his belt around my neck and raped me anally while I passed out from lack of oxygen. After I left him he blackmailed me into sleeping with him. It was all seriously messed up.

For the very first time in my life I am loving in a safe environment with an amazingly loving and supportive boyfriend. I am in therapy and on medication. But the nightmares won't go away. I live in fear everywhere I go. I have flashbacks, nightmares, and mental breakdowns regularly. I self harm and abuse medication. I have low self-worth. It is extremely difficult for me to maintain close friendships because I am either withdrawn or emotionally volatile. I want to move forward so badly but sometimes I feel like the weight of these memories will consume me.
I don't know what I'm looking for here. Validation? Support? Another voice to assure me I'm not alone? I don't know. But I do know that I don't want to live like this anymore.",['conj'],0

I didn't think much of it, I thought I was just getting sick. Then my heart started racing and te room practically spinning. I was shaking a lot and thought for sure I would pass out.
Then I went to my 8th class, AP Lang and Comp. Since it's the first week of school i didn't know anyone which made it worse. I couldn't focus and then half of my vision was gone. It was really scary. The right side of y vision got blurry and I felt sick. I asked my teacher to go to the nurses (she's really funny and cool) and she asked what was wrong. I said I felt dizzy and she walked me to the hallway and asked if I had a condition and if she could let someone walk me. I told her I think it was my anxiety that just made something happen but it never got like this before. I was really scared. She told me that she also has anxiety and understood it was scary, she offered me a bottle of water to take with down the hall and called someone to walk me down.
When I got to the nurses she asked me what was wrong and I told her I was scared because my eye sight was going blurry and I couldn't see very well. I started to cry a little bit because I worried it wouldn't go away and the fact my heart had been racing for two hours was making me uncomfortable and I couldn't stop shaking. She let me lie down and offered to call my parents. I stayed for twenty minutes or so until I finally just calmed down. Someone had brougt my school stuff down and I only had 5 minutes before I had to catch the boss. My locker was near my AP class so I stopped by and thanked my teacher. There were other students in the room so instead of saying ""anxiety"" she just asked if it was something she said in class or I something happened, the word anxiety was like the white elephant or something. I really appreciated her not saying the word since people were there. I told her it was what we had talked about in the hallway. She told me she understood and she knows it it scary.
I didn't want her to think it was because of the class, it definitely wasn't. I've been looking forward to being in AP Lang since middle school, and I am I the class I dreamed of. I love t so far and it's only been two days. I have a really cool teacher, having a teacher that understands is just comforting. I feel bad she had to go through the same, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.
 She said if I ever need to talk that she was there.
I was still a little shaky after the bell rang so I went to say goodbye to my favorite teacher (another teacher I had last year.) and I gave her a hug because she always makes things feel better.

I think what triggered the attack was the school year starting. I haven't been takings meds like I should, and school has always been the biggest trigger. I've never had one so bad to where I thought for sure I would pass out. I'm thankful for both teachers that were there for me. My ap teacher was such a great big help.

mistakes and grammar errors in this post, and she's my ap lang teacher, but I'm typing with my phone, which, we all know is a pain in the butt.",['attr'],0

For a few years I've been getting anxiety issues, or at least I think I am. Recently, they've been getting worse. I usually got it once or twice a year, whenever I was nervous about going to camp and such. And I've recently been getting it within the last few months whenever it is that I go out to my girlfriends house, or if we're going to the movies or something. It's gotten to a point where I get so nervous before I leave the house that I vomit and such. But the odd part is the second I get in the door to her house and sit down a few minutes later I feel normal again. But the hardest part for me is getting there without vomiting, I can deal with the anxiety, I just don't want fluids coming up. For example, I was going with her family to an outing a few weeks ago and when I got to her house I had to excuse myself for a minute and I pretended to go to my car and get some water, although I ended up puking into a plastic bag because I got so nervous in my car(Thankfully no one saw). This is practically happening every time I see her now. I'm not exactly sure what I should do about it, I'm perfectly comfortable with her and everything. I guess it's just who I am.

A good friend of mine suffers from anxiety, and as a natural result, can be a little wrapped up in herself. I think I've been a good friend to her over the last couple of years, since she really opened up to me about how badly it affects her life. She talks a lot about things she stresses out about, which is a lot - stuff that I can't really understand what the big deal is, but I do try to empathize, and at the very least always offer a sympathetic ear, because I do understand that her anxiety isn't something you can just ""snap out of"" or ""stop worrying about"". I've read a lot about it and I encourage her to seek counselling etc. as she still hasn't really found a way to deal with her condition (no meds, and currently no therapy - she has tried a couple of therapists but they weren't the ""right fit"").

I haven't had any problem being her shoulder or wall to bounce off because things are generally well in my life and I am one of those people that friends end up confiding in about issues in their lives. It can sometimes be tiring for me, especially dealing with anxiety as I'll admit I do have (internal) moments of frustration that she can't take more decisive steps to help herself. I never air that kind of frustration to her, and I am generally a compassionate person so it's not a constant thing, just want you guys to understand that even on a good day, being the sounding board for an anxious friend comes with its own sort of stress.

However, my current problem is that I'm going through my own crap right now. Long story short we were supposed to meet for lunch a couple of weeks ago but I had to cancel because my Dad had a serious health crisis - well, he had a stroke. She replied saying oh no I hope he gets well soon - but since then, nada. No follow up to see how he's doing, or how I'm doing for that matter - he's doing okay considering, but he was stuck abroad at the time and it has left his hand paralysed, although the docs are still investigating and he's undergoing physio. So it could be a lot worse, but the point is that she doesn't have any of those details, all I was able to tell her in my own panicked text was that he had a stroke. And even though I am thankful that it was a relatively mild stroke, obviously it's an ongoing thing so it has been a stressful time for me. I felt a little stung that my friend never followed up with me to see how everything is going, especially considering the amount of love, concern and support I've offered her over the last couple of years.

She finally texted today - saying hello and a quick ""how are you"" before launching into another spiel about her current focus of stress and indecision (which we had been talking about for a couple of weeks before my Dad fell ill). As much as I want to maintain a compassionate attitude towards her, trying to remind myself that this is all part of her anxiety issues, being a little self-absorbed - well, to be honest, I'm pretty angry right now. I don't even want to reply to her because my immediate response is ""go fuck yourself"". The ONE time I am going through a very real crisis of my own and she dropped off the face of the planet only to resurface with her own problems again, 2 weeks later. No mention whatsoever of my Dad or how I'm coping with it. It takes a certain level of patience and strength to really be a friend to this person, and right now I don't have either.

This post has turned out a lot longer than I planned, and I don't really know what I'm looking for - I guess some insight into how she is thinking, how she might find it difficult to see past her own problems and engage with someone else's? Anyone else here who has a friend or family member suffering from anxiety who might have experienced something similar? Maybe this is just a rant at the end of the day, but any words of wisdom would be appreciated.

tl;dr - I've offered years of support to my anxious friend, she is offering none to me at the moment when I'm going through my own crisis. Not sure how to deal with that in a compassionate way when I'm feeling pretty let down by her. ",['appos'],0

 I don't know if I have social anxiety or something else... and I don't know what to do. I have seen a number of professionals (therapists, psychiatrists, etc) and none of them seem willing to say straight up ""you have anxiety."" 

I have been on a variety of meds, for a variety of disorders I was thought to have had (bipolar, depression, briefly ADD), all of which ended up being contradicted by different professionals. It seems no one can agree on what I have or the course of treatment for it.

The problem is, it comes and goes. Some days, I feel particularly confident and good about myself so I have no problem being happy and upbeat, talking to people, having things to say, not thinking about what they are thinking and not feeling uncomfortable (or if I do, it seems like a normal amount if meeting new people or something). 

Most days, I get anxiety around large crowds (always afraid of getting in a fight, getting sized up, not looking like ""a bitch"" -- I am tall and athletic so when I do get in fights, it's not a big deal but I constantly assess threats around me and look for someone to be disrespecting me in some way). When I have to talk to attractive women, I sometimes get shaky and can't think. I worry about what other guys in the room are going to think of me, and if they are going to judge the way I talk to her.

It's such a burden because I know I'm not a super weird guy, and I'm not unattractive to most. It's my shitty anxious personality that holds me back.

I have had substance abuse problems, which I feel is less of a separate issue and more of a way to feel better due to my anxiety. When I feel socially anxious, it feels good to drink. So a lot of times I can't go out without drinking. I also have used hard drugs because it feels better to be focused on being high or the obsession you get from those substances that replaces the obsession you have about yourself and what people are thinking about you.. 

I have come a long way in my anxiety. I have learned how to control it sometimes and have learned that a lot of that comes through the practice of walking through fear and doing what you don't want to do. I think that's great, but it only gets you so far. There has to be a way to get rid of the remnants of anxiety so that I don't have to ""walk through it"" anymore. Right?

I have always wanted to try Xanax or something, but I don't want that slow dopey pilled out demeanor you often see with people that are on those drugs... And because of the substance abuse history doctors don't want to give it to me (fair enough). 

I am so tired of thinking about what other people are thinking about me and feeling that shaky nervous feeling around women. Looking forward to your thoughts and experience on this... 

Just wanted to add, I have tried:

Depression meds

Bipolar meds

ADD (just vyvanse)

CBT and/or DBT (works a little bit)

Exercise (it helps some, but only temporarily)

Vedic meditation (helps a little, but is very time consuming - 40 minutes a day)

My anxiety is pretty manageable, but there are times when it still acts up and last night was one such time. It would be nice to have some meds around to level it out, and although I do keep a Xanax or two around for emergency reasons, there's a bit of an issue. 

My anxiety typically will pop up in social situations. I also have a hobby which involves craft beer. I was at a friend's place last night for a beer tasting (we will drink several different beers in smaller pours over the course of the night, typically around 2-4 ounce pours of each) and at the end of the night, I was hit with a good anxiety attack so I had to leave earlier than I was planning to. 

At this point, I had some Xanax at my hotel room but I was unable to take it due to the alcohol. I won't do it, and I am firm on that. The rest of the night was spent in bed trying to shake it, and well, that did not lead to a comfortable night. 

However, there are other meds out there. Does anyone here take anything specific that works for them yet allows you to drink? Alcohol on it's own does not seem to be a trigger for me, but sometimes the wooziness of being drunk/buzzed can trigger it for me, hence why I do samplers/flights/tastings as opposed to guzzling beers.

I've now been on prozac 10mg/day for 4-5 years and have seen 3 different therapist.  Maybe a total of 8-10 months between all 3.  I've had some success in improving, but in general it just keeps getting worse.  I'm constantly worried that I'm going to get sick/be sick.  Driving has now become a problem for me recently.  It wasn't before, but about a year ago I had a panic attack in a car thinking, ""I'm so far from home, what if I get sick out here in this car? ""  Ever since then, driving has been a problem for me.  It's not that bad if I'm by myself, but with someone is almost a guaranteed panic attack.  This is fucking me up right now because I've just started dating a wonderful girl.  FIRST date, I pick her up from her house...start having a panic attack, and quickly make up some story about how I forgot I need to be up early, and if we could take separate cars it would be very helpful...So I drove her BACK TO HER HOUSE so we could take our own cars...it was very awkward and embarrassing for me...although she was pretty cool with it.


I CONSTANTLY analyze things for the risk of getting me sick.  EVERYTHING.  If I go out to eat, my mind is going a mile-a-minute thinking, ""What if the food is bad?  What if the water is contaminated?  What if I'm already sick, and eating something is going to upset my stomach enough to make me vomit?"".  My mind sort of automatically runs through every single possible bad situation that could arise, and then the resulting anxiety either causes a panic attack, or forces me to just bail.  My mind is a master of being able to see ANY possible way something could cause me to get sick in any situation.  

I know this has been a long read, and if you've made it this far thank you very much for your time.  I'm starting to reach the end of my rope with this and feel like I can't keep forcing myself to be semi-functional in society any longer.

Anyway my anxiety is getting worse. I'm just waiting for the day where I have a full out panic attack. I've had one before a few years ago. About 3 weeks ago I went into a gas station and there was a lot of people in there. My anxiety went so high. I felt like I couldn't breath so I had to walk out. I knew if I would have stayed in there that I would have had the panic attack. I'm pretty good at noticing when I'm about to have one and getting out of the situation. That's happening for often now. I can't go into a store by myself because I know my anxiety is going to torture me. I usually go with my mom but yeah I'm 25 and that's really not an option I like but it works. I feel like my mom is the only one that gets me and what I'm going through. My dad doesn't believe me sometimes or I don't think he gets it. But going back to my anxiety getting worse now my dad is starting to believe it. He keeps telling my mom he's worried about me. He notices now when my anxiety is bad and when I'm depressed. At least now he kinda understands what I'm going through. Yeah I don't know what to do. Right now I'm so lost and I'm sitting in my room alone on a Sunday as always. I'm so scared about the future. I'm going to be 26 and still living like this while the world outside moves on and I miss out. I always had a goal of living a somewhat normal life by time I'm 30 and that seems likes it's going to be here before I know it. I don't want to be 30 and living like this. I want to be living on my own. I want to have a job where I can make a living. I want to have relationships and have friends that I get to see on weekends. But right now I don't see that. I just see a future where my anxiety still controlling my life. Anxiety is my best and only friend right now.

Almost eight years ago when I was about to finish my apprenticeship as an IT guy, I just passed out in the garden of my (ex)girlfriend for no real reason.
I was doing sports for years, my body was in great shape and everything went perfect till then. I already planned my life for the next 10 years and so on.

Soooo, the moment I woke up again I wasn't able to do anything. Couldn't stand up, couldn't talk, was just about able to keep my own poop in (yummy). They called the ambulance, brought me to the hospital, checked everything -&gt; found nothing. I was laying in the bed for the next three to four weeks. Not because the doctor told me to, but because I wasn't able to do anything else without passing out again.

When I was about to get better, the same thing happened again..... and again a few weeks later. The third time was the turning point in my life when everything went shi*.

**Current situation**

It's hard for me to leave the house. And the biggest problem are appointments. Whenever there is one, my body and my brain are in deep trouble. I can't sleep the day before. I feel sick. Diarrhea. Thinking way too much and so on. If it's nothing REALLY important, most of the time I just call the person/or whoever and tell him/her/them that something came in between and I don't have time anymore. Bad thing about this: I started calling everything an appointment. Even buying food or getting money from the bank (and it's only a 2 minutes walk). It sometimes kills me.

I moved 400km (around 250mi) away from home 	to live in a shared apartment with some friends. Just to see if I can live on my own when there's no mum anymore who does everything for me when I can't do it on my own. Well, I can.. barely.

Being jobless isn't the hardest part for me right now. Having no job isn't such a big thing in germany, since you can live pretty well from the money you get if you know how to use it in the right way and don't waste it (of course I want to work, but it's just not possible right now). I don't know what to do right now... I'm not thinking about doing something stupid to myself (seriously I would never do that), but there's no energy left. I can't find new friends like this. I can't easily hang out in a park and talk to other, even though I have no problem at all with talking to strangers. 

Women always helped me in the last years. I was able to do much more when there was someone but it was never a real thing. No relationship, just some good times for a few weeks until they realized, that I'm not that easy to handle with all my problems. Yeah, well. I'm lonely and it's some sort of depressing. Tried so much (serveral therapies, medication), failed so often. I don't even have the learning effect anymore when I accomplished something I should be proud of. The next time I have to do it, I shi* my pants and fail.

Soooo... wow that's a long text. I doubt that I can find anyone here who lives in the northern part of germany and is able to help me face to face. Is there any great advice you guys could give me that is more than just ""Don't give up""? I'm still so young and I don't want to turn 30 with what I have now.

So, where to begin? Well I first found out I had anxiety issues back in 2002-2003ish. I had my first ""event"" while laying in bed after a long night smoking copious amount of marijuana. It was mind racing, body shaking, and heart pounding fun let me tell you. All of my fears came bubbling to the surface and I faced a lot of demons that night. I finally passed out after a few hours when my body just physically couldn't take it anymore. I woke up the next morning more afraid than I had ever been. That was it, I had finally lost it and was going crazy just like my old man. I rejected everything in my life in one fell swoop. Dumped my then girlfriend, pushed all my friends away, and flushed all my pot down the toilet (still can't be around the stuff actually). 

Fast forward a few years
I'm away at college. Still having anxiety attacks, but nothing like that first doozy. Mostly just the world goes ""weird"". Things I've seen everyday look different. Reality doesn't make sense anymore (wtf are up with ears? why do they look like that?!). I feel lightheaded and disconnected from the world. I figure this is the beginning of mania... I'm slowly cracking up. No one knows, it's my dirty little secret. If they found out surly I'd be thrown away in a mental hospital right?! I live my life as best I can, but there is always that nagging fear I'm going to have one while at school, my job, or driving. I start to avoid things I once loved just to avoid a ""trigger"". My world becomes smaller and smaller every day. I soon realize this is going to destroy me if I keep going on as is. I decide to fight back! I hit the internet to educate myself (which was a big step because every time I thought to look into my condition I had an attack). Ohhh the things I learned! 1) I'm not cracking up (yaaaaay), 2) it's an anxiety disorder (neato), 3) it's never really going to go away (booooo), but 4) there are literally millions of people like me. Kind of a mixed bag really, but since it wasn't me going professional crazy I came away feeling much better. I used everything I learned to wage a war against my anxiety on every front. I meditated.  I exercised. I ate better. I slept more. I grabbed my anxiety by the balls and didn't let go.

A few years later
The war is all but over. I fought my anxiety on every battlefield and took no prisoners. Drinking caffeine a trigger? Get me a double! Let do this here and now in the middle of starbucks! I wanted my anxiety to attack just so I could spank it into submission. Every fight made me stronger and wiser. I found out that when you invite anxiety attacks into your life the little cowards never showed up for a fight... but you have to be sincerer. You can't say you want one to avoid getting one... they'll smell the fear on you. You have to reallllly want one. I mean ""back stiff, muscles clenched, wishing for one to show its fucking face just so you can smash it"" kinda want it. The war was over... the littered remains of anxiety attacks surround my feet and I moved on. 

A few years later
Life chugging along... unfortunately right into an unhealthy relationship. I'm walking on egg shells. I like this girl, but god damn almost anything I do can send her into a mood. It finally happens... BAM! Anxiety attack. We had just had unprotected sex (I know tmi) and suddenly I'm filled with a fear of AIDS or STDS... she says she is clean... but is she really? What if I get AIDS? What is she has AIDS and doesn't know?! Sure, she's been careful but you never know... I start to freak out. It's been a long while since I felt like this... I know this feeling but those huge combative balls I grew just a few years back have now shrunken into two feeble little raisins. She asks what's wrong. I tell her (HUUUUUUUUUGE MISTAKE). So now I have a huge anxiety attacking going on, an angry girlfriend asking me wtf an anxiety attack is and WTF did I mean by her having AIDS. *sigh* Looking back now it's a little funny, but at the time there was no laughing. My head fells fuzzy... my lips are tingling along with my fingers... I start to feel faint. HOLY BALLS! I thought the first anxiety attack I  had was bad? Well this is its bullyass big brother. I take a seat and put my head between my legs... it helps... not much but it helps. She is still drilling me about what's going on and why did I think she had AIDS. I decide it's time to nope the hell outta there. I stand up, slap my face (which actually helped a lot!), get dressed and leave. With every mile I put between us the world seems to get back to normal. I arrive home and pass out. Within a few weeks we're broken up and funny enough the anxiety attacks fade as well.

a few years later
I meet my current girlfriend. She's wonderful, and perfect, and amazing, and blah blah blah. Our big first date is coming closer... as is a familiar feeling. Fuuuucccck. I gave anxiety a taste of blood with my last relationship and now it's gonna come barge into this one as well. Well... let it! I was once quite the slayer of anxiety attacks, and although my blade might be tarnished it should still work! I go on the date and about halfway through dinner it begins. I excuse myself to the bathroom to gather the troops. I'm standing in a piss soaked restroom (it was a nice restaurants too... I was surprised) looking into the mirror deciding my best plan of attack. Just sit there and deal with it? Risky plan... it's been effective in the past but what will my date think of a sweaty man who looks like a deer caught in headlights? Excuse myself from dinner and go home? Well I'll still have to drive her back to her house and then drive all the way back to my house (a few hours away); that plan sucks in every direction. Tell her? Wait, what? Not only tell someone about my condition, but tell the girl of my dreams? That's a booooold move.  I take a look in the mirror... fuck it. I go back out and spill the beans. I was pretty sure my head was going to explode. She cocks her head and looks a tad confused. After a moment she says ""Well, what can I do to help?"" 

Have you ever seen a video of a chuck of glacier falling into the ocean? That's how it felt to hear those words. All the stress. All the anxiety just fell away. Granted I still felt like I had an anxiety attack, but there was nothing behind it. Soon my muscles relaxed and my lightheadedness faded. Long story short, we went on to have a wonderful date. The next three years are total anxiety attack free bliss....

Tuesdays December 10, 2013.
I'm sitting at the computer. Ms Amazingpants and I have been bickering all morning. It's almost time for work so I stand up. Uhhhh feel a little bit lightheaded... kinda woozy... maybe it was those meds I took... maybe it was my breakfast... maybe its low blood sugar... maybe its high blood pressure... maybe it's a stroke... maybe it's a heart attacks... my mind and heart start to race. Before I know it I'm suffering one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my life. Room is spinning, heat is racing, lips and face going numb, and I'm shaking all over. I'm in bad shape. I've never felt like this before... sure I've had a couple doozy anxiety attacks, but surely this is something more. I feel awful. Whereas most of my other attacks have been mental, this one is strangely physical. I knew I was mostly likely having an anxiety attack, but the wooziness... the spinning... the numbness... it was all a bit too unsettling to leave to chance. I decide it's time to go to the ER...

a few hours later
I'm sitting in an ER. I have an IV in one arm and a heart rate monitor on the other. I'm looking at Ms. Amazingpants sitting against the wall. The entire wall is spinning counterclockwise behind her. I'm trembling, nauseous, tingling, and breathing fast. Doctors and nurses have all came and went. It's just her and I. I slowly feel myself nodding off. I jerk back awake every time. Slowly I being to lose the fight. I nod off. When I wake up the world is right again. The room is no longer spinning. I'm no longer numbs and shaking. Embarrassment sets in. About half way through the ordeal I knew it was probably anxiety, but I needed to make sure... In the next bed I hear a doctor talking to a lady suffering from lupus and a laundry list of other ailments... and here I am... taking up a bed because I got stressed out. Final diagnosis? Dehydration, anxiety, and hyperventilation. After I discharge myself I go home and go to bed for the rest of the day. I wake up later and realize that a paper bag, 2lts of water, and a couple hours could have saved me the thousands of dollars that ER trip is gonna cost me. Balls...

Saturday December 14, 2013.
Here I sit, typing down my most personal experiences to be judged by unknown individuals on a forum out in the clouds of the interweb. I still think about the other day... could it have been prevented? Or was it something I needed... to remember how this disorder is as much a part of me as my hair or skin. Just a little forget-me not from my buddy anxiety. Wish I could say I'm doing better, but I find myself always questioning. Am I woozy because I didn't eat enough for breakfast? Hope not... my appetite went to shit along with my bank account on Tuesday. Am I drinking enough water? Am I woozy because I haven't been drinking enough? Maybe I've been drinking too much... I hear that can mess you up too. Is this the beginning of another attack? I hope not.. I gotta get to work. Last month anxiety attacks couldn't have been further away in my thoughts... now it consumes them. That's the bitch of it right? The more you fear them the more likely they are to come for you. 

I haven't given up though... if anything I'm more resolute than I've ever been. Am I out of shape to wage another war? A bit. Is that gonna stop me? Nope. My anxiety feeds off my fear. I don't have time for either. The more I understand my anxiety attacks the better I get at fighting them. With every shift in how these attacks effect me I learn new ways of coping and combating them. I am better for every attack I have. I may get defeated (like my trip to the ER), but good god damn I learned a lot.

I'm 26, married, with a one-and-a-half year old son. For probably 10 years now, I've had a slow and steady stream of crippling fears that make it very difficult to function. As ridiculous as it seems, I am very anti-medication (I was on some for five years, which helped form my opinion), so I haven't considered the option just yet. Maybe it's time to? I don't know.

My fears stem from some abuse in my childhood, this I know. I'm self-aware enough that I understand the reasoning behind some of my fears, but not all.

Some of my fears are irrational, some are justified (maybe?). So you can get an idea, my fears include: the dark, being alone in my house, my house in general, murderers/rapists/general ""bad guys"", acts of violence or terrorism, open water (and thus, boats), flying, foreign countries/other states, not being in my comfort zone, big cities/large crowds, elevators, the list goes on. 

These fears have begun to cripple me to the point where I don't WANT to leave my house, but I force myself to. I fear I've begun to develop some level of agoraphobia, and I worry that within the next few years, things will have gotten to bad, that it will begin to affect my son and instill irrational fears in him. I don't want to become a shut in. I'm unraveling though, and I just don't have a clue how to handle this. Any advice?

Honestly, though, I'm not sure if it's even worth treating.  It controls my life to a certain extent, but for the most part, it doesn't cause me any real problems.  It kind of centers around the kitchen, for some reason; I have a hard time letting anyone else cook or clean because they do it wrong.  I end up hovering the whole time and dying inside when they put a dish away in the wrong place or don't chop an onion ""right"".  It's... more like I'm a perfectionist than anything.

This could potentially be a huge rant, but I've never talked to anyone about this. And the more I think about it, comparing how I am now to my childhood, it starts to make sense. And I know self-diagnosing isn't the way to go about it but every sign seems to point to anxiety.

I've always been... weird, I guess? Most of my memories from preschool are of me getting in trouble: yelling at the teacher because she stopped pushing the wagon, getting frustrated with other kids, feeling guilty. All the time. If I had to describe what I felt most throughout my childhood, it was guilt. (And still do, actually, for the most insignificant little things).

Elementary school: don't remember having ""behavioral problems"" or anything until 4th grade. We had these stupid spelling packets due every Friday and I always waited until the bus ride on Friday morning to do them. Never finished them, always got in trouble. I hated 4th grade and my teacher and got all ""N's"" (the equivalent to fail) in citizenship (completing assignments, getting along with others kids, etc.)

5th grade I started getting these terrible stomachaches. I remember crying and saying it felt like someone had stabbed me in the stomach. I took some sort of antiacid for a bit. My mom bought me a box of Lactaid, assuming it was lactose intolerance. That same year, I got my first migraine (throwing up, crippling headache) and have had consistent headaches ever since, pretty much every day.

My social skills sucked then, too. I would be completely embarrassed by stupid things. Like, someone finds my underwear at a sleepover with all girls that I know? NO WAY I would ever admit they were mine, even if no one else cared. If my friends went to the movies and didn't invite me, I'd cry my eyes out. I worried constantly about what everyone thought of me.

Middle school I got into this weird habit that if someone hit my left arm, I'd have to hit the right arm in the exact same way. No idea how it started, but I did it for everything. This was around the same time that I was trying really hard to fit in with the ""popular"" crowd and failing miserably. Meaning, being humiliated in front of the girl I admired, called ""the ugliest girl I have ever met"", had rumors spread about me. Eventually I was eating lunch alone in the library.

When my ""friends"" found out about my ""hit the other side"" habit, they started ramming into me in the halls, or once even holding me down and punching me on one side. That one incident I started crying and couldn't breathe and begged them to stop. My older sister noticed me touching random objects in Target, then running back to ""touch them right"". She told my parents she thought I might have OCD (she was diagnosed with anxiety) but they brushed the idea off.

I taught myself how to cope with the touching rituals, especially once people started really taking advantage of it. I'll still find myself rubbing my arm or leg to ""even it out"" but not in front of other people.

Highschool was an entirely different story. I won't go into extreme details, but I was sexually assaulted at the end of freshmen year by my ""boyfriend"". I didn't tell anyone for years how it actually happened, and tried to forget about it.

But besides that one incident, I can't completely condemn high school. I barely thought about it, made new friends, got decent grades, even went on an exchange year to Italy. I'd actually say that's when I felt the most peaceful and at ease with myself.

The reason I'm writing here now is the next stage in my life. I'm finishing up my freshmen year of college, and I have never felt as unstable or exhausted as I do now. Again, I'll skip the long story, but I found myself in an abusive relationship (this time, with a lot worse than a 15-year-old boy). For some reason, I kept going back to this guy, despite the physical, emotional, and mostly sexual trauma of it all. In the process, I lost my best friend of five years, who I'd been dating before the abusive prick.

This best friend and all of his friends turned against me. It was a semester-long ordeal in which I was constantly on the verge of tears, stopped caring about schoolwork, and had re-adopted that feeling of guilt. Guilt, slung across my shoulders, dragging pain down through my head and neck.

He came up to talk to me one day and my hands started sweating before I even opened the door. The moment I saw him the tears started flowing. I sat down on the couch and while we tried to talk about feelings, my leg was trembling (or vibrating might have been a better word for it). I started hyperventilating, and I actually asked him to leave.

The past few months are the worst it's ever been. I am always tired; I'll wake up in the morning and all of my muscles are sore. I didn't go to classes for almost a month because I couldn't physically force myself to go. And if I did, the work that I had missed would stress me out even more, making it even harder to go.

It's like I'm just dragging myself around, this terrible sense of guilt slung over my shoulders, pulling down pain through my head and neck, weighing me down. It's guilt, guilt from accidentally drinking someone's juice in 7th grade, guilt from yelling at a teacher, guilt from letting a boy force me into doing things I didn't want to, guilt from not hanging out with a friend because I'm too tired. Guilt from feeling guilty about nothing.

I'm tired of randomly crying when I'm out with friends. Everyone will be hanging out fine and I'll start thinking about what everyone else is thinking. I worry about whether or not anyone really wants me there. I've recently made some pretty fucking amazing friends, one whose going to be my roommate, yet I'm never convinced that they actually like me. Eventually I sneak outside and smoke a cigarette by myself, wondering why I'm upset when nothing's even happened.

If they all get together without me, I (silently) freak out, like they're all relieved I didn't find out about it. I know it's irrational - they invite me out all the time, talk about how they just gushed to someone about how great I am. But I take every compliment and every reassurance with a grain of salt.

But the worst guilt of all is when I can't find the energy to go hang out with someone, even for a few hours. I can't explain to people how I'm feeling because I'm not even sure myself. I'm supposed to go to a friend's in a few hours; he's an awesome fella, one of my closest friends here, yet I haven't seen him in weeks because I've barely left my room. If he doesn't answer a text, I get really stressed out that he's ignoring me. When he finally answers, I dread the prospect of leaving my room and walking there.

Sorry for the long post - I just needed to tell someone. I never told my sister more about my anxiety, for fear of worrying her. My mom was prescribed anti-anxiety meds herself just a few months ago, but I don't want my parents to pay for a therapist we can't afford if it's not a serious issue.

I don't really have a question here. I think, I just need a hug and for someone to tell me that I'm not crazy. Or if that I am crazy, it's not such a hopeless thing.",['oprd'],0

He prescribed me a low dosage of Celexa and some supplements to help loose 10 or so pounds because he thought my depression was weight based from not doing anything all the time. 

I was afraid I would become this happy 24/7 nothing wrong can come my way kind of guy, which is nothing like me. I am a realist, shit happens, karma is a bitch, etc kind of person. But nothing like that happened. 

Gradually I noticed a change after the side effects wore off. I can talk to people more, be in a better mood most days (still have my bad days sometimes), and try to put myself out there more. Sure I am still working on that girlfriend but I met a girl last semester in my class who I am trying to get with or at least keep in touch as a friend. Whatever happens, happens. 

So for general anxiety I noticed a big change and for social I noticed a slight change, I am still going to therapy and he knows I still need work with the social aspect of it but I think the meds helped me by 70-80% and that is huge to me and should be for other people too. 

So I know the meds route can be scary for some for many reasons but I think it's a great tool to help people with anxiety and depression. It never hurts to ask your Dr for a recommendation or look around your area for a psychiatrist.  ",['compound'],0

A little background: In April 2010, about a month after my first child was born, I had an anxiety induced breakdown. The pressure of being a father, compounded by a bad work situation and my family was just too much for me and I ended up entering an anxiety triggered depression for about 4 months. I couldn't work, I was barely able to bring myself to take care of my daughter. 

After about 8 months of therapy and trying just about every anti-aniety/anti-depressive med I finally found a combination of Ativan and BuSpar that got me back in the saddle. I've been doing ok until very recently. I've become more and more impatient with others, and I've been picking fights with my wife lately. 

It just seems like I'm sliding backwards toward circumstances that led to my first breakdown. If somebody expresses disappointment or acts like they're unhappy with me, I'm a nervous wreck. I worry about what I need from them, and what they could take from me if they decided that I'm not worth loving/caring about. I'm seriously ready to give up again and worry that this time I may not care enough to get better. It's not that I'm having suicidal thoughts, more that I'm having ""I don't think anybody would be worse off if I died"" thoughts. 

I've mentioned this to my Psych and Therapist, but I don't want to play ""medication bingo' again with all the side effects it entails, and my therapist, while well meaning is no match for the anxiety and pessimism in my head.

-my mother suffers from anxiety and depression 

-I recently started smoking marijuana. I do it about once a week to once every two weeks. I don't know if this whole thing might be my bodies reaction to the weed, but there is no correlation that I have seen between when I smoke and if I haven't smoked for a while.

Background info:
22 year old female, just graduated college and applied to a graduate school. Work a part time job at a restaurant. 

I'm not even 100% sure I have anxiety. I went to a doctor multiple times because I was having frequent stomach pain and heart burn. When the doctors didn't see anything wrong, my boyfriend suggested it may be anxiety manifesting itself physically. So I went to a PA who specialized in anxiety and told her how I felt and she sort of told me that I had anxiety and prescribed me prozac. That was two months ago.

My whole life I have been a very negative person and I had not realized it until recently. When something bad happens, I get into a downward spiral where I just can't let it go without getting upset and shaming myself for messing up. I have negative thoughts that invade my head and I cannot get rid of them or just let them go despite how irrational I know they are.  When I get into a fight with someone and we make up I still feel like something is wrong even though there is nothing wrong except me making it seem so. I honestly did not realize this was not healthy until recently. Also in discovering all of this, I have also realized my self confidence is quite low. 

I am still coming to terms with the fact that I may have anxiety.  I never took the medication out of fear and my parents being very against me taking them. Now I am considering therapy but I'm afraid I won't be able to get help because I feel like my anxiety if I do have it, is too mild. I feel like I'm just being irrational and I need to learn to be positive and believe in myself. I just have no idea how. I do know that I want to change. I want to have control over my thoughts and feelings. I want to let things go and know that everything will be okay and I don't have to tear myself apart first to realize that.

I believe I'm having a lot of hormone problems related to my menstrual cycle too, and I think that is definitely contributing, but I'm really just worried about what is going on with my brain and why it has gotten worse (I should add that I have a lot of health anxiety too). 

This period of bad anxiety I'm having HAS been mixed in with good days, but it seems like at least every couple days I'm getting upset over something minuscule, getting angry at my significant other for no reason, feeling like I'm going to have a panic attack out of no where (which never used to be a problem for me), obsessing over what underlying disease I might have, and then crying over how messed up and just not like myself I feel. And this hasn't been every night, but a lot of nights, I'm so unbelievably uncomfortable and restless when trying to go to sleep and after tossing and turning, I just lay there with my heart pounding and a heavy feeling in my chest because everything is quiet and I'm actually AFRAID I'm going to start hallucinating or hearing things. I feel so hypersensitive and aware that I feel like I'm seeing little things move in my peripheral vision even though it might just be an actual shadow I'm seeing or a little bit of light coming through the window. And then I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't think it's ever been this bad. Trying to read or concentrate on things has gotten more difficult and I get to the point of holding back tears when I don't understand something. Nothing feels right. I have no sense of security in myself or anything else right now, I keep feeling distant from everything, and I just really want to feel better. Does this sound like anxiety? Or am I losing my mind? What calms you down when you're feeling almost at your worst? I don't want to just deal with these feelings day by day, I want to do what I need to do to be healthy and stable on a regular basis. 

I should probably add- the only obvious thing I can think of that has changed between the time that I was doing well and the past few months is that I moved in with my boyfriend. It was hard to adjust to at first, but I did and I'm happy living with him. The only thing I'm wondering is if the lack of alone time I'm getting now is affecting me a lot more than I realize.

If you are open to other reasons you are feeling anxious, I would suggest [researching if you are an Empath or not](http://www.psi-zone.net/whatis.html).



[Check this site out too if you are interested further](http://empathsupport.com/).



Empaths are HSP (highly sensitive people) that pick up on the moods and energies around them.

I know damn well what depression alone is like, but anxiety came, and then depression mixed in, and it's all kinds of fun. Also, I simply trust the collective mindset of r/Anxiety more than r/Depression when it comes to these things. We are the over-analyzers, after all. Anyway,

The gravity inside of my head is insane. It's like a black hole that steals the light and won't let anything go.

What I really meant was, ""The stress is too much to handle on top of the depression, and I have no place to hide.""

My hugest stressors right now are: Work, anxiety, discomfort (generally speaking), money, medication, sleep (or lack thereof), and it all originates from my god damn head. It seems as if I have no way to deal with it all, no way out, no place to hide, nothing to look forward to. Having been generally stressed and ridden with anxiety that kills my feelings and abilities to function for the duration of my life so far, I'm at the point where I'm about to just leave and say ""fuck it."" Leave everything behind, burn it all, to take everything locked up in my head and fucking unleash it on everyone and everything around me all at once.

There is a minimum of one-hundred reasons why I would be unhappy, but to sum it up, it's the lack of happiness throughout life so far that is leaving me feeling so ripped off and convinced that it will not get better soon enough to stop me from giving in or giving up.

So, I have three options:

1: Keep Trying

As I have been for years, NON-STOP. I have received no result as of yet. I have not become better, or, at least, not enough to give me a reason to think that trying to become better actually leads to becoming better. The process is simply too inefficient and takes too long, and I'm much too impatient to put up with it. It's kind of like if I would just quit trying, I could finally fall to where I'm supposed to, to be in my place. If I would quit holding myself up, I'd fall into the fire or the sea or whatever place. But just ""letting go"" right now can take minimal effort compared to how much effort I put into keeping myself alive. So, point 2:

2: Give In

Hospitalize myself. Put myself in a place where I have no choice but to be fixed. The place where I belong. I'm talking mental hospital, here, but probably a ""real"" hospital to start out. This way, I probably throw away the things that I still own and the ""friends"" that I still have. At least, that's how I feel it is. I throw it all away and get to stand there and watch it all burn. Strangely, I think that would be satisfying. Little effort, guaranteed result.

3: Give Up

Given my current situation, there is actually a way in which I may be able to very easily kill myself. A way that will probably happen unless I lift a finger to prevent it. And probably within a couple of weeks from now. This reality has become very possible in my mind, and I've actually grown to be disgusted by all of the things that I own, thinking that there's no point in having all of these useless damn decorations and clothes and everything else because I won't be alive to even see it. Hence why I took some old belongings and burnt them last week. I just wanted to kill away the memories, and I felt a legitimate smile, watching it burn. It felt like one of the few things I would actually remember.

If there's a fourth option to be here, I'm open to suggestions. I haven't decided on one yet, but option one has been playing on repeat for years and years and I just want to hit the goddamn stop button. I just want it to stop. Just make it stop.

tl;dr: I'm unhappy with what I have been through so far and I want it to stop or change, now. What do I do?",['conj'],0

I'm 22 years old and get anxiety when I hear about health conditions. I'm 100% healthy, and have no genetic predispositions to diseases or illnesses. Yet, whenever I read about people having heart attacks, seizures, bipolar disorder strokes, etc., I feel the start of a panic attack. I usually push the attack away with my mind, but the looming anxiety and attack possibility is always there. 

I have a lot of stress in my life, and it doesn't help that I work in a hospital, where medical issues surround me. I just moved 2,000 miles away from home to a new city away from my family and friends. I don't know if that's causing it because it happened a few weeks after I moved here and started my job. 

Please help me. How can I treat this? (no medications, prefferably). I want to change the way I think. I don't want these medical issues to scare me.

I wish I had never started on benzos.

After a few weeks, things were still going very well, but I started to notice some significant cognitive decline. More specifically, I felt like my mind was less well connected to my body. My typing suffered, I became clumsier, and I often struggled with tip-of-the-tongue syndrome. So, I talked to my psychiatrist and decided to taper off of Klonopin. 

I had been taking 1.5mg a day, so I reduced the dose by 0.25mg (half a pill) per week. Anxiety returned for sure, but it was no worse than the prior 26.5 years of my life, so I was managing OK. And then the time came to stop altogether. I'd been on 0.25mg daily and had been feeling OK. 

I took my last dose on a Sunday morning. By the following Wednesday, I was in severe withdrawal. Headaches, vertigo, hand tremors, SEVERE anxiety, and sweating were all present and accounted for. By Friday I decided I couldn't cope, so I called my psychiatrist again...but apparently he only works Mondays and Wednesdays! Since I was jonesing like a fiend and could barely function, I had to make the call alone to start taking the klonopin again.

So, now I'm back on 1.5mg daily. And I still hate it. It's become a source of anxiety in and of itself, rather than a solution. I'm back to having racing super fast thoughts and being unable to focus well. I did talk to my psychiatrist the following Monday; we're going to start the taper again and then he has another drug that will help me get all the way off the benzos at the end. 

So, if your psychiatrist recommends benzodiazepines...tread carefully. I never thought I would feel like an addict, but I do now. I barely drink and don't do any drugs, but I feel like I have failed, like I need to be in a 12 step program or something because I am hooked on these stupid yellow pills in order to get through the day.

Current meds I'm on are Venlafaxine (225mg/day), Quetiapine (300mg/day) and Gabapentin (900mg/day).



Every day, without fail, around 7pm the panic begins. Here's what we (myself, my wife, the doctor(x3)) have tried so far:



**Diazapam, Lorazapam, Clonazepam**
Super-high tolerance. I took 30mg Diazapam, 20mg Lorazapam, 14mg Clonozapam and I barely felt it. It wasn't enough to stop the panic, I still had attacks while taking these doses, and the doctor wasn't happy with the high dosage so these have been ruled out.



**Gabapentin and Quitiapine - High Evening Dose**
Trying 200mg Quitiapine and 300mg Gabapentine as should give sedative effects, and my word it did the first few days. First night I was absolutely sedated (beyond where I would want to be), then it tapered to quite sedated, lightly sedated, not sedated, nothing. Now I take the same dose, absolutely no sedative effects, anxiety and panic persist and take over - however I do fall asleep hard ~3 hours after taking it so there must be some effect.



**Mindfullness Course**
Online course, 4 weeks. Has done nothing so far except remove £60 from my bank account. Based on buddhist meditation, all about focusing on the body and oneself. ""Body scans"" are a big part of it and they *always* end in a huge panic attack as they inevitably (as part of it) get to ""what am I feeling around the chest and heart"" to which the answer is always ""chest pain and a racing heartbeat"". Also I'm incredibly judgemental. I'm a complete dick from the internet. I know Google and all that silicon-valley lot are swearing by this at the moment, but I'm afraid my bullshit meter is going off. Feels like it will end up on a penn &amp; teller episode. 


There's several people around town selling this now at between £45 and £75 an hour. One even had a 6 month contract he tried to get me to sign. Nope.

I'm continuing with the online course as I've been told to ""just do it and don't judge it"" by the course and several online blogs &amp; peeps who say it's fabulous.

I feel like I'm out of options. I genuinely and honestly do not want to go back to drinking, but when I was I simply had AWFUL Anxiety in the mornings, I drank that away at lunch and drank it away again in the evenings. 1/3

Now I just have AWFUL anxiety in the mornings, AWFUL anxiety at lunch and GIGANTIC anxiety attacks in the evenings. 3/3, heck even 10/3 seeing how bad the evening attacks are getting

I've been fighting anxiety for almost a year now. Racking my fucking brains trying to figure out what is wrong with me. Desperate to figure out how it came back after all these years...

I'm in an accelerated nursing program. For over a year I've been trying to cram my brain with as much medical knowledge as I can. I really want to be a nurse, I think I'd be good at it.

Last week, we took a medication math test. The only passing grade is 100%. I fucking got 18/20. I missed one god damn question. In any other case, 18/20 would be awesome. But I missed one fucking question. It was probably one of the trick questions they snuck in. 

Anyways, I realized tonight that my anxiety is because my nursing program is messed up. For over a year now I've tried to be the best nursing student I can be. But because I've missed ONE QUESTION I have to take a retest. Miss one question again and I'm out. Meaning for a week or two I have to walk around with that over my head. Miss a question and the years I've put in to this whole thing... the money I've got in it... all wasted. 

I've wasted 3 years of my life with nothing to show for it... all on 18/20.

So after a lot of drinking I've realized that my anxiety is completely reasonable. 

The math test isn't the only thing causing me stress with my program. But it might be the reason I stop going.

Anxiety isn't cool. It gets you Tumblr reblogs, sure, but true pain is suffered in silence. No post can display the pain, the suffering, the hurt. Having it doesn't make you friends. Worrying about your next exam is normal. Worrying about walking past your front gate isn't.

Anxiety isn't romantic. People don't fantasize about being with someone anxious. Sure being ""shy"" or quiet might be cute, but it definitely isn't desirable for that person.

Anxiety is real. People suffer. You can deny it inside for as long as like but it is there. Pushing it to one side isn't gone. A footballer sitting on the bench is still a part of the game and could be the difference between winning or losing. Anxiety could strike at any time and is not to be dumbed down.

That's anxiety. But life itself is good. People care about you. There are people that talk to you, and you talk back. There are people that can make you feel better about yourself, and that's amazing. I think realizing this made me approach my anxiety in a whole new light.

I'm not a very active poster but I am definitely an active reader. Some posts on here are amazing. There are amazing people on here that can help others more than they know how to.

I'm learning to love life again, and the love of life sometimes feel greater than the anxiety within and that's what urges me forward. The first few weeks for me were terrible. I was in denial. I can see that now. Looking back I was never willing to accept I was unwell, and that feeling is so restrictive.

I hope everyone here finds that drive. Treatment is the training for the marathon. Having a day without anxiety and doing what you love is the starting pistol going off. Life is there to be lived and its amazing once you let it be. I'm a year and a bit into this now, medication free. I wanted to do it without and despite being prescribed as a worse case situation, 'you need to take this for your treatment to go anywhere' kind of thing. Anybody can do it.

I now love life and I can't wait to experience it. I'm not there yet, but I can see it in the near future. I hope you all have an amazing day and you find the love that helps you through everything. I feel like this applies for any setback in life too. Sometimes being such an insignifcant person in life scares people, but it's the greatest thing there is. Humans control this world now, and we're all humans embracing that. I'm writing this partly for other people and partly to remind myself.

So I've been taking 30mg of Cymbalta daily for almost a year now, and my doctor added Buspar twice a day a few months ago. It's been working okay, but not fantastic. My overall anxiety is down but I still have panic attacks. 

The bigger problem is that I'm not sure my medication is helping the actual problem. For periods of time, I'll be really happy and my life will feel really easy. But once this feeling kind of peaks, I eventually reach a point where I crash. When I feel like my life is getting to be too overwhelming, I go from feeling anxious but confident to depressed (with occasional anxiety). My depression sets on very suddenly and very, very strongly (to the point where I almost checked myself into the hospital). I guess I was hoping that the Cymbalta would help stop the depression, but I didn't notice any effect on the depression at all. 

Several of my blood relatives are bipolar, and about a third of them deal with depression. I'm in my early twenties, so I'm worried that I might actually have mild bipolar. This idea really frightens me.

Can I see my doctor about this?

I found out recently that one of my sisters has been struggling with anxiety and depression, and another has been seeing a counselor at college who thinks she needs to be medicated for depression.

I have read that these disorders can evolve from a sort of genetic predisposition, but my concern isn't so much about them having these issues as how I can effectively and compassionately communicate with them.  I want to be supportive, but I didn't even know how to help myself when I was struggling, so I'm kind of at a loss as to how to help them.  Since I know anxiety and depression go hand-in-hand, I thought someone here might be able to help.

I'm really concerned about my sister in college right now-- this is her first year, and we were thick-as-thieves before she left, but now she hardly talks to me.  Her senior year in high school, we had a heart-to-heart about how she was struggling to feel motivated and appreciate life, and I shared how my own experiences led me to believe that medication wasn't a bad thing in situations like this.  Nothing much ever came of that conversation, as far as I know, except that she kind of pulled away and hasn't been the same since.  I'm really hoping I didn't say or do something that made her feel uncomfortable.  I really just want to help her get to a point where she feels happy and healthy and loved.

(It's not that I'm not concerned about the other sister; she's older, though, and is taking care of things on her own-- seems to be fine at this point.  I'm glad she recognized the need to make changes.  She's also engaged, so she has a fiance to look after her on bad days.)

Do you guys have any thoughts about how to help my sister feel comfortable when she gets home for Christmas?  My mom is taking her to the doctor to get another opinion and look into medication options, based on the school counselor's recommendation.  I wondered, though, if there was something I could do (or should already be doing) to help improve the situation.

I've been a nail biter for as long as I can remember, but more recently I've been dealing with some pretty real general and social anxiety, and in the past month it has gotten to the point where I can't shut it out and push past it. Unreasonable sweats, tremors, consuming terrorizing thoughts, insomnia, etc. Even currently, I'm sweating and shivering even though I have nothing worrying me. Today I finally took the first step and went to talk to a school counselor. They confirmed that what I've been dealing with is definitely general and social anxiety, with bits and pieces of OCD and grooming disorder mixed in. Our meeting was more just about getting to know me and my issues to that they can better help me. I'll be starting independent therapy in the next few weeks, and I'll have meetings every other week. 

In addition to this, I'm going to seek help from a professional, and hopefully get a prescription to help me cope. I don't know what kind(s) of medication to ask for though. One of my roommates has a bottle of trazadone that I've been taking 100mg of at night to help me sleep, but it makes me far too sleepy and tired to consider it a viable option for daily use.

But there is just one hang up that I don't how to handle. For about 2 years, there has been a girl who has been my close friend. When we first met I had too much anxiety about what would happen that I couldn't make a move. Then she started dating someone else about 6 months ago (who she is currently dating). However now I still have some feeling for her but the problem is that she wants to be close friends. I try to ignore and blow her off but she keeps dragging me back because we do make pretty good friends. 

The problem is that I feel like this is affecting me moving on. I feel like that I can have a relationship with someone else, but when I try all I can think about is her and over analyze that perhaps she might feel the same about me. I stay up at night and during the day I just mull things over about the situation.

So I don't know what I should do. I want to go our separate ways, but if I just be a complete ass I feel horrible since I am one of her best friends. So I need a valid excuse to stop seeing her. I really don't know what to do. We never had anything together that was more than friends, so it would seem pretty weird if I was just like ""sorry you have a boyfriend but I have actually had feelings for you for the past year so we can't be friends""

I can't discuss this with my other friends since they don't really understand how much anxiety I have or had. ",['conj'],0

For the past 2+ months or so, my anxiety's just been all over the place ([I posted about it a little while ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/33sgoa/i_think_about_dying_waaaaay_too_much/)), and a few days ago I finally got a prescription for Celexa that my psychologist has been urging me to get for some time now.

This current/recent bout with anxiety has really been me overthinking everything, specifically my future aka what my major is gonna be and what my job is gonna be, etc. But that's led to me overthinking everything else and thinking and worrying a lot about death/dying (a problem I've had before). I just overthink everything. Overthinking my future makes me overthink the future of the world and start worrying about the end of humanity and the end of the universe as if it's happening in front of me.

It's the worst.

I have a bunch of breathing and thought refocusing techniques that usually help pretty well, and the Celexa has truly helped me follow through with the techniques. I had a pretty bad, death worrying day today and once I chipped away with the techniques my day got better. Like a lot better. I'm sitting here on my couch watching the NBA Finals and feeling pretty good! Some things still trigger some anxiety, but I'm sitting here actually enjoying the basketball game, and I came into it rather excited to watch.

I feel like I'm rambling, but let me sort of wrap it up with my main point. This summer I'll be working at Camp. A Camp I've been to every summer besides 2013 since 1998 (so, this is my 17th summer there). I love it, it's my favorite place in the world, and this summer I'm a senior counselor for the age that I wanted (going into 9th grade). Today, I finally started getting excited for it. I'll probably get my camper list tomorrow, and I leave in just less than 2 weeks. I can't wait. Finally, it feels like my thoughts are starting to refocus just naturally. The Celexa's definitely helped, and I'm actually moving up to a whole pill each day starting tomorrow, which I'm kinda excited for.

Boy do I suck at, um, not rambling. My point is this: whether it be the medicine or the techniques or something else, looking forward to something really helps. Anxious me wouldn't be pumped for camped, he would worry about when he's not gonna be at camp anymore. Buy nay, I'm so pumped for this summer, I really am. I guess it's because I love camp so much. Because that's where I truly feel at home, where I feel so care and worry free (even when I'm responsible for the lives of 10+ children). I think this can help any of you folks as well. If you find something that you can really be excited for, something you love and hold dear or whatever, something you can't wait for.....maybe that can help. Since I've come home from college, I've sat on the couch watching TV and overthinking shit all day. And I can't wait to be going back ""home"" for the summer instead.

I'm still rambling. But I just wanted to tell you guys that I hope you find that thing, that thing that makes you jump around like an excited puppy or something. Even if it's something tiny, I know it'll help with all the crap you and I have to deal with.

If you read (and understood) that whole thing, thanks a lot. Sweet dreams everyone.

I have already posted about how my eyes broke. Woke up one morning with double vision and cross eyed. Two weeks before I re-started college. I've worked for 5 years to get my anxiety and health under control to return to finish my degree.
I spent all of last week in Rochester Minnesota at Mayo Clinic. 4 blood tests, 1 urine test, 3 MRIs, about 14 X-rays, 1 bladder function analysis, 2 sleep oximeter tests, a neurologist appointment, an ophthalmologist appointment, a neuro-ophthalmologist appointment, 3 internal medicine appointments, a consult with endocrinology, a consult with rheumatology and a 6 hour blood pressure test all in one week. On top of keeping up with 15 credit hours worth of college.
I have a genetic cholesterol disorder which I will have a heart attack by 35 if I don't get under control with a significant amount of Lipitor, I have high blood pressure I have to control, and I probably have Lupus. We have to wait and take time to do more testing for that. With my eyes, apparently I was so stressed I caused myself to have a convergence spasm which crossed my eyes so hard it broke the muscles. I have to wait a year to see if it worsens and then have surgery.
Now I'm finally home, trying to get back on track, and in the last 3 days I've gotten an abscess in my belly button, a rash in my armpit and around my belly button and I feel like I have the flu. I'm on heavy antibiotics.
I'm so so tired. I'm still trying to get everything back in order, but all I want to do is sleep. I'm getting to the end of my rope with this. All I wanted was my degree, and life seems like its trying its hardest to de-rail me. I'm not trying to have a pity party, after being at mayo it's as clear as ever that so many have it so much worse than me. I just wouldn't mind some cheering up if anyone has the urge to. I'm too tired so see the silver lining on my own right now. ",['compound'],0

Tired, exhausted, depleted, discouraged, and drained don't even begin to touch how I feel. I feel numb and misguided.

I got a job in April of 2014 and have been working there until now, but I quickly realized that 40 hours is way too much for me to be working. I just can't handle it, I am in so much pain and my stress anxiety and depression are hitting new highs. The fatigue and fog is overwhelming. I am going to physical therapy, myofascial therapy, ultrasound sessions, doing relaxation exercises, eating right and trying to pace. I just can't seem to win right now.

I just needed to vent because I need to apply to SSI which if I get that after my second or third try then I will feel much more comfortable as when I start volunteering I will feel like I am being compensated for a bit of my service. I'm just 24 and trying to figure out what I want to do, I am absolutely positive I want to help people with chronic pain or illness of all sorts, that is a for sure. Part time is ideal for me right now and I am trying so hard to figure things out and schedule new doctors appointments and get MRIs, xrays, CT and bloodwork as my tests are outdated.

I am so overwhelmed, and have been seeing a therapist too and a psychiatrist. I wish my hard work would pay off soon.
Right now, it's all about me not knowing what I want and/or need. My SO doesn't know how to make me feel better when I'm in pain besides a hug or doing the cooking or making extra compromises somewhere else. It's just super frustrating because I don't even know what I need to make the pain better or need to make the pain better, the anxiety and depression less sharp.

Normally I would self medicate with booze or chewing tobacco, but seeing as everything under the sun hurts me that I've tried to get temporary relief (marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, fibro meds) just ends up exacerbating things.

Now I can't leave my house (my dad's home where I went for the weekend to get away from my city apartment because it reminds me of my depression). **FUCK YOU ANXIETY. YOU MAKE ME CRY OVER MAKING PAYMENTS FOR MEDS I KNOW WONT WORK. YOU MAKE ME CRY OVER BEING ALONE. YOU MAKE ME FEEL ALONE EVEN WITH A GF. YOU MAKE ME CRY BECAUSE 40 HOURS IS TOO MUCH FOR ME AND I CANT WORK AND FINANCIALLY SUPPORT MYSELF.** 

Basically....

My pain is really awful most times but it's the anxiety that is truly crippling. And because of this, obviously the depression. It's a bitch. 

**tl;dr**
it gives me a lot of anxiety to make decisions, I'm doing the best I can, can somebody give me a bit of motherly advice even if I won't like what I'm about to hear? I'm just to the point where I don't care about anything.

Yes, they're stressed. Yes, they could be happier, but they're doing it without freaking out. I often wish I could be one of those people.

I work as customer service at a fast food restaurant. When I am at work, I deal with being there fairly well. I am taking 15 mg Cipralex daily and 10 mg Elavil to help me sleep well. Medication has improved my ability to be genuinely nice to customers, and I can make smalltalk more often. I'm proud of that. There's still pressure, the odd jerk customer, and busy times when we don't have enough staff. I think every fast food joint experiences this.

I feel fine about the downsides when I have no more than three shifts a week. If I know I have more than three, I start feeling extra anxious the day before. I did four half shifts a week for two weeks because my manager asked me. I became a jerk at work. I was stressed, impatient, and bad under pressure. I lost my temper at my coworkers. I was ashamed of myself.

I may be able to afford different help besides just medication in the future, but right now I can't. My way to cope with work the next day is to shun people the night before. I am wondering if anyone has any tips or sees something about my situation that I don't see.

I'm a college student who did almost a year of therapy combined with 60 mgs of Prozac, and kind of just abruptly stopped both when the latter stopped working so well (though thinking about it, it might just be because I stopped taking it reliably) and I felt okay without it.

I exchanged one email with my therapist that said to call her to schedule an appointment after summer break and predictably, face with the need for a phone call, never did.

I'm starting to feel like I can really benefit from returning to therapy and medication, but being untreated, I'm very, very anxious about returning, largely because I left without notice last time.

I don't exactly have much time to devote to therapy either... I currently work 37 hours a week (mostly within the clinic's operating hours) and am taking two classes and have exactly five hours in common with the health center.

I know going back would be best for me but I have so little time and am so scared of how my therapist will react to me again and what to do and how to catch up and... just... you guys kind of get how I'm feeling, I'm sure.

When I was 20, I decided to try learning to drive again. I was lucky enough to find a really nice instructor, and I was apparently a very good driver, but when it came time to do the test I fell apart - I failed it three times. The test examiner I got (I got the same one every time) was really cranky and stern, and it made me so unbelievably anxious to be in the car with him that I totally lost it and made stupid mistakes. After my third fail, I decided that it was probably not safe for me to be on the road, and so I gave up on driving for the time being. 

I am now 28. I have had a lot of treatment for my PTSD, and I have been doing really well lately - so I decided to attempt driving again. I have been for a few drives with my mother, and it was okay - I was relatively calm, I didn't make any big mistakes, I successfully drove on the highway and so forth. Encouraged by this, I decided to take some formal driving lessons to learn the specific stuff I needed to know for the test, etc. 

My first lesson was....okay, but the instructor was really stern, and it made me nervous enough that I decided to book my next lesson with a different school. The school actually advertised as a ""No Yelling"" school, so I figured that their instructors were probably patient and friendly. I even advised the school that I was very anxious etc, so that they knew the situation beforehand. 

I just had my lesson with them, though, and it was absolutely horrible. From the minute I started the car, the instructor started talking to me non-stop in this really irritable/angry voice. His instructions weren't clear, and when I would do the opposite of what he wanted he would be all ""NO! I told you to do it this way!!"" He also kept calling me ""sweetheart"" in the most condescending way possible, and asking me questions about why I didn't have my license yet. When I told him the truth - that I was anxious and didn't feel ready - he would scoff and say that I was now too old to learn. And....I mean, I know I am embarrassingly old to be just taking my test now, but mocking me about it just makes me feel even shittier. He also kept asking me why I was so nervous, and when I told him that I was a generally anxious person, he started yelling ""Be more confident! You have to be more confident! You shouldn't be so nervous!"" at me. 

The worst thing was that this affected my driving, just like it did last time I took my test. I was holding back tears for most of the lesson, and trying not to have a panic attack. I don't do well with being yelled at, nor do I do well being in extremely close proximity to a stranger, thanks to my PTSD. I became so focused on controlling myself and trying not to piss the instructor off even more that I made a whole bunch of stupid mistakes - which...I then got yelled at for. 

My lesson was an hour ago now, and I am still in tears and trying not to hyperventilate. I feel so...ridiculously stupid, and incompetent, and weak. I feel like giving up on attempting to drive altogether. And it's so upsetting, because I have been doing so well and thought that I would be able to handle these kinds of triggers better - but apparently I am just as fragile as I have always been. It is just really, really disappointing and disheartening. 

When it comes to driving, I feel like...the actual driving is not really a problem - even when I have encountered sudden changes/dangerous conditions on the road while driving with my mother, I have dealt with it fine. But the social aspect of having lessons and dealing with having another (often cranky) stranger in the car with me is screwing me over and affecting my driving so badly that it's like I can't drive at all. I don't know what to do about it. 

This was really long and ranty, so thank you to anyone who read this far. If anyone has dealt with this kind of situation before, I would love some advice.

My wife has a bottle of 5mg oxycodone from a recent surgery. The pills are just about the same size as my 5mg Lexapro.

So in addition to basically taking a daily narcotic (which was knocking me on my ass), I started to go through withdrawal from the Lexapro by the third day -- was lightheaded, dizzy, exhausted, felt dissociated, unsteady. Plus, if I had a beer with dinner, the combination of the opiate, the withdrawal, and the alcohol zonked me out for hours on end.

I am back on my *own* meds, and the oxy is now in another room to avoid future mistakes, but it was interesting getting a taste of cold turkey. For any of you thinking it's time to stop taking Lexapro, do so under a doctor's supervision! (And by all means, read your labels!!)

Recently my doctor diagnosed me with ADD - Inattentive Type, and we decided to try Wellbutrin before stimulants because of my anxiety/depression (and Wellbutrin is good for both of these, why not kill two birds with one stone?).

So I slowly tapered off the Lexapro, taking it in unison with the Wellbutrin XL 150 mg every morning for about 3 days, then doing like a half a tablet for 2 more days, and then I stopped the Lexapro completely and have been on the Wellbutrin alone for about two weeks now.

I haven't noticed any significant anxiety/depression symptoms rearing their ugly head during the switch, which is good, except for one...

Before I was on any anti-depressants (Lexapro) I struggled with a lot of irritability/anger as my coping mechanism for getting anxious about something. I noticed since I have been off the Lexapro I have been getting extremely angry at the littlest things, and annoyed almost instantly. I do realize it's irrational though, even as it's happening, but I still get frustrated and almost want to punch something.

Has anyone else experienced this during an anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medication switch? 

I'm tempted to start taking the Lexapro again, maybe 1/2 or 1/3 a tablet a day for another week or so until the Wellbutrin has had time to take full effect... though, I'm not a doctor and he seemed very sure about only doing a 3-4 day tapering.",['compound'],0

However I find that I'm avoiding people and when they say/do certain things it gets to me, where it hasn't before. I don't know when my feelings are justified or when it's just based off my increased anxiety. 


For example today I was telling my SO about this issue of increase in anxious feelings and he said he had something to do tonight but he could probably hang out for a bit.

I just told him I rather deal with it by myself and not get him involved, because in the past anxiety and relationship don't mix and I shouldn't rely on him to fix my problems. I explained to him that its making me feel different and that I need some time to adjust. 


I'm not sure how to deal with these increases in anxiety and when my feelings are justified or not... Any advice?",['conj'],0

My anxiety still prevents me from being myself. I can tell that I am holding myself back from enjoying my life and becoming productive. Instead of being irrational, I am anxious to do any activity outside of my apartment such as biking outside and going to workout at the gym. 

Because of this, I have been trying to gain the courage to call my University therapist to get help. Every time I get the courage to enter the number into my phone, I never press send because I am afraid.

When I was about 10 I remember lifting up my toddler sister to carry her around the store or something, and I think while grabbing her my finger accidentally slipped inside part of her diaper. I think I remember this happening on 2 occasions, and it's giving me a ton of anxiety because I worry maybe that I had touched her vagina on accident!  (It felt wet and stuff, but maybe that's just how the diaper felt). What gives me more anxiety is what if like me being a 10-year old was like sort of curious about what that was (which is probably just my current anxiety making me feel like I did something horrible) and like not being more careful. I am repulsed by the thought of me accidentally touching anything innapropriate with any young person ever, it's disgusting. But I am still getting anxious because of this random memory! 


Edit: my anxiety is snowballing and making me think like what if I am going to turn into some weird old pedophile! It was an accident but my anxiety tells me 'you were 10 you must have been careless enough while picking her up on purpose to let something like that happen' etc etc. I'm not a bad person I swear!!!! :( 

Edit 2: my anxiety always makes me feel guilt over something, like I've done something morally wrong. Does anyone else have this? Like what if I had subconsciously/curiously wanted to feel that (which I highly highly doubt was the case!) ugh I hate this disease. 

Edit 3: but then again, maybe I had just accidentally felt the inside of the diaper, as I doubt it would have been possible to physically touch 'in there' through the side of the clothes and diaper. Fml this sucks, why do I overanalyze everything ",['compound'],0

Truth be told, I don't think I *have* anxiety, not in the way a lot of the people here sadly do. I'm comfortable around my friends and people I know, I'm fairly talkative (even if I don't want to be), and I really don't have much to complain about. Whenever I see posts on this sub regarding anxiety attacks, medication and seriously crippling conditions, I just feel bad for wanting to talk about myself on here. But I suppose I might as well, I don't know how else to get it out, you know?

Maybe it's because I think too much about stuff. Usually I like to pretend that I don't think at all, and just go with it. But I do constantly over-analyze every outcome of a situation, fearing for the worst and hoping for the best. Sometimes that's alright -- movies are rarely a letdown! Other times the shattered pieces of my expectations results in a lot of self-blaming. And the worst is when my thinking stops me from doing otherwise ordinary things.

A few examples of things that freak me the fuck out. I hate talking to strangers. Not because the act of it is so terrible, but if I do (or want to do) something premeditated (go to the store, library, hairdresser) I freak out. I consider all the judgements that go on in society, and given a pretty shitty self-esteem, I just can't always handle it. It sucks not because my fears are necessarily justified, but because of the notion of *what if?* If I end up doing the things I'm afraid of, I always conclude that it really isn't so bad. I just fear it will be, and that doesn't go away after doing it once or twice, it persists, despite the knowledge that it isn't bad at all.

Right now I've just graduated high school. I live in a country that doesn't have as much of a social standard for what to do now as tv-shows would have me believe the US does. A lot of people take a year or two off, working, travelling, others get jobs and start careers or education. I don't know what I want, and even if I did, I'd be afraid to do it. I want to travel, but I know I wouldn't be able to handle that (not because of anxiety alone, it's just the whole idea). I also want to keep studying, but the environment of a university also scares me. I probably wouldn't fit in -- I'm not very mature, responsible or amazingly smart. I don't do well in typical social situations, not because I'm awkward, just because I usually dislike a lot of the stuff others love. The responsibility also gives me the creeps, and while I would love to move away and start ""a new life"" if I might be so dramatic, the simple stuff surrounding that idea freaks me out. Going to the laundromat, doing regular things by myself. I don't feel like I know enough about life to do something like that at all, and I'm afraid to show my lack of maturity to people in fear of being judged.

I don't consider myself to be a very ""good"" person. I'm average I guess. I'm not stupid, but I'm not brainy either. I'm sort of weird, and finding like-minded people can be unpredictably hard (or easy I guess).

What it all comes down to, I guess, is that I know what I should do, how I should feel and how things *probably* will go, but in the end I can't bring myself to truly believe any of that. Whether that's insecurity, awkwardness or anxiety, I don't know.

I hung out with the metalheads, but I had connections to drugs and alcohol, places to hang out, and generally I think I was a fun, adventurous person to be around. I had my close group of friends, but I got along with everyone and partied with lots of people outside my social circle. I also managed to get good grades and have part time jobs on the side. I was happy.

I moved on and went to university and had the same experience. Made tons of friends, partied hard but kept up my grades.

I'd always had moderate issues with anxiety, but none of it was social, and the issues were largely manageable.

Then *he*  happened. He made me cut practically everyone out of my life, eventually that included my entire family as well. The only time I ever got to see anyone besides him was by sneaking out, and obviously I got caught a couple times, which lead to punishment.

It's been almost two years since I saw him for the last time and the idea of being around people still freaks me out. I can't remember time I saw my friends, though they still try to contact me (bless their hearts). I can't even go to the grocery store without getting antsy.

It's frustrating because I have had so much time to get over this, and I've been doing all the right things (therapy, meds, exercise, diet, work, etc), but I feel like I'm exactly where I was when I was with him. Maybe even worse than where I was, because now I have no reason to be scared so there's the shame that comes with that.

It's also frustrating that I used to know how to be social and now I've lost what I knew. It feels like I've forgotten how to speak a language.

Due to the bullshit I go through everyday in my life/house, I encounter about 2, rarely 3, anxiety attacks a day. I am 18/F, living in a 4-5 person home, including myself, with both grandparents, my mother and my brother--when he isn't kicked out. I'm not a loud person; I'm shy, quiet and keep to myself. But when I'm trying to get my point across to someone thickheaded, I may win the fight with words. I'm only 5'2 and I am kind of a people person. I don't mind talking to people or asking someone for something when needed. I am kind, friendly, and 'weird in a way' kind of person and you wouldn't think I'd be a such an inexplicable mess. Although I kind of panic in public, I like encountering people in public and helping. Social anxiety tends to kick in when I have to speak in front of people or when I am put on a spotlight. Sometimes meeting new people, I don't speak up.

My grandparents speak broken English and fluent Italian. Barely understanding anything you throw at them at a fast pace. My brother, 22, he's literally a rock. He's a walking brick wall. Anything said will go through one ear and out the other. He has anger issues. He'll throw things in your face to make you feel like shit. He'll say ""you're a piece of shit; go die; you're stupid and lazy; the only thing I'll ever do for you is host your funeral"". He's fucking sick in the mind. But I won't let words get to me. He's always repeating himself and disrespecting my grandparents. He also has a daughter, so any kind of problem that erupts in this house, he will point it directly to her. He threatens us he won't let us see her if we keep bothering him or just say one simple thing like her toys are everywhere. He says we don't respect him enough. We tell him endlessly-- you're given a roof on top of your head, a bed to sleep in, food to eat, and clothes on your back. Why is it so hard to respect someone who does so much for you? The respect you give is the respect you get. Just shut your mouth, give a little respect and no problems will happen. 

But anyway, after he's done threatening and telling my grandparents to 'shut the fuck up' endless amount of times-- my anxiety kicks in. 

He's literally my pet peeve. I can't stand to look at him nor hear his voice. Repeating and continuously shouting, I get annoyed. I mumble to myself. Working myself up. I start to breathe heavily, and have trouble breathing. I start to shake. I question myself why do I shake? Is it my psychological fight or flight trying to do it's job? I jump in and I confront him, usually leaving him speechless or confused, sometimes puzzled because I usually am right. Within minutes of that confrontation, I'm shaking, choking on my words, my one leg shakes, they soon become weak and I can barely stand anymore. I tend to not breathe normally, but once I realize what is happening, I try to control myself. I'm filled with anger and I am vulnerable. After I actually finish my argument/confrontation, I just stand there and begin to cry. Like my psychological fight or flight failed and now depression has taken over. Is this normal? Am I just thinking about too much? Am I letting it get to me? I always tell myself it'll get better but I think my anxiety is getting worse. I hate feeling like this. Does anyone else get this way or feel the same with confrontation?

I am not on any medication and I am worried to tell my mom to let me see someone. I want to see someone but I'm not good at talking out loud because then I'll just cry; and that won't help. I have a bad past with anxiety/depression and medication. If anyone could give me some tips or help with ways to cope with these bad habits of confrontation or how to make myself feel better after-- you'd save my life. Literally. ",['conj'],0

We had a long discussion and that day was when my diagnosis was discovered. She put me on Clomipramine (Anafranil) and ativan prn. The Clomipramine worked almost right away.

I believe I'm having a lot of hormone problems related to my menstrual cycle too, and I think that is definitely contributing, but I'm really just worried about what is going on with my brain and why it has gotten worse (I should add that I have a lot of health anxiety too).

This period of bad anxiety I'm having HAS been mixed in with good days, but it seems like at least every couple days I'm getting upset over something minuscule, getting angry at my significant other for no reason, feeling like I'm going to have a panic attack out of no where (which never used to be a problem for me), obsessing over what underlying disease I might have, and then crying over how messed up and just not like myself I feel. And this hasn't been every night, but a lot of nights, I'm so unbelievably uncomfortable and restless when trying to go to sleep and after tossing and turning, I just lay there with my heart pounding and a heavy feeling in my chest because everything is quiet and I'm actually AFRAID I'm going to start hallucinating or hearing things. I feel so hypersensitive and aware that I feel like I'm seeing little things move in my peripheral vision even though it might just be an actual shadow I'm seeing or a little bit of light coming through the window. And then I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't think it's ever been this bad. Trying to read or concentrate on things has gotten more difficult and I get to the point of holding back tears when I don't understand something. Nothing feels right. I have no sense of security in myself or anything else right now, I keep feeling distant from everything, and I just really want to feel better. Does this sound like anxiety? Or am I losing my mind? What calms you down when you're feeling almost at your worst? I don't want to just deal with these feelings day by day, I want to do what I need to do to be healthy and stable on a regular basis.

I should probably add- the only obvious thing I can think of that has changed between the time that I was doing well and the past few months is that I moved in with my boyfriend. It was hard to adjust to at first, but I did and I'm happy living with him. The only thing I'm wondering is if the lack of alone time I'm getting now is affecting me a lot more than I realize.

I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. I would break down and cry, no motivation or energy to get out of bed, I could not meet new people, I would have a panic attack, and so on. I took Sertraline, 2 anti psych meds and a sleeping medication for 3 years.

I first started moving about when I had a sudden realization one night: **""I have to do something with my life, I have try to enjoy life. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain""** I wanted to go out, I wanted to have fun, to have friends, to smile like how I see people on social media. But how could I do it if I couldn't even talk to a person? to put it shortly, I kicked myself in the ass. I forced myself.

I took the first step with **online chatrooms** it didn't matter where it was, if there was a person I can talk to regarding anything, I'll try it. I started with a simple ""Hello"" and I would get a panic attack before they can even reply and disconnect. But I kept at it. The pain and anxiety going through that was excruciating, but then again, what else do I have to lose? It soon slowly seeped into me, talking to people online. A couple months later I slowly started moving to video chats, I would instantly disconnect upon seeing the person, but then again, I kept at it. After 5 or so months, I applied this to real life and my comfort level slowly leveled out. I cannot stress how bad I've felt through the process. It's a grind. 

Through this painful and scary process, I went from the person that cried getting up from bed, have strong panic attacks seeing people, to a person that can go out and live a normal life. I recently got together with the girl of my dreams. If I can do it, so can you. I believe in you. Test yourself, learn to love yourself. (I teared up having my first real conversation in years to a person because I was holding in anxiety)

**Edit:** Present day, I found myself to be able to befriend strangers and keep up online webcam chats for hours. I found techniques to maintain a conversations when lost. The most important thing to do in my experience is ask questions. It's lame but the format I used would be : Relate to the question you're about to state -&gt; ask the question. If not in person a example would be ""I'm not doing anything at the moment. Rolling around in bed, you?""","['conj', 'conj']",0

A doctor I spoke to said it sounded like GAD, and I've seen a counsellor once and will see him again after the Christmas break.

I'm coping with the work at Uni, but it can be tough to be bothered to do work in evenings. I worry about all sorts of things: will I do well in exams and my degree, will I end up lonely, missing my parents, will I be happy in life etc. Often it's like one thing worries me, which leads to another and another and so on. Sometimes I even stop worrying but the physical symptoms still persist; sickness, shaking, hot/cold flashes, needing the toilet a lot and tiredness. I guess it's like subconsciously I'm still worrying. I find it leads to depression easily also, there's a fine line between the two. I think a big part of my problem is I lack the ability to think short term, or to ""take each day at a time"". I think far too into the future and get scared. Alcohol seems to aggravate it, particularly large amounts, my counsellor said it can trigger my 'episodes' which last a week or so. Also the evenings and mornings are far worse, I know about SAD and light therapy. I've been trying to avoid caffeine too. Talking to people helps, and I don't play any sports but I'm going to try to start Ultimate Frisbee next week.


Sorry about the rant :P What I'm basically asking, is does/has anyone have any experience with such things while a student at University?

I often find myself bored, which is not helpful. What ways are there to deal with it? Including food, drink and medication. Just someone I could talk to who relates might just be nice.

I was on my way to work early in the morning when a drunk driver swerved into my lane and hit me head-on.  I saw them coming and, having no escape route, I stopped and laid on the horn.  When they hit me and the airbag deployed, my wrist was severely fractured.  While my wrist has mostly healed (it will never be 100%), it is my mind that has suffered the most.
I first experienced the fear when I had to ride home from the hospital the next day. I wasn't driving, but just getting in the car was terrifying. At home, I would be gripped by fear in random moments. I would see headlights when I closed my eyes at night and I would have nightmares. I expected it to go away with time and experience. It hasn't.

I no longer have nightmares or see headlights, but the thought of driving is daunting. I don't drive in the dark unless I absolutely have to. I am able to drive, and my hypervigilant state behind the wheel has made me a better driver. However, I have to work up the nerve to drive even five minutes down the street. Tomorrow, I will be making a three-hour round trip for an appointment and it has been on my mind since I scheduled the appointment. I am not sleeping well and I can't get the thought of the drive out of my head. It didn't help that earlier today an erratic (possibly drunk) driver almost caused several accidents right in front of me in just two miles on the highway. In my mind I was panicking, but I was able to keep my actions calm and drive defensively until I could get off the highway and pull into a parking lot.

I know this is very mild compared to a lot of the experiences I have read about on here, but I feel like this fear/anxiety centered around driving is controlling my life.

I'm on antidepressants but no anti-anxiety medicines, I live in the US and I have insurance.

Anyways, for example right now my head feels weird. Not in pain, not lightheaded. I don't really know how to explain it. I just have a strange feeling in my head. I'm wondering if it's a panic attack. I have a bottle of water right next to me, but drinking some isn't really helping. I've eaten plenty today.

Like I explained above, I have anxiety just in general and social anxiety. I ended up going to online school for the last half of my senior year in high school because I just didn't want to go to public school, didn't want to interact. It made me feel anxious.

And also, like explained above, my anxiety attacks are strange. I'll be sitting there and realize that I feel weird, normally my head has a strange feeling. Then I'll start panicking because I feel weird, and it's a whole cycle.

Also, I'm wondering if I have that thing (I forget what it's called) where I make myself sick because of anxiety or stress. I just learned about it and it sounds like something that could happen to me.

I lived with my parents for the better part of 6 months, went and talked to a counselor regularly, was prescribed meds, and basically pulled my shit together. I met a really nice girl when I came back to school, and ended up dating her, something that I never really imagined happening.

Everything was absolutely great for that year and a half. But now my ""demons"" seem to be coming back to haunt me. I have frequent anxiety attacks, I can't sleep at night, I can't really get excited for anything, or feel happy for that matter. I just feel depressed with a good amount of neuroticism associated with anxiety. 

I've had a really bad string of luck the past few weeks. That girl I mentioned before, we broke up painfully a few weeks ago. My younger sister and I were about 5 feet from getting wrecked by a high-speed police chase the other night. This guy I [used to] hang out with was blackout drunk at a party, punched my roommate, and touched multiple girls inappropriately and I spent that whole night making sure that he didn't go near two of my female friends. I was in a car accident yesterday. I lost my wallet last night. I slept through multiple classes the past two weeks because I couldn't fall asleep at night and passed out from exhaustion the following day. My employer messed up my month's paycheck and paid me $1.47 instead of the much larger amount I was owed. 

I've been able to brush things like any one of these off without a problem in the past. But it's all piled up, and I am having such a hard time coping. I can't talk to any of my friends about my issues, and I can't talk to my mom, she has enough to worry about. I'm going to go into my school's psychological services office this week, to try to start seeing a counselor regularly. I think that'll help.

But I really just need some kind of way to cope in the meantime. 

I can't fall asleep, it's like I can't stop *thinking.* 

I don't know how to get my mind off of anything in a productive way--I usually end up laying in my bed with the lights off listening to music or I just mindlessly surf the internet.

I don't know how to meet people. I'm 100% ok with talking to people once I've been introduced, but the process of walking up to someone, and saying ""Hi, my name is Ben"" is one of the most stressful things I can think of. And I feel like having more people to talk to would be really beneficial. And unfortunately I don't  have time to join a club with how much I work, not that any of my school's clubs really appeal to me in any way, shape or form.

I'm doing some research on therapists in my area (NW Chicago 'burbs) as I've finally reached the point at which I feel it is necessary to address some matters causing me extreme amounts of distress.

There are two situations that I've found induce near-crippling amounts of anxiety: Doctor visits and airport ""security"" (theater).  

The former stems from frightening and painful allergy testing I was subjected to against my will as a child - I went last Thursday for the first basic checkup of my life since my high-school physical (that's 16 years by my math - I'm 29) and my heart was pounding the entire time.  I refused to give consent for a tetanus booster even though I was long overdue for one because I didn't feel like becoming any more of a panicky mess than I already was.  Fortunately the doctor was very understanding when I explained A. the reason and B. that I was there for both the checkup as well as a psych referral to get past the anxiety.

The latter is, I believe, largely related to another overall contributing factor, which is the (strong, in my mind) possibility that I have an autism-spectrum disorder.  I have not traveled by air since July of 2010, which was a few months before the Terrorists Searching Americans instituted their Morton's Fork policy of virtual strip-search or coerced invasive physical contact by a stranger.  People talk about flashbacks and nightmares as a result of TSA interaction.  I have nightmares about airports (Not planes, mind you.  Not flying.  AirPORTs.) just from hearing that I may have to fly.  I could barely keep calm before scope-n-grope but given that body scanners have a 54% false-positive rate, and that being scanned does not guarantee one will not be touched, and given the way Team Sexual Assault wears ""ZOMG Unpredictable!"" like a badge of honor...something has to give if I'm going to be able to fly.  Also, getting married next spring and will be taking my honeymoon the following fall (after fiancee's 2-year hire date passes and she gets more vacation per year), which will most likely involve air travel.  How fucked-up is it to dread your own goddamn honeymoon?  Because as bad as I was at the dr.'s office, I know I'll be 100x worse than that at the airport.

So, my question is a multifaceted one.  Bearing in mind that I do plan to see a psychologist/psychiatrist/therapist about this and I'm just trying to gather any input I can:

-I've heard SSRIs are prescribed for GAD.  I don't think I have it - my day-to-day anxiety ebbs and flows like most people's and even if it's a little more severe, I've learned to deal with it on my own through ""mundane"" means.  Glass of water, quiet room, deep breathing, etc.  Also heard bad things about SSRI side effects.

-I've heard benzodiazepines can be addictive.  I have no history of drug or alcohol abuse and I don't think I have an addictive personality (granted, that's difficult to see from the inside looking out).  There's no family history of drug abuse that I know of and I'm otherwise healthy.

-I've heard that SSRIs must be taken daily whereas benzos are a case-by-case-basis ""panic button/call in the cavalry"" drug.  I find this preferable as I don't want to have to take something every day when I may, by all rights, have had a perfectly fine day anyway.

-I've also heard that benzos are better for acute, gut-punching anxiety whereas SSRIs are better for pervasive, lingering but not as severe anxiety.  As I said, my overall day-to-day anxiety is, largely, manageable.

-Whatever meds I may or may not end up on, I would use as a backup plan while focusing on CBT to try to overcome it as best I can.

-Assuming I do get a positive diagnosis of ASD (autism spectrum disorder, for anyone who's getting lost in the alphabet soup - sorry for the topic shift), can anyone say how well SSRIs, benzos, and/or CBT worked for them?  My concern is that because ASDs can mean a more ""rigid"" mind and atypical cognitive paradigm, CBT will be harder to make work.  Not in any way preemptively throwing in the towel, but I would like to be prepared for the possibility that I'll have to put a lot more effort into it to get comparable benefit out of it.

-What about SSRIs/benzos for adult-autism/ASD/Aspergers people?

-My doctor did say he doesn't like to prescribe benzos due to the addiction potential.  If a psychologist recommends it (assuming I don't go to a psychiatrist who can write the prescription themselves), what're the odds he'll acquiesce?  I realize that it's partly a matter of his personality, but are specialist recommendations commonly subject to physician veto or are they Serious Business(TM) not to be flouted lightly?

-Can we abolish the goddamn TSA already and throw its employees into the salt mines?

I should state again that I fully intend to seek the services of a psychological professional in addition to whatever I can learn here.  I will not mistake anything said here for medical advice nor will I hold anyone responsible/liable for what's written.  Just hoping to get some feedback from people who may have been in a similar spot.

---
tl;dr I may be autistic to some degree; doctor visits and TSA terrify the everloving shit out of me; can anyone say what to expect from CBT and anxiolytics for these situations?  Am I up a creek here or is there hope?

Now, unless I use complicated strategies to gradually build my endurance (which takes months to do, a pedometer, and plenty of rest), I have sleepless nights, rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, nausea, feel tired, feel muscle soreness, and generally feel bad when I do minor exertions.

I'm a total weakling now - barely a part of normal society. Blast this anxiety.

Any solutions to this problem would be appreciated!

I realize that this problem may all be in my mind and that I am probably just out-of-shape and completely healthy otherwise, that is, I do not have ""exercise intolerance"" in the strict medical sense of the word.

Below is a link to a 1946 study on exercise intolerance in people with anxiety. I realize that all this article really says is that people with anxiety are generally less fit than their normal counterparts, and that this is not exactly new information.

Jobs, financials, my chronic pain, the future of my pain, how I'll ever have my own place, how I'll ever make a living and how I'll ever find a way to evade this pain. It makes me so nervous that I've had problems eating lately. Undereating and overeating. 

I realize I am no different from anybody else here, we're all people, and we all have *mostly* crippling anxiety. I'm a deer in the headlights (for lack of a better term, because I fucking hate that phrase) all the time. I just wish there was a quick fix. 

Oh yeah, meds. For my chronic pain, I have resigned to the fact it will never be cured, I am now just treating symptoms which is sort of what I can do in the meantime with my anxiety/depression. Fortunately, my grandpa's best friend is my ortho doctor and his nephew will be my Internist/Psychiatrist which is nice that I'll only have to go to one person for that. Pretty sure he can prescribe the pain meds that I need as well, which is going to be pretty fantastic. That's on April 9, so not for a while. 

I'm also anxious about just daily stuff. Like, I know I should make a schedule, and I know there are certain things I should do every day that I just don't. Or stuff I am not supposed to do but I do them anyways. Crippling anxiety doesn't bode well with disabling pain. 

So when I was in bed, I was thinking about all this stuff and just imagined small me with the rest of the world on top of me, and felt like I was sucking it in and realizing just how insignificant I really am, and how insignificant my problems are. I am not unique to anybody but myself. As it happened, it made me really freaked out and I had a panic attack, but now that I am writing about it, it makes me happy to realize that other than my family/girlfriend, I don't have to do anything that I don't want to do. I am doing things for myself and constantly trying to better my state. 

I just wanted to reach out to others who may feel the same as me, I love you all. I'm going to get better at reading other people's. ",['ROOT'],0

The background was that I moved from the midwest to Orange County California and after a few months started having really bad anxiety that affected my work and life. Seeing a doctor, psychiatrist, and being on 2 meds (Celexa, Xanax) allowed me to barely get by.


After not being able to put up with it any more, and the stresses of work pushing it over the edge, I made the decision (with help of my amazing psychiatrist), to make the 2,000 mile drive from beautiful Orange County, to a town that is notoriously rated on the top 10 worst places to live lists. But hey, its home.


I found that moving back relieved most of my anxiety (over time), and continuing seeing a counselor helped with both reducing it further, including discussing the feeling of resentment with having to move. It took many months, but got slowly better day by day.


Its been 6 months since the move and I am off all meds, not currently seeing a counselor, and started my own business to keep me focused. Along with gym time, and getting back together with friends, anxiety plays a minimal role in life now. If anything, its slowly faded with time, and only occurs now a couple times a week.


Some items I took away from all this has been that there is hope. Even moving from probably one of the best places to live, back to one of the worst has taught me that its possible to improve a situation. Take a deep breath, keep working at it. It will get better with time.",['attr'],0

I've been struggling with anxiety for years, and it hasn't been until recently that I have been truly aware of it. I have been pushed, and pushed myself to avoid treatment and medication for a very long time, part of that is due to guilt. I have been told that emotions are not valid and that I have been over-dramatic and selfish by my parents and some SO's and some friends, so even right now, as I write this, I'm thinking of hitting cancel and just going back into my head. My anxiety is best exemplified by what I've called ""the voice"" it is a personification of everything that is fear in my head, there are times where it is quiet and I can go about a day pretty normally. Then there are days where it screams and makes everything in my head jumbled, I worry about everything, recently it has made my heart beat to the point where it makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack, I can't sit still, my skin feels like it's either going to pop off my body or I should just rip it off, I feel like I'm drowning, I want to do things, and yet don't want to do things.

I've been a reader of Reddit for a long time and have read many posts like this, never once thinking that I would actually write one myself. The Reddit community is incredible, so I figured it was well worth my time to reach out to you fine people. 

Before I begin, here's a quick background. I'm 22 year old male, and a rising senior in college. As far as medications are concerned, I have been on Lexepro for just over a year now, and am in the middle of a transition to a dosage of 15 mg, up from 10 mg. 

My anxiety started with a panic attack of sorts that I had regarding my mom. I was on my way to work one day, my head still in a fuzz of sorts from just waking up. This event happened just over a month ago (which gives you an idea of how long I have been dealing with this), but from what I remember, I was extremely annoyed/pissed at running late for work, so I wasn't in the best mood. My thoughts went to my mom, and I thought to myself that I didnt love her. Naturally, there was strong mental pushback on my part, and this spun itself off to a full blown anxiety attack of sorts. 

Fast forward 1 month and here is my life today:

I consistently wonder if I love my family members each and every time I am around one of them

Being around my mom and dad makes me horribly anxious

In order to get these thoughts out of my brain, my mind forces me to conclude that I don't love my family members.

My questions that I have to anyone out there reading this, is what is going on with me? Is this a new normal that I will be saddled with for a long time? Any advice, insight is helpful. Thanks guys. 



tl;dr: Relationship anxiety has caused me to distance myself from my family.

It got so bad a couple of times that I've actually been admitted to the psych ward and I've made so many trips to the ER over the years absolutely *convinced* that I was dying that I owe the hospital thousands of dollars. I've done all of the ""normal"" stuff... medication, therapy, etc and while it's definitely helped, I'd still constantly have anxiety and panic attacks, although not as severe.  
  
****

Last month, I was given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. My best friend from high school offered to fly me out to Los Angeles (I live in Ohio) and spend a week with him and his partner visiting LA, Hollywood, San Bernadino, Beverly Hills, Las Vegas, and the Mojave Desert, absolutely free. They offered to pay for everything, from my ride to the airport to my meals and whatever I wanted.   
  

Ever since I started getting panic attacks, I've been *terrified* of leaving the city where I live. I was always convinced that I'd have a heart attack or stroke or something and I'd be too far from a hospital and I'd die. But I knew I'd never get a chance like this again, so I decided it was time to face my fears.  
  
****

I got on the plane to Los Angeles, a 6-hour flight, nervous as hell. It was the first time I've ever been on a plane and I was flying alone. Before we took off, all these scenarios started running through my head. Having a heart attack or stroke on the plane, having an anaphylatic reaction to something, the plane crashing in the middle of nowhere, the wings breaking off, so on and so forth. I eyeballed my Ativan and thought about taking one, but I decided not to.  
  
****

The plane started taking off and my ears were popping. I was wriggling around in my seat, trying to stay calm, when I looked out the window at the ground getting further and further away from me. And I realized something. **I can't control everything.** The minute I got on the plane, it was out of my hands. All I could do was hope that I'd get to Los Angeles safely and if I was gonna die on the way, I might as well look out my window and enjoy the view.  
  
****  

That little epiphany on the plane and the 6-hour flight that followed has given me a lot of insight, mostly the fact that I'm a control freak. I realized *I* am the reason I have panic attacks and anxiety because I limit myself to them. **It's my own fear that's causing them in the first place and by trying to control everything, I'm making it worse.**   
  
****

The thing I fear most is losing control of my body or a situation. Heart attacks, strokes, allergic reactions, brain aneurysms, car wrecks, plane crashes... even my panic attacks. They're all things that I can't control, and those are the things I fear. I've limited myself over the last 7 years because I felt like I had to be in control at all times. I wouldn't go camping, I wouldn't travel, I wouldn't even go for a nice drive along a country road because I *had* to be in control of my body &amp; surroundings and I had to be able to get help if I wasn't.   
  
****

I ended up having an amazing time out west and even spent 4 hours just exploring the Mojave Desert out in the middle of nowhere (something that prior to my plane ride, would've put the fear of God in me). I gambled in some of the most high-class casinos in the world, I ate the best food I've ever had, I visited a bar made entirely out of ice and actually got buzzed (something I haven't done in nearly a decade), I got to see the awesome sights around Hollywood and go shopping on Rodeo Drive, and I got to see the Rocky Mountains &amp; Grand Canyon from 37,000 feet. It was, quite possibly, the best week of my life. And I didn't have a single panic attack the entire time.  
  
****

I haven't had a single panic attack since I've been home from my trip and even my general anxiety level is much lower. I had to force myself on that plane, force myself to give up control of the situation, and I'm glad I did.   

Life isn't worth living if I'm so scared that I don't do anything. I just needed to accept, *truly accept* the fact that sometimes things can happen that are beyond my control. I might as well sit back and enjoy the trip instead of spending the whole time obsessing over what might go wrong and miss out on the beautiful view.",['appos'],0

ive had a lot of ups and downs throughout life. i was perfectly fine and practically spoiled child until my parents got a divorce. my father was using drugs, and bailed out on us.  about two years into the drug use my father tried to commit suicide many times. i realized i witness some of them but didnt connect the dots. this made me depressed. im going to leave out the depression side of my anxiety as it will make this story so much longer. so since 4th grade ive been seeing therapist on and off for my daddy issues that evolved into family disfunction.

fast forward to age 12. (i think) i was misbehaving by skipping school and sleeping too much i was prescribed my first antidepressant, prozac. after the trial weeks, they changed me to something else. this went on for a couple years of switching up antidepressants (i think ive been on all of them). not right away but also at age 12, i think, i was prescribed xanax. 

i was put on .5mg of xanax and stayed on that for a year until i moved to a different state. my new doctor immediately put me on 1mg, age 13 and i was diagnosed to have a panic disorder. from that age until about 16 under the same doctor i flexed from .5mg~2mg. some months it would go down, some months he would up it. he gradually upped my dose each time and maybe went down a little but then back up...i was at my worst at age 18. he had me on 4 xanax bars. which is like 8mgs?

 i cant...really remember ..that year. i was mean. the worst thing was my short term memory. i remember having a boyfriend whom i was really excited to get into bed with and finally it happened and the next day he asked me how it was and such and ....my heart dropped because i didnt remember ANY of it. i forgot about people, and the people who cared about me i treated like shit because i really had no feelings. i was numb. i was soulless. and ...i didnt even know at the time. all my friends were afraid to say anything because i would get upset about it. 

age 20 i had gradually come down to about 6mg a day in 2mg increments. and i only came down because i had moved and had a new doctor. this doctor kept it going and did the same thing but i knew i wanted to get off at this point and that was the plan. things started brightening up. i got off my antidepressants by myself, i was living on my own, i had tons of friends and a handful of good friends that cared about me, i was busy, i was happy. i was so comfortable i even almost stopped taking my xanax completely. i would forget to, and probably took maybe .5 (if any) a day. most days without any in a week.

then i had a bad experience... ive always experimented with drugs and took a bad x. (im now drug free though, yay.) i had a horrible time, freaked out, went home and waited it out. ugh i would explain it further but this is a long story.

after that i was really freaked out. i got homesick and by this time all of my family was scattered among the US. mom, texas. sisters, illinois. father, washington. i was in california. i went to washington to my fathers because it was the most stable place i thought i could get my shit together. (note: hes been about 5+ years sober now, just bought a house, everyone else living in small apartments) so i moved in with him.

i got a doctor to continue my xanax as i was really needing it because this was the most city-like place ive ever lived and was really freaked out about how busy it was. i was having trouble find a psychiatrist and she was a regular doctor. when i went in for xanax she treated me like an addict which made me pretty sad but continued it. three months pass as i am slowly adapting and she cuts me off. right before christmas. i went through withdrawals that werent that bad because i was on like .5 two times a day. 

i understood how she felt that i was addicted but i never thought i was because i didnt have much of a physical attachment to it. then i learned about psychotic addiction. yep. all 8 years of my life depending on xanax to prevent my panic attacks came back to BITE me in the ass.

as being so young on xanax i never learned to cope as well off of it. dont get me wrong i still panicked on xanax. now i am 21 young adult scared to go to the mailbox. i have diagnosed myself with agoraphobia as i am scared to have a panic attack while driving, to have a panic attack while meeting someone new, to have a panic attack at the grocery store, to have a panic attack at the doctors office. i feel like the full force of all my anxiety over the years have come back to bite me in the ass. fuck, when i first went off the meds after withdrawals i was scared to sit in the living room. let me note i have NEVER felt like agoraphobic before. maybe crowded places but this was very extreme for me, as i have become very social too.

its been four months of this. i have no one to help me, as my father works constantly. i made no friends in time that i trust being new here. i have been brave enough to get to the mailbox and take the trash out on the busy road i live on every week. i tried to walk to a park once but ended up haha running back not even half way because i thought i was going to puke and pass out. 

it really sucks!!! i decided to not even try to go back on them and do my best to become myself again. hopefully i only have to do this once. anyways if you trying to figure out if xanax or medication is for you, please for the love of anything, do research or try and tough it out! do therapy! if i could prevent this for anyone i would feel like my place on earth was a success. i also really hope my memory heals....i still have problems with it. 

**TL;DR percribed xanax for 8 years ranging from .5mg to 8mg. when i was forced off, my pent up anxiety became a monster of the worst anxiety ive ever had in my entire life. first anxiety/depression to panic disorder to agoraphobia because my anxiety was only treated with xanax.**","['advmod', 'conj']",0

I'm a 17 year old that just graduated high school and is about to go to college. My anxiety started getting bad last January when I started the college course I needed to graduate and as graduation started getting closer. At first, the only thing that triggered me was my grades. Then I started getting triggered by more and more things. I now have trouble being around groups of people, making phone calls, and sometimes even showering.

I want to see a doctor about it and maybe get put on some sort of medication to help prevent attacks, but my mother believes that anxiety is just a call for attention. She also thinks that no one needs to be put on medication because ""medication is the government trying to turn the country into zombies.""

I'd go myself, but being 17, I'd need parental consent for any medication the doctor would want to put me on. My birthday is in December, but my classes start before then and I'd really prefer not to wait that long as school is the main cause of my anxiety.

I told my DR about that concern so he prescribed me klonopin 0.5mg twice a day (although he said to try to avoid using it a second time during the day as needed because of memory issues). I was also prescribed vyvanse (new stimulant) for my ADHD. Now that I'm home I've been reading up on the long term effects of Klonopin on the brain, and I'm a little worried. Although it does work very well for my anxiety I'm worried about the long term effects. What are your guys thoughts? Also is there another medication for Anxiety besides benzos that won't cause sexual dysfunction like SSRI's

I have been suffering from anxiety since I can think. Which makes it around 45 years. In this time I suffered from Panic attacks, OCD, Hypochondria and everything in between.

When I was a kid, nobody really knew what was wrong with me [Germany, 70's, anxiety wasn't really a thing]. However I read everything I could to find a reason for my 'madness'.

As I grew older, I understood that it was actually a mental illness. I then studied Neuroscience literally because I thought that if I knew how the brain works, it could help me.
What I learned was that anxiety doesn't equal anxiety.

Some people have short term anxiety after a trauma for example, others have phobias [thought disorder] and then some have actually physically too many/little ion channels in their brains producing either too little [depression] or too much serotonin [anxiety].

Strangely enough, just knowing this made me feel easier [not less fearful].
The only thing that has ever worked was medication [SSRI] that keep my serotonin amount on a  more or less 'normal' level.
It makes sense.

Yet, having taken them for so long, the body probably just compensates and gets used to it. The anxiety is still there [albeit much less compared to before].

Now to my gripe. 

Wherever I go [GP, Therapist etc], everyone tells me the same thing. That I should breathe a certain way and the anxiety will go, that my thinking is wrong and if I could just change it, my anxiety will go, that if I rationalise my fears and make lists, it will go, that if I become more 'mindful', my synapses will grow a different way and my anxiety will gradually become less...[lol, synapses are not ion channels and have nothing to do with the production of serotonin, but hey].

Being told all these things was brilliant at first. Most I had heard of already, other things were new and worth a try.
Only that most things are just plasters, covering up a symptom but do nothing about the actual origin [apart from SSRIs].

I am meditating and I watch my breathing and my muscle tension, I do things slowly now and try hard to reschedule my worries [not much luck]. Apart from that, most else is useless to me.

Why? Because of a great variety of things, from certain beliefs [not religious but still have beliefs about life] to the way my life just is; I am an individual and not a thing where a certain formula WILL work on.

Also because I have a funny brain, all the ""you must do this and that, and your anxiety will get less and less"" has now caught me like an extra worry. [Be careful who you ask to do what].
Similar to anorexic people, my mind is preoccupied with rules about how to stop my anxiety.
Almost every second I feel obsessed to 'watch my anxiety', everything I do goes through the 'anti anxiety check' and because I also suffer from CFS/M.E it is becoming very exhausting and frankly I wish I could just be me.

Just the thought of someone telling me that it is OK to have anxiety [as I read on some blog] instantly calmed me more than all the 'do's and don'ts. I wish someone would say:
""YOu've had it for so long and you are still alive, just do what you can and ACCEPT who you are.

Instead, especially right at this moment in time I feel like a:

- Failiure:
There are all these fail-safe things I can do, that helped many people but it just doesn't work for me. Therefore I must be doing something wrong.


- Idiot:
Despite going to Uni and having a reasonably high IQ I seem to be too stupid to do what others have done so successfully. Everything I have read and tried was obviously rubbish. Therefore I must be stupid moron.


- Guilty:
The only one to blame for my anxiety is myself, because others managed and if I don't, the ball is back in my hand and I am obviously not doing it right, so don't blame those that try and help you and don't blame your physical differences because the only one to blame for my anxiety is = MYSELF.


- Stressed:
Do this, do that, new rules for everything, because it will change my neurons and my thinking. Therefore if you don't do it all, guess who's to blame? Doing just a few things that I can manage doesn't work. Hence stress.


- More fear:
Telling someone that doing all of the above will CURE them [with an anxiety disorder they at best can manage but never realistically heal] has cause more anxiety [remember who you are telling these things Therapists, if we were all calm we wouldn't have a problem in the first place]. 


This I think is the big elephant in the room.

Phobias can be sorted very easily with CBT, temporary fear also. Physical anxiety...nope.
Also people who had it all their life should be approached differently. We are NOT NORMAL [whatever that means]. There is a reason we do what we do, because of our illness, which is very real, just as real as kidney disease or whatever.

Telling us that we only 'think wrong' is patronising and preposterous. 

Believing that we will do everything you tell us is also very naive.

We are not robots who only need a program and everything will be fine, we are people. Each one with a different way of life, each one with different experience in life, beliefs and behaviours that sometimes [SHOCK] stop us from doing everything exactly as Therapists tell us.
We are human and yes we all live different lifestyles.

I will finish with something I would love to hear instead of more rules for me to follow.
If you suffer from Phobias, CBT is brilliant.
If you suffer from trauma induced anxiety, CBT and Mindfulness is really good!
If you suffer from OCD, depending on how long you've had it. CBT and Mindfulness can help. If it is part of a general anxiety disorder that is physical, then you should pick some good bits from CBT and Midfulness but also read up on things like Buddhism, Zen, herbal remedies etc. Broaden your knowledge, the more you know, the less scary some things become.

If you are just a fearful, nervous worrier and you have tried everything but it only works only for a short while because your brain is a crafty bastard and comes up with something completely unexpected and not covered by your 'new behaviour rules'.

Sod it!
Be who you are. Say ""I am a person who has anxiety, it isn't my fault; and for who I am, I tried as best as I can. I have lived with it this long, I will live with it. It is who I am, accept it because I have. I am neither a failiure, nor a moron if I don't want to or can't follow all those rules given to me, because I am human.""

Just allowing myself to say this feels already better and has a far more calming effect than any therapy I ever went to.

I know doctors and therapists are there to help us but they do have to understand that one formula does not work for everybody. 
So stop blaming us for something we really can't change, rather help us live with it.

 - I met this person when I started high school. He was (and is) staff at said school, and we became very close over the years. Given that timeline, we've known each other for roughly 4.5 years. I've cried in front of him more times than I care to admit, and he's opened up to me a lot as well.
 - Even when my parents mistreated me and were not supportive of me (i.e. most of the time), he was there to listen and give advice. I owe a lot to him because of this.
 - Right now I'm in my first year of university in the same city where I grew up and where he lives/works. Because of our schedules, we unfortunately don't see each other much. Every couple of months, we manage to carve out time to see each other, and our dynamic hasn't deteriorated.
 - I go to individual therapy, group therapy, and a meditation class regularly. No medications. I've noticed some positive changes, but I'm not sure of my ability to cope with this new situation.
 - Because of past traumas, I had/have very few friends, and he's the person I'm closest to. He knows this. I'm trying to build a network of people I can trust here at my university, and it's coming along, but obviously they can't replace this person.

The other day he told me, in person, that he was seriously considering moving to the opposite coast. (This is the US, so this is a *huge* distance.) I'm glad that this didn't happen while I was still in high school, because back then I didn't have any other places/people to turn to. Still, for the past few days I haven't been able to concentrate on much. I don't want to do my schoolwork, I don't want to see my friends, I don't want to eat anything. All I want is to watch Netflix in bed and drink a ton of water. I feel horrible. The move isn't going to happen for at least another year, so that's a bit comforting.

We talked about it for a bit the other day, and he told me these things up front:

- He hopes to always be a part of my life.
- He hopes that we can remain in touch even after he leaves.
- Whenever he's back in town, he will make a point of seeing me. (I also want to visit him, and have the means to do so.)

Despite the above, my fears are the following:

- We'll just stop talking to each other. He's bad at emailing–his ""email personality"" is incredibly taciturn, but he's really sweet in person–so that wouldn't be the best option. Skype/FaceTime/Hangouts is way better IMO. He rarely initiates contact, which I think we need to discuss before he leaves.
- We won't make the most of our last year together. His workload decreases dramatically once summer starts, and though I'll be working almost full-time as well, I hope that we can do things together before he leaves–on the weekends, and after work, and things like that. This might not happen, and I think we'd both regret that later on, so we've got to make plans.
- *How do people even have discussions about this sort of thing?*

tl;dr: longtime mentor is moving away next year at the earliest; I'm trying to cope but have no idea what to do. Please help!

For the past 3 weeks I've gotten little sleep because I wake up every morning at 3-4am. I can try to fall back asleep with no avail. I have spent 3 hours trying one time, but my mind won't shut off; it won't stop obsessing. I am in the beginning of the acceptance phase of not being able to sleep.

It started when I first encountered heartburn in college, when I was up late writing a final paper (of course, it was due the next morning). Subsequently, I sometimes feared I was having a heart attack, even though I later learned it was nothing but acid reflux. Despite having my heart checked (everything looked great), earlier this year I would have horrible episodes where I would have tingling in my arms, pressure in my chest, and more fear of a heart attack. I even called 911 once because my arms were going numb and my hands closing. I've subsequently had everything rechecked and it was just a panic attack. 

However, later on in that same semester, during a particularly stressful finals week, I felt an odd feeling (probably more heartburn), and suddenly started having an anxiety attack. I felt lost, like I didn't care about what I was doing, like everything was so meaningless, and I feared, very intensely, that I was ""going crazy."" I managed to get through that day, but in the roughly six months since, I've on and off suffered with intermittent anxiety (I think it's anxiety), not sure whether I'm feeling anxious, depressed, or both, but usually afraid that I'm ""going crazy,"" or going to be terribly depressed. Sometimes guilt triggers it. Random guilt about things in the past, how I treated some people, not spending enough time with my brother, etc. It generally improves after a couple of hours, but it's always frightening. I'm afraid of getting anxious if I drive somewhere, and I think ""What if I go crazy and get lost when I'm away from home?"" When I'm out, though, and socializing, I generally don't have a problem and don't feel anxious (this can vary, of course, and I've had some anxious or depressed situations even while hanging out, but to a much lesser extent), or only feel a little anxious. The anxiety hasn't affected my productivity or concentration, or much of anything else. It is there basically every day though, and it is a battle. 

PS, as soon as I started experiencing this new, current form of ""mental worry"" anxiety, I really have not had any fears of having heart problems subsequently (I've also been working out and getting in great shape).

Eventually, I just stop and scream and they just wait until I try to run again. So i decide to walk, take baby steps toward the goal or dream or accomplishment, I want or need to do.

I just want the other me's to go away. Sometimes, they do disappear and I can do things without any problem but they come back for the important things, harder things, the goals or dreams I really need to achieve. Its a constant battle.

I applied for SSI a few months ago. I've quit about 20 different jobs in the past 5 years because of anxiety, and flunked out of college after 3 semesters when I was a straight A gifted student in high school.

I don't do well under pressure and I can't break down in front of doctors - I have this weird complex where I must show decorum in front of professionals, so whenever I am pleasant and cordial to any doctor naturally they suspect.

my anxiety is severe to the point where I can't drive or hardly even go outside. if people look at me I get upset. I don't sleep at night because I see horrible things. I haven't had a job in almost 2 years now.

but my anxiety is not the only reason I'm applying. I have endometriosis and PCOS, had two surgeries last year, and that sparked a chronic pain condition (possibly fibromyalgia, haven't been able to see a specialist yet, money is pretty tight even with great insurance) so I am in severe pain every day. 

I don't know when I will be able to work again and I hate myself for it, but I need to get the SSI money (it's $600 a month, I think) to pay for my student loans ($3,000+ even though I flunked) and then start helping my parents with my medical bills. I don't want the money just to have money or use on dumb shit. my parents had to refinance their house because of my medical bills and it makes me want to fucking cry because they're both 60 and they need money for retirement.. they don't guilt trip me at all, but now they can't go on their bucket list vacation to the Grand Canyon this summer that they already had planned and I know it's because of me.

Therapy (I have an amazing therapist) and meds (Zoloft, 25 mg starting dose and now 50mg) have brought me from point A to point B:

Point A: Crying for sometimes 6+ hours, couldn't eat, cried in the bathroom at work, stopped working altogether, relationship with fiance severely strained, losing weight, sleeping for 2 - 4 hours per night, constant fog and depersonalization, intense depression and hopelessness, feelings of dread/phobia regarding work, constantly triggered by almost everything


Point B: Able to attend social events, returned to work and ended the year on a great note (I am a teacher), went to the bar with colleagues, excited to plan my wedding and day trips with fiance/friends, eating full meals and no anxiety about food, sleeping 8+ hours nightly, hope for the future, desire to help others and excitement for my upcoming school year, very few triggers and able to calm down when I am triggered. Have not had a true panic attack in weeks. 

This all changed in a matter of weeks due to therapy and meds. I am on Zoloft and I have had NO side effects. It took about 10 days for the positive effects to begin and they have only continued. 

There is hope! I still have days where I feel down or nervous, but in general I feel so much more hope for the future and the present.  And those bad days never spiral into depression, depersonalization, panic, despair, etc. I feel like I am almost back to being myself again.

Best of luck to everyone in this sub. Seek therapy, possibly meds, don't let yourself needlessly suffer. I suffered for 5+ years before seeking help and I wish I could take it all back and do it again.

I just moved to a new city and had my first meeting with a new psychologist. His focus is more on neurological behaviorism. He told me about a couple of different treatment options that he uses and tailors depending on the individual. He told me about Alpha-Stim [link1](http://www.alpha-stim.com/as100/)which is a type of CES [link2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_electrotherapy_stimulation). 

It is essentially a pair of electrodes that fit on each of your earlobes and creates a current that flows between them. I only used it for 20 minutes but yesterday and today have been some of the best days in recent memory just because I feel more like myself. 

The website seems a little too good to be true and it is hard to take the word of any site run by the people who produce the product. It could be a placebo effect, there is a lot of conflicting opinions online about it, but I am blown away by how immediately it seemed to make a difference in my life. I would like to eventually be independent of SSRIs and other meds and I think that this device seems to be the most promising way. As with any sort of brain-business your results will vary, but for me it was a great discovery. 

I would love to hear from any other people who have used it to hear their comments on it. 

tldr: I think that CES could be the right thing for me and some fellow r/anxiety redditors may also benefit from it. 

EDIT: Apparently some people deem this to be sensationalist and borderline homeopathic. I disagree, but again I will restate that this is just my first experience with it.

Anyone who replies, I want to thank you.

I'm not so clear of mind while writing this but that's one of the reasons I guess for making me come here to ask.

I'm not so much a lurker, I like to post sometimes to help others rather than seek help for myself but this is a question that came to me.

-------------------

I'm living in Canada and I'm taking Ativan and Chlonazepam (not at the same time, I react to both differently so usually choose depending on my predicament). I believe I'm on the strongest dose of both. I don't take them daily often just weekly or bi weekly although recently daily as I'm not feeling so good.

My problem is that they take time to kick in and even when they do, I still have most of the symptoms of anxiety, I still feel the physical symptoms and my mind is still racing sometimes, I'm still crying etc.

Has anyone ever been prescribed something that.. for what of a better phrase, knocks you out quickly to allow you to relax somewhat? The last couple of nights I've taken meds to sleep which normally work but my anxiety is running so high I've just lay there for hours panicking and not being able to sleep.

Any suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated, whether they are benzodiazepines or a different kind of med (not anti-depressant though) that will act quickly on the odd occassion I'm in serious need of it. I could then speak to my specialist about it and see what he thinks and if he could prescribe it. I'd trust you guys much more from your own personal experiences or from friends you might have heard say things worked for them.

Thank you.

TL;DR: Would like suggested meds similar to/or benzodiazepines which work very quickly and are quite strong. Thank you.",['amod'],0

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I've never gotten help for anxiety/depression before--I think I've had depression for several years, but the bad anxiety is more recent. Basically right now it is a constant, 24/7, feeling of doom and fear in the pit of my stomach. There is no relief, and I feel like I'm going crazy from worry. I'm constantly on the verge of tears, thinking about dying, and thinking about what terrible disease I might have. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For the past month, probably longer, I have had trouble taking a full breath. It feels like my throat is tight, or like my lungs aren't filling up with air; I have a lot of shortness of breath. I'm not sure whether the anxiety is causing this, or its something physical, but of course I keep googling my symptoms (I've also been having random pains in my chest) and convincing myself I have cancer. The way I feel (mentally) is absolutely unbearable, but I have to work from 8-5 and I can't miss work. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I went to the doctor last week and I told him about the breathing/pain and anxiety, but I wasn't being clear enough in just how bad the anxiety was (I think he thought it was because of the breathing issues, which it partially is, but it is much more than that). He did an EKG (which was fine) and prescribed me antibiotics to see if it was the result of a respiratory infection. Well, the antibiotics didn't help, so now I need to call him back to make another appointment. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have to plan out interactions like this in advance so I know just what to say, so my questions are:

-How do I explain how bad the anxiety is? I feel really guilty, like I wasted his time last time because I wasn't completely honest, but this is the biggest secret I have and I've never told anyone. But after years and years of feeling awful, and considering that this is impacting my life immensely, I just have to do something. I'm also going back to school in a few weeks, and I want to start some treatment (medication, therapy, or something) before I go back. 

-Can anyone tell me if they have had similar symptoms, and it turned out to be from anxiety? That might set my mind at ease a little. 

-If I do call tomorrow to make another appointment, it won't be until next week. The thought of going through the weekend worrying (to put it extremely mildly) is terrifying. What can I do to calm down until my new appointment?
Thank you, and I would appreciate any advice. For reference, I am a 20F, currently on propranolol for a generalized tremor (which hasn't had any effect on my feeling of anxiety). ",['appos'],0

I suffer with generalized anxiety disorder and I finished a round of counselling to help with this a few months ago. I am currently on a waiting list for further sessions and at the minute I can feel my anxiety creeping back up on me. 

The hardest part I'm struggling with at the moment is the random feelings of guilt which develop when my heart starts racing too fast. It feels like a heavy feeling in my chest, incredibly similar to guilt, although I have nothing to feel guilty about (rationally). From there I start getting really disorganised negative thoughts and unbearable internal chatter and worry. My anxiety seems to be getting triggered when I notice that my heart's beating noticeably fast, it's feeling heavy, and my anxiety spirals out of control from there. I'm not sure what to do while I'm waiting to get back into counselling, rational thinking doesn't help because the negative thoughts and feelings just keep seeping back in. I can barely sleep, I have no-one to talk to at the moment and I cannot control my thoughts. 

Has anyone got any advice on how I can stop the cycle in the mean time, I've hit a really low point in my depression. I used to take Propranolol which helped a lot for physical symptoms such as the racing heart, but I started to develop chest pain after taking it which would last for prolonged periods of time, so I stopped. Is there any other useful medications or things I can do to combat any of this? 

I appreciate any help. Sorry if some of it isn't making much sense i'm really struggling to concentrate, and I can clarify if needed. Thank you!",['attr'],0

What happens is my surrounding become unfamiliar. I know what they are and I can name things such as the buildings so obviously I am recognizing my surrounding despite being unfamiliar with them. However the big thing is I completely lose the ability to figure out how to navigate. I can't remember where anything is or how to get anywhere, even the entrance to a store.

An example: I was leaving a store one time with my girlfriend. We get in the car and I have to ask her how to get out of the parking lot. Then I had to have her tell me not only which direction home was but step-by-step direction on how to get back home. She tried pointing and say ""This way, take that street."" but I was unable to comprehend it. She had to be more exact with ""Go right at the next intersection with lights."" Even ""Go towards the McDonalds"" was too much for me understand.

During these I am described as being incredibly irritable and angry. I also don't really remember most of them. I can only recall 2 or 3 of them that I actually remember and it was my girlfriend that made me aware that it was closer to 5-7 times. It has happened on campus, while driving, and in stores. I've had to be led to the exit or cashiers in a store a few times. We haven't noticed any triggers. Though we did note that I have a lot of trouble remembering how to get around in my hometown. I've had to relearn how to get around and frequently have to ask people for directions.

Episode length varies but generally I get to my destination through the help of others before it ends.

I take Zoloft and Abilify and have been on both for roughly 5 years without issue. I haven't taken any anti-anxiety medications such as Ativan for almost 2 years.

My depression and anxiety is at an all time low and practically non-existent and has been for the most part for the last couple years. I saw a counselor 2 months ago because I thought I was experiencing a depression flair-up since I was becoming lethargic, de-motivated, and having trouble sleeping. I was a bit stressed about my major and declining grades in my classes but after we got that sorted out all of those symptoms disappeared. The counselor didn't see any other issues. We met a few more times to make sure and we struggled to find any issues to discuss.

I saw my primary care physician about my current issues and they said it is just anxiety and that I could go and see a psychiatrist to get my medications tweaked. I'm going to see my old psychiatrist but it may be several months before I can get in.

I'm having trouble agreeing with my doctor that my issue is just anxiety but since I don't have a medical degree I figured I should ask if anyone has had similar problems with anxiety or their medications?",['conj'],0

There were no refills left on my anti-anxiety medication so I had the pharmacy contact my doctor for more refills. I waited a few days and called the pharmacy back. They said the doctor never contacted them. So then I called the doctor and was on hold for 15 minutes and I found out I needed to see her first so she can see how I'm doing before refilling the pills. 1) lame 2) I've been on the pills for over a year 3) that would have been nice to, you know, know that first. So I went to the doctor the next day (thank god they had a cancellation and got me right in) and the doctor said she called in my prescription to the pharmacy. I made it very clear to her that I was completely out of medication and needed it immediately. I called the pharmacy shortly after and they said my doctor hadn't contacted them. I then called again today, two days later, and she still hasn't contacted them. This is of course the medication that kicks out extremely quickly out of the 3 I'm on so I'm already having withdrawal symptoms-- headache, tired, irritable, nausea, diarrhea, and if this goes on longer I know I'll have other symptoms too because this happened once before. I feel like crap and still have to pull myself together and go to work. So has anyone else had a similar experience? I'm going to call the doctor's office tomorrow.

Karma happened, and she now has her life in the shithole, she's flailing in school (2 years behind at this point) and seems really unhappy, really really far in debt. When we were together I would always push her to work and try hard and it would work.

Common friends say I should cut her out completely, because she is a source of anxiety, but I would feel more anxiety about cutting her out and not helping. I just honestly feel really bad for her, but her dating this guy is a constant reminder of what she did. Sometimes I'm ok with it, other times I'm angry. I want her to get her life back on track, and I think that means dumping this guy because he's a major distraction to her success.

She's still a good friend, the only one who actually understands my anxiety so I can talk to her about it and it usually helps. This time I can't because it's about the mess she caused.

Now, however, I feel that I've reached a point of sufficient stability that such a retrospective is appropriate.

The basic goal of this post is to remind people who are currently struggling with anxiety that things *can* and *will* get better. Your path may be more or less difficult than mine was (and is!), but it is a path which will eventually see you leading a more full life than you are now. Don't succumb to your anxiety, even if it feels insurmountable. 

Anxiety entered my life when I was just starting my second year of university. I had experienced bouts of anxiety throughout my life, but had never experienced a panic attack or anything severe enough to indicate anything more than a slightly nervous disposition. Therapists would later try to find roots of my fully-blossomed anxiety in my childhood, seeking some sort of unprocessed trauma, but there was nothing to be found. To this day, I remain convinced that I simply experienced a change in my brain chemistry that had rather severe implications for how I would live my life for the next several years.

The first panic attack hit when I was out for a walk. For the previous few days I'd had a rather nasty cold, and I was still congested. Walking usually helps my sinuses clear, so I went out for a brisk walk. My first indication that something was wrong came when I realized that my heart was beating very quickly, and that I was sweatier than I should have been. I started to feel afraid. Suddenly, my body shifted into overdrive. Every nerve from my toes through the top of my head felt like it was buzzing at full strength. This, combined with the still-lingering illness, was too much, and I started to pass out. I put my head between my knees, and the world came back enough that I was able to call one of my roommates, who came to get me.

That was the first panic attack that I had. For the next four hours, I lay in bed wondering what on earth had happened to me, occasionally getting bursts of dizziness and the same sizzling feeling in my nerves. I didn't know whether I had some kind of neurological problem or not, whether or not I had experienced some kind of cardiac event, or whether it was just low blood sugar. I was terrified. 

From then on, I was perpetually nervous about having a similar attack. I noticed patterns in when the attacks would come: typically when I was alone and traveling between my house and university, or while alone at work. I also noticed that, for reasons unknown to me at that time, if I called my parents or girlfriend and spoke with them for a minute, the attack would subside. I started to exhibit what would become entrenched patterns of avoidance of the trigger scenarios - I avoided being alone, I avoided public transit, I took shifts that coincided with those of my coworkers. My girlfriend and parents started getting two or three calls a day from me, for no particular reason - I hadn't yet told anyone about the attacks.

Eventually, I acknowledged that something was wrong, but I still had no idea what. I went to my doctor, who ordered a battery of tests - blood tests, ECG, and so on. All of them came back completely normal. The attacks still persisted. Then I ran into a description of the symptoms of a panic attack online, and felt that sense of dawning realization. Every one of my symptoms appeared on the list, and the triggers for the attacks were mentioned as common triggers for panic attacks.

At this point, I felt somewhat better - I knew, at least, that I wasn't experiencing the symptoms of some horrible heart defect. But foolishly, I did not seek any treatment. I thought I could deal with it on my own.

Over the next two years, the attacks worsened. I broke up with my girlfriend and moved back in with my parents. I started to fear the times when I knew I wouldn't be able to get in contact with someone on the phone, because if I had a panic attack I wouldn't be able to stop it. This worrying made me anxious, and this anxiety made panic attacks more frequent and severe. Previously talkative in class, I became more withdrawn. I still spoke up, but it required a conscious effort, and frequently after speaking up I would need to get a glass of water to calm myself down. I was having between two and three panic attacks of moderate strength per day. Still, I didn't pursue any treatment.

Then, at the start of the second semester of my last year of undergrad, shit hit the fan. It was a Thursday. I left the house at 12:04 to walk to the bus stop. My mom was on the phone with a friend in Ontario. At 12:12 I got to the bus stop, already feeling somewhat anxious - I knew that I wouldn't be able to contact my mom if I had a panic attack. At 12:15 the bus arrived, and I got on. Immediately, I felt even more uneasy. But I persevered, and took my seat. The bus I was on passes through an area which has no cell phone signal just before it reaches the university. At 12:19, the bus stopped in this area to let off a nun. I looked at her as she got off, and checked my phone. 12:19, no cell signal. Immediately a severe panic attack hit. I felt like I was being hit by a train. I was dizzy, sweating, my heart was pounding. I needed to *run*, but I couldn't. The attack lasted for half an hour, and only subsided when I took a cab home.

Finally, I sought treatment. However, the attack had been severe enough that I now was psychologically incapable of being alone for any period of time, or of taking the bus on my own. If I was, I would have a panic attack. Fear took over my life. Despite weekly therapy sessions, I was more or less unable to attend class. This caused academic complications for me that I'm still sorting out. 

Flash forward eight months. I'm living in my own apartment in a different city from my family and fiancee, I'm in graduate school, and I teach three tutorials a week. When I go home to visit, I take public transit and the ferry alone. None of this bothers me anymore. The panic attacks are under control (touch wood!) - in fact, they simply do not occur anymore (again, touch wood!). How, you might wonder, did this happen?

- **Cognitive behavioural therapy**

- **The right medication**

- **Support from those close to me**

I cannot stress enough the importance of these. CBT is one of the more difficult things that I've done, but it was immensely helpful. I still use the techniques I learned when I'm feeling anxious or nervous about, for example, giving a lecture. The medication is also immensely helpful. I don't take much (75mg of Effexor daily), but it provides me enough of a leg up that the CBT techniques can really be effective. Without CBT or medication, I would not be where I am today.

The support from others is also of great importance. What I have found is that the hardest step for me was being open and honest about the problems that I was facing - once I told the people I trusted about my anxiety, they were happy to help me, and their support made an immense difference. I spent a long time trying to hide my anxiety and pretend that I was okay, but bottling it up did me no good whatsoever. Letting a trusted few know about it and telling them how they could help me was one of the key steps on the road to winning my life back. 

I don't think that I've ""conquered"" anxiety by any stretch of the imagination. There will be times in my life when it crops up again, in times of stress or illness. But I have my life back now. And if you are experiencing anxiety and feeling lost at sea, remember: *it will be okay. Both now and in the long term, you will be alright. In the short term, the fear that you have will subside. In the long term, you will learn how to work with and disarm that fear, and you will be free to live your life the way you want to again.*",['conj'],0

Hey /r/anxiety, I'm living with mediocre/heavy anxiety since middle school. I guessed that it would disappear or lose its power over me but it has not. It's so distracting it makes just daily living quite hard. Everyday I usually get some sort of ""spasm"" where I clinch my fist and jaw for 20 seconds or so until the thought about the event disappears. I don't want to have any of these thoughts any longer, I'm sick of it. What can I do?

The odd thing is that these ""spasms"" only came after a year or two after middle school altogether, not immediately after the school day it happened. 
Since being psychologically bullied in middle school I have developed some safe-guards (or ""checks"") against thinking thoughts that lead to anxiety. They do help, but it's quite hard anyway. 

I have not met my bullies since the last day of middle school - and I have no intention of doing so. I simply want to leave all those memories behind me and never let them come back, what can I actually do? 

Medication is not a great solution since I already spend quite a sum for my asthma, allergy and psoriasis medication.

I've spoken to very few people about this, and certainly haven't ever opened up to a total stranger. For the past five years, I've been suffering from what I can only assume is OCD of some sort. It sounds really weird, but here goes: 

A number of years ago, after my grandmother's funeral, we took here ashes and scattered them. I can't say why or how, but from that moment on, the idea of human remains ""contaminating"" me or objects I am in contact with has caused me immense anxiety and severely altered my quality of life. I go to great lengths to ensure that anything I touch couldn't have been contaminated, and even objects I am 99% sure haven't been, I have to clean thoroughly. It's gotten to the point where nearly half of the things I own have, in my mind, become ""contaminated"". It doesn't matter if the object simply touched something that touched something that touched something that touched a body, or ashes. I have to either clean it thoroughly or throw it away, and keeping track of this has become something I obsess about. 

For instance, those shoes I wore when scattering my grandmother's ashes? I cleaned them thoroughly, but that just wasn't enough. I wrapped them in two bags to ""contain"" any ashes that might have somehow ended up on them. Then I stuck them in my closet. Eventually, I began to wonder if these (now imaginary) ashes could have escaped the bag and fallen on other things in my closet. So for several years now, I have not been able to bring myself to touch anything in that part of the closet. And if I move anything, I'm afraid the (imaginary) ashes will fall onto other things. 

Over the years, even the slightest thought that something could have become contaminated in this way causes me to have to clean it thoroughly, or, more often than I'd like to admit, throw it away entirely. Sometimes, if I see dust on something of mine, I begin to wonder if it is actually ashes and I have to clean it and everything it may or may not have touched.

I know this fear is irrational, but try as I may to force my mind against this fear, I can't. I know I should be able to, since rationally, it makes no sense to me- it's so full of holes. For instance, several years ago, I had dental work which involved having human matter placed under a pulled tooth as a scaffolding for my bone to build on. For the next few days, I had this sandy human bone powder falling out of my gums. It was my worst fear come true. I was contaminated, as well as pretty much everything I touched or even was around. But now that my gums healed, and that stuff is secure in my skull, It doesn't bother me a bit. 

There are two other ways I know this fear is irrational: I have multiple friends/family members who are nurses and who are in at least some contact with dead bodies on a regular basis. I know this, yet being around them doesn't bother me at all. I can be in a house where I know someone died. That doesn't bother me. Here's the craziest one: someone I know lost his arm in an industrial accident. Yet touching him, or the ground where he lost his arm, or the machine that crushed his arm, doesn't bother me *at all*. Why? Because he isn't dead. That's right. If I were to touch a dead person, or anything that has touched a dead person or even been in the same room, I'd be contaminated and would be everything I touch, and my week would be ruined. But if I were to touch a dead part of someone who is still alive (dead skin, hair, even a severed limb), I would be no more contaminated than if I had touched dirt or mud.

Recently, it's gotten worse. I've begun to doubt my own memory regarding things I remember cleaning, or thinking that something is contaminated when I know it isn't. This has caused me to begin cleaning things many, many, times because even though I distinctly remember cleaning them, I feel as if I can't trust my memory.

As you can imagine, this is majorly screwing up my life. It gives me anxiety 24/7 and I think about it multiple times an hour. I've finally realized that I should see a therapist and see if there is any medication I should be taking. Is this OCD? So does anyone have any experience with something similar?

I am 17 and I have been struggling with anxiety for as long as I remember. I never feel happy anymore because I'm always so worried about every little detail about my life. I second guess myself all the time in fear that I'm making a bad decision or I'm going to make myself look bad or embarrassing in front of people. I also feel really uneasy around people. I hate being in groups of people and I would rather just sit at home then be out with anyone. It even drives me to feeling sick sometimes to where I won't want to eat or want to do anything.
My boyfriend has expressed how worried he is about me and how he wants me to get help. My problem is that my parents don't believe problems like anxiety are real. They don't believe in getting therapy or medication to fix anxiety. I can't communicate on a personal level with my parents either and it's hard for me to tell them when I am having a problem. My boyfriend has told me that he will talk to them for me, but again, I'm too worried it'll upset them and then end up going down the road of telling me I need to grow out of this problem and there's really no medication for me to take that will help me because it's not real. I really don't feel okay with myself anymore and it's starting to throw me into a dark place. 

I just really need some advice on explaining to my parents that this really is a problem and that I'm very unhappy with my life because of it. Should I let my boyfriend talk to them? How can I tell them that I really NEED help with my anxiety? I just need some advice and thought you guys could possibly help! Thank you for reading.


EDIT: Wow! Thank you all so much! I didn't expect to get so much feedback. I definitely have a little better idea of what to do now. I'm still pretty scared about it myself that I'm figuring all this out and not really sure how the next few months are going to go. But thank you again to all of you. This means a lot! I'll definitely keep you guys updated once things start rolling after I talk to someone about it! ",['attr'],0

Because of the computational nature, the work moves along quickly and results are generated at a pretty rapid rate in my group. Everyone in my group is insanely intelligent and incredibly kind; they are, quite honestly, some of the smartest people I know. 

I've been dealing with anxiety, panic attacks, and depersonalization disorder for years; within the past two years they have been the worst. Two months ago, I just stopped going in, doing my work, and being a part of the group community; no one knew why, they just knew I wasn't at my desk. I was so scared, panicked, and ashamed to tell them about what was happening; I didn't want them to think less of me or believe me to not be as smart as them (I tend to work a bit slower than those guys!).

Today, I finally told the head of my group; just that I have anxiety and panic attacks. He sat me down and asked me for more information. Turns out, his wife also suffers from PTSD from 9/11 (we're in NYC), anxiety, panic attacks, depression, and depersonalization disorder; he was completely empathetic and supportive. He even asked about my medication regimen and spoke about his wife's. I was so scared to tell this person something personal about me that, try as I may, is a major part of who I am and how I do my work. Instead of thinking less of me, he was incredibly helpful and offered a great deal of support; he let me know that he understood and was there to help if I needed him.

So, after such a success with something that I had been dreading to say for over a year (even had panic attacks about)... My therapist suggested just doing the things you panic over; even when your heart is pounding, because it might actually be helpful. It might not even be that bad at all. I have to ask my fellow anxiety-ridden redditors..

23 y/o female. Successful-on-paper type, type-A personality, the type that likes to DO things. Reasonably accomplished, personable, socially functional.

**Anxiety background**:

Ever since I can remember and well back into my childhood I was always an anxious and obsessive kid. I remember flipping out from stuff like having my hair look wrong or feeling forced into doing things. Came from an unpleasant situation at home but made the best of it and don't attribute the environment to my problems so much as genetics and personal sensitivity to my environment.

I have ""wave"" panic attacks that are intermittent and come in groups. They can be ""kicked up"" by any particular event and the most recent trigger was watching an episode of Intervention where the girl being ""intervened"" upon had a heart attack at 19 and I then proceeded to convince myself that I was going to have one as well. When I am not having full blown anxiety attacks I have a constant dull ""whirr"" of anxious feelings that predominate my thoughts when I am not distracted by something more important. I take (prescribed and monitored) Ativan on a regular basis to help me deal with my panic attacks and anxious thoughts. It is supposed to be a short-term medication but it is the only thing I have found that has worked while also offering me enough clarity to function, so my Dr. and I made a conscious decision to keep me on it for as long as is necessary and then do a controlled withdrawal.

My brand of anxiety includes obsessive feelings and thoughts, occasional compulsing (typically manifests itself as over-grooming or meticulous habits like filling a plastic cup with water and dumping it out twice before I'll drink out of it etc). I also deal with intense and unyielding feelings of guilt and shame over the most trivial of things on a near constant basis. I perpetually obsess that I may be being judged, discussed or observed without my knowledge even though I know for 100% certain that I am not and want these feelings gone. 

**Issue**:

I have a few concurrent and interrelated medical problems that both make the anxiety worse, and are also caused by the anxiety simultaneously. I made a [handy chart](http://imgur.com/HtQ2U) to help you understand what I mean.

* IBS: Can't poop, won't poop, wish I could, makes me anxious and feel disgusting and bloated and angry. Thus more anxiety, mostly about my health and my appearance. The more stressed I get, the worse the IBS gets. They feed off each other.

* ED: Suck at food, been diagnosed ED for 11 years, used to seriously abuse laxatives, likely the cause of the IBS. The pain associated with the IBS perpetuates issues with ""unsafe"" foods and allows me to justify not eating. Thinking about food or not eating it makes the anxiety worse.

* PCO: Most recently I got diagnosed with polycystic ovaries (not the syndrome, just the cysts) after having a number of meltdowns regarding pain in my pelvis that nobody took seriously... since I panic about everything. Ultrasound revealed massive cysts on both ovaries which are impacting my hormones. The effect this has had on my identity is huge. I worry constantly about being rendered infertile and it can take the anxiety from a ""6"" to a ""10"" if thoughts about infertility get thrown into the mix. I feel very unwomanly as a result of this reproductive system failure, so staying thin and ""pretty"" becomes a priority, and thus, ED.

The worst part about all of this is that I am otherwise entirely rational perhaps to a fault, have always been a successful student and worker, and feel that my obsessiveness sometimes gives me a competitive edge: I have extensive knowledge/ability in my areas of interest, for example. 

My ability to retain information (both good and bad, real and distorted) is definitely a strong suit... but at the same time, I wish I could let go of all the extra junk that floats in my head, and I can't.

I just made these connections earlier this morning. I knew they were all related but didn't realize to what extent. This is a breakthrough that may be able to help me along in my journey to getting this out of my system. Anyone else ever dealt with anything like this or have any suggestions? Obviously my situation is going to be different from yours but ANY suggestions about lifestyle management or other tips would be largely appreciated.

I have been feeling better and better lately and my anxiety levels have dropped a bit. I can feel my life having the potential to move in a more positive and productive direction and don't want this to get in the way. Want to get better.

**TL;DR**: Anxiety feeds off comorbid conditions, has been a lifelong problem. Realize it's stupid, want it to stop, feel caught up and entangled.

I've been going to therapy/CBT for about two months now, and it's was helping me quite a bit. But right now I feel like giving up. I have a pretty terrible job an undisclosed retail store I'll call ""cold gravy."" I feel most of the people there treat me unfairly, but I'm an extremely sensitive person so I thought it might just be that. Then two days ago one of my managers told me that she had been told by a coworker that they thought other people were being mean to me. I told my manager that whoever was reportedly treating me that way was probably just being strict, even though I know who it was who was being mean and that it was more than just strictness.  For the rest of my shift, I was just wishing I could go back in time and tell her the truth.

Outside of work I failed out of college last fall and had to move back to my hometown, and unfortunately all of my friends from here have moved away for one reason or another. Most aren't even in this state anymore, not that I blame them. I've also never had been in a relationship before, which contributes significantly to my loneliness, but that might be a story for another post/another subreddit. On the first I'm starting a physics class at the small college here, as getting an A in a class there is one of the few conditions of my return to college in the fall. Although I'm not too thrilled about the class, maybe I'll meet people my age that I like. Then again, that's exactly what I thought about my job before I started.

I just feel like giving up. My anxiety is pretty severe, for example the reason I flunked out of school was because many days I was too afraid to even leave my apartment to go to class. I've recently started the medication shuffle and right now I'm on 112.5 mg effexor and 100 mg zoloft nightly, with the effexor scheduled to go up and the zoloft down at my next psych appointment. I used to smoke weed as well because it legitimately helped me, at least my mood if not my anxiety as well. However ""I"" (read: my parents) have decided it would be best if I quit for a while, so I did And I'll be the first to admit that I was emotionally dependent on it, but then again, I'm emotionally dependent on spending large amounts of time by myself.  I've considered it just being withdrawals, but for many reasons I don't believe this to be the case.  

All in all the mixture of lonliness and boredom I feel on a daily basis coupled with me being treated like I'm less than human at work is too much for me. I feel like it's undoing the work on my mental health that I've tried so hard to accomplish.  Sometimes I honestly wish I was dead, and that's not a feeling I've had in a long time.

First, a little background.

I'm in my very late teens, I'm female, bisexual panromantic, Canadian, I have social anxiety, PTSD, and emotional repression. I am untreated (no meds), and have no access to doctors or other people due to my living situation. I can't call hotlines as I don't have a phone and the walls are so thin in this house that they'd hear me if I tried to use the home phone. I am not allowed outside, and it is not a choice that I made . . .

I've known a girl since we were both eleven years old, and we've been dating since January 1st, at four-thirty in the morning, when we promised each other that we would get married a few years down the road. No rings, of course, we're both strapped on cash and we'll pick out the engagement rings once we get some money flowing. She's known that I've been in love with her since we were fourteen, and didn't reject it. I am also a woman.

I've (legally) left secondary school early due to being screwed over by the system (I'm of above average intelligence and will only do things that interest me, such as study forensics or people-watching . . . I also was running from an abuser and was shunted off to a people-the-district-didn't-want learning centre that was too far away and much too wibbly-wobbly on their policies, hours, and grading for me to put any real effort into it - the way I was screwed over was that they kept making me repeat because I couldn't prove that I had a disability in math, because my absolute failure of a family doctor, whom I have a great dislike for, refused to sign off on it) to pursue a freelance job writing screenplays for television (which I do for fun and no profit, I'll explain in a bit) as well as directing my own successful animated series on public access, and she's going to be graduating very soon. 

I don't have my GED, and I have a disability in mathematics that the district and my family doctor refuses to acknowledge, because on IQ tests and other such things, I've scored too high. I'd take it to court, but I don't have the money and my parents don't care. I went to an arts school as a child that didn't teach much math, and I've struggled with it all my life. I'm not good with concrete things and restrictions. Never been a rule-follower.

My family is beyond horrible, twisted, and sick, I'm not going to get too far into it due to legal issues (if I were to say anything more in public like this, I could possibly get more than a few people thrown in prison), but I will be fleeing them come next September, when I hit my province's age of majority. My girlfriend will be moving to another city soon (around 45 minutes away, where I live, there are a bunch of cities side by side that flow into one another, quite an odd area) with her mum to be closer to her older sister and adorable baby niece. I know her family well and they love having me around. 

They've offered to pick me up whenever I want to come over to their new house, so that my parents and family won't be able to find out the address. I don't know if I'd have to pay rent, I'm guessing probably, because it is a single-parent household (the mother, who's still quite young, never married or stuck with either father, and both are deadbeats) that's supported on a nurse's assistant's salary. So, not a lot. 

My girlfriend is very smart, but she's very stubborn and unmoving on a lot of subjects. She does care a lot about me, but is an introvert and isn't a talker. My childhood was psychologically isolated and abusive, hers was filled with being shunted from one family member to the next. I was bullied, she fucked up the bullies. 

As of now, my parents refuse to let me outside even for a walk, I'm often without food or proper hygiene stuff (mostly razors and shampoo, I don't have any luxuries like makeup or skincare creams), I haven't had new clothes since I was 13, I have no phone, and we're not even terribly poor anymore to justify those things. We don't do anything as a family, everybody just either watches television, mopes about, or works, or worships the ground that my brother walks on (my family's very sexist). I spend around 90% of my day on the computer, and I'm only let out of the house if I want to see my girlfriend (who they think is just my friend) on weekends, and only once a month or so.

Trust me when I say it's better if I just ride this one out for the next couple months. 

I have very little experience with the outside world, even though I am an expert at reading people like books. I'm not well-versed on, for example, buying things, and the very thought of going by myself and buying something, say, a pair of pants, terrifies me. I cannot drive, though I'm well past the age to do so. Public transport is expensive and scarce here, and taxi's are way too expensive for most people. I have eyesight problems as well, on top of documented social anxiety, PTSD and emotional repression. I am not allowed help for any of this. For four years (late 2007 - late 2011), I was sexually and psychologically abused by a man I wasn't related to, with my family's support backing him. My family seems to think that women are property, and don't care much about my education as a whole (the first person to graduate in my family EVER was a cousin of mine). 

I've been suffering ever since I left him from PTSD, which has been diagnosed but untreated.

I want to work as either a youth worker or just directing. She says that I should go and get my degree in psychology and work on my directing on the side, and honestly, I'm not sure what I want to do. I'd be comfortable just making money doing what I'm doing now, but I don't want to end up broke in a flat somewhere with nothing to our names. Mostly, I want to just leave the country, and the influence of my family over my life. Moving provinces isn't an option - I have relatives in all of them. Most of America as well.

Now, here's where my girlfriend and I differ in our plans, and it's driving me INSANE. I've always wanted to leave home and then we'd stay in Canada for a few months, and then go to England (I'm thinking Bristol), where I've planned to live for a VERY long time, just to get away from my family and live in peace. The advantage of growing up on British media is that I can fit in just fine there. She knows that staying in Canada would risk not only my safety, but her and her family's. 

She still doesn't want to go.

We are (somewhat) young, but we are intelligent (we both can't remember the last time we've made a life-changingly stupid decision, we both don't smoke, drink, party, or do drugs) and I love her very much. She has abandonment/trust issues from growing up with her young mother being in and out of rehab for drugs and alcohol. Her mum's great now, and is on the right path, but the issues are still there. She just wants to go to university and stay here, close to her family.

A good description of our relationship is that it's mostly conversations, where I come to her with problems and she listens to them and provides a safe haven for me to vent off steam and just enjoy myself and actually laugh and smile sincerely. We usually share her bed or pass out on the couch, and just talk for hours and hours. She's told me that she trusts only me, I also trust her too, and we communicate freely and openly - she knows if I'm not telling her something and won't stop until I tell her. Usually I only refrain because I feel ashamed of being so ""normal people"" inexperienced, but she often sets my mind on the right path - I can always learn, right? There are some things that I've told her we need to work on, as we aren't very physical (she has problems with person-to-person contact from the slew of creep boyfriends her mother brought around her during childhood) and often refuses to talk about her feelings, and we've never had sex. 

I've brought it up with her, but she often just refuses to talk about it because it makes her uncomfortable. If she's not ready, I'm okay with that. I can wait. I have the patience of a saint from growing up having to wait years for anything I ask for. I know what it's like to get nothing for my birthday or Christmas, so I can wait for sex. We both aren't religious and believe in regeneration (NOT reincarnation - we believe that when you die, the energy doesn't just stop existing, it /has/ to go somewhere, so we agree that we think you are born as a new person with little/no present memories from your past life, it's a little new-agey but we don't go shoving it down people's throats . . . to each their own! We claim to know exactly nothing concrete, and are flexible and open to other's ideas of what happens when you die) so it's not a purity/wait-until-marriage thing. We are in a lesbian relationship, so the qualifier for most are lost with the first word, which is sad. 

What frustrates me is that I want to be more physically open with her, and I don't know how to do it. I've tried talking to her, but that doesn't work - it's literally all talk, no action. I don't mean sex, just things like kissing and suchlike (it has nothing to do with being ""out"" as we have kissed and held hands in public, when her family wasn't around). We do want to marry one day, and have kids (we have a few gay friends on either side that are happy to help out, and adoption is always an option - we'd prefer older children if we adopted, because they always get ignored by prospective parents), and maybe settle somewhere. I just don't want it to be Canada, because I won't risk the safety of our kids, ourselves, and her family.

(If we were to leave, her family in Canada wouldn't be at risk because they would drop the search, like they did for my cousin-in-law, and just pretend that he never existed. I have solid proof that they'd be okay. It's also not an aversion to England, we both prefer the familiar rainy, dreary sort of thing, which is probably why so many Brits choose this area of the province to move to, as the climate and culture is as close as it gets.)

Sometimes, our conversations get so far as the compromise of visiting them on holidays, or bringing them to our place. It's not like we're bad with money, I'm horrible at math but we both grew up poor and know how to balance the books and budget flawlessly. We'd be able to save up beforehand to make it work. I'm willing to leave after she's done her university, of course, and she did tell me that if she hated her courses, she'd switch to another school. I'm very scared that I won't be able to hold down a menial job (social anxiety and general lack of other-people experience outside of an overcrowded classroom hinder me from being able to do teamwork or take orders), and I need to find something that'd be good for me. I would do freelance editing or computer help, but I don't want to seem lazy as they all don't see how I can stay on the computer so much, even if I am their tech support when their electronics bite back. 

I also have a fear that if I move in with her and her mother, that some of my habits and hindrances (for example, I have no knowledge of how to use modern kitchen appliances, as everything I've grown up with was 1970 or older minus our dial-operated microwave, and I have a habit of making tea in the mid-afternoon, when they don't own a kettle) may weird them out, and that I may just be too scared to do anything and I'll end up failing in their eyes. I don't know a thing about normal life expectations outside of television, which is daunting and, according to her, unreliable. I don't know how well I can cope with having my little shell of a world being mostly taken from me. I won't be able to spend a lot of time doing my stress-relief stuff like tumblr or just reading, because I'd be working or helping out her family. I've told her this, and she just told me that I'd learn to deal with it. But I'm scared I won't. I'm so scared.

I'm unsure if I'll even be able to get the courage to do this. I'm a very angry person but I am physically weak (I'm overweight and have little muscle from being kept indoors most of my life) and can't take it out on anybody. I have little self-worth or courage and, though she said she'd help me move out when my family was out and just leave a note telling them to go fuck themselves, I'm scared I may back out. My family alternates between ignoring my existence (I've failed them by not staying with my abuser, therefore they've no reason to care about me) and leaning on me to do everything for them and fix their problems. Sometimes I feel like I should cling to them, even though everybody I talk to (I don't have real-life friends, just online ones) says in no uncertain terms to haul ass and leave. I feel such attachment to my horribly fucked-up life, and I don't really know why, except that it's all I know. 

I just am so scared that I don't know what I'm getting into. I want to leave for England in five years (at the most seven), she isn't being clear on why she doesn't want to go, as I would have it all under control. I have many online friends backing me on going, but I don't know how to convince her . . . she's stubborn, like I said, and so am I. I cannot, CANNOT compromise on this. I am doing this for the both of us and she treats the idea like it's something out of a child's mind, or she gets uncommunicative with me and assumes a very closed, pouty posture, or she locks up and puts on the smiley act and changes the topic. We never have had communication issues, so what is it? I also want to travel quite a bit to make up for everything I've missed, mainly around the UK, and she just told me flat-out that we could do that later, when we were old. I don't want to work through my twenties and be miserable and regret living with her. I want to travel and see the world and she knows that I can make room for her to get an education. I don't care about money that much, I have zero plans on being super rich as the thought makes me uncomfortable. I just want world experiences, I want to live simply, and I want to have my home base be somewhere where we're both very culturally comfortable. I want to be more physically open, and I'm too scared of easing into it because when I try, she can see right through me and closes up completely for the rest of the night and I feel horrible. I have one night a month to see her, and in between, maybe one email conversation as I can't call her.

I've asked for her opinion, but she doesn't want to give it. What do I do? Again, talking gets us nowhere. I want to just be sure in my resolve to do the plan that we've had for a long time (since before New Year's Day).

Like soldering or tinkering with smaller tings. I always just thought some people just don't have steady enough hands to do this kind of stuff, so never worried about it. I've also lost around 110 lbs the last 3 years, but that did take effort and it did make me a lot more sociable than I've been the last 10 years. 


About 6-7 months ago I started feeling unrest often, I thought this was nothing to worry about. I just saw it as a positive thing since it got me to actually go exercise more instead of just watching TV. 


Then right after new year I managed to break my arm (humerus) The doctor gave me 3 weeks worth of Oxycontin which I stopped after 2.5 weeks when it gave me a panic attack, the first two days of withdrawal was laying in bed with freezing waves that made me cry for 2 days. After the first two days it become better and better, but I would still sometimes get freezing waves and just feel really sad.  


In the start I wouldn't drink much alcohol, since I wanted to recover as fast as possible, but the unrest at weekends would make me go party with friends. I had a lot of fun and weekends flew by, during the week I would exercise when I got bored of staying at home. I would never have a bad hangover, was kinda surprised that I could go on a 45 min walk just hours after waking up after a night at town. Last few weeks of my sick leave I would even party two days in a row on weekends.


Then 3 weeks ago after drinking two days in a row, I would wake up as normal and just feel slightly tired. I was watching a movie and relaxing, then I get this panic feeling and it felt like I was about to pass out. I just put on some cloths and went out walking, nothing really felt wrong while walking. But when I got home and tried to relax again the panic/shaking would come back again. I ended up going out for a walk 3 times that day. I ended up having moderate shakes for 3 days after this.


2 weeks ago I only went out 1 day, everything seems fine in the morning but when I was relaxing at evening I got the same dizzy feeling and started panic again. This time it was a lot worse, If I focused on something for more than 10 sec my vision would start to drift/blurry/unfocused. I tried to go for a walk, but my mind was so gone that it felt like my legs was just on auto pilot and I would almost forget that I was actually walking. I started to get afraid of tripping and hurting myself, so I went back home just after 500 meters. At this point I had major shaking and couldn't focus on anything. my first thought was low blood sugar or dehydration, so I drank water and made tea with lots of sugar. But it didn't help much, so I got a friend to drive me to the ER, where I had to wait for almost 2 hours. While I was sitting there shaking like crazy, I would see the floor start floating around like it was water. Then the guys that was in the doctors office with heart problem started making sounds like he was dying. This freaked me so much out that I had to go out in the parking lot until it was my turn, ended up walking in circle for 1 hour trying not to focus on anything more than a few seconds. When it finally was my turn, the doctor took all kinds of tests for 2 hours and couldn't find anything wrong. EKG, blood pressure and blood sugar was all ok. When driving home it was already 01:00 and I was really tired, but when I closed my eyes I would see lots of faces and they would even shake like crazy, they would also become deformed. When I tried to sleep that night I would suddenly get this feeling everything was wrong, then after a while everything felt ok again and I would fall back to sleep. This kept going all night. This time I would only have major shakes for one more day before feeling ""kinda"" okey again.


Then come last weekend, I had decided to not really do any crazy drinking. I would have shakes that I could feel all the time at this point and didn't really feel like making it worse. But this cute girl managed to convince me to come party with them. I bought only one 6 pack and took it easy, had a nice evening and went to pub where I maybe had two 0.5L beers. But the next day I would get the same bad feeling, in an effort to keep my mind on other things I called/texted lots of friends. When that didn't work I got a friend to come to my place with a 6 pack and a bottle of 33% rum, neither of us wanted to deal with anxiety/panic so we started trying to drink it away. After 3 beers each and a rum bottle, we managed to get more booze and we got drunker than we had been in a while. Next day the panic was there as expected, I was shaking like crazy but managed to distract myself most of the day, but it was really hard and tiring. When it became time to sleep I would get the same hearth beating/racing and get the fainting feeling, whenever I managed to almost fall to sleep I would get vivid dreams that would wake me up right away. I even went to check my door for real after dreaming that someone was knocking. 
Now 4 days later I'm still shaking if I try to relax, the shakes also doubles now if I drink coffee or use nicotine (snus, ecig or normal cigs). I also woke up with a big rash on my arm, but it was gone the next day.


Turning alcoholic has crossed my mind, but I don't really have the urge to drink everyday. But I have a really hard time saying no to being social at weekends. Shaking quite bad right now and about to go to bed and probably not get more than 4-5 hours sleep before work tomorrow :/  Have a doctors appointment on Friday to see if there might be something causing all this. Don't really want to start on meds for the panic attacks, since I got a friend and she has 5 different personalities depending on if she is sober, drunk or meds.",['conj'],0

I usually get to go once or twice a month.  Since my appointments are scattered around in no reasonable pattern, I then have to tell my boss that I need to switch hours.

I never know what to say about this.  They really prefer it if I'm in at consistent hours, understandably enough, which means that whenever I have to change hours I get the strong sense that my boss wants an explanation.

For the past few months I seemed to have developed some sort of nasty generalized anxiety. Lets go back in time a few months. I graduated last winter and did not have anything to do, just waiting for dental school to start in July. So I just chilled at home watching shows and not doing much of anything. Not much at all seemed to happen until April where I did a lot of driving (Seattle to San Fran) to help my mom with some paperwork she had to do there for an embassy. I noticed that during the drive and while I was down there I was really anxious. It was like this... constant uncomfortableness, fatigue, dizziness, poor sleep, etc. One night I had a traditional anxiety attack. High heart rate, shortness of breath, fear, and doom. Nothing seemed to trigger it though. It just ""happened"". I walked around a bit, collected myself, and went back to trying to sleep.

So then we drove home and I wasnt feeling to well. Light headed, dizziness, fatigued, headaches. But after a few days I went back to my regular grind of shows and computer. Things seemed to settle down a bit. I was feeling a bit ""flat"" though, not depressed/sad, but just kinda flat.

So now were are at middle/late May. I went to Thailand. I was a bit anxious on the plane, which was unusual, but it wasnt bad. We get there, its fine. The first week goes by without any problems. Start of second week though we start going from island to island. Its just my friend and I, its going ok. I dont normally drink, one night though we played this stupid park the bus game and kings cup. I lost the kings cup and ended up drinking this practically full cup of vodka redbull. I felt like death the whole night. Throwing up, anxious, bad, awful. Eventually comes the next day. Im laying there and suddenly feel a fever. It was bad. We go to the Thai hospital and they think I have breakbone fever since it was so high. I didnt. I did though stay at the hospital for 2 days. I had a stomach infection and a blood infection. 

I get out of the hospital. I feel pretty good! So we go to the next island. Which has no medical care... and our hostels ac wasnt working right... My body completely crashes. I have this constant dizziness, fatigue, headache, and this weird dull anxiety. No racing heart rate, but still that feeling that you just want to push out but cant. I dont sleep well for a few days, then we head out back to bangkok for the flight home. It was awful, lots of bus riding, no sleep, and plane flight. During which time I also pick up an eye infection. 

We make it back to Seattle and I feel so relieved to be home. Im tired, still sick, jet lagged, but im home. Over the next few days I visit a doctor to check up and I start getting better. I did smoke weed to try to help me just relax and mostly because I was bored. About 5 days later at night before going to bed I smoked and had this weird sensation that my hand and mouse was HUGE and my proprioception was way off. It kind of freaked me out and I got really anxious. Got sudden diarrhea, and for the first time ever my body started shaking! First my legs, then torso, then arms, then jaw. I could barely talk. It really freaked me out. But my heart rate and blood pressure was fine. I walked around outside with my legs occasionally locking up but then went to bed.

Here is where it starts getting bad. The following several days I felt AWFUL. VERY dizzy, incredibly fatigued, had no desire to do anything, headaches, and had this uncomfortableness that would just not leave me alone. I stopped smoking thinking it was that. But it wasnt getting all that much better. After about a week of that hell it started to get a bit better. I still had the uncomfortableness, fatigue, dizziness, flatness, but it was all slowly getting better.

There were also days where for about half the day I felt ""ok"" and functional. Had energy etc. But then I would crash, or how it seemed to me. My anxiety only seemed to get worse or bad when I was tired. 

So then a few weeks later I help my friend move to San Fran. I took a benadryl part of the way down and it was BAD. I felt like I was going to pass out. No high heart rate. Just this fear of passing out, hot flashes, dizziness, panic. Eventually get to sleep. Wasnt very functional next day. But over the course of a couple days we moved in. During which time I realized that wine did not help me feel better or worse. I also realized that my appetite was non existent and that I was losing a lot more weight than I thought. 

I finally get back to Seattle. Im feeling a bit better. Go to the my doctor again and we talk about trying lexapro. 5mg. I agreed. Took it for 2 days and the side effects were not something I could tolerate. Tweaky in the evenings and morning. Really tired during the day. Thats not gonna fly in school. So we stopped lexapro. A few days later I noticed that my anxiety wasnt too bad but I am so fatigued. My sleep is poor, im tired all day, I still have flatness, headaches, dizziness. All still there. I start my dental school orientation tomorrow... Im pretty scared that I wont be able to perform as well as I used to when I applied. I just want to get rid of this dizziness and fatigue, I also miss enjoying food and wanting it. 

I know its a lot so ill try to make a tldr

But its the aftermath that I feel horrible, as if I have committed some sort of social crime. It feels like my insides are rotting and twisting, and I feel the need to breathe much more heavily to oxygenate my body. Sometimes the physical discomfort lasts for hours until I take my sleeping pills and fall into a good dream. 

It just almost always feels like I am making social interaction mistakes, and I probably am. I feel as if i should NOT be expressing my potentially controversial opinions, or I should just talk less in general. I keep overthinking little things I said or ways I behaved, worried about how others are judging me. The acceptance from my peers feels extremely important for my sense of peace and wellbeing. 

Sometimes even when I don't think I did anything wrong, I still feel ill. 

An event also occurred at university (or rather a university facebook page) early this year that made me feel absolutely horrible, and felt particularly horrible because of my weird anxiety problem.  

I really enjoyed a particular paper in the semester, and I even enjoyed the exam. So right after the exam I went onto the paper's facebook page and wrote something like ""This paper is great. Great lecturers, great labs, interesting content. Really enjoyed the semester"" , then someone commented ""Stop sucking dick"" and that one comment got a whole ton of likes from fellow students. I just felt really hopeless and hated, and I felt like quitting university over such a stupid petty thing. Kept crying till I fell asleep. Even now in the new semester I keep thinking about that almost every day I walk into the university grounds, that the other students in the class hate me. 

I know that this is such a small problem and I know what mindset I need to have, but I keep getting plagued by my instinctual ""your peers must like you, you are a disgrace, you always act wrong"" feeling along with the physical discomforts of panic, depression and anxiousness.

I had weekly one hour sessions with a psychologist in his private home. I got mostly ""mhmm""s and ""how does that make you feel"". It didn't allow me to open up and I continued with my burdens. I eventually stopped showing.

He is interested as well, but somewhat reluctant to pursue anything, and one factor is his anxiety/panic attack.  Several times in a row now we were supposed to see each other, but he could not make it due to attacks.

Regardless of my romantic interest, he is someone I truly want to be able to help and comfort when he has his attacks or is anxious about another one coming, simply because I care about him.  He is medicated but having issues with it until he sees his doctor again.  He is deeply afraid of getting much worse.

I want to be there for him as best as I can.  How can I do this?  How do you respond to someone when they say they feel hopeless and ruled by anxiety and medications?  What have been said or done that made you feel better in times of extreme anxiety/panic?  How can someone that cares about you best comfort you when you aren't doing well?

Currently, I realized that the thing that hurts me the most is the obsessive and intrusive thoughts that keep occurring. I find innocent information in the world, and then I manage to put a negative spin on it and use it to make me feel insecure or terrible about myself.

He used to throw me around and 'practise wrestling moves' on me.  There are home videos of my other brother, the middle child, and in the background you can hear me screaming and crying out of fear and/or pain.  When I was two he told me I was adopted (I was) out of malice.  When I was three, he threw a dart at me and it hit me in the upper thigh.  It couldn't have been an accident because the dart board was in front of him and I was standing behind him.  

When I was 6 we were fighting about something and I ran to hide behind our parents bedroom door and he saw me run there, so he slammed the door open on me, breaking my nose.  

I could go on, listing specific incidences that I remember but I'm starting to shake and cry just remembering these incidents.  The thing I remember the most though is how it made him laugh when he hurt me.  He enjoyed hurting me.  

He's always been something of a fuck up too, always getting himself into shit and then getting my parents to bail him out.  He's 34 and owes them hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The truck he's had for 5 years is in my dad's name, and my brother has just started to make payments on it, like this year recently.  Because my parents are always bailing him out of shit he caused, when I've needed help with paying for therapy and medication they've had to tell me no because they gave all their money to fucking Kevin and they can't afford to help me.

He's also a pathological liar, and very manipulative, and more than once now this has affected me directly in a negative way, like the time I found out he was sexting with the girl who bullied me through school and whose actions drove me to try to kill myself twice, once when I was 13 and once when I was 17. 

There's so much more to this, like how our relationship has panned out as adults (it's not good, the money situation with my parents and sexting with that slut is just the tip of the ice berg) but I don't think I can write any more.

1. Deep, slow breathing, for long periods of time. After a while, my body gets calmed, I can think more clearly and my mind slows down.

2. Talking about my anxiety with someone I trust. I just vent, and I ask that person to just listen. It helps understand me a little bit better. I realized that by trying to explain my symptoms out loud, they end up seeming illogical to my mind and the anxiety levels go down.

3. Remember that anxiety is the ""fight or flight"" natural response of the body? Well, I go out and run fast, in an angry way. It helps a lot to discharge tue anxiety, by making my mind and my body tired. It can end up being a little bit addictive. The feeling is awesome after I finish and it is healthy.

4. Green tea. Several cups of it when I'm at the office. It can calm me down and it has a weird effect in my mind that allows me to concentrate much better.

5. Avoid cigarettes and caffeine. Cigarettes are the worst in all senses. I stopped smoking when I realized they affected my anxiety considerably. Coffee is only helpful when I am not having anxiety attacks, otherwise, it makes the symptoms much worse.

6. If you have the money, go to a psychiatrist and get medication. I am under sertraline, and it started doing wonders after the first 3 weeks of usage. It was prescribed for me for 6 months. My anxiety attacks have almost completely dissapeared.

7. Force yourself to understand that you want to feel better and you are going to do all you can to get better. Don't give up. Consider yourself lucky: you were born in a time when methods and medication exist to treat mental problems.

You are not alone. You are understood by a lot of people and we are all together in this. We must help each other.",['conj'],0

The obvious answer is immediate-acting anti-anxiety meds (benzodiazepines) such as Klonopin, Xanax etc but I’ve found I still have problems with anxiety even after taking the benzo I’m prescribed (Klonopin), even if it does somewhat diminish my anxiety and take the edge off of things.  The second obvious answer is alcohol but personally I’ve found that about 20% of the time it makes things marginally better and the other 80% of the time it makes my anxiety and general sanity/emotional well-being *significantly* worse; this has all been whilst drinking alone though...social drinking is an entirely different animal which I’ve found has a much higher success rate the few times I’ve done it.

So what are some other methods or techniques you guys find useful for instant anxiety relief?  I’m not looking for long-term solutions like therapy, SSRIs, or other things that typically take weeks or months to see benefits from, as I’ve tried many of these already with mixed results and am really just looking for ideas to alleviate or lessen anxiety right away while it’s actually happening.
So far some of my solutions are ASMR videos, such as these:

#1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVpfHgC3ye0
#2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UrUsduW4FA
#3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g9e2ner9sE
#4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv4BOmjRids

*(Also head over to /r/asmr for many more videos like this)*

Also, particularly soothing music seems to help as well – [this track](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CySNhHVAokQ) in particular is [claimed by scientists to be the “most relaxing song ever”](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8830066/Band-creates-the-most-relaxing-tune-ever.html) and, according to [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marconi_Union#Weightless), “it induced a 65% reduction in overall anxiety and brought test subjects' resting pulse rates to 35% of their usual resting rates.""

Two albums also come to mind; [“Dive” by Tycho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_%28Tycho_album%29) and [“Black Sands” by Bonobo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sands).

After playing these videos and songs on a daily basis for years I’ve found I’ve become rather desensitized to them unfortunately, but they do still help a little (and hopefully will better help others out there just discovering them for the first time).  

In addition, I find lighting candles, turning the heat up, and drinking certain kinds of tea to also help somewhat.  Oh, and scalp massagers, too…for those of you who don’t know, it’s [these things](http://i.imgur.com/RBOv9db.jpg).

So those are a few of my semi-solutions, but I’m very interested in hearing from the rest of you.  Be they songs or albums that relax you, massage or relaxation tools/devices, types of tea, or any other thing, technique, product or method that reduces or alleviates your anxiety right away...what’s worked the best for you?",['attr'],0

I'm sorry for the wall of text. I know I'm being completely insane, but I just need some reassurance and maybe an internet hug.

**Background:** 
I have been dealing with anxiety since I was 14. I've seen numerous therapists and am currently taking Lamictal and Abilify in unison to quell my mood swings and general anxiety, as well as a panic medication for when the panic attacks start to set in. 

Earlier this year, I left a 3-year relationship that was incredibly toxic and manipulative. When I got out, I felt a huge weight lifted from me. I started getting along better with my family and my self-esteem and self-worth skyrocketed. I was in a much better place and eventually decided I was ready to jump back into dating.

Now, I've always been a clingy person by nature. It's been problematic in the past. I've had several men say ""Listen, you have to back off"" and then totally disappear on me. I eventually learned to hide my emotions and pretend I wasn't as attached as I really was. It worked for quite some time. 

**Currently:** 
When I decided to get back into dating, I reactivated my OkCupid account. I started dating two men (who I referred to previously as Robert and Cole, so we'll stick to that) and I was feeling pretty good. Cole was kind of a show off with his money, which didn't really attract me. Robert was emotional and we had long talks about some deep-rooted experiences and feelings. He mentioned he was also a fairly needy person in relationships. This made me feel more comfortable to open up. After seeing both men and getting an idea of who each really was, Robert and I decided to no longer see other people. I was ecstatic.

This is where things get sticky. I assumed that since Robert and I were on the same page and so similar, that I could be more open and more myself. I wouldn't have to put up that wall and hide my emotions. I got clingy. I'm not proud of it, but it happened.  I panicked and apologized, as he didn't seem too into it, but he told me to relax and that he'd like to see me again. He told me we'd probably have to wait until the weekend, but that it would definitely happen.

I felt a little better. Far less anxious. I went about my day on Monday feeling pretty alright. We talked that evening and sent a few, slightly sexy messages to each other but when he stopped replying I assumed he had fallen asleep.

Then Tuesday and Wednesday (yesterday) happened. I sent a couple texts each day, trying to ask questions in order to start a conversation. *""Hey, how's your day going?""*, *""Do you know when you'll be free yet?""*, etc. I didn't send tons of them, and I spaced them out quite a bit over the days. But his reply was... radio static. Nothing. I want to be optimistic and assume he's just been really busy, but I mean, that's tough when he's going completely silent. My mind is racing with *""He doesn't like me anymore""* and *""I scared him away""*.

I've made a plan for the next couple days though. Today, I will leave him alone and just try to calm down. I have plans for the day and night so hopefully I can stay distracted. Tomorrow, after work, I'm going to call him and see what's up with this weekend. If he doesn't answer and then get back to me, I'm going to assume he's pulling the fade and just let it go. 

I know I'm being unreasonable and he's probably just busy, but my anxiety is completely ruining me. I just wish he'd say anything. *""Hey, sorry. I've been busy. Talk later!""* or *""Hey, this isn't going to work because you're a fucking psycho""*. At least I'd know what to think and where to go from here.

Maybe I wasn't ready for this. I don't know. I mean, he's the one who initiated being exclusive and I even spent the night the last time I saw him. I think I need an institution, I feel like a complete basketcase crazy.

**TL;DR:** I'm being kind of insane over a man, which hasn't happened in years and I don't know how to stop. My clinginess has probably already scared him away, I just need some support and advice for the future. And maybe an internet hug.",['conj'],0

I'm a 20 year old male, with severe anxiety that causes instant dizziness and nausea. I'm dizzy everytime I'm not asleep and even than I wake up in the middle of the night feeling bad. My parents refuse to believe that it might be anything else, or help me when I am basically crying cause I'm sick of feeling this way. 

I graduated high school in 2013 with a high gpa and good grades and I didn't have terrible anxiety nor was dizziness a symptom than. (I've had anxiety since I was in elementary school).  And they convinced me to stay at home at a community college for a year or two cause of money. My parents make decent money, but because they never save we live paycheck to paycheck in a $300k+ house. So they refuse doctor visits and medication, even after my doctor and another neurologist ordered a MRI of my head..she said yeah sure! And than refused after. That was a year ago. 

I did poorly in one of my classes, I took notebooks of notes, there wasn't any tests only one paper and a group presentation. I did the entire presentation for my group cause they had kids and long hours at work, and my paper he said sucked because I didn't use the sources he wanted. Which was a book over 100 years old that costs over $200 just for a copy. He failed most of the class, and complaints to the dean didn't do a thing. Now they refuse to pay for school. 

They told me to get a job, and I got one but they aren't happy that I picked that specific job cause they said, ""you'll get bored"" it's the local Y. I love it there with nice people, something to keep my anxiety on the down low. 

I've been working for my mom at her job for a couple weeks finishing filling their records but I couldn't go wed, cause I had to go up to the school to remove a hold on a meningitis vaccine that I already got a year ago, and they wouldn't answer email or phone. She was pissed. Today I was supposed to go with her to work but I said I'll go, but I really need to go up to the school cause my issue was resolved but all the classes I picked are already full and idk what to take now. 

She screamed that her blood pressure was too high lately and it something happened to her it was because of me. On top of that they are basically making me break up with the gf I've had since October of last year because they like my older brothers gf more? My gf is a straight A 4.0+ gpa that is so caring and got a scholarship to one of the biggest private schools in the state. But they don't like her now. They are just trying to make me unhappy. 

I'm grounded now..and they took my car away and my devices later and I'm no allowed to leave the house or see anyone. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm so unhappy with my life.. And my anxiety has reached an all time high in my 20 years here. ",['conj'],0

She's really pushing for me to get help, and to stop running from it.

I can, and will, talk to friends as well, but it's just so frustrating to try to explain to people who don't understand. They try, but at the end of the day I just feel like they think I'm complaining about something minor or even non-existent because I can't just show them a wound to empathize with.

I have [panic disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_disorder). I remember having my first panic attack when I was younger than ten years but they don't diagnose panic disorder that young, if I'd seen a doctor they probably would've called it GAD. I saw a therapist for the first time in my early teens. The anxiety started before my family tumult but was surely exacerbated by it as time went on, I won't go into the details (an across the world move, a divorce, deaths, etc.) because that's beside the point. It was harder when I was younger because my family life was so intense and unsupportive and when I reacted physically I didn't know what was happening. I would think, sitting in my desk at school, that the bones in my hands were trying to claw their way out of my skin. At night I would curl up in a tight ball because if my feet touched the end of the bed I'd have to recognize that I was growing physically which meant I was also growing closer to death. I'd hide under the covers at night thinking that the shades over my windows were opening themselves and that monsters were waiting outside to kill me and I'd race up the stairs in the dark because I thought hands were reaching out from beneath them to grab my ankles. I was put on antipsychotics that I still have stretch marks from because I gained so much weight so quickly. After years of doctors and medications and exploration I accepted what I have and that it isn't going anywhere. Knowing what it is makes a world of difference. This is how I explain it to people now:

I'm walking down the middle of a road on a sunny day, everything is just fine. I hear a pebble skip behind me and I turn to see where it went. I find a car there, feet away, racing toward me, and I don't have time to run. My heart races, my muscles tense, my sight tunnels, my breathing stops. I'm terrified, I'm about to die. That moment of, well, panic - sometimes I feel it five times a day. Sometimes I might not feel it for a whole day or two, those I recognize as great times. Sometimes it passes in an instant and sometimes it stays for hours. It might hit me while I'm alone or while I'm with a group of people, at work or in a store. You know in movies and shows with ""crazy people"" how sometimes they'll hit their heads over and over with the palms of their hands? I do that, but I've been doing it  for so long that when I close my eyes tight and my hand goes to my forehead I'll brush my hair back so you don't recognize what I'm really doing. People comment on how often I sigh sometimes and tend to attribute it to something like boredom when really those sighs are heavy exhales because I just panicked and had been holding my breath. I've been doing this long enough that I know how to look normal and sometimes that's even more terrible because it makes it harder for people to believe me when I try to explain that I'm not well. I'm not afraid of people or situations, my self-esteem is pretty adequate and I've been described as being laid back and accepting, which is one of the bittersweet qualities of this anxiety. Being struck so often by the fear of an inevitable death gives me a lot of perspective. The absurdity of this condition is that it's given me some phenomenal gifts in addition to the daily struggles. It's hard, extremely hard, and it's the kind of dark that makes people very, very uncomfortable. I function because I have to but it takes so much more than healthy people realize, and some days, like today, I just feel so frustrated.

There's plenty more I could say but this is already growing long. I'll answer questions if you have any, I don't mind talking about it, in fact, it helps to think that I might be able to help someone else understand.",['conj'],0

I stopped having panic attacks, and I was feeling much more capable of social interactions and accomplishing work that previously had left me feeling hopeless and just sick over failing. But since those first few months on it, I slowly started slipping back into a darker place. It's not that the anxiety was back, but my depression began to catch me off guard and start weighing me down. There'd be some days where I just had no motivation to get out of bed, to get dressed. The friendships I was still maintaining began to fall by the wayside, not from the agoraphobia but more because I didn't see any point in spending time with anyone. I wasn't getting anymore enjoyment with them than I felt sitting alone in my room, so that's what I did. And that's what I'm still doing, all the time.

Now today, I woke up at 5PM to dozens of missed calls about a visit with my uncle that I completely blew off. I don't really even feel guilty right now, either. Just, eh.

I'm writing this because I feel it might help me. I'm not even sure if my problem is technically ""anxiety"", but  I've been following this sub-reddit for a while and I thought some people might be dealing with the same thing, so maybe I can begin to overcome this.

I should note that I'm 30 years old, male, and I've never been on any anxiety meds. I've never even been to a psychiatrist, even though I've thought that talking to one may just help me.

Enough of that, let me describe my issue.

I have a problem which I can best describe as ""overthinking"", and in many ways I feel as if it's become a major hindrance to my life. Essentially I overanalyze and overthink every problem in my life to an exhaustive degree. I know full well that I do this, and I understand it's likely ridiculous, but I can't ""turn it off"".

I'm self-employed, and I've found that I've really only had this problem for the past few years since I first became self-employed and it's gotten progressively worse.


My major problem is that I blow problems out of proportion, and always think of what the worst case scenario will be ... no matter how outlandish that may be.

A perfect example is something going on right now. I'm having a dispute with one of my vendors about a bill. It's a typical business problem, something people deal with everyday. They claim our company owes a certain amount, we claim that their billing is incorrect. Nothing out of the ordinary for the business world.

Now, the ""normal"" individual"" would probably think logically about this. They'd think, ""Well, we'll either come to a resolution on this, or it will end up going to court and we'll deal with it through legal means."". It wouldn't overwhelm their day, it would be a challenge in the game of life.

I don't think that way.

Sure, I understand the way it would ""likely play out"", but my mind wanders in a more outlandish way. Instead of thinking logically, I think about this ridiculous worst case scenario where we have a dispute over the amount owed and he sends goons out to my house to get me. Threatens me. Finds out where we live and this turns into a fight out of some movie where I'm battling dudes in my kitchen.

Trust me, I know how ridiculous this sounds.

Now, I need to totally note that I have no reason to think this way regarding this dispute. He's never physically threatened me, never even remotely, but that's IMMEDIATELY where my mind goes. The problem is, it's not ""one thought and then it goes away"", it turns into an obsession. It becomes something on the back of my head for an entire day (sometimes days).

It's not even that scenario. Just a few more examples of times where I overthink:

- I find myself over-analyzing emails from customers, to the point of it becoming an obsession. I'll dissect every line, the tone of the email, and more.

- If I get a missed call from a number I don't recognize on my cell phone I immediately Google the number out of some fear that it's something major.

- I'll always worry about how I'm representing my company publicly out of a fear that it will turn into a PR nightmare.

There are more examples, but it all comes down to me over-analyzing every single situation imaginable. It's exhausting and I find it takes away from my life, my personality, and who I am.

I don't enjoy it at all, but have no clue how to ""turn it off"".

I'm basically writing this in hopes that others know what I'm going through. I'm thinking that maybe some of you could offer advice from your own personal experiences.

Like I said earlier, I'm not sure if this ""overthinking"" is technically an ""anxiety issue"", but I figured reaching out to you folks couldn't help.

The short version of my story is: I'm 30, female, and diagnosed with GAD and OCD. After about eight months of CBT I decided to give medication a try about four months ago, and was put on 10mg Lexapro/day, which worked beautifully almost immediately, *except* that it made me really, really fatigued (read: crushingly exhausted, aching muscles due to longing for sleep, actively falling asleep at work - but still, you know, pretty cheerful). 

Just under a week ago my doctor gave me two weeks' worth of 20mg Lovan (i.e., Prozac) to try, with the reasoning being that it's very similar to Lexapro but with a more energising effect. It's been five days now and I'm still not sure.

I think I'm doing all right after the initial switch (I had some restlessness in my legs and arms, but that appears to have faded), and I'm very definitely awake (it's 2:48am, but the novelty of being alert hasn't worn off!), but I think I can feel the anxiety creeping back in at the edges. I'm clenching my jaw and I lost most of Tuesday and Wednesday to a migraine, and I spent a *lot* of the last 24 hours mentally rehashing an argument I had at xmas dinner/making up new mental arguments to get worked up over/generally exhausting myself by rehearsing fights I've never had, which has always been my most persistent and irritating anxiety symptom. I've also been a bit irritable with my partner, and took an off-hand comment of his earlier waaaay too personally, and had to walk off for a bit to talk myself down. I'm also pretty keen to take this keyboard apart, clean it, and put it back together, although I'm keeping a lid on that for now. :)

So, the point is: I have 9 Lovan/Prozac left, then another appointment with my doctor to discuss the results. I also have a script for Lexapro. I am very tempted to just go back to the Lexapro, but I MAY be blowing things out of proportion (I do that) and not giving the Lovan enough of a chance. If this is just an adjustment period, I'd like to get through it.

Does anyone have any perspectives they can offer on this? Thanks in advance!",['dative'],0

1. The doctors are more interested in prescribing me acne medicine instead of my ear. I can't tell if that's a good sign or a bad sign.

2. I use the term 'medicine' very loosely, because apparently you can't do anything about an ear infection other than a couple of pain killers.

3. I know that ear infections are common, especially amongst kids and teens, but I can't help but worry that it'll spread to my eardrum or something. The doctors say that my eardrum is fine, and it's just my outer ear, but I still fret.

4. I debate whether I should go running, since that helped null the pain a lot. However, I need music if I want to actually run, and the climate I live in is quite humid. Apparently I should avoid both if I want my ear to heal.

5. I still quite haven't figured out a way to take showers and keep my ear dry. (It's my right ear.) I heard cotton ball and Vaseline works dandy, but I also heard that you shouldn't stick cotton balls in the ear. I haven't heard from the doctors I've been seeing, since they're more concerned about the acne on my chin.

6. Ibuprofen helps? Ish? I got antipyrine-benzocaine otic for my ear, and something else I haven't gotten to try yet, but pretty much the ABO numbs my whole ear canal so that I don't feel anything, but it also brings a lot of discomfort. Ibuprofen works sometimes and then sometimes it doesn't.

8. There's pus coming out. Not a lot, and I know that the pus is just there to get bacteria out of my ear, but I can't help but worry if this means something much worse is about to come.

9. I got my left ear cleaned from all the earwax by my doctor. Only problem is that it still kinda feels like there's water behind my eardrum, and I really don't want to have ear infections in both ear. Also, she scraped pretty hard in order to get some earwax stuck in the back of my ear, but it felt &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; painful, and I'm worried that she touched my ear canal or something. Probably not, since they inspected my eardrum after and didn't see any problems, but I can't help but worry that the doctors are doing far more harm than good.

I also want to share my story because there is a bit of an 'anti-SSRI' bias on Reddit which I know stopped me from taking medication when It shouldn't have.

I started getting really bad bouts of depression/anxiety over two years ago, sparked by the death of a friend. Looking back, I had always been a bit 'up and down' with my moods for no reason, but it was following this period of grief that I started to really go down hill.

I had the usual symptoms: thinking about death a lot, constant generalised anxiety, constant rumination of bad things that were to happen. I also had some unique concerns: I was overly preoccupied with my relationship. I would obsess for days about whether I loved my boyfriend, whether I was attracted to him and whether or not I should break up with him. I essentially fit that 'Relationship-OCD' pattern to a tee.

Having read about all the studies indicating that for 'mild' depression/anxiety SSRIs are no better than a placebo, and reading a lot of horror stories online, I decided that CBT and meditation would be how I would beat this thing. 

I saw two therapist for about 8 months. They were nice, but beyond the typical CBT technique I don't think I gained much insight from the process. I was able to recognise bad thought patterns, 'let them happen' but for some reason that didn't help ease the anxiety nor make the anxiety more tolerable. Meditation was also nice, in those moments of meditative trance I was calm, but as soon as meditation ended so did the calm.

This went on for two years, and to great detriment to my relationship and my personal view of life. It hit a critical point where I had to do something drastic, so I went to my doctor  and was prescribed 20mg Citalopram (Celexa).

The first three weeks on it were pretty shit: tired all the time, feeling drugged out and not really feeling much of a benefit.  However, the side effects went away. It was really only after I was on it for 2 months or so that I started to notice a benefit.. very gradually though.

Because the change was so gradual, I actually had to stop and take notice before I realised how much of a benefit it has been. I no longer needlessly worry about my relationship, I no longer lie awake obsessing about death, I no longer feel ridiculously worried about every little thing. It has completely transformed me! I can honestly say this is the best I've felt in over 2 years, and I owe it all to these drugs! 

Honestly, the ongoing side-effects have been pretty minimal. It will effect your sex life, but I imagine not in the drastic way that most people on Reddit suggest. Really all it has meant for me is that I need a little longer (say 5 minutes longer) of 'warm up' before anything. 

So here is my advice: if therapy isn't working or you have a family history of the illness (which I did) give medication a shot! 

Hopefully this story will help someone.

Theanine is a supplement which crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been shown to lower anxiety levels. It puts the brain in a relaxed state and can help take the edge off if you are ever in a bad place.

It's extremely safe, you can take it without worrying about hurting yourself (for those of you who have anxiety about taking medications and so on)

I know some of that is low blood pressure related. Typing this is exhausting me, I start working full time in two weeks and can't be like this at work.

Has anyone else experienced this, did it go away after a while? I don't want to stop taking clonidine because it is helping my general anxiety level. ",['attr'],0

I work for a landscaping company and yesterday we were mowing lawns. After finished a bigger one, me and another guy started cleaning out the grass from underneath the lawnmowers. When we were finished, I went to pick up all the grass and immediately felt a jab on my finger. I don't know what it was, and at the time I sort of just brushed it off, but now I'm concerned that it was a contaminated needle. I have no real reason to believe this, other than the fact that I have a small dot on my finger that appears to be a puncture wound, and looks like it could be from a needle. I keep trying to tell myself that it could have been all kinds of things. There were big pine trees around me, so it could have been a pine needle. It was next to a main road that was recently oiled and chipped, so it could have been a sharp edge on a chip. It could have been a splinter of wood, or even a sharp blade of grass. No matter how much I tell myself this, the word that keeps repeating in my head is ""NEEDLE."" I don't know what to do. I could go to the hospital for the post-exposure treatment, but they and my family would think I'm crazy (maybe I am), and the medication is supposed to have extremely unpleasant side effects (to the point where some people actually stop taking them). Can anyone offer some advice?",['nsubjpass'],0

It literally made me feel worse - IN THE SHORT TERM. I learned that this was a side effect of my body adjusting to this new drug. That's why doctors commonly prescribe benzos like Xanax for the first 2-3 weeks, so you can transition smoothly onto Lexapro. As my doctor explained, the key to SSRIs like Lexapro is that it takes 4-6 weeks for you to feel their real effects. When you feel depressed or anxious 4-6 seems like an eternity. Thoughts tend cross your mind like, ""What if this doesn't work and I'm wasting my time?"" but, in order to benefit from the drug, I learned you MUST wait out the short-term negative side effects. I also learned that it's important to remind yourself each day: I'm getting better each day, even though I might not feel like it right away. Your mental attitude is as important as the drug(s). Make it your goal to be strong for 1 month, until the drugs can take effect. Start with: I'm going to be strong and persistent for this hour. Apply the same attitude to the following hour. By doing this, you'll keep yourself busy with staying strong, and a day will pass. Apply this to the week. Weeks will accumulate and eventually, a month will have passed and should start feeling the effects of Lexapro. Between weeks 4 and 6 you should start to notice some improvement. In my case, I noticed a vast improvement by week 3. I've been on it for 6 weeks and in social situations, I feel much more calm and confident, while still having some moments of anxiety. But, I've learned that those moments are learning opportunities, where applying a new approach, like being more assertive or being more mindful or both, arguably help more than the drug(s). As for generalized anxiety, it is almost completely gone. No more unnecessary worrying. In general I feel natural, calm, optimistic, without feeling intoxicated. Stick with it and keep reminding yourself, despite nagging doubts: through strength, persistence, and the medication, I'm getting better every day. ",['npadvmod'],0

I have a long history of anxiety in my life. I'm a 24 year old male, and for a good decade from the age of 10 to 20 I had major anxiety and some depression issues. My main issue and symptom was panic attacks. Horrible panic attacks that flood my mind with extremely negative thoughts, trying to persuade me I'm never going to be okay, or I'm going to end up in a psych ward, or worse.

To be clear, I'm not suicidal. I'm miserable, that's for sure, but I am not suicidal. I've had racing thoughts of ""what if's"" and things but I've never been close to considering it.

I was free of anxiety and panic attacks for the most part for the past 4 years or so. Sure I had stress, and there were times when I felt panic symptoms, but overall I've been okay. I've dealt with some major changes like moving out of my childhood home, my parents divorcing, things like that. I did them for the most part without any big consequences stress or mental health wise, which I guess is really good.

This all changed though on the 30th of April. I work a late midnight to 6 am shift at my job, which I have for years and years, but as I was sitting at my desk just on the PC, I felt a weird flutter or odd palpitation in my heart, which caused me to become light-headed for a moment. It scared me, as I was unsure what it was, but I felt okay right after it, it only lasted literally a second. 

About 15 minutes pass and I kept thinking about it, worrying about it, making my my heart race faster and faster, and I think I reached a point where it was too much. I started to feel faint, so I left my office and went to where someone else was working at the time and told them I was feeling really bad and felt like I was going to pass out. I sat down in an office chair nearby and passed out right after. I was out for about 20 seconds.

I went to the ER in an ambulance, they did a ton of tests, and in the 2 weeks following I consulted a cardiologist, had everything done from wearing a heart monitor, having an echocardiogram on my heart, multiple blood tests for sugars and things like my thyroid, multiple ECG/EKGs, chest x-ray, etc. The whole shebang. 

Everything came back normal, my heart is healthy and fine, which is a relief and is great, and my whole experience was chopped up to a normal random heart flutter and a panic attack of sorts making me faint.

But now here's the problem. Ever since then I've felt off. The past few weeks have been extremely stressful for me. Having to go through tests, fear of the unknown and the results, the waiting game, and my fears, doubts, and anxiety just piling on top of each other. 

Even now that I am ""in the clear"" with the cardiologist, my anxiety from the past seems to have rear its ugly head again. I feel like perhaps I was traumatized by this whole event and it sent me back down the spiral.

I have the problem where I think way too much about how I feel, and when I feel ""off"" at all, I start to panic because I don't feel well, and when I don't feel well I start to panic, so it becomes this spiral of anxiety.

I didn't sleep well the past few weeks because of it, and so I started back on Setraline on Monday as prescribed by my doctor. I used to be on Zoloft back in the day, which from what I understand is Zoloft, so I don't think there is any difference.

The problem is, ever since starting it, and maybe a little before because of anxiety, but definitely since starting it, I have close to no appetite, I have diarrhea, and most of all, I cannot sleep.

On Monday and Tuesday of this week I felt absolutely horrible from my lack of sleep which sent me into panic mode, especially yesterday, where I ended up having a full-blown panic attack over not being able to sleep and how I felt. I took some Xanax and an Ambien, and I was thankfully able to sleep for a few hours.

Last night I was able to sleep maybe one or two hours, but that's it. I researched and saw that insomnia a side effect of this but it's driving me crazy, and all the while feeling weaker than usual because of lack of sleep, and definitely because lack of appetite. It's hard to force yourself to eat when you have no desire.

I'm just scared and I hate feeling this way. I want to go back to how I was feeling 3 weeks ago, back when I was at least moderately normal. I hate taking pills because I worry about side effects, and that they change who I am or becoming reliant on them.

I've contacted my doctor and I hope to hear back today, but in the meantime, if there is anyone who has gone through anything similar at all, how do I deal with it? I want any advice or comforting words.

How do I get my appetite back? How do I sleep? 

I just need to be normal again.


I know speaking with my doctor is one of the main things I can do, and no one here really knows me or my medication or history, so no one can provide professional or solid advice, but I'm just looking for anything.

About 2 months ago I caught walking pneumonia and later a bad head cold. At the time I had many presentations to do at work and was feeling a little dizzy some days. Along with the underlying stress and worries of living in a foreign country (although I have been here for 3 years already). However, the more I worried about getting back to work and improving my health the worst I felt. 

I then mistakenly took my symptoms (numbness in face and dizziness) for sinusitis and was put on antibiotics for a few weeks. My health wasn't improving, so I was getting more and more stressed at the days went by. My right eye started twitching some days.

Finally, I got a CT scan, a MRI, and a blood test, which all came back with no abnormalities. Then one week ago I was driving home when a lady rear-ended my car when I was stuck in traffic. My car was written off and I was taken to the hospital to get checked out. 

A couple of days after that I had another attack after I couldn't sleep and ended up having to be taken home from work because my vertigo was so bad. It has calmed down a bit now, but I still frequently get dizzy and experience numbness in my face.

My question is what should I do now. I live in Japan and I'm not sure if the doctors will give me anything medication for anxiety or just tell me to wait it out.

I obsess over what if I have cancer. What if I have a brain tumor? What if I have rabies???? (I volunteered at a wildlife clinic for 2 years, I wonder what if I got rabies airborne, or from that cat scratch - even though it is still alive and it happened months ago and if it was rabies it would be dead by now and it only passes from an animal that is exhibiting the symptoms and it usually only happens from a bite not a scratch unless they licked their paw right before they did it &lt;-- these are the crazy shit thoughts that go through my head...).

I have tried therapy, vitamins, eating healthy, and medicine. I started on zoloft after I was having panic attacks daily, often multiple times. My blood pressure was super high when I went to the doctor during an attack. She put me on zoloft. Zoloft worked amazing for me for a few weeks. A week after starting, different parts of me started to twitch every now and then. It didn't bother me at first, because the Zoloft was working so well. Then after a few weeks things started bothering me again. My doctor upped my dose. Weeks later I was still having body twitches that started my worries again about disease. I went to the doctor, she put me on something else that just didn't work. So I am on nothing now. Nothing at all. I just want to scream. I am back to drinking every night because it is the only thing that calms me down. I sit at work and think about getting home and having a drink to fix my obsessive thoughts.

This post is to make a collection of a multitude of methods that work for the individuals who post with their Anxiety in hopes of providing a hand to those who may need it. 

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy**

From my knowledge this fairly new to field of Western Psychology.  Its main focus is Mindfulness.  Becoming aware of yourself,  feelings and thoughts.

&gt;*Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) focuses in particular on the ways clients understand and perpetuate their difficulties through language. Providing a comprehensive overview of the approach and detailed guidelines for practice, this book shows how interventions based on metaphor, paradox, and experiential exercises can enable clients to break free of language traps, overcome behavioral problems, and enhance general life satisfaction*
[Source](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1999-04037-000)

&gt;*The core conception of ACT is that psychological suffering is usually caused by experiential avoidance, cognitive entanglement, and resulting psychological rigidity that leads to a failure to take needed behavioral steps in accord with core values. As a simple way to summarize the model, ACT views the core of many problems to be due to the concepts represented in the acronym*, **FEAR**:

**F**usion with your thoughts

**E**valuation of experience

**A**voidance of your experience

**R**eason-giving for your behavior

And the healthy alternative is to **ACT**:

**A**ccept your reactions and be present

**C**hoose a valued direction

**T**ake action
[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy)

**Mindfulness and ACT**

&gt;Being present means being in direct contact with the present moment, rather than drifting off into automatic pilot, and getting in touch with the observing self, the part that is aware of, but separate from, the thinking self. Mindfulness techniques are taught to experience the observing self firsthand, whether they bring awareness to each of the five senses, thoughts, or emotions. 
 
Opening up is the ability to detach from thoughts (defusion) and accepting, or making space for and dropping the struggle with painful feelings, urges, sensations, etc. Acceptance is the ability to allow what is to be as it is instead of fighting or avoiding it. If someone is thinking, “I’m a terrible person,” they might be instructed to say, “I am having the thought that I’m a terrible person.” This effectively separates the person from the cognition, thereby stripping it of its negative charge. When someone is experiencing painful emotions, like anxiety for example, they might be instructed to open up, breath into, or make space for the physical experience of anxiety and allow it to remain there, just as it is, without exacerbating or minimizing it.

This is the book I'm using right now:

[ACT Made Simple by Russ Harris](http://www.amazon.com/ACT-Made-Simple-Easy-To-Read-Acceptance/dp/1572247053/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382941250&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ACT+made+simple)

**OK** Stop for a min

Take a deep breath. In through your nose. Notice how your breath passes through your nose....how it cools the back of your throat as it fills up your lungs....Don't think anything of it, if you are, that's ok. Just gently bring your attention back to your breath. How your body expands from the inside out...Now, notice how your clothes feel against your skin...how your shirt feels on your shoulder...take another slow...deep breath and close your eyes and breath a couple more before coming back to this...

**I know you just read those words. Now go back and take a couple mins to really try it. :)**


That's mindfulness. It takes practice, but It really has helped me get enough breaks in the storm to start moving forward against the wind.

 I know that was a lot of info. Scan it as you can, maybe come back a couple times. 

**Meditation**

This is the single best thing I do for myself. (Again, ill update later). Simple start. Mindfulness is kind of like Training wheels for Meditation for me. It sometimes seems like my mind doesn't want to meditate because it's terrified of being still, but once I just **Start** the resistance fades and it's wonderful, then it comes back, then it's wonderful. 

 [Good Article on Swiss Study](http://sciencenordic.com/mindfulness-helps-against-anxiety-and-depression) 

I've noticed a slot of the science I find behind Meditation has been labeled *Mindfulness*. Not sure why, but there are a lot of similarities. Think of Meditation as a Good nights sleep. You dream, your body re cooperates and your mind rests to get you ready for the next day. As you go through your day, if you start to feel tired you might need a power nap to bring yourself back up. That could be Mindfulness. Meditation practice prepares you for the day, and throughout it if Anxiety starts to tap you on the shoulder, you use a mindfulness exercise to quit your mind again and get back to what you were doing. 

[THIS is a GREAT post from another user about getting started and it's benefits for them](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1msb30/how_i_learned_to_harness_meditation_as_a_tool_to/)

I start is when I lay down to go to sleep and just follow the speaker until I fall asleep. It's going to sound *cheesy*, become aware that's resistance from your brain and just keep going. :)

**Subreddits** 

/r/meditation  

/r/ZenHabits 


**Exercise**

Go walk for 20min. Make a playlist,  get a podcast and just go. Your anxiety will be there whether you are walking or doing nothing. The biology behind it is great. 


**Goals**

Setting goals and accomplishing them is a great thing. It doesn't have to be anything BIG at all. This is for you and no one else. Pick any 1 thing you feel your anxiety has prevented from doing that you *want* to. Start small, and do something, Maybe it's visiting a new subreddit, trying one of things above, or even just responding this this post! You can do it! And even if you don't, Thats ok too. 

**Cut yourself some slack**

I'm harder on myself than I've realized. I beat myself for the littlest things. I'm not good enough, I'm stupid, I'm lazy..why would anyone want to talk to me etc etc. Sound familiar to anyone? What would you say if a close friend that you love said that to you? What would you tell them? And say that to yourself, be your own best friend. You deserve it.

If I can pass as a reasonably normal person I feel proud. I have been working hard on changing myself into someone more confident and sociable than I am by default, although I accept that I'll never be major social or outgoing.

I thought I was doing a lot better. I have done things people wouldn't have thought I could. I moved abroad, I work talking to groups of strangers for hours, I am learning a difficult new language, I have been in a relationship for six years. I do have anxiety, and I do take Citalopram daily for it, but that's my personal life and I wanted to keep it separate. I always thought that it's ok if people see that I am introverted and not really a group person, as long as they didn't know mental health stuff.

But people notice. My boyfriend's family get ""concerned"" about me, and now it turns out my colleagues have been ""concerned"" about me too. It's all in my body language, some of my personality quirks, and my failed attempts at passing off medication side effects as just being ill. I had to explain my anxiety basically to stop these people wondering if something worse is wrong with me, but now I feel so ashamed of myself. I thought I was doing better, but people keep seeing this in me. I don't want this to be my identity, I don't want to have to keep giving out personal information in order to stop people think that I have something worse going on in my head, or that I'm potentially on drugs in my boyfriend's family's case (my boyfriend's uncle is an addict who displayed a few similar traits like being tired all the time, being very quiet and distant sometimes, etc). I don't want my colegues to discuss me when I am not around to try and figure out what is wrong with me, or be extra nice to me because they think I am unstable. I don't want any of this, why do I keep betraying myself without realising?

Right now I feel like running away and starting fresh around a bunch of people who don't know me, and haven't seen me cry. Why do I have to be such an easy crier? It's pathetic but I tear up whenever I have to talk about this stuff. I won't run away, my boyfriend doesn't deserve that, but I just now feel uncomfortable around everyone in this country except for him. They all know, and I can't stand it, and I feel ashamed that I'm so stupidly anxious that people speculate after spending time with me. I don't get over this easily, I don't see how to feel comfortable around them again even though I am not angry nor do I blame anyone for being curious or worried. It's just that my anxiety hasn't even been particularly bad lately and yet I still give off this vibe. I just hate myself so much for this, and I don't know what to do.

So I've been seeing someone new for a little over a month now - she's really great and we have good chemistry, but as is always the case, I don't really know how to bring up or discuss my anxiety.  It has reared its head in a few ways - I told her about my father being post-op TG, which is a huge trigger for me (she's also just a shitty dad in general), as well as discussed how trying new food can make me extremely anxious.  When something happened in the bedroom that could have been a problem, my anxiety began to run wild and I kind of stared off into space and was rubbing my fingers together (a major symptom for me), and she looked down and asked if I was okay.  I explained that I had anxiety, and she kind of laughed it off and said ""calm down"" multiple times.  Generally, I prefer to be told ""it's okay"" because calm down is a directive which tends to make anxiety worse for me, so I told her this later, and it seemed to cause her to simply not really understand how my anxiety works.  After leaving I felt the usual embarrassment, and have been unable to stop thinking about it and overanalyzing her behavior - when I told her I would like to sleep next to her at some point she said ""yeah, okay"", which felt dismissive, and I spent about two hours after I got home wondering what that meant.  I really am trying to make things work, and I took a medication vacation to avoid the sexual side effects of Lexapro as we were beginning our relationship.  I've had very ugly relationships before in which my anxiety wasn't understood, and I don't really know what I expect from this post - it's more nice to just have a sounding board because I'm sure my friends and family get so sick of hearing about my anxiety.  Any tips on how you all have handled anxiety in a new relationship are welcome.

TL;DR:  My anxiety causes a lot of issues in my life that can be difficult to understand - and I'm extremely worried (go figure) that I'm not handling it correctly in a new relationship.",['compound'],0

However, I carry a lot of stress/anxiety in my shoulders, neck, and jaw, and I have noticed that I've been clenching my jaw a lot all hours of the day - worse at night, and it's causing quite a bit of pain and discomfort. I'm not enthused about going off the Wellbutrin because it has helped me and I have not had good experiences with SSRIs. I do not feel the Wellbutrin has made my anxiety itself worse and the level I have now is manageable, but I know it does for some people.

I found some info online about two meds that have shown promise for treating bruxisum - clonazepam and buspiron. Clonazepam is out of the question for me as I'm hoping to get pregnant in the next year, but buspiron is category B so I would feel...not as bad about taking that (after I had talked it over with my doctor and everything of course). Just curious if anyone has had luck treating bruxism with buspirone. I already exercise 5-6 days a week, do yoga and attempt to do relaxation exercises regularly, and I'm going to start getting massages every couple of weeks but can't really afford more than that. 
ETA: I do wear a night guard for sleeping that I got custom-made by my dentist. I've been clenching my jaw at night for years but it seems to be all the time now (notice it even during the day). The night guard fortunately prevents grinding but not clenching. My dentist has also told me my bruxism is anxiety-related (not caused by bite or alignment problems).",['appos'],0

20F, used to be really depressed as a kid but definitely got better. Been in a really healthy place, workout 5x per week and eat a healthy diet. Low caffeine intake, no medications. 

Never had horrible anxiety but used to check the locks in my house frequently growing up before going to bed ( 2x per night, never considered it to be OCD or anything though) 

Smoked a little pot over the last two years, smoked a bowl, went to bed. A noise woke me up in the middle of the night (boyfriend closed the bedroom door) and I went into full on freak mode. My heart started pounding, thought I was going crazy, gonna have a heart attack or something, shaking, general freaking out. Now every time I'm around weed I have to try to fight to control my anxiety and have actually stopped smoking all together which sucks big time. 

Second issue - I feel the need to check things constantly. Examples: I put my wallet in my bag, walk 10 feet, must stop and check to see if I put my wallet in my bag/that it hasn't fallen out/that I haven't left it anywhere. A few nights ago I left my wallet in the car and woke up in the middle of the night in a panic wondering where I put it. Walked out to my car at 3:00AM in the snow because I HAD to know that it was still in there because I could not sleep. 
Same goes for triple checking my phone/keys/rings ect are still in my pockets/on my hands. 

This is really, really, REALLY annoying and I want to stop panicking every time I start wondering where I've put my wallet/keys ect. 

What can I do? I don't really feel like seeing a therapist because quite frankly I'm in university and work a lot and I don't really have the time or the finances to cover it. 

EDIT: Also get some crazy tingling in different sides of my head fairly frequently, especially in my forehead. I've heard this is a symptom of anxiety. Is this true?

tldr: Panic attack after smoking pot,  consistent anxiety over checking to make sure where I put my wallet/keys/ cell phone/rings etc. even though I KNOW where they are. What gives?

Antidepressants help OCD and GAD.  They don't touch the rest.

Klonopin helps panic attacks some, taking 3mg/day.  Klonopin is a seizure medication.  I know it works on the panic because I've taken it alone.

I need to ask the doctor about different directions and diagnoses.

Paxil, Lexapro, Zoloft, Effexor, Anafranil, have all been tried and failed on the panic and agoraphobia.

Xanax failed on the panic.  Klonopin helped the panic some.

My anxiety always used to give me butterflies, make me wanna cry or something like that every 1-3 months. Which wasn't much of a problem.

After That I got the Irritable bowel syndrome and i started getting nervous, going to the bathroom more often, feeling gassy... which it became worse for some time, untill i got used to it.

But now my anxiety feels out of control. It all started one night. I was going to sleep with my ""relaxing"" routine (a relaxing infusion, hot bath and music), and suddenly i had a panic attack (I used to get those every month or so). 

I don't know why, i imagined the towel as a snake (since the shape was similar) and I thought that was a schizophrenic vision. I started getting paranoic, daily pannic and anxiety attacks, palpitations, tension, lack of air, my memory started failing, couldn't concentrate in class... I ended up going to the neurologist. But he said everything is alright, and he even told me to take a medication called sertraline. (Which i haven't tried yet since i'm really scared of side effects and complications it could have)

I calmed down some days later and started getting better, but now i'm feeling down again.

I haven't had any panic attack since then, but lately i've started feeling tense, my back hurts all day, i have palpitations after eating, i feel gassy, i feel like i have something on my throat, difficulty breathing, pressure and stings inside all my chest that hurt when i pressure back, laugh/talk for too long or breath too deep, phisically weaker (my arm gets tired when playing the guitar for example) and my mood is pretty horrible overall since I feel ""wrong"".

Does someone have any idea what could this be? I'm always asking myself why my anxiety has a new symptom everyday... but i also think that maybe someday i will think this is anxiety and maybe it won't really be.

Should i go back to the doctor? Give up and give the medication a try? Any opinion about it?

But this time I wanted to share a positive update about some amazing progress I've been making. I also want to send out a mass ""thank you"" to everyone who has been helping me and giving me advice. I wouldn't have made it this far without the amazing people of this subreddit. 

So I've been struggling with some inconsistent anxiety and depression for about two years now. At the beginning of this year, my mental health took a serious turn for the worse. By the end of February I began having panic attacks anywhere from once a week to once a day. I would have panic attacks just from seeing or talking to someone, I would have panic attacks while driving, while trying to fall asleep, etc. It was absolute hell. Because of this, I became so depressed that I slept for most of the day and stopped leaving my house. My relationship was put under a lot of stress because I was no longer driving to see my boyfriend and relied on him coming to my house. I don't think I was developing agoraphobia, but that's what my friends and family started calling it. I was also barely eating, so I began to feel physically weak and ill.  

Basically I was at rock bottom. I didn't even really want to live anymore. I was terrified that my relationship was going to end. I finally told the people closest to me that I needed to something about it, so I made an appointment with my doctor. 

I didn't even think I could make it through the appointment. I was holding back tears as I was walking up the steps to my doctor's office. I was so panicked while writing my name to check in that my handwriting was barely legible and I thought I was going to pass out. Sitting in the waiting room was pure hell, I kept telling my boyfriend ""I can't do this, I can't do this"". I was still extremely nervous in the exam room, especially because I had to start talking about all of this. The nurse who checked my pulse made several comments about how fast my heart rate was - which is actually kind of funny in retrospect. Anyways, fast forward to after the appointment, and I now had a prescription for Lexapro. 

Getting the medication was just the first step, though. Once I had the pill bottle in my hand I was still terrified to take it. I was terrified of all the possible side effects. If you get prescribed an antidepressant my one piece of advice would be to ONLY ASK YOUR DOCTOR about the side effects. Do not look that shit up on the internet because you will only convince yourself that horrible things will happen if you take it. It took me hours to summon up the courage to finally take my first pill, and even at that, I only took half a dose. Every night after that it became less and less scary taking the pill, because I knew it was there to help me, not to hurt me. As for side effects, I don't think I've experienced very many. My stomach felt kind of ""tight"" for a few days, but that also could have just been my nerves, and I also have felt a little more tired lately. But hey, I'm willing to deal with some tiredness because at least I've become more comfortable leaving my house. 

After not leaving my house for weeks, I finally started going on little errands to places like the post office, the bank, the gas station, etc. Sometimes I would feel anxious during these trips, but it also felt so good to get out of the house. I was also strategically going to these places when I knew other people wouldn't be around, which I wouldn't necessarily recommend, but it helped me to just get out of the house and that's all that matters. Finally, last week I began my unofficial spring break and drove to my boyfriend's house. I was anxious while driving there, and I felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack once I got there, but I think that was only because I hadn't been there in so long and I had built up so much anticipation about it. Little did I know this was just the beginning of one of the best week's I've had in years. I felt so relaxed, comfortable and I was finally able to actually have fun. Normally I'm quite nervous around my boyfriend's roommate, but I was able to interact with the two of them with ease. We even went out several times to coffee shops, stores, and other friend's houses. Not all of this was easy, sometimes I would still feel anxious and slightly panicked, but my emotions never got out of control like they have been for so long. If I panicked I panicked, but then it was over and I didn't dwell on it anymore. 

In addition to the medication, I've been reading this book called, ""Hope and Help for your Nerves"" by Claire Weekes - which was actually recommended to me by someone here on reddit! I'm not sure if they would want to be publicly credited, but I want to give them the biggest thank you! I was a little skeptical because they had said that this book was like a cure. I really didn't believe it, but holy fucking shit it has helped me immensely. Over the last two years I have tried therapy, yoga, exercise, and finally medication, but this $4 book I bought used on Amazon has been the most helpful by far. I would love to summarize it for you guys but I just wouldn't be able to do it any justice. Basically, the author is a doctor who has treated many patients with chronic anxiety and depression. She seemed to ""connect the dots"" with all of their symptoms and experiences to figure out what anxious people really need. She explains what anxiety is, why we experience it, and she gives us many ways in which we can solve it. She's also so confident and hopeful, I feel like every other sentence she says, ""you CAN be cured, and you WILL be cured"" which I think is extremely important for people like us to hear. After reading the book and applying some of her suggestions, I can honestly say that the one that has helped me most is the ""float and accept"" technique. Again, I'm only giving you a glimpse of the things she talks about, but she advises the anxious person to just ""float"" through their panic attacks or stressful situations. This book made me realize that we anxious people have basically trained our bodies to react to things in certain ways. We've conditioned ourselves to the point of not being able to control our panic attacks, which is why we are all so frustrated and depressed because of it. But this author helps you realize that once you understand what is going on in your mind and body, 1. it becomes less scary and 2. you can begin ""training"" yourself to react differently. Just like any kind of training, you're not going to become an expert overnight. You have to give yourself time, and the author talks about that too. I seriously recommend this book to anyone dealing with anxiety, depression or panic attacks. She doesn't delve into depression as much as anxiety and panic, but I feel like her approach to feeling better can be applied to lots of different conditions. Another part of the book that was an immense help was that she describes all of the weird symptoms of anxiety that made me feel like I was literally going insane...but she helps you to not feel insane because she explains how every patient with anxiety exhibited these symptoms. I'm talking about things like obsessive thoughts...like not being able to stop thinking about someone even though you hate them and then questioning your sanity because you shouldn't be thinking so much about someone if you dislike them...yeah, she explains that, and then I felt totally normal and was able to stop my obsessive thoughts - or at least not let them bother me anymore, which is one way to stop having them entirely. 

I know this is getting long, but last and not least - I want to say that in order to get better you have to WANT to get better. The depression I was experiencing as a result of my anxiety was making me completely apathetic. I didn't care about my health or anything, so therefore I didn't care about facing my anxiety or treating it. I think what finally scared me into recovery was that I was afraid of losing my relationship. There was way too much at stake for me to not be taking care of myself, which is why I finally broke down and saw my doctor. Like I said, I had my boyfriend go with me, cause I don't think I could have done it alone. So don't be afraid to ask for help, ESPECIALLY when you are first trying to get better. The people who love you and care about you will be willing to do all of the weird or silly things that help you overcome your anxiety. Also, I don't mean for this post to be all pro-medication - I totally understand if that's not the route you want to take. But if you are where I was, at rock bottom, and you WANT to get better, the first step is telling the people around you. They will help you review your options, or get on the internet and forums like this are full of people who have ideas. There's therapy, books, medication, meditation, exercise...tons of ways to at least start treating your anxiety and eventually curing it. Also, I'm certainly not ""fixed"" after all of this. I had a mild panic attack just last night, but I'm not letting it get to me because I know overall, I'm beginning to get better. Take it one step at a time, allow yourself to have setbacks and ""let time pass"" as Claire Weekes says. If I can start feeling better I KNOW that all of you can too. But it takes work, it takes effort and it takes patience. Be gentle with yourselves, and I wish you all the best in overcoming your fears and mental illnesses. My little tiny bit of progress has given me so much hope for all of you anxious sufferers out there. Don't give up! ",['conj'],0

I know it's a weird time to post, maybe no one will see this but I'm doing it now. I'm at work alone. I don't even know if I'm in the right subreddit but there are so many and I don't know where I should be. Definitely have some form(s) of anxiety among other things I think. Alcohol. Depression? Communication. Trust. Loneliness. And so on. I don't know.


I'm 30 years old. Male. No meds. No diagnoses. Fiancee of 1 year, together for ~7. I have a degree in Psychology(for what it's worth), and honestly I can trace most of my issues to their origins, I'm a *very* introspective person, I just can't seem to deal with them.


This is all very strange and new territory for me. Recent events have forced me to seriously look into getting help. I wish I could get into all the juicy details with you guys but it would take days, I assure you(edit: turns out I sort of did.. almost). Like I said in the title, I wouldn't really know where to start. I mean even now I'm at a loss for words. I guess basically there are trust issues, she's cheated in the past but I couldn't leave because I love her more than anything and I'm still so happy when we're together. Great my eyes are already watering up. I've never talked about this with anyone. She knows she's been horrible in the past. Things are certainly better in terms of trust now than they have been but the damage was done. I started drinking. Hiding it and lying about it when she could obviously tell. It just got worse and worse. I would tell myself it's because of that but really I just feel happy when I drink. I don't drink everyday. I can go a few days without it usually, at best. When we're together I don't feel the need to. She started using drugs occasionally. I honestly don't even mind that much but she lies about it, too. She told me once but I know she still does it. I love spending time with her more than anything. We have so much fun. She feels the same. But the whole relationship is one very fucking long story I can't drop on you guys right now. I sometimes read her texts and I hate myself for it. Such a complicated story, sorry.


The ""recent event"" though, fuck. I'm an idiot. I drove her away. 2 weeks ago she came home from work to find me drunk, passed out early evening. We both do shift work, which only makes things harder. I lied and said I went out with friends(don't remember any of this). She knew I was lying. Said if it happened again she would go to her parents for a while. I got drunk again on Saturday night. Told her it was ""reddit meet up day""(it was..) and people came over and we went downtown. All lies. I got drunk at home alone as usual. I guess I wanted her to think I had friends. I feel like a loser even though I know people like me. God, I feel like I sound so pathetic. Again, she knew I was lying and I admitted it the next day. We both cried a lot and then she left for home where she is now, though she's coming back tomorrow. I'm terrified to talk to her about it. Promised I would start seeking help, which is a process I've begun through work and researching options in my city.


I worry about money. I owe my parents thousands and I spend too much on booze and I'm just generally bad with money. No savings. My job pays alright, not great, but I should not be in this situation. I've stopped exercising. I'd rather stay in bed all day or game. GTA or Skyrim or games that take me somewhere else. I eat like shit, probably because I'm often drunk or hungover. Even when sober my heart is often pounding. I dwell and worry about everything. EVERYTHING. Imaginary situations in my head cause me to break out in a sweat. I know these are textbook signs of anxiety, panic. The problem is that my mind can be so active, and I constantly over-analyze and try to reason that I just break down everything that may help me. I don't even know if that makes sense. Trying to type this all out has my head in a complete mess, more than usual. Anyway.


My job is stressful. I'm a paramedic and I lack confidence even though my co-workers seem to love working with me, and I've never done anything wrong really. I just worry about the day that it happens, because it will, happens to everyone. I know I'm a good medic. People have told me that and people will switch shifts to work with me, etc. It doesn't seem to matter. Just a short term confidence booster. The type of job makes it hard to make good friends, too. I don't hang out with anyone from work, even though I might like it. Plus side: this type of job has very good confidential assistance options, which I've never used. Again, wouldn't even know what to say first. Probably my best option at this point though.


**Alright**. I'm done writing. I'll come back to this later. I really hope that any of you feel like responding at all. I really need any options or advice or experience I can get. If you read this, I thank you so much. I have never done this before and I've never shared these things with anyone. Thank you.


A **TL;DR** is probably impossible. I'm scatterbrained right now. I'm sorry.",['ROOT'],0

She has felt so bad lately that, she has had to take a leave of absence from work. Her doctor has bumped her daily dose of Lexapro up from 10mg to 15mg,(started that yesterday) she is also taking .5mg of clonazepam twice daily. Small doses I know, but she is a very small girl roughly around 90 lbs. 

Her anxiety is a strange one and the fact that it is strange and unusual also seems to cause her more anxiety. The biggest trigger is that almost every time she eats or drinks something, she believes she has swallowed a pill. Not only that, but she can actually feel something hard and round go down her throat(pill) each time. I try my best to assure her that she hasn't swallowed a pill, and to try to have her think logically about it. She also has problems with things touching the floor or her pants feeling contaminated. A lot of chemical centered things, like being anxious about the bath water if I don't use a certain bathtub cleaner. She also suffers from nausea, weakness, dizziness etc. The pill thing is the biggest issue, and is the newest problem. She has had some form of OCD/anxiety/depression most of her teen/adult life. She is 23, but the pill thing has only been around for a few years. She has had a very unsupportive family, and previous Bf's which I know didn't help matters.

The depression she is going through, I believe is due to the fact she thinks there is no hope, and she is going to have to be like this the rest of her life. She had been through quite a list of different medicines combinations, and feels like their is nothing left to try. She feels her therapist doesn't understand, and she doesn't trust her advice all that much. I would like to have her see a CBT/DBT trained specialist, but that isn't something that is available to us in our area.  I try to assure her that there is no easy fix and that we have to just keep trying, and not to give up.  

I really love this girl, and want to start a family with her someday. I know that isn't something realistic at this point in time. I try to be patient and supporting as much as I can. I do my best to let her know I have her back 24/7, and try to be there for her at all times. I do feel helpless at times, and that is the worst fucking part. But I try to be strong in front of her, and hopeful.

I've been lurking here for years, and it's been a while since I wanted to write this post, but I have held back for fear of insulting others in this sub who have anxiety issues far worse than me - so I hope I don't come across in this way. I have been telling myself (lying?) that it makes me feel 'stupid' and at times, guilty and I'm not sure why. I feel as though I am telling myself 'Because I am 28 y/o man', surely I should be over this shit that has plagued me since childhood.... I've even been married for 2 years with a very steady income, virtually no real world worries at all yet I still suffer with this. I should say I'm also physically healthy, and have no drug / drinking problems, or any other mental problems such as depression or suicidal thoughts etc. In fact, I have never been as stable at any point in my life thus far, and its annoying that I can't relax and enjoy my life. 

So, ever since I was a kid, I have suffered with my nerves, which lead to numerous doctors saying I had mild anxiety disorders and I have heard different doctors diagnose different types, (sometimes recommended medication, to which I have refused several times in my life as I worried I would become dependant on them). It only crops up really during times of stress, or when something terrible happens eg a death in the family, major bad news, etc. For the longest time I thought it was normal. I admit I was very uneducated in the areas of mental illness, as I assume most are, and felt ashamed of myself for admitting that I had a problem. Fortunately, thus far, these events have been far enough spread out that I have gradually gotten my self back to 'normal' after a period of time going about with my daily life and what not. It's only recently that, for some reason, my anxiety issues have seemed to start occurring more frequently and seemingly at random. (which, surprise surprise, is making me anxious).

I'm not sure if it is 'normal' amongst us folks that have this problem, but I seem to have what I have been calling 'the cycle' 'the buildup' versions... and for good reason. I will try to explain. It's as though I have two types of 'scenarios'. 

The buildup version is when I start off on a typical day going about my normal routines, generally feeling good and not stressed out at all - to suddenly randomly feeling thoughts of dread, fear over seemingly irrational things like the future, losing my wife, illness, even really bizarre thoughts like what happens when we die, etc.... of course, at the time they seem very real and immediate things to feel anxious about. This used to happen quite rarely, maybe once every 6 months or so - Most times it would pass, often leaving me with a low feeling, sadness, while other times they seem to escalate into what feels like a Cycle.... at which point I will start feeling nausea, and eventually start having really panicked thoughts about the things I am anxious about, before vomiting. I almost never manage to calm myself down and throw up for most of the night, before crashing from exhaustion. I then feel very anxious for a few days before it gradually goes away - only to start again randomly every couple of months.... like a cycle. 

When I was younger, I was whiteness the death of my grandfather at the hospital. It was sudden and dramatic, a heart attack - I was in 'shock' for 2 days and had to be sedated to get sleep by my doctors. I was quite young at the time (around 10-11 years old or so) and while I do remember very clearly what I saw, I don't think about it directly or even remember the brief counselling sessions I had as a child afterwards. I just remember being very upset about it and throwing up a lot. The reason I bring this up is because my mother, who is one of the only few people including my wife that know about my anxiety, thinks that my problems stem from this event. I am not so sure myself, but I suppose it could be...

I think the biggest fear I have is losing my wife, because of how much I love and depend on her, the thought of it is terrifying. The fact that I would be alone and she is gone, etc. So I am not really sure where I am going with this.... I suppose I am hoping that someone out there feels the same as me, or has gotten over it, or... something. I don't know. I don't want to spend a few nights a month throwing up over irrational fear for the rest of my life...

While dealing with the causes and symptoms of crippling anxiety and depression is very subjective, there are a few things that I have found which *really* helped me alongside prescribed medication (I am on Sertraline and Propranolol);

* Sleep - for me, regardless of medication, a lack of sleep is a major, major trigger.  I have never slept well and found for most of my life the only way to sleep was to read until exhaustion.  However I found a non-pharmaceutical remedy! I truly cannot say enough good things about the Andrew Johnson hypnotherapy apps on the iPhone - particularly the ['Dont Panic'](http://www.withandrewjohnson.com/recording/dont-panic/) and 'Relax'.  These have been a game changer for me.  They may not work for you, but they *might*. If panic and sleep is a problem what do you have to lose?

* Vitamins - whilst the jury might be out scientifically I can tell you that taking a good multivitamin and a good quality Omega3 supplement makes a *big* difference for me.

* alcohol &amp; smoking - well it is obvious, however for me it was the anxiety related to the potential health effects of smoking, and alcohol? Great in moderation (for me) but anything more lead to dreadful hangover episodes of depression and anxiety.  Easily remedied!

* medication - oh lordy - I  can only speak from experience with SSRI's but holymoly dont miss a dose or fiddle with dosages. Ever.    

I am sure these will have been raised before so my apologies if this is a re-post....Anyway, keep fighting the good fight. I know I wont be this well forever but hopefully I can look back and read this in the future and know there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and I hope any of the above simple things eases anxiety for any of you.

That was my worst point, and I've been getting steadily better since then. Time, therapy and meds have made me learn how to deal with the stress so it doesn't generally boil over into anxiety.

However



I am very nearly done with nursing school. Which is great but I'm also quite nervous. I don't feel like I've been taught *how* to be a nurse, and when I start thinking about that fact, I get anxiety chest. Depending on how much I think about it, my hands shake and I might sweat a little bit also... which then reinforces my fears that I'm not going to be able to do this job. Who wants to get an IV put in by someone with shaky hands?

I'm interning with a nurse right now, and she is super helpful and cool... but I constantly worry that she is going to turn to me at some point and say ""You know, you're really not cut out for this"". 

Logically, I know she won't do that. She's been super helpful about correcting my mistakes and doesn't scold me for not knowing how to perform a skill... but the worry is still there.

I also worry that once I'm done with school I'm going to get a job, and start in a new nurse program where it will quickly be decided that I'm not good enough to be a nurse. 

Once again, I doubt it would happen like that, but it really worries me. 

I worry that I'll never get my shaky hands/nervous sweat under control. And that all this time and money will be wasted. I worry that I'll hurt someone by mistake.

Things are better than a year ago, but I still have so much on my mind.

First of all, I want to say that I see many of you are unhappy with your therapeutic programs and your prescriptions. I completely understand, I tried 2 counselors, 1 psychiatrist, and countless medications (prescribed and illicit) to no avail. Finally, last year, I found an awesome CBT clinic for panic and anxiety disorders nearby, and it has COMPLETELY changed my life. I recommend you all do some research on local CBT clinics (they are, unfortunately, not incredibly easy to find).
So, the Behavioral part of CBT involves creating a hierarchy of ""Exposures"", which are situations characteristic of those that cause you severe anxiety, ranked in order from least-anxiety-provoking and least-likely-to-avoid to most-anxiety-provoking and most-likely-to-avoid. Your task is to start doing these exposures (often times as role-plays in the safety of your therapist's office) until you retrain your brain to realize that you aren't in danger (it's more complicated than that, but I'm sure you're already sick of reading). I am scheduled to give a presentation about myself tomorrow in class, which is my absolute highest-end exposure. A year ago I wouldn't even be thinking about doing this. Tonight I feel pretty capable, a manageable amount of nervousness, and a tiny bit of excitement to do it.
Really guys, I suggest looking into CBT. Even if there isn't a clinic nearby, there are tons of great workbooks that will walk you through the process. Sometimes people are 100% successful doing it themselves.
Thanks for reading, this subreddit has also provided a major space for me to feel comfortable and not so crazy. I truly appreciate that.
