Im in my first year of high school,and did not experience this until near the beginning of september.I wake up and feel nauseous,like having to throw up.I get shortness of breath and feel like I cant breathe.Ive tried to take deep breaths but this turned to be counter productive because it dried out my throat.There is constantly ""flem"" in my throat,presumably due to allergies as diagnosed by my doctor but allergy meds nevef worked,I simpy cope.This made me feel like I was choking on the flem bassically.Other symptoms include my fingertipz,feet,and teeth starting to go numb and burping.I have no conclusive link as to why it happened during the weekend,but I assume it is because I was in an area that reminded me of the school.I was in a store,and mainly it was the cold temlerature.",nsubj,1
