I was embebbed in other companies for a week or two at a time, I'd get a desk, get used to the people and move on. It was a bit like starting a new job over and over. When I wasn't doing that I was in out main office answering calls from sometimes nice, sometimes angry customers. The first few calls I answered were terrifying. During the time at the company, due to working there and two other major issues resulting in a perfect strom of stress I had my first and only two panic attack. but I eventualy learned I could deal with an agnry customer first thing in the morning and adlib in the phone enough to calm them and I was a pro.\\n\\nEventualy I decided to leave and got good enought that I could interview recruiters to find where the best empoyers were and what areas they were looking for to tailor my skills, I eventualy took a phone interview by accident and nailed it without knowing who I was talking to.

Around the same time at a buisness type thingy, made a point of talking to and getting to know evey group of people at the buisness/tech meetup thing and became the center of every group while I was there, except one.

I'm supposed to take 1 tablet every 12 hours (as needed). I'm against taking medication after what I had to deal with in the past but I realized this is my only option to get better.\\n\\nHowever, I feel like it's not really helping me. I'm going through a really tough time in my life right now and I've been crying almost everyday. I can't deal with this along with the shaking, grinding my teeth, repetitive thoughts, you name it. I'm getting so sick of being like this. Anyone who meets me can sense my anxiety. I'm a damn mess and I don't know how to fix myself.\\n\\nI always have that sense of impending doom. I hyperventilate a lot. When I get really bad I experience hypervigilance after. The nightmares come and go, but I always have trouble sleeping. \\n\\nI don't know where I'm going with this. I guess I'm progressively getting worse again and I don't know what to do. I have no friends. I have no job. I have nothing going for me after years of battling mental illness. I'm still broken and I don't know what to do next. I see my doctor next week and I don't know what to tell him about these meds. He tried going me SSRIs before the ativan, but I had REALLY bad side effects within the first week and had to stop.\\n\\nWhat the hell do I do now? Thank you for reading this. :(\",\n",

It's like part of me is afraid to let go of this anxiety - I've known it all my life and it's such a different way to think that somehow it felt unnatural and therefore wrong.  How do I break out of this?  I feel like this is one of the key pieces to really being able to let this go.

       " 'I was dxed just a few weeks ago, after about **7 yrs of anxiety** and panic attacks. I knew I hadn\\'t been an \"anxious\" person in my teens or early 20s — it was situational (sudden stress) that caused panic attacks, and the anxiety just never went away.\\n\\nBut it *seems* that all my symptoms can be explained away \"easily\" because my thyroid levels came back super-low (very overproductive — my body was attacking itself!), which gives you anxiety and/or panic attacks as its primary symptom.\\n\\nThe bitch is that my doctor has checked my thyroid levels at least annually, and it took *seven years* for the blood work to suddenly show up bad. (Real bad.) The first few years, I was tested for everything. At some point, I dropped 25% of my body weight, and when blood tests, heart tests, etc came back fine over that year, my doctor assumed I was **a coke user** or *anorexic*! (Pure joy.) And I\\'m sure most here can understand how ludicrous is would be for an anxiety sufferer to get near a STIMULANT and use it regularly. I\\'m quite certain my heart would have exploded into a thousand pieces if I\\'d done coke. Coffee\\'s a problem, you know; no way I\\'d seek out and use a STIMULANT —EVER!\\n\\nTo shut that doctor up about my apparent coke habit, I spent $400 cash for a DNA hair test to prove I hadn\\'t done illicit drugs. Then my doc moved to the next \"obvious\" conclusion: anorexia! He kept checking my throat and fingers routinely *to make sure I wasn\\'t throwing up*.\\n\\nNOW they\\'re saying, hey, your thyroid has been messing up ALL THIS TIME! It just didn\\'t show up in all your 20+ CBCs you paid for over the years. *Hee hee.*\\n\\n**Yes I\\'m pissed** because we\\'ve spent thou$and$ on stupid specialists (including crack-head \"psychiatrists\" who thought I was angling for drugs, or otherwise said I showed no \"mental disorder\"); there were so many specialists and even more stupid tests and CT scans, ludicrous drugs that I didn\\'t even FILL because they were obvious \"throw something and the wall and see what sticks\" drugs.  I went to the doctor almost monthly (at least 6x/yr) for seven years, often to get refills, but also for ER followups. And I didn\\'t even know I HAD a thyroid in all that time; it never came up.\\n\\nApparently, doctors are supposed to know that even if your blood tests aren\\'t showing thyroid problems, they should use other evidence (anxiety, high heart rate, lightheadedness, etc many things) to determine if you\\'re a potential thyroid patient. You know: do their job? Most **don\\'t.**\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m now on anti-thyroid drugs (methimazole, or MMI) with a goal to get it into remission (where my thyroid functions normally with a few diet tricks). Now they didn\\'t like that; oh no, they wanted to chop out my thyroid. (What doctors do when they don\\'t know the answer.) I said \\'no\\', since at that point, my trust in doctors and tests dropped to **an all-time low**. As in, I\\'d trust a street junkie who self-medicates for schizophrenia MORE than anyone with an MD behind their name. Nope: I came my ass home, looked up the apparent death sentence, joined some hard-to-find groups, and realized that most of the stories were from people who had sadly LET endos radiate or chop out their thyroid without looking it up. Headlines: \"don\\'t make any rash decisions\".\\n\\nIt\\'s tempting to have it cut out, too, because by the time your bloodwork shows \"hyperthyroid\", you\\'re in danger of \"thyroid storm\" (aka, **instant death**! Yay! JUST the thing an anxious person needs to hear!). So I was going to let myself DIE so at least my family could sue their stupid practice for MALpractice. (Not \"depression\": FURY.)\\n\\nFortunately, I\\'ve met people who\\'ve used the anti-thyroid drugs (ATDs, and I think mostly they block iodine which is in everything) and a good diet to get themselves into remission (their thyroid functioning properly again). They can apparently \"feel\" when things aren\\'t normal, like with diabetes and other autoimmunes. There are natural iodine blockers (peanuts, strawberries, a few other things I found on wikipedia) and other dietary tricks someone who is in remission can use to feel well. Imagine, a damned peanut working better than a benzo to help you sleep. (It\\'s not that simple, but almost.)\\n\\nThe good news is, since I\\'ve been on the MMIs, I\\'m feeling different (and it\\'s only been a few weeks). I\\'m getting to sleep better; fewer anxiety attacks by FAR; fewer benzos (but unfortunately more cigarettes). My throat (where the thyroid is) has start to hurt, but that\\'s apparently normal. I felt a little \"too good\" the first few days, and started exercising like a madwoman to get my atrophied muscles toned up some — bad move; caused pain everywhere. Gotta use baby steps.\\n\\nBut the kicker for me, and why I\\'m writing a *book* on this subreddit, is that what \"they think\" CAUSES thyroid problems is anxiety and stress. Not untreated stress, since I used benzos to keep my body from suffering stress. Apparently, benzos (and SSRIs, yoga, etc) are just treating the symptoms and not a potential underlying problem that\\'s not easy to diagnose early on.\\n\\nIf you have anxiety, at the very least, MAKE SURE your doctor \"believes\" in thyroid problems. If he doesn\\'t, find a new one. My muscles have atrophied, including my heart. I weigh 98 lbs at 5\\'6\" (low BMI) and my hunger hasn\\'t come back yet even with the thyroid treatment. My vision suddenly got blurry; I\\'m picking up my first pair of Rx sunglasses today, and my eye doctor is trying to keep me from having worse symptoms. I\\'ve had a series of doctors who knew nothing about (or didn\\'t respect) thyroid disorders. Many docs think it\\'s just for overweight people, but really, it\\'s autoimmune, they know VERY little about it, and you won\\'t do well long-term with a doc who doesn\\'t believe in thyroid disorders. I could have felt better, and saved a ton of money, YEARS ago.',\n",

       " 'Hello. I am sorry if I get a little sloppy writing this, I have so many things to say. I\\'ll try to keep it organized. (Also, I am 14. Please don\\'t judge me for my age, I am not dumb. I was actually extremely nervous to post my age due to the fact teenagers are stereotyped a lot. lease don\\'t make me regret it).\\n\\nI am a male who has not had a haircut for years. My hair is down past my shoulders, and I hate it. The issue is, because of my hair, I have always been seen as \"that weird guy\", and I started avoiding people in order to avoid a potential rude comment about my hair. Now, I rarely go out in public, and if I do I actually start shaking and avoiding eye contact or talking.\\n\\nSo, why don\\'t I just get my hair cut? Because I cannot go out in public without having a breakdown. Even being near people I don\\'t know makes me shake. Having them watch me get a haircut, and one touching me would probably make me black out. \\n\\nMy life has been so routine that I don\\'t even know what I\\'m doing most of the time. I am constantly thinking, endlessly creating fantasies where I have friends, have a life, and maybe even a girlfriend. I hate not being aware. I always feel out of it.\\n\\nMy grades started dropping in 6th grade, my hair was already long then, but almost all my friends from elementary went to a separate school due to location. I had made some friends, but not many. I tried to find out why my grades were dropping, keep in mind I was not being bullied so I was pretty sure it was some type of focus issue.\\n\\nThen, during the winter break, I had a breakdown. I couldn\\'t go back to school. I was sweating every time I thought about going back. After many long talks with my parents, I ended up getting homeschooled. I do not like being homeschooled, but I need an education, and when I have the choice of getting bad grades at a public school, or better grades at home, I chose the latter. And I have been getting good grades, but I feel even more isolated from society now then before, because I am.\\n\\nAbout a year ago, I started wondering what I would look like without long hair, because I am very unattractive with my current hair. I took my hoodie, tucked my hair away so only the ends would show on my forehead, and I was shocked. I actually look good! When my parents were not home, I started having 1-2 hour long periods in the bathroom where I would just admire this new found me. (I still do).\\n\\nI think I thought of this new me as another person, and thought of him as a friend. Yes, I became my own friend. Eventually I even started having my short haired self try to talk some sense into my long haired self. I was arguing in the mirror with myself, trying to get myself to see how logical it is to get a haircut, but my mind seems to just hit a roadblock every time, and I would start thinking about what I would change if I could go back in time, which is ridiculous.\\n\\nI hate change. That is another reason I feel I can\\'t get a haircut. I don\\'t like being the center of attention, and a change like a haircut for me would be very hard to cope with. I also want to go back to school, but if I get a haircut and go, I can\\'t even imagine the people I used to know\\'s reactions, who have only known me with long hair.\\n\\nI feel desperate. I have even, and this is going to sound pathetic because it is, though of faking an injury to my head so I could maybe pretend I didn\\'t know who I was and cut off my hair, then magically go back to normal.\\n\\nI have never done drugs, I live in a good area, and my parents are together. I feel selfish a lot of the time, making others worry about me because I\\'m afraid to get a haircut.\\n\\nAlso, **please** do not tell me to suck it up and go. The last time  went to the dentist, I had been sweating so much there was a spot on the waiting room chair, and no one was in the waiting room other then my mom and a lady reading a magazine. I honestly think if I try going into a crowded Greatclips I will faint, or run away halfway through the haircut.\\n\\nI\\'ve been to therapy, but it didn\\'t help at all. If anything, it made me worse. I am not depressed though. I love life, the mere thought of ending it is ridiculous. I also have never cut myself, Loosing valuable plasma is not going to help me in any way.\\n\\nWhy do I refuse to get a haircut, even after all of this?\\n',\n",

Or should I go back to the doctor and tell him I want to keep trying medication? Or, perhaps, should I try and find a different doctor in the area and get a second opinion?\\n\\n\\nThe medications I've tried are\\n\\nFluoxetine: Horrible nausea: lasted all day and interrupted work.

Caused me panic attacks right before bed.\\n\\nParoxetine: I don't actually remember why I stopped this one. Might've also been nausea, but I can't recall.\\n\\nCymbalta: Awful nausea and extreme drowsiness.

       " '**Actual experiences with meds will be quoted, background story will be in regular text. **\\n\\nHey guys, I\\'m a victim of hereditary anxiety. I\\'m guessing the right term would be GAD because I have no reason to be anxious, life is going dandy for me. Nothing great, but nothing bad at all with it. And I was/am chronically anxious, every single day. One day it would be the shaky nervous anxiety, the next it would be the \"I\\'m about to throw up/diarrhea\" anxiety, and then the next would be the \"Where am I, why are the walls moving, am I in a dream?\" anxiety.\\n\\n&gt;Anyway, I only took clonazepam because my mom had it on hand once when I was having a really bad attack and near forced me to take it. I was worried it would make me feel even worse. To my surprise, it worked. With no side effect other than feeling sedated a little bit. Now I know that clonazepam is not something you take everyday ( I mean you can.. ) but it\\'s something more for emergencies/situational use. Plus I knew I was building a tolerance fast. Only after 5-6 dosages of 0.25mg\\'s, what used to make me feel sedated and crash out now doesn\\'t even affect me. So I had to get onto a maintenance pill. \\n\\n&gt;Paxil was my doctor\\'s first choice. I don\\'t know how many mg\\'s the pill was but I took half before bed. I fell asleep, and within an hour I woke up like I was on crack. (I\\'ve never used before, I\\'m just assuming.) My whole body was one giant tremor, I stumbled to my parents room because I thought something insane was happening. They calmed me down and let met sleep on their floor in case I had more trouble. I just remember being eyes wide open and my mind just racing. I tried very hard to fall asleep, I closed my eyes and in what felt like a blink 1am turned into 6am and I was wide awake. I did not feel groggy, I didn\\'t feel like I slept at all. The next day was spent not being able to close my eye lids for more than a couple seconds and constantly shaking a limb. Mentally, this medication made me feel like a zombie. I couldn\\'t be depressed/anxious because I couldn\\'t focus on what was making me sad at the time. In fact I couldn\\'t think about anything for more than 2 seconds without my mind switching to some other topic. I couldn\\'t be sad, but I couldn\\'t be happy either.\\n\\nThis all was when I was about 17. Today I\\'m 20, near 21, and my anxiety has come back full force. But in a different way. Over the years I\\'ve noticed myself being sluggish, feeling like my brain wasn\\'t on or something was wrong with me. But I didn\\'t associate those feelings with anxiety since the only anxiety attacks I\\'ve had were panic attacks. Feeling nervous and shakey. Now my anxiety attacks are mellow but not in a better way. Everyday for a couple weeks I spent in bed feeling ill to my stomach. I was very dizzy and lightheaded, and confused at times. I had this feeling that you get right before you\\'re about to puke and you want your mommy and daddy. The feeling that didn\\'t know that paper was due or that the final was today. Constantly scared, but for no reason. I\\'ve been a vegetable in my bed for the passed few weeks. I never registered for classes next semester, because I couldn\\'t even fathom going to class in the state that I\\'m in. And I\\'ve been avoiding going to work a lot. (I have a very tolerant and flexible boss and little financial responsibility at the moment, thankfully)\\n\\nSo I went back to the doctor, said I\\'m not having that Paxil experience again. He prescribes me Buspar. Many hate it or don\\'t care for it, and little love it with a passion. It has many reviews, and they are so mixed. Some people it made nervous and even more anxious, some people said it made them pass out into a pool of their own drool, some say they hallucinated. But whether people said they hated it because of bad reactions, it did nothing for them and they think it\\'s a sugar pill, or it was a miracle drug that turned their life around, they all had one thing in common. It made them incredibly dizzy. I absolutely did not want this, dizziness to me is like being on a roller coaster you can\\'t get off of. And if I was dizzy, for sure I would be nauseous.\\n\\n&gt; So, being so traumatized by Paxil and not wanting to be dizzy, I literally took a chip off the end of the 5mg pill(The lowest dosage it comes in and I only took half of a half, of a half) and tried to keep my mind off the potential side effects. I was on my phone when I noticed it sort of \"hit\". The phone\\'s colors were a little more vibrant and exaggerated and everything just felt a little odd. Nothing enough to make me freak out yet. I then began yawning over and over for a good 5 minutes and felt like taking a nap, so I did. I woke up from this nap incredibly energized almost like I was on Paxil. But it didn\\'t make me freak out like Paxil did, I just felt like I drank a ton of coffee and I could run 10 miles. My jaw was a little sore though, I think I was grinding my teeth while I was sleeping which has never happened. And while I was awake I caught myself chewing the inside of my cheek or my tongue quite a few times. But the anxiety and dizziness/confusion was gone. I thought to myself, this drug isn\\'t addictive, it\\'s very cheap and if I can build up a tolerance to where I\\'m not being shocked by overwhelming energy, then I\\'ll definitely enjoy life again while on it.\\n\\n&gt;This feeling lasted all the way until night time, but wore off a little. I actually had no trouble going to sleep though. The next day I was still feeling it (I know it has a short half life, but I\\'ve never had energy like this, I wan\\'t to believe it was this med) and being at a lower level of unnecessary energy, I was feeling actually really good. No more confusion, no more dizziness, I felt almost euphoric. Grin from ear to ear. I thought to myself, \"Is this how normal people feel? Have I just been mentally suppressed my whole life?\" I did have a moment of sadness though, because I thought for a second about how this may not last. How tomorrow I may feel just as bad as I felt a couple days ago. I did not take a pill that day, because I still had a lot of energy from taking the crumb of the pill the day before. Needless to say, I was back to square one the day after. I took the crumb again, and the anxiety went away, I got really happy again and motivated, but the power rush didn\\'t come back. It did give me energy, but not overpowering how it was before. Like mentioned above, I was in my happy place. The day after that is today. I took another crumb, a little bigger this time. And felt happy and motivated with no anxiety. Although this time within 7-8 hours the anxiety was coming back, where as it lasted 2 days the first time, and all day the second time.\\n\\nNow I have an issue.. It\\'s depressing me a lot to think that for me to be happy in life, that I\\'m going to have to take this pill every single day. That I\\'m not the reason that I\\'m happy, it\\'s these pills. I\\'m not truly happy, it\\'s just artificial. It\\'s not fixing my unbalanced chemicals, it\\'s synthetically boosting me and it\\'s not natural to feel this euphoric. What if I forget my pills on a trip one day? Why can\\'t I be happy.. by myself? These are questions that are sort of putting me down.',\n",

I think I would be way more anxious/depressed if I couldn't get off with my boyfriend. Is there anyone at all out there that DIDN'T have anorgasmia/sex issues on Lexapro? \\n\\nLorazepam - never had experience with this and would like to know more. My grandfather was appalled they prescribed it for me because at one point all of his friends (prescribed for sleep too) got addicted.\\n\\nBut when you're in the middle of a panic attack, when there is nonstop terror and nothing else in the world seems to matter or exist and you're fairly certain you may die, how effective is Lora? My doc said it was faster and stronger than the 0.5mg Xanax I've been using for emergencies. This 0.5mg Lorazepam was prescribed to me to use daily at night but I would like this as my emergency med. \\n\\nAdvice is appreciated. Thanks reddit! :)\",\n",

My boyfriend understands this and has been pretty supportive of it, however, there's more to it now.\\n\\nI get super anxious about sex now, and i think it might be making it more painful for me...which just increases the anxiety. I'm too afraid to tell him this though because I'm afraid he'll think he's doing something wrong or will just get frustrated with me.\\n\\nIs this a normal thing with anxiety? I really enjoy things like cuddling and kissing, but as soon as he shows any indication of wanting more I just freeze up. \\n\\nI usually just push myself through it and try to make myself enjoy it, but this night was just too much for me. I'm terrified to tell him and i have no clue how to start. I'm really convinced that i have anxiety since going through this sub-Reddit and other websites (I've made so many connections with problems that i never even thought were related).

       " 'This week has just been awful for me anxiety wise. I got back into town from vacation Friday, just in time for the 4th. I went over to my male companion\\'s apartment to watch fireworks and things between us just felt weird. We haven\\'t been dating long and we\\'re certainly not serious, but the weird feeling got to me.\\n\\nMonday, I went back to the lab I work in after being off and my professor is pressing me to get my paper published. Stressor 1. I also recently found out my first deadline for applying to medical school is August instead of October. Stressor 2. When I asked my professor if he can write me a recommendation letter and review my personal statement, he asks for my deadline and I reply August. He says that he would normally want TWO MONTHS for revisions. But just get all my materials to him ASAP. Stressor 3. After all this and being on the verge of a panic attack for 2+ hours, I have to go around and ask other professors for recommendation letters. Stressor 4.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the last couple days I have been really high strung. In the back of my head, I am sure male companion is tired of me and doesn\\'t want to see me anymore. I know that\\'s not true, but that doesn\\'t matter. He\\'s leaving town this week and when I asked if I would get to see him before he left he replied, \"If you want to.\" IN my brain that meant I was twisting his arm behind his back to get him to see me, that it was a chore to spend time with me. Then I get back to my apartment and get an email from my professor after he read my personal statement. He started out saying it was readable and entertaining. But then he goes onto say that it doesn\\'t really get to the heart of why I want to go into medicine and then questions why I want to be a doctor. Cue downward spiral of negativity and self-loathing. Not to mention poor male companion has been trying to text me and tease me to lighten my mood, but I am so not in a good place right now and I am not going to unleash the full crazy on him.

       " \"Back in the ER again, thinking that I have a issue with my body... Only here to entertain the nurses and doctors wages. I swear there was something wrong with me last year when I was in the ER 3 times, got a full body CT each time (one with contrast) to try to figure out what was causing the pain in my body... \\nWhy it was hard to breathe...\\nJust what the fuck was going on with my fucking body. \\nDo you know how fucking irritating it is to have doctors tell you nothing is wrong each time while you get close to 3000 daily background radiation a pop? \\nIt scares me just thinking about it. I didn't think it was anxiety at first because I never had any issues with my mind or situation. But somehow, between the countless doctor visits and countless counselor visits, i was unfortunately convinced that i had anxiety. I was put on Lexapro initially for about a year do to anxiety attacks that i couldn't believe I was experiencing, I was slowly losing grip of my reality. When I was let off everything went back to normal... I felt like myself.... Well until recently. \\n\\n3 weeks ago is when my anxiety came back with brute force, causing dizziness, panic, the reoccurring hypochondriac. Chest pain, head pain, delusions, dull aches to sharp ones and finally me losing control all together. I started to begin to feel like my life would end up to nothing, anxiety would become my prison, and i would never get out. I have never ever felt so empty before... But you see, that was the night before I went back on Lexapro. Prior to that I flipped on my girlfriend because i felt like I was being smothered to death, when in reality she was just cuddling with me... I freaked like I never would've. I pushed her off and called her a bitch and ran to bathroom hyperventilating, locking the door behind me. \\n\\nThe worst is being a hypochondriac, I think I have aneurysms, I constantly feel faint now which is getting in the way of me running which is one of the only things that keep me sane. \\n\\nBut tonight Im back in the ER... I woke up (no reason I can fathom) shaking uncontrollably... (4th day back on Lexapro). I try to brush it off, get some water and go back to bed. Before i can go back to sleep... The mother of all attacks, like as if the portal of hell opened in my brain... \\n\\nI was trying to unwind, just drifting, thinking... Then I realized I couldn't stop thinking, I couldn't change my thoughts, I couldn't imagine something else. My thoughts felt like they were overloading.... They became faster, compiled (I wasn't asleep) and then....\\n\\nCOLORS... Fucking bright vivid sharp fucking COLORS... (Sorta like if you stare into the sun and blink, but times 100) and then my heart went from my runners heart rate (50 or so) to god knows what... It speed up so fast and I panicked. I ran to my girl friend and shook her awake, she didn't budge, nor comply. My hands and extremities start to tingle... My head started to ache, my throat started to close. I shook her vigorously... And finally she woke and screamed to get away and let her sleep. It didn't help, it made it worse. I panicked and called the only person I knew would understand, my stepmom. \\nShe came and i started to become nauseous, I ran outside to her car, and she ask me whats going on (her being a nurse) i told her and now where here in the ER, 3 o'clock in the fucking morning. On the way here though, the street light appeared to be more foggy, like the aura, wasn't shiny but more smokey which i thought was odd... But I don't know. \\n\\nNow I'm praying to god they find something (like the last few times) to explain and end this anxiety nightmare, because its so hard to believe I have it. I was fine 3 years ago... Like what changed? It could be so easily explained with a condition, anything but anxiety. \",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve had GAD and OCD my entire life but I was just recently formally diagnosed a year ago (I\\'m 23).\\n\\nWhile both diagnoses fit me really well, there\\'s one thing that doesn\\'t fit, I can (and have) lose touch with reality. Let me tell you a bit of my back story so it makes more sense.\\n\\nWhen I was 18 I started having really bad anxiety, panic attacks and my OCD spiraled out of control. I didn\\'t have insurance at the time so I wasn\\'t able to get help. My OCD started getting very severe. I started believing really weird things. Like my tonsils were going to randomly start bleeding and I\\'d die and that I have skin cancer (I have a family history of melanoma). At first, I knew it didn\\'t seem to make much sense, factually anyway. But as it started getting even more severe I started \"losing touch with reality\". I would start believing it was true. So much so that I would spend money out of pocket to visit doctors and when they would say everything was fine, I wouldn\\'t believe them. I thought they just weren\\'t looking hard enough and missing something. I had no sense of \"This doesn\\'t make sense\", I BELIEVED it. I knew I was going to die. I would obsess over it 24/7 to the point I was barely sleeping. All I did all day was check to make sure my tonsils weren\\'t bleeding and that my moles weren\\'t changing.\\n\\nFast forward, my stress started to be reduced. The severity went down. I no longer believed it and sat there and thought \"How could I believe something so out there?\" I gained insurance not too long after (Thanks Obama).\\n\\nI started going to counseling and seeing a psychiatrist. They both said I have GAD and OCD. I never once brought up these severe episodes. I was (and still am) embarrassed. In my moments of clarity they seem completely ridiculous and it scares me, because I feel like I was losing my mind and worry about it coming back.\\n\\nMy insurance changed not too long ago and I am no longer able to afford going to counseling or seeing anyone and guess what? It\\'s coming back. So far it\\'s only very temporary. I may lose myself for a few minutes or a half hour at most but it\\'s still there. This is how it began last time. I\\'m very scared, embarrassed and I don\\'t know what to do.\\n\\nI\\'ve always been told with OCD you realize you are obsessing but can\\'t help it. But when this happens I don\\'t even realize it\\'s completely crazy. I believe it. In my world, it\\'s factual.\\n\\nCan this still be OCD or am I right to suspect something else is going on? Does anyone have any experience with something similar? Hell, I\\'d just like to know I am not alone. I feel like I am going crazy and I feel really ashamed. I am usually a very logical person.',\n",

       " \"So here is my issue.  Years ago my now fiancée lied to me about sexual involvement with a very close friend.  She also lied when confronted about it.   Even the guy she was in loved with was hitting on her while we were together early on and she kept it a secret from me and claimed that she only lied and kept it a secret not to ruin our relationship because while she only had one night stands with him that I was the first person to actually be interested in her sexually, emotionally and physically all at once.  The fact that these things happened was bothersome enough but the lies are what kind of sent it out of control.  I have tried pushing it out of my mind and getting on with my life but it ends up being ok for a few months or so and then I bring it up again in fights about how I don't trust him and how I don't like him anymore especially since he claimed I was one of his best friends after I found out he was hitting on her behind my back.  Plus the fact that anytime I or anyone says anything bad about him or something he does she defends him without taking a second thought about it even if she knows she's in the wrong but if he or anyone says anything negative about me she won't peep up at all and just let it happen and agree with it unless it's stupid outrageous.  Also I should mention hat this is the type of guy to sleep with any woman that he wants through manipulation of emotions as he has done for his life and has no problems cheating on significant others or helping other people cheat on their significant others (he openly admitted this one night to all of us while drinking) and almost every woman that he has ever been with intimately has told him to fuck off in no fewer words except she stays with him as well a few others.  He claims depression which I can believe but uses it as a manipulation tactic.  She is also a bleeding heart however and I understand her fervor to help anyone who needs help or claims to need help...she has trouble saying no to people but I've noticed many small mannerisms at times that indicate she treats him differently.  When we visited him and other friends at one point we waited at the bar until he was done with work.  A few other friends met us one after the other as time passed but she seemed distant and preoccupied and didn't move to get up and hug any of them and barely greeted them but when he got there she jumped up and ran across the bar and have him a long big but and then came and sat back down mostly only paying attention to him and ignoring other conversations.  I know for a fact she is not cheating and that she would never do it but my anxiety screams at me, at the weirdest fucking times, that she doesn't love me as much as she does him or that she loves me but likes him a lot.  It hurts because I connect all of her mannerisms big or small and sometimes possibly not even in ways that she understands or intends and I could be blowing it all out of proportion but I don't think I am at all.  It's very noticeable to me and even a few of out friend group when it happens if they are looking for it but I love her.  We've been together for 3 years and are planning on being together forever but I fear that I won't be able to because of his irrational fear.  I'm worried that it will continue affecting me as long as we are together and I have to worry about it....I'm just fucking nuts.  Other than that my anxiety is under control better but this issue has been a constant issue ever since the issue occurred and won't go away.  I've tried the confrontation tactic on both of them and was told flat out no cheating was involved but that doesn't make me feel better when I feel that it's more of an emotional cheating rather than a physical one.  It just bothers me...any advice or help...please?\",\n",

       " 'I\\'ll make a long story short. \\n\\nI have Pure O and generalized anxiety.\\n\\nFrom 2005-2007 I dated a girl who was my first love.  We started college together.  But we broke up in 2007 because she thought we were fighting too much.  (I honestly can\\'t remember in retrospect).  I was heartbroken, though, and I never remember being that happy in my life since then.  She started dating and went on to marry one of my best friends.  I don\\'t have contact with her or him anymore.\\n\\nWe broke up in January and I was devastated.  In October of that year (2007) I started dating someone else after having lost about 60 lbs.  We got engaged the following summer.  The idea that I was still in rebound never hit me, but we grew apart as she wanted to party and I had quit drinking.  \\n\\nI was single for the next two years and then I started dating my most recent ex.  She has severe anxiety issues, a history of drug abuse, etc.  She was a wonderful person.  But we, with our anxiety and problems, ended up being emotionally abusive to one another.  It got to where I felt I couldn\\'t get out and had to involve an outside party and the police.  I developed stress-induced hypothyroidism as a result and I took about 6 or 7 months to recover from that (my weight had gone up about 80 lbs since my initial loss so I got up close to 290).  \\n\\nI took time off from school and work after the relationship ended and my parents were a big help to me as I got my thyroid meds in order and started losing weight.  I\\'ve lost 50 lbs since the middle of this past December.  \\n\\nI went on a first date with a girl I met from Match.com last night.  It was amazing.  I felt like I was with my high school girlfriend all over again.  We talked for seven hours.  She normally goes to bed at 9.  She stayed up til 2 and we just talked to one another and it was awesome.  I gave her a hug and we talked about going out again after she gets back from a trip she is taking this week (she leaves tomorrow).  \\n\\nShe texted me good morning today and told me that even though she was gonna be busy she wanted to just say \"have a good day :).\"  I texted her back later and told her I was gonna be at a local coffeehouse if she wanted to stop on her way out of town and grab a cup with me in the morning.  She didn\\'t text back for about 5 hours and I sent another that just said, \"If not its not a big deal, just figured since I would be in the area I would ask :) and how did packing go?\" or something along those lines.  She texted me back later telling me sorry she had been busy and was now at the concert she had planned on going to with her mom, etc and that she \"definitely would like to\" get coffee but she \"didn\\'t think she\\'d have time :(\" in the morning.\\n\\nShe stayed out super late talking to me and we couldn\\'t stop laughing and being goofy with each other all night, and I haven\\'t had that much fun with girl since almost 10 years.  Today, I just couldn\\'t stop obsessing about it.  Thinking how I had fucked things up somehow or that I was being an idiot or that something terrible was going to happen.  \\n\\nAnd then it hit me today that I hadn\\'t even been in love since that first girlfriend.  That I just wanted someone to be with or accept me and that the girls I was confiding were just getting more and more damaged and broken [not that there\\'s anything wrong with them].  And then here I am today, having lost 50 lbs, out of an abusive relationship for almost a year, and I am absolutely fucking terrified I\\'m going to destroy it.\\n\\nI can\\'t focus on exercise or my little schoolwork I have left or just take my mind off of it because I finally have something like I used to have and I\\'m scared its all going to end.

       " 'First off, I know that a certain level of anxiety is normal. I haven\\'t been worry free for years. I know that compared to what other people have to go though, my situation isn\\'t bad.\\n\\nSecond,  I will probably go into too much detail about this but I have never talked to anyone about this so i might as well give a lot of details. \\n\\nI\\'ve always worried about how I look. When I was younger I was a fat kid (not like the kid from Willy wonkas chocolate factory,  most of the fat was on my stomach) no one ever said anything so it was easy for my young mind to overlook that and focus more on having fun. \\n\\nAround sixth grade I started to become self conscious about my weight. I started to grow taller so i was growing into it but that didn\\'t stop me from feeling embarrassed.  Again none of my class mates teased me or was mean to me at all.  I began to ware a hoodie everyday because it feels like a barrier.  It\\'s something physical between me and everyone else. I still ware a hoodie everyday to school without taking it off and I\\'m a Junior in High School. \\n\\nAfter sixth grade my anxiety about how i look began to get worse. I didn\\'t ware my hoodie when classes started  because it was the middle of Summer and i felt like i didn\\'t need it.  \\nSeventh grade at my school is junior high so that meant that we got to move into part of the high school, get our own lockers,  and begin moving from class to class. Everyone had classes in the actual high school (which means classes in the freshman through senior part of the building). I began to notice that the hoodie really helped.  Before i started wearing it i would feel like everyone was looking at me.  I had a science class in the high school part of the building so i had to walk through there. I had to walk down the hallway with people on both walls just standing there talking but for me i felt like everyone was looking at me. After that i began to ware my hoodie everyday. \\n\\nSlowly my worries started to include more than just my appearance.  I hate speaking in front of my class. If we\\'re doing a presentation of something that we researched then I\\'m fine, because i know what I\\'m going to say.  But say we\\'re reading a book outloud in class i start to panic because i know that I\\'m going to fuck it up and  stutter. I think i read faster than my mouth can keep up.  So for me reading a paragraph outloud that i haven\\'t already read a few times,  is painful. I can read perfectly well to myself.  I always have a book with me so i can read during class. \\n\\nI\\'m always worried about something.  Most of the time it has to do with school and my anxiety.  If i know that I\\'m going to have to speak in front of my class by myself and there\\'s no way i can get out if it,  then i will think of it constantly until i have to speak. I\\'f its not about school then it\\'s about personal problems. \\n\\nI know I\\'m writing a lot but I\\'ve never talked to someone about this.\\n\\nI dont talk very much in public unless if its to my friends. I hate going anywhere that I\\'m not obligated to go to, like school or family gatherings. \\n\\nI like routine because i know it\\'s safe.  I know, mostly,  what\\'s going to happen because it\\'s pretty much the same.  Wake up,  get ready,  ride the bus to school,  deal with seven hours of things i mostly half ass because it\\'s easy enough and i get Cs and Bs, go home,  watch tv go on xbox live and talk to a friend on there,  watch tv again,  go to sleep,  repeat. \\n\\nBut the past few years have gotten worse. During the Summer I\\'m fine. No anxiety. But starting on the last month of Summer break i begin to get depressed. The last week of Summer I\\'m extremely anxious and i dont want to do anything except watch tv or youtube all day wIthout saying anything outloud to anyone or my self. Christmas break is like this too but not nearly as bad. \\n\\nMy best friend (who I\\'ve known since third grade) doesn\\'t know it, but he helps me a lot. I can be myself around him and we can just talk about stupid shit. For a while i forget my worries. But he skips school a lot and when he\\'s gone i almost never say anything to anyone. I have other friends but i never see them until lunch and for some reason i feel like i can talk to them. (Also i haven\\'t eaten lunch in about 3 years because the food sucks and i feel embarrassed when i eat in front of people). My friends on xbox live help too since they have no idea what i look like and in the privacy of my room,  i can be myself. \\n\\nI know this is a long submission so I\\'ll  summarize.\\n\\nIm very introverted, i hate being somewhere I\\'m unfamiliar with.\\n\\nI\\'m very self conscious about my weight which ruins my summer and Christmas break.\\n\\nI\\'m constantly worried about something.  Usually its tied to my self consciousness.\\n\\nIf, unfortunately, something embarrassing happens to me i will obsess over it for months. I still get flashbacks to things that happened years ago that mess with me today.\\n\\nAlso i know that i repeated the same idea (like my self consciousness) a lot. Well i decided to write this at one in the morning on a Wednesday, so I\\'m tired and need to get to sleep. Im sure that there are errors in this post but I\\'m too tired right now to fix it.

       " \"I went to a bar this evening for a friends birthday and had a panic attack. I bought a drink and talked to the bartender with no problem. It was pretty cold this evening so I was pretty confused why my body just decided to heat up. As more people trickled into the bar I felt myself becoming hotter and hotter. As I was talking with people I couldn't for the life of me make eye contact and just became hotter and hotter. At one point I started to notice I was sweating and became scared that I would sweat so much that it would be embarrassing. I then began to break out into a sweat. I felt like I just ran a mile and I couldn't get my body to cool down. I was trying to have a conversation with someone and I just became so drenched in sweat I stopped talking to them and started panicking. I felt like I needed to hide somewhere and calm down. Luckily I found a booth I can't hod hide in but I was concerned I would be alienating myself from the group and that they would think something was wrong with me. I tried to get myself together and finally my klonopin kicked in. I felt so embarrassed to be sweating like that in front of everyone. I didn't even have a drink in me yet. Am I overthinking the situation? I feel as though the people in the bar thought I was being weird. I can't help but keep thinking about it. I hate anxiety. \",\n",

       " 'Hello /r/anxiety, I just woke up after a bad night and a nightmare, naturally I also had an attack and I\\'m trying to recover now. I really need some support right now and I would be grateful if you could help.\\nBasically, what happened last night is I was blamed by a friend for \"wanting special treatment\" because of my emotional instability. I have anxiety, sometimes depression, and avoidant personality disorder. And I\\'m also just very sensitive and fragile. So there is no stability to speak of, and I know it can be hard for another person to deal with my issues, but I think a friend should try and understand them, no?\\n\\nIf you want a better understanding, here\\'s how it went: I was anxious the whole day yesterday and before going to sleep I sent the guy one of the pictures that I sometimes use to help me to relax. He started criticizing it, which was the last drop for me, because in his criticism he also touched on something I totally didn\\'t want to be criticized (something dear to me). So I told him I don\\'t want to hear his opinion now (in a relatively angry manner), but instead of understanding his impact and backing off, he started fanning the flames, by insistently telling me that he has the right for his opinion, that I\\'m acting wrong and childish for losing my temper, that I am the only one to blame for it, that it\\'s not *his* problem that his words affect me this way, and that nobody owes me \"special treatment\". ... Not cool.\\n\\nWhat I ultimately told him is that I always thought there\\'s nothing wrong with adapting to a friend\\'s nuances, especially if they\\'re psychological issues – it\\'s the right thing to do as a friend. Unless these nuances are unbearably hard to adapt to and trying to do so hurts you – that\\'s where you simply cut off the communication. That\\'s what I always did.\\n\\nI hope someone here can agree with my point of view. I feel hurt and humiliated and shocked because of being blamed like this and I desperately need some understanding to get back into shape. Also I would like to know what would you do in this situation. I don\\'t know if I can be friends with this person anymore since he refuses to understand me and tries to justify his lack of understanding instead. None of my other friends do this. I have some very understanding friends and I\\'m grateful to them for taking my issues into account. I\\'m not taking it for granted. I just think it\\'s the right thing to do as a friend. Do you agree?',\n",

It sucks because whenever there is anything I have to worry about (which usually revolves around what I think people think of me), I mentally focus on it until I can somehow get myself to rationalize it.\\n\\nMy anxiety isn't overwhelmingly socially limiting however. Every weekend I'll go out with friends to bars, but usually end up getting too drunk. Outside of this I tend to mostly busy myself with school work, searching for jobs, etc. and don't force myself into novel types of social situations. This has been a trend throughout my life...I've always stuck to exposing myself socially in the party esque scene in which alcohol serves as a social lubricant (I am not an alcoholic though).\\n\\nAlthough I am told that I am very attractive I have problems connecting with girls. My looks seem to intrigue them enough that I don't have problems approaching/meeting them, but once the conversation really begins I struggle. In high school I had several close friends whom were girls but in college I don't really have any. \\n\\nAll of my friends have had a girlfriend by now and I am still lagging behind, which nags me everyday. That said I am not a virgin, and have had sex a dozen of times but still lack experience and confidence. Unfortunately I worry about this whenever i find myself in situations with girls and in many cases this hurts my performance/discourages me from pursuing/bringing them home in the first place. \\n\\nI go to the gym several days a week, see a therapist and am about to begin taking antidepressants. In the past i had taken them but they didn't really help and i got anxious about them lowering my sex drive to the point that I stopped taking them. \\n\\nDo people have advice as to what I should be doing differently?

       " 'Five-ish years ago when I was 16, I was a disgusting attention-whoring jerk.  There\\'s an unnamed game I used to play and I spent a lot of time on one of its servers whose lax rules essentially turned it into \"4chan: The Game\".  So I spent a little over a year spouting obscenties and slurs with the rest of the regular players (I was more annoying than most and did a lot of all-caps spamming, but I ended up on good terms with most of the regulars).  Disclaimer:  I\\'m extremely liberal.  Some people (cough cough /r/theredpill) would call me an SJW.  I said the things I said because they were offensive and I knew they could provoke a reaction.  So what\\'s the problem?  Why can\\'t I just forget about it and move on and try to be a better person than my 16 year old self?  Because of the stupidest reason ever: My username was my *real* name.  So after a year of doing this, it suddenly hit me how incredibly, incredibly stupid what I\\'d been doing was, and so ever since, I\\'ve been having panic attacks and intermitent depression about the future.  What happens if search engines become better to the degree that searching my name brings up a post or two on a forum talking about me?  You know how sometimes random people get their 15 minutes of fame by getting hundreds of thousands of shares on a tweet?  What if something like that happens to me on future twitter and someone from that server sees it and remembers me?  There are a dozen scenarios that could completely ruin my life.\\n\\nNow I\\'m in college and in the next few days, I have to sign up for classes next fall, but before I do, I have to declare a major and decide what to do with my life.  I have two in mind:  one that\\'s fairly presitigous and could potentially get me in the public\\'s eye if I were successful (and I\\'d really rather do) (it\\'s not acting or broadcasting or anything, it\\'s a specialized field of engineering), and another one that\\'s less so.\\n\\nWhat really gets me is thinking about my brilliant, loving parents.  They\\'ve poured over two decades of their love into me and I\\'ve probably thrown it all away.  I cringe imagining their reaction if this came out.  And what about if/when I get married?  What if it came out when I have kids?  What would they think?  And safely assuming I lose my job in this hypothetical worst-case future, I\\'d be completely fucking over any family that I have.  I used to be hopeful about things and the future before all this, but for these past few years, I\\'ve spent half of my waking hours feeling anxious and hopeless and disgusted with myself and above all, guilty for being a complete failure to my parents as their son.\\n\\nSo what am I going to do?  I\\'ve posted a shortened version of this once before and the most I got was, \"Scrub those results from Google, that\\'s all you can do, man!\" (I didn\\'t mention this, but Googling my name used to bring up a bunch of posts from the server\\'s forum mentioning me or offhandedly talking about my behavior, and I\\'ve been *pretty* successful in getting rid of those), but that doesn\\'t do much to alleviate my fears.  So should I take the more prestigious major?  The less one?  Is there a point, or is the reveal inevitable?  Should I just hunker down and become a garbageman and stay out of the public eye and die alone and unaccomplished?  I\\'m scared and depressed and I don\\'t know what to do.',\n",

He also didn't understand my anxiety as he has gone through much more than I and feels like my anxieties are not problems at all and that really hurt my feelings. \\nSo I guess my question is, how do I relax? \\nI've already lost someone I really care about due to my need to control and I don't want to do that to anyone ever again.\",\n",
       " \"Hi guys, \\n\\nI've had an acute (but severe) anxiety disorder for about 15 years now (I'm 30). I have been with my partner (who's also 30) for for 12 years and married for 7. \\n\\nMy disorder is really only an issue going into new workplace environments, however these attacks are incredibly severe, almost to the point debilitation. This is due to some very traumatic experiences I had entering the workplace as a teenager. \\n\\nOn the plus side, during these past 12 years I have overcome my anxiety and successfully held down a couple jobs for some significant periods of time. \\n\\nOn the negative side, due to the severity of this disorder I have also let some of other jobs go as I was simply unable to cope with it. Overall I think my disorder has cost me 5 or 6 jobs.\\n\\nUp until recently my wife has always been a never-ending source or strength, love &amp; support for me. However a couple of years ago I had a particularly bad attack when I was about to start working a new full-time job. Long story short, I ended up not getting this job (because of my anxiety) &amp; my wife not long after had a nervous breakdown. She has always been the main income earner in our relationship and after not being able to keep a good-paying full-time job it all became a bit too much for her. In her words, she broke. As she explained to me not long afterwards she is desperate for me have to a consistent income. She was then put on some pretty strong medication.\\n\\nFast forward to this year and things have slowly grown more distant between us. I have started working what is essentially my dream job however it is only between 15-20 per week and the pay isn't that great. So, I went out to find another casual job to help bring in that little extra. Sadly, when I got this other job I yet again had extreme anxiety for a few days. It was at this point my wife gave me an ultimatum that I needed to make this job work or our marriage maybe over. \\n\\nAs I'm sure most of you will understand having that added pressure hanging over me made the task of starting this new job made it that much more difficult. But, after a few days I did overcame my anxiety and am now currently work 2 jobs and bringing in a relatively regular income.\\n\\nI was so proud of this achievement and thought that this might be the start of a turning point for us.  \\n\\nHowever after a long and difficult discussion last night my wife confessed that while she is happy about me overcoming my anxiety and sticking with this job she no longer feels she has anything more to give me in terms of support and patience when it come to dealing with my disorder. On top of that due to my sporadic incomes over the past 12 years she does not ever see us being able to have children and on top of that she feels a big part of her breakdown &amp; subsequently being on medication is because of me and the trauma she's experienced watching &amp; having to constantly support me having such horrible panic attacks. She told me that whenever she thinks of a future with me, she is now filled with sadness &amp; insecurity.\\n\\nWe do both still love each other intensely but I just don't think she  can see a positive future with someone like me. She is making an appointment to see a psychologist today in the hope of helping her clarify her thoughts and then we will go from there. She has also suggested that we may need to separate temporarily for now, while she gets herself together in this way. Which I said I was willing to do.\\n\\nSo that's it basically. I am absolutely terrified by the thought of losing my wife, to the point where it makes me physically sick. I cannot imagine my life without her but her happiness trumps all of that and maybe we would be both better off in the long run to go our separate ways permanently if she cannot overcome how she feels about a future together with me. I'm doing everything I possibly can make things better but right now it just doesn't seem like enough and I don't know what to do.\\n\\nThat's it, any feedback or advise is of course appreciated.

       " \"I suffer from extreme, massive anxiety attacks. I walk around most days with a general undertone of worry and paranoid. It's become a part of me. I'm the zany manic friend. Everyone thinks I'm funny and fun and wild and don't care what people think of me (which is not true). Anyway. I take Wellbutrin for my depression and I love it. Very happy with the affect it's had on me (I can get out of bed, I brush my teeth, I go to work, I go to the gym, I shower, etc.). The only problem is that it increases my mania and anxiety -- which are worse for me than depression. My anxiety manifests itself in very physical ways (nausea, dry heaving, sweating, rapid heart rate, trouble catching my breath). I asked my Dr. if I could have something to balance the Wellbutrin out just a tinnnny bit. She prescribed me Xanax. Now, I'm not trying to abuse the drug. I understand the risk of addition--but my Dr. gives me so little that it makes my anxiety worse. I am constantly weighing if my panic attack is BAD ENOUGH to take one. Am I just dry heaving or am I puking in the parking lot at work? Will a few deep breathes work? Or am I about to drive myself off the road? \\n\\nIn any case--she prescribes me 3.75 Mgs a month. That's 15 0.25 pills. The bottle says two a day. Correct me if I am wrong, but two a day would last me exactly one week...not a month. And she doesn't always refill it on the month. Sometimes it's more like 6 weeks. \\n\\nHow to I go about getting more without seeming like a junkie? \\n\\nDoesn't this seem like  a ludicrous amount? I have friends who  have far less anxiety than me who only have prescriptions for traveling and such and they seem to get 60-100mgs at once. \\n\\nAm I delusional and should work with what I have? What are your doses like? \",\n",
       " \"I spent my morning in the ER today because I woke up with extreme back pain and was unable to feel part of my left leg. It's all numb in one area. The ER doctor gave me muscle relaxants and some pain meds and referred me to a neurologist because they suspect I have some nerve damage. My partner is out of town for the week and doesn't even know whats going on because he doesn't have access to internet or phone until after 8. I feel like I'm all alone right now with no one to comfort me. All of my friends and family live hours away and aren't here to support me. Does anyone else crave company when they're having an anxiety attack creeping up? I like being around others as support and a distraction. It makes it easier to keep those negative thoughts at bay. I just keep obsessing and worrying what if it's something serious? My mind is racing and jumping to all of these ideas, each one worse than the one before. Being around people or having a distraction helps me ignore those intrusive thoughts. Anyway, I guess I'm rambling now. Sorry.\",\n",

       " \"Hi this is my first post and I'm just so upset right now I feel the need to vent. I've dealt with anxiety and depression all my life. It has affected me in many ways. In my early years I've been told I was autistic, LD, and a problem child. I've been bullied all my life. During playtime in elementary I would have to go to some LD class and do work in there instead of playing so I made no friends. I got called weird and such, okay not too bad, but I still had no friends. My attempts to be friendly just ended in more bullying. Fast forward to middle school, no longer in LD classes but still bullied like crazy. People said I was a lesbian, and that I was born a boy. That I could handle I just tried to stay out of everyone's way. But the bigger guys at my school decided since everyone was saying I was born a boy that they could beat me up. That didn't end well for me. So by high school I just avoided everyone like the plague, I was alone but that was better than being picked on. Never went out with a group of girls, never went out and did anything really. Now I'm in cosmetology school, I decided to be friendly and talkative and to fight against my anxiety but I still felt left out and I didn't know why. People would walk away when I tried talking to them and little things like that. But then today this girl texts me saying everyone thinks there's something wrong with me, that I'm crazy. I ask her why they think that and she said it's just some of the little things you do. She said *girl in my class * was saying some things about me and judging me for some things. I mentioned that two girls in the class talk about/act like I do and no one thinks theyre crazy and she said that's because everyone loves them but everyone thinks they'res something wrong with you but you can talk to me any time. Now I'm contemplating not even going back. I feel like if I stepped foot in there I would have a panic attack and thinking about everyone talking about me bothers me so much I just don't know what to do. The rational me would say that they're probably just trying to get under my skin for no reason, or that she doesn't like the people in there and is trying to turn me against them but no matter how many times I tell myself that it still bothers me I'm on the verge of tears, I guess I have to go back to being alone again. \",\n",
       " \"Hi all.\\n\\nNew to this sub and I'm fucking terrified. I need some serious help.\\nBasically health anxiety is ruining my life and I'm scared I have cancer despite the multitude of other things that it could be. \\nIn July my wife and I lost a baby. I suffered serious depression. I was on a particularly stressful project at work and the same week we lost a mortgage application. I had to get another one sorted out. After a couple of weeks (mid August) started getting a pain in my lower right abdomen. When I went to the loo, I would see mucus. I went to a walk in clinic (uk) and had a supreme panic attack thinking my appendix had burst. The doctor felt my tummy, took my blood pressure, listened to my stomach and said that she thought it was ibs. She suggested I see my GP. \\nI then booked to see my doctor who basically suggested that I take a week off work because she also thought it was ibs. I took a week off and by Wednesday was panicking again. I went to see the doctor again and she too felt my tummy and said it was ibs. She suggested taking buscopan. \\nAt this point, (early September) my wife and I were in the process of buying a house and if I'm honest, I don't recall the ache being there all that much. Especially since my employer has moved me onto a different project. \\nInto October, we moved house and I was telling a guy at work about my fears for my review. I stressed out that they might fire me because of the stress issues. He said they had been great with him when he had bowel cancer. \\nSuddenly, the pain I had became more prominent again but this time on my left side. I had back ache, leg ache, headaches, and thought I looked slimmer in the mirror. The pains would move about. Sometimes lower abdomen, sometimes right, usually left. And I started to get constipation. People told me the weight loss was because I was cycling 2.3 miles to the station and again to get home as well as the mile long walk at the other end (so about 6.6 miles a day, four times a week).\\nFast forward to now, I have had a testicle check... All fine (since the pain would go into my groin), two doctors have checked my rectum and prostate... All fine. Blood test came back fine. \\nI'm 32 and terrified that I have colon cancer. In the last 6 days of worrying I've lost 4 lbs or so (without the cycling as I got a puncture). I have been forcing my food down as I've lost my appetite, I can't finish meals too much and it's only the last 3 days that my poops have become more regular. My doc said to put my mind at rest he'll sort a colonoscopy but says he doesn't think in his 20 years experience that it's cancer.\\nPlease, someone give me some reassurance. Has anyone had similar experiences.\\nMy concern is the weight loss. Can anxiety really make you lose weight even if you eat?\\n\\nThanks in advance\",\n",

I\\'ve been extremely anxious in both social situations and pointless everyday situations as well for about four years now. By pointless I mean that there are tons of irrational fears that I deal with. I over-analyze situations in my head and always say the wrong things. I have an immensely tough time saying what I feel and expressing myself because I\\'m terrified that it will come out sounding stupid. I usually just end up stammering out some garbage that I don\\'t even mean to say. I am by no means popular in high school, if that gives you any idea as to my social standings. I do have some friends, but I\\'m a completely different person around them. They only know me as the guy who\\'s funny but almost tries too hard to be so. I end up doing the same thing with my family but it\\'s a slightly different persona. I feel like i\\'m trapped inside this guy who doesn\\'t act anything like me, and I hate him. I hate myself for being that guy. I hate myself for never being able to do my homework or study even though it would be so easy to do. I hate myself for being stupid, even though I know, or at least I like to believe, that i\\'m intelligent. Every past relationship I\\'ve had, which isn\\'t much considering that i\\'m only 17, has lasted about a week. I always end up assuming the worst after every text and every meeting. \"Oh, she must hate me now.\" I think, \"I\\'m just too weird I can\\'t handle this.\" Almost every aspect of my life is dominated by these fears and irrational excuses that I make to avoid doing anything.\\n\\n The only reason I\\'ve decided to talk about it is because recently I\\'ve been staying up late unable to sleep because i\\'m either scared or over-thinking everything about my anxiety. This causes me to be late to school in the mornings which is fucking horrible. They stare at me as I come in and I just look to the ground, hoping to god that the teacher doesn\\'t make a remark.

He doesn\\'t give a shit that they love him and are hurt by what he does. My mother loves him unconditionally, so you can imagine how hard this has been for her. This brings me back to why I can\\'t tell anybody, but you\\'ve probably figured it out by now: I can\\'t have my problems become another issue that she has to deal with. The guidance counselors at my school probably have some parental disclosure thing, so that\\'s not an option.

       " 'Hi, I stumbled upon this group searching for some answers about GAD and itching. I have been having disruptive bouts with itchy skin for about 8 months. There have been times when I\\'ve felt about [ ] this close to a breakdown over it, and have often ended up crying and in a panic attack. \\n\\nI\\'ve gone through all the possible causes I can think of:\\n\\n- I thought it was dry skin for awhile, but no creams/soaps/lotions/etc. help even a little bit. \\n\\n- I thought it was environmental, some allergen at my home, so my husband and I gutted our apt. had the carpets cleaned, washed everything with sensitive laundry soap, and still no luck. Also made no sense that my husband has no symptoms like mine.\\n\\n- I finally went to my dr. and she thought it could be something I was eating... however this seemed very unlikely to me, as I have an extremely varied diet and I thought for sure I would have noticed if there was a link there. But, I did try to eliminate things I\\'d been eating more of, like coffee, and still no change.\\n\\nSo, long story short, I mentioned it to my sister, who replied, \"OH I had that too! It stopped after I finished school and quit my stressful job.\" !! \\n\\nI have had a pretty intense year... over a year ago, my other sister left home and cut off our family, so that has been stressful. I\\'ve felt very discontent at work for over two years, and finally decided to go back to school online to get my degree and get out—which hasn\\'t really helped with the situation presently, but has added extra stress/time constraints. I also recently saw my doctor about depression, probably induced by all these factors, and she subscribed 5-HTP which I have been taking for nearly three weeks now. \\n\\nSo with that new suggestion, I\\'ve begun to see strong links between my stress and anxiety level and the itching. Since taking 5-HTP I\\'ve still had some itching attacks, but they are much more manageable. When I can get out of my situation, take a walk, drive, watch TV, BREATHE, I start to feel better almost immediately. When I\\'m in the middle of an attack, I notice my breathing becomes short and I cannot concentrate. The one time I had significant relief with no attacks for a week was when I was sick on the tail end of taking time off from work—so I was out for almost two weeks straight, and NO itching during that time. \\n\\nMY QUESTION IS THIS: I find relief from taking Benadryl, because it calms me down, but makes me VERY drowsy. And I do not want to take it for a long period of time. I am taking the 5-HTP and meeting with a therapist to try to help, but this week after my first meeting I have had even more attacks of itching (even reading this group to find some answer had me scratching all over). \\n\\nTLDR: So what do you (those who have these same symptoms) do to manage it in the meantime? Topical medications? Oral meds? Something else? Is it OK to be taking Benadryl consistently for this? I just need some relief so I can work on getting to where I can manage this anxiety. \\n\\n',\n",

The video game in particular that has been causing me to feel this recently is Super Smash Bros for 3DS. It's typical smash bros, really fast and with a million things going on, and I think all the visual activity is just frying my brain. \\n\\nAnyone else felt like this playing a video game? \",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve been living with anxiety for the past two years now, mainly hypochondria. A few nights I realized I haven\\'t been dealing with any hypochondria or anxiety for about a month or so, and that\\'s great! Today I went to the pool with a friend. A little bit of water got in my nose about 3 times. I played around with my friend by stating the oh so fun fact that the \"brain-eating amoeba\" N.Fowleri can exist in improperly chlorinated pools. BAD IDEA. The water wasn\\'t really cold but we didn\\'t go in until around 5 or 6 on a hot day so I thought that\\'s a bit normal but now I can\\'t help but think maybe it\\'s warm cause it isn\\'t properly chlorinated (which I\\'m pretty sure the temp. of a pool and it\\'s chlorine is not related). N.Fowleri lives in warm water so that\\'s adding to my fear. I\\'m just sitting here trying not to panic and having a funny feeling in the back of my nose while I slowly freak out over having N.Fowleri in me. I\\'m pretty sure I don\\'t have it but I\\'m still freaking out a bit. I feel a little defeated too, I haven\\'t freaked out or had any hypochondriac type thoughts for about month and now that progress is gone.',\n",
       " \"Anyone else using these at night? If so, how are they going for you?\\n\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Uvex-S1933X-Eyewear-SCT-Orange-Anti-Fog/dp/B000USRG90/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356010453&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=uvex\\n\\n\\nFor anyone that's not familiar with the concept, it's said that the blue spectrum of light can stimulate the brain to where it can upset sleep and throw out circadian rhythms. The body needs darkness at night just as much as it needs an appropriate amount of sunlight during the day (you may of heard about darkness therapy). I'm not a specialist, so please google if you'd like to read more.\\n\\n\\nAnyway I decided to try these glasses to cut down blue light since I kept coming across this type of therapy. It was only 8 bucks for the glasses so no real loss if it didn't work. I've been using these glasses for a few months now and I thought I might share my experience with them.\\n\\n\\nOne thing I'm always suffering from is over-sensitivity to light, I've constantly got blotches in my vision like a camera flash went off even when I'm not looking directly at light. Something I noticed immediately with these glasses is that it really cut down that sensitivity. I could even look directly at light sources with no problems. On a side note I would have to say driving at night with these on is unbelievable, it doesn't really make things darker, it just seems to make it more comfortable looking at light, so when a car headlights are strong its not blinding. \\n\\nI wore these every night from sundown till when I went to bed. Now I don't know if it's a placebo effect or not (hard to tell with these things) but after a few weeks I found I felt more refreshed when I woke up (like I had a proper restful sleep). I've never had problems with sleeping even through my worst anxiety but you don't necessarily have to wake up or have interrupted sleep for it to be bad, so maybe something was happening for me during sleep that I wasn't aware of. \\n\\n\\nI at least felt more peaceful during the day that I could cope with anxiety issues better. Everything seemed to be working out pretty good. Now a word of warning for anyone looking to try this, I noticed after about a month and a bit of doing this at night, I started to feel a little anxious and depressed while wearing the glasses. It was weird, it felt like my body fretted for normal light/normal vision. I started feeling agitated in my orange world. \\n\\n\\nI think I found that I was overdoing the therapy, I was doing this every night from sundown till the moment I shut my eyes in bed. I think I didn't really have to do it that much, and when I started just wearing it maybe 2 hours before bed it seemed to relieve that issue and I still wake up feeling like I slept well. \\n\\n\\n**TL;DR:** My experience with these glasses was good, I wear them at night. Word of warning, don't wear them the whole night, just a few hours before bedtime is fine.\\n\",\n",

       " 'OK I am going to go ahead and apologize for the long wall of text you are going to get.  So I start off the day yesterday at about 5:30 am.  I get up and eat two bowls of cap\\'n crunch (I know, razor blades!!!) and everything seems ok.  At 7 am I take 30 mg of Vyvanse that my doc prescribed last week on Monday for anxiety and 500 mg of nabumetone for some pain I am having in my back and legs.  Again, everything seems ok.  Day isn\\'t bad.  Wife gets up and gets ready for work.  Everything is ok between my wife and I.  No problems there (that I know of) and she goes off to work.  \\n\\nAt about 8:30 or 9:00 am I go for a walk (about 1.5 miles) and talk to my mother (mostly just listening to her go on and on about nothing).  I get back from the walk feeling sweaty and take a quick shower.  So far I am feeling my usual anxious self and some depression but nothing really bad.  I am functional.  I am ok.  \\n\\nAt 10 am I take my \"morning medicine,\" which consists of 1 mg Xanax extended release, 40 mg of prilosec (for my terrible stomach acid), 800 mg of Gabapentin (again, for anxiety), and 25 mg of Seroquel (anxiety).  My day goes on.  Nothing bad happens to me.  No one yells at me.  Nothing goes wrong.  I am doing research on the internet, playing my 3DS, playing around with Blender 3D.  \\n\\nAt about 11:30 am I eat a bag of Reese\\'s cups.  I didn\\'t intend to eat as many as I did.  Probably 5 and a half servings of them.  I usually eat candy but not that much.  I am trying to cut back on sugary things because of my weight (about 210 lbs).  I think this was my obvious first mistake.  I don\\'t eat anything for lunch.  Just the candy.  \\n\\nAt 12:30 pm I start to feel tired.  This is when I do something new.  I drank an orange flavored \"5 hour energy.\"  I usually feel tired early afternoon and my doc didn\\'t have any advice for me so I went this route.  My wife thought it was a good entry point for someone who doesn\\'t regularly consume caffeine.  I feel ok.  I don\\'t go to sleep or anything.  I don\\'t feel super jacked up.  I just feel a little tired but nothing too bad.  My anxiety still isn\\'t over the top or anything.  The day goes on.  I spend time with my 3DS and talking to a friend on the internet. \\n\\n At about 3 pm I start experiencing pain in my pectoral area.  Not sure if it is muscular or what, but whenever I moved just a little bit I would feel pain on both sides.  I also notice that I am feeling a little more jittery than usual.  Anxiety is starting to build up.  I try really hard to focus on my game.  I think maybe it is just the caffeine (again, not that much.  Less than a cup of coffee) and go on. \\n\\n At 4 pm I take my day time medicines (seroquel 25 mg and gabapentin 800 mg again) and keep playing my game.  The pain is getting worse.  the anxiety is getting worse.  Everything is getting worse.  I am having trouble focusing.  Having trouble concentrating.  Not feeling well.  \\n\\nMy wife gets home at about 5 or 5:30 pm and is super happy that she got me some xmas presents from Target for a super good deal.  Wife is in a great mood.  She seems happy.  She is being super nice to me.  For some reason, though, every word she says upsets me.  I feel like even the smallest move she makes is going to make me start yelling.  I am super irritated and aggravated.  The pain is getting worse now and it is starting to move to the center of my chest.  I tell my wife I am not feeling well.  I try to just let it go and think about something else.  My wife has me put a pizza in the oven for her.  I didn\\'t put one in the oven for myself because I wasn\\'t feeling well and I didn\\'t know what was going on.  I keep stressing to my wife that I don\\'t feel well.  I tell her that maybe I want to go to the emergency room after I think about it for a minute.  She goes, \"that bad?!\", and then doesn\\'t really talk too much about it.  She does ask, \"what do you think they can do?\", which is something that has been going on in my head for a while now.  The pain is pretty intense now.  The anxiety is way high.  Every small sound and movement in the house seems like it is specifically engineered to infuriate me.  I sit down on the couch and watch Hotel Impossible with my wife.  The pain is bad.  Strong burning sensation in my chest.  I feel like maybe I am dying.  This doesn\\'t feel like heart burn.  I know it can\\'t be a heart attack.  I start to think that maybe I am having a panic attack.  My wife looks over and sees me in pain and checks on me.  I tell her I want to go to the emergency room.  \\n\\nWe end up going.  The ER is only about a mile from my house.  We get in there and it is a long wait.  I tell them I am having chest pain and I feel like I am dying.  They take my vitals and hook me up to an EKG and check on my heart.  Everything is normal except for my blood pressure.  It was a bit high, but the nurse said it was normal for someone in an agitated state like I was.  Then I wait.  I am starting to feel some discomfort in my stomach now on top of the pain in my chest.  I ask my wife to find me something to eat.  She disappears for a while and then comes back with a small bag of chips, a pack of crackers, and a bag of cheez-its.  I eat the bag of chips and some of the crackers.  After eating, I was starting to feel a little better.  The burning in my chest was starting to go away.  I wait in the emergency room for hours.  No doctor visit.  I play my 3DS for a while.  I realize that I could probably just go home now and call my doctor tomorrow. \\n\\n After waiting 3 hours to see the doctor, I end up leaving the ER and just going home and going to bed.  This wasn\\'t heartburn.  I have had heartburn before.  That is not what this was.  I don\\'t think being hungry had a causal link to all the shit I was experiencing.  I have been hungry before.  This hasn\\'t happened before.  Did the panic attack pass as I was eating and calming down?  Was I suffering from low blood sugar?  High blood sugar?  Was it the 5 hour energy?  Was it the Vyvanse?  Why would I have chest pain 5 hours after drinking a 5 hour energy.  Why would I have chest pain and all these problems after I was getting near the end of the half life on my Vyvanse.  Why did I start to feel better?  What the hell happened?\\n\\nI am a 30 year old man diagnosed with a bunch of psych stuff.  I live in the US (if you couldn\\'t tell by my measurements in the post).  My doctor told me in my last visit (monday last week) that I was going to start ECT soon.  The Vyvanse was an attempt by the doctor to at least hold me over until the ECT got started.  I hadn\\'t taken a psycho stimulant before.  I am not taking any recreational or illegal drugs.  I am taking my medications exactly as prescribed by my doctor.  I do not smoke.  I do not drink alcohol.\\n\\nWhat happened?  Thank you for reading my insanely long post.  I apologize for the typos that you will read.  I hate proofreading.\\n\\nEDIT 1: Formatting to make post easier to read.  Also, I have contacted my doctor\\'s office and am waiting to hear back.  I spoke with his medical assistant who said I had a panic attack and to stop taking the Vyvanse.',\n",

       " 'First off, I sincerely apologize for the wall of text, but there is quite a bit I want to get off of my mind. I have talked to people I know, and I would like thoughts from a broader audience, and I just found this sub.\\n\\nI am a 24 year old male. I have a girlfriend of six years who makes a decent living and everything about my life is above average. I\\'m finishing up my first year of law school. I\\'ve noticed that, within the past year, my anxiety has hit an all-time high. I\\'ve always been an anxious person, but it has been generally manageable. This is different. This is affecting my grades and my relationship. I should also note, for the sake of disclosure, that I have been diagnosed with ADHD when I was seven years old. I did not receive medication until I was 22 because of my parents. At 22, I received a low dosage of Adderall, and I went from a C student to a straight-A student. I could actually focus. It was amazing and has been extremely helpful. I should also note that my anxiety is still there if I don\\'t take the Adderall (I tried this because I thought the Adderall was the culprit). I have also done recreational drugs before. I smoke weed once in a while, and it helps me relax. I have done Acid once, years ago. I have done a few pain killers recreationally, but nothing recently. I smoke cigarettes occasionally, and I like good beer. I hardly ever drink during the week, though. I have also, in the past, had a prescription for Ambien and Xanax to help me sleep. I have had sleeping problems for as long as I can remember. I like being awake at night, which screws me up when I have to wake up at 6:00AM for class.\\n\\nOk, first off - a year ago I had just graduated with my bachelor\\'s degree. I had a hard time finding a job, but I finally found one working in tech support for a company that treated its tech support staff like garbage. But, $9/hr, even if I was being treated like crap, was better than $0/hr. I spent six months at that job, and progressively got more and more unhappy and anxious. I felt like I was going nowhere and nothing I could do would make my supervisors happy, so I stopped doing any more than the bare minimum. It was during this six months that I decided to apply to law school, which I ended up getting into. So I quit that job. Not long after I quit that job, I had a huge falling out with a good friend of mine, who \"took\" three of my other friends with him, which didn\\'t help things. But I just told myself that I knew who my real friends were, and let it go.\\n\\nNow to law school. Law school is hard, and there\\'s a lot of homework and social interactions. The insane homework load caused me to literally freak out if I didn\\'t get it done RIGHT AWAY because I was afraid that I would forget something if I didn\\'t. Normally, this sounds like a good way to do your homework, but it quickly got to the point that if I didn\\'t get EVERYTHING done RIGHT AWAY, I would fret over it to the point of loosing sleep or becoming irritable with my girlfriend, which caused fights and even more lost sleep and anxiety. This anxiety about my homework has spilled over into every aspect of my life. I get anxious about unimportant things that I need to do, because I feel like I will forget about them and they will never get done. I would become anxious that I would end up pissing my girlfriend off if I did something, anything, wrong. When she acted at all abnormal, I would freak out and demand to know what I did wrong. This usually doesn\\'t end well and I hate it. We love each other very much. I seriously don\\'t know what I\\'d do without her and it kills me when we fight over something I can\\'t seem to control. \\n\\nNow, on top of these problems, my social anxiety has hit an all time high. I have an insanely hard time talking to anyone outside of my girlfriend, my close friends that I\\'ve had since high school, and my parents. The best way I can possibly describe what goes through my head every time I have a conversation with anyone outside of my normal circle is\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say something stupid. You\\'re not talking enough, no talk more. It\\'s silent, stop the silence. Now stop talking, they obviously don\\'t like you. But they have to like you. Don\\'t bring up that topic, why the hell would you do that? Now they think you\\'re stupid. Wow your voice sounds really weird. You just mispronounced that word. What were you thinking about just now? That one word, oh yea. Now they don\\'t understand what you were just saying. Holy fuck man can\\'t you even finish a simple thought? No wonder everyone you meet thinks you\\'re retarded. Does everyone really think I\\'m retarded? Now it\\'s silent again and they think you\\'re an asshole and don\\'t want to talk to them. Wait, were they talking to me or someone behind me? Ugh, I really would like to weigh in my opinion but they\\'ll just think it\\'s stupid. You should make small talk. What is small talk? The weather? That\\'s stupid. Whatever. Oh yes, the weather. Ok that\\'s over with, what now? Awkward silence. Holy shit, this is awkward. Look at the ceiling. Look out the window. Pretend to check something on your phone. Oh wait, that will make them think you\\'re rude. Put your phone away, even though they probably just noticed I didn\\'t actually check anything on my phone so now they think I\\'m just rude and now it\\'s been awkward for like ten minutes.\" when in reality it had probably been all of 30 seconds. \\n\\nAnd this is what happens almost every single time I\\'m trying to talk to someone I don\\'t know. I have rare times of clarity and anxiety-free social interactions, but they are few and far between. People have noticed that I\\'ve gotten worse at this, too. The one thing that has been making me worse has been when people ask  \"why?\" or tell me I need to \"confront my fear,\" like I haven\\'t tried, or that I \"should be ok\" or \"you\\'re life is so great. It\\'s so much better than most people\\'s lives. People would kill to have what you have. Why are you so anxious? What do you have to be so unhappy about?\"\\nIt\\'s like, yes, I get it, I suck at interacting with people. I suck at being normal. I can\\'t make small talk. Yes, I know that\\'s a bad thing. Yes, you\\'re right, I should try harder. I\\'m not doing enough to fix this. Yep, you\\'re right, I can\\'t be a lawyer if I can\\'t talk to people. Yes, I understand that I\\'ll never get ahead in life. Yes, I basically suck as a person. \\n\\nAnd then I tell myself, everyday, that the stuff I\\'m worrying about is normal. That I shouldn\\'t worry so much. I have a good life. Stop thinking about that. That won\\'t happen. Stop being sad, you have nothing to be unhappy about. Look at your life. You\\'re fine. You could be poor. you could have a crappy car. You could have shitty parents. You could have a terrible girlfriend.\\n\\nYet, all the logic in the world doesn\\'t make it go away.\\nAll I want to do is enjoy my life again. I remember enjoying life, and I\\'m not right now. There\\'s ups and downs, but it used to be normal for me to enjoy life.\\n\\nSo, I\\'m sorry if this sounded like a rant or something, but I would just like to know if I\\'m seriously messed up or if I\\'m normal and have nothing to worry about. Any responses are appreciated. Thanks!',\n",

But nonetheless, I have what are seemingly heart attacks and christ do they scare teh shit out of me. Nothing more unsettling than confronting your own death. I\\'ve been doing that daily now for the past couple of weeks. Over the past year i\\'ve had more than a handful of really bad episodes where all I can do is reluctantly accept my death. But i always seem to live.\\n\\nI \"feel funny\" which procedes to a heaviness or burning or pain in chest which procedes to difficulty or inability to swallow and shortness of breath which in turn leads to dizziness, shaking and flushing. In other I constantly feel like im having a freaking heart attack. Its only been recently that I\\'ve considered that i might be having panic attacks. This is a weird idea to me because I always thought that panic attacks were for \"those\" people who let things get to them. I don\\'t let things get to me, but here I am having panic attacks or something.\\n\\nWhat do I do? What can I do to cut the frequency of these things down? How do I prevent myself from passing out because I\\'m so terrified that im having a heart attack that I forget how to breath? Nothing is scarier that nearly passing out in the midst of a persumed heart attack.',\n",

       " 'Hello everyone.  I just wanted to share with you my experience of anxiety and how I feel like I\\'m starting to take control and I hope that some of it will benefit you all.  \\n\\nI never really had anxiety much until I was 23 and in the military.  Believe it or not, I feel like most of my anxiety can be traced back to when I was getting promoted at a ceremony that was supposed to be exciting.  I never had an issue with crowds or being the center of attention- I was so excited for this event!  So I\\'m up there in front of approximately 100 people standing at attention (Standing straight with arms to the side;not moving).  I start shaking a little bit; I\\'ve had my normal 5 cigarettes and Monster energy drink by this time of the day (9am).  I think nothing of the shakes and continue to wait my turn to get promoted.  As I\\'m waiting I notice the shakes get worse- it\\'s not just my legs anymore, now I can feel my back starting to quiver, taking away from the picture perfect sailor (spare me the Navy jokes, I\\'ve heard them all :D) I had always been.  I break my thousand-yard stare only to see other people watching, nudging the person next to them to look at me, thinking WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY??  I fight this feeling I have, heart racing, breathing constricted- determined to stay as still as possible for this event.  At this point my back is spasm-ing, legs shaking- I\\'m a fucking mess.  I made it through the ceremony somehow, as people walked by to congratulate me some asked if I was okay, some smirked, and of course all my friends teased me relentlessly about it.  This small event will go on to define the next few years.\\n\\nThe teasing subsided after a few days, and it was business as normal.  Other people got awards in front of the squadron and I stood at attention just fine for them in the crowd watching them, wishing I could have kept my composure for my big day.  I was then due to receive an award for my outstanding service for an inspection we had.  Many others were to receive commendation as well, so I was in the third row receiving the award.  I stood there anxiously while everybody crowded the hangar to observe the ceremony.  My heart started racing, muscles shaking again- I knew this dreaded feeling all too well.  I had to leave.  Luckily I managed to get out of it by telling my superior that I could NOT stand there, and I was allowed to wait outside.  I went to see a doctor after this incident.\\n\\nThe doctor told me I had an essential tremor that was made worse by stress and anxiety and I was prescribed propanolol.  I didn\\'t notice many benefits while taking it but I could tell by the horrible feelings when I missed a dose.  I continued taking it regardless.  After disgracing myself twice through these awards I started thinking that \"What if I have a panic attack simply watching others get an award\".  The Captain Picard of my brain replied \"Make it so\".. and simply from thinking that thought I caused myself to have anxiety while not being the center of attention.  Damnit, Picard.  \\n\\nEvery time an award was to take place, I was nowhere to be found.  Avoiding the feelings I dreaded most.  At this point, I ONLY had anxiety at award ceremonies. \\n\\nFast forward 4 years, I volunteer to go to Iraq (to avoid doing another deployment on a boat).  No anxiety that any normal person wouldn\\'t have during this deployment.  Everything was business as usual for me.  Turns out the U.S. was leaving Iraq 5 months after I got there.  We were faced with the choice of either going back to the U.S. (where my Navy contract would expire and I would be a civilian again), or take reassignment to Afghanistan.  I chose Afghanistan.  While in Afghanistan I was able to take 2 weeks of \"vacation\".  The military puts you on a plane and sends you where you want to go.  I returned home.  Spent two weeks with my family and on my flight from XXX-Atlanta (where I would return to Kuwait, and ultimately- Afghanistan) I had a panic attack on the tarmac headed to the runway.  My irrational mind contemplated telling them to turn around, or even just running out the emergency exit.  I was terrified.  \\n\\nI arrived to Atlanta airport and sought the doctor there, as I had 9 hours until my next flight.  I kept thinking that if I had a panic attack on my last flight, this next leg of my trip would be unbearable as it was a 14 hour flight.  I was prescribed Xanax.  ZZZzzzZZZ all the way to Afghanistan.\\n\\nWhile back in Afghanistan all I could do was dwell on this horrible incident.  Why did this happen to me again?  Was this going to be a recurring event?  I\\'ve wanted to be a pilot since I was a child and planned on flight school after this- can I still do that?  Hundreds of questions about myself ran through my mind.  I met with a counselor in Afghanistan and was prescribed Prozac.\\n\\nThe counselor helped a little bit, and I\\'m not entirely sure if the medication helped at all because I still felt anxious.  Keep in mind that I was never involved in a direct gun fight with the enemy.  Once again I felt horrible because here I am in this horrible place and I have anxiety not war-related.  Granted there were a few close calls- a group of rockets passed between 10-20 feet over my head while I was working at a guard shack.  I calculated that from the distance they were fired from had they aimed just a few centimeters lower, I might have been hit.  I\\'m thankful that I wasn\\'t.  We also got mortared- a lot.  That\\'s scary because you never know where they are going to hit until they land.  Your body adapts and you become used to it to a certain extent.  I did receive my award for service over there though with the help of Xanax.\\n\\nThe flight to the U.S. did not bother me when I left.  I guess I was so excited to come home that I forgot that I was supposed to be afraid of flying now.  I returned home and everything was fine and I separated from the military and returned home for civilian life.  I had big plans though.  \\n\\nMy fiance and I moved to Florida where I would attend college and take flight training to satisfy my goal of being a pilot.  While very heavy on the wallet- I flew.  I was very good at it and not once did I experience the anxiety that I once knew all too well.  Life was great.  \\n\\nUntil Christmas break.  During the few weeks off of school from the beginning of December until early January I had time to think- too much time.  I played a lot of video games and didn\\'t really do a whole lot with myself except think.  I was in the Navy Reserves and had a similar panic attack at an award ceremony one weekend- can\\'t stand still, back tremors, the works.  This got me to thinking.  If I still have that issue, what if I have a panic attack on the plane?  What if I have a panic attack while getting a haircut or something crazy like that?  Well, the good ole Captain Picard \"made it so\".  I could barely keep my head still getting my hair cut that weekend, and I was heavily medicated on the flight to and from home.\\n\\nBack to Florida, time to fly again.  I flew once, when I got back and decided I could not do it anymore.  I was on the verge of a full blown panic attack for the entire training flight.  Much to my dismay I dropped out of the flight training course citing \"lack of funds\".  So here I am in Florida, not flying, embarrassed, ashamed.  What was I to do?  I kept going to school and thought of back up plans.  \\n\\nNavy reserve weekend again, it was a Sunday and I was determined to get the hell out of the place before I had another panic attack at the normal ceremony.  I said I was sick and left early.  On the 2 hour drive back home I had a panic attack on the interstate.  Great, now I associated driving, getting a hair cut, and a slew of other things with fear.\\n\\nI missed a lot of class that semester, failed a class, and was actually house-ridden for about a week and a half.  I refused to get in a car or go anywhere.  I decided to call the local VA Hospital and schedule an appointment.  I need help and I knew it.  The first thing the VA wanted to do was give me medication.  I didn\\'t want to take medication as the onset of the problem was quite rapid for the most part, so I was determined to get through it without medication.  But they prescribed it anyways and I took it home and took 1 dosage of this SSRI.  They also set me up with an appointment at a Veteran Center- not run by the VA, but there to support Veterans.  I went to this appointment the next day and met with a counselor there who has thus far given me so much help I don\\'t think I could ever repay her.\\n\\nShe was an alternative-medicine type therapist and helped me talk some things out and give me some coping strategies.  She taught me a technique called EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) that involves tapping on certain points to calm oneself down.  It actually works, sometimes fast, sometimes it takes time, but it works.  That, combined with the coping strategies, got me on my feet and out the door again.  \\n\\nFor the year or so after that, it was a combination of meeting with her, but also trying to find \"The Cure\" to my problem on the side.  I think we\\'ve all been there.  The Cure, doesn\\'t exist for most.  I tried looking at vitamin deficiencies, random herb pills that worked short-term at best and all sorts of other things.  I didn\\'t find my Cure.  If you\\'ve read this far, I doubt you have either.  \\n\\nThe past year or so has been a rollercoaster- some days I would be on top of the world, others- anxiety through the roof.  Through 2 books I\\'ve been reading, and my counselors help, I have finally got on the road to recovery.  The books are called \"At Last a Life: Anxiety and Panic Free\" by Paul David and \"Hope and Help for Your Nerves\" by Dr. Claire Weekes.  Just for the record I am not affiliated with them and am not making a cent should you buy their E-books on Amazon (which you can read on your cell phone, as well).\\n\\n I know I\\'ll have days where I am an emotional wreck but through these books and my session, I have learned to not fear fear.  It has been my biggest struggle.  That, and projecting my fear onto future events which eventually come true because that how I pictured they would.  Now, I welcome every bit of anxiety because it gives me another chance to prove to myself that I can do it.  Every time I welcome these feelings, I feel them lose their strength on my life just a little bit.  All of this didn\\'t happen overnight.  Some of it did, after reading a few chapters of the books before bed I would feel more equipped to handle the day\\'s stresses and challenges but I faltered occasionally. \\n\\nI\\'m not 100% and I\\'m not sure if I ever will be.  I\\'ve given up on trying to be \"the person I was before all this\", because that person doesn\\'t exist any more.  That person hasn\\'t gone through the trials that I (or you) have.  All we can try to do is be a stronger person than we were yesterday.  I will warn you, though- it involves getting out of your comfort zone.  Take baby steps.  For me it was like \"Okay, I\\'m going to find a barber I\\'m comfortable with, and go there for a while\".  Believe me, once you start doing things that you never thought you could do again, you will realize how little power anxiety has over you.  \\n\\nI haven\\'t done any more flight training- I have a baby on the way and realized that everything happened for a reason.  I like to think that God planned it out for me that way, or the universe knew that being a pilot wasn\\'t a sustainable career for me at this point in my life (new FAA laws/subpar pay).  I do want to finish getting my pilot licenses at some later point in life but I realized that there\\'s no point in dwelling on  things I haven\\'t done or achieved because I have different things to achieve at this point in time.\\n\\nI realize this was long, and I did not intend that.  I also realize that not many will read this whole thing.  I just wanted to put it all out there and maybe if I somehow helped just one person I\\'ll be overjoyed.    I am also getting married in a week, which is similar to the situations that I got anxious for, but I met with my counselor today and between scheduling the appointment last week, and meeting with her, I realized I have nothing to be afraid of.  \\n\\nI wish nothing but the best for all of you dealing with anxiety and hope that you all can find peace with it.\\n\\nTL;DR\\nYou can conquer anxiety.',\n",

       " \"Hi. So, I have *very* bad social anxiety. It controls my life, made me drop out of school, lose all my friends, quit my job, etc. etc. A lot of those things happened because of chronic pain, too, but I feel like without SA I would have possibly pushed through.\\n\\nAnyways, I am sick of living this way and it brings me to tears almost every day. I want to be able to go out and do social things without worrying about what others might think of me, so I decided to push myself and volunteer. I volunteer two days a week for several hours somewhere that I am very passionate about.\\n\\n.. And every day I'm there, it is hell. Even the night before drives me nuts because I dread it so much. The things that (I think) make me anxious the most is going on the bus (I hate waiting at the stop because it gives me time to worry. Several times I haven't been able to put the ticket in the slot because I shake so bad, the bus driver has even taken it from me and put it in himself, and I hate the thought of sitting beside anyone, or opening the door on my way out.. it's ridiculous). As well as that, I am nervous about the time I spend at the place I volunteer at. The people there are around my age (big red flag, I'm way more comfortable around people way older as I feel they don't care as much), and I have to interact with them fairly often when I'm there which basically makes me want to puke.\\n\\nI love the volunteer position to death. It is the only place in my area where I can do what I'm passionate about, and I don't want to fuck this up, but I am scared that I might have pushed myself too far and my anxiety will continue to get worse. I have been there for 1 1/2 months now, and I've probably gone there a total of 10-15 times. No one even knows my name, which is okay, but I'm sincerely scared they think I'm mentally retarded (my stuttering when I do manage to talk), sketchy (my constant shaking or nervous look), or maybe they just think I'm arrogant as hell which is clearly not the case.\\n\\nIf I decide to stop going, all social interaction I ever have with strangers goes out the window, and there's a good chance I won't be able to volunteer at this place again because there's a 6 month minimum commitment and lots of people try to get in. I should add I also need this for my resume because it's completely empty at this point, but without people there even knowing my name, it seems pointless.\\n\\nAlso, I know it seems obvious that I need professional help, and I agree, but I don't have a family doctor, so I need to go to a walk-in clinic for a referral, and *of course* I'm way too anxious to go. So I want to do things to help me in the meantime. I've tried an anxiety group (no help), reading up on and practicing 'mindfulness', as well as breathing exercises. Nothing's really helped and I can't tell if I'm getting worse or staying the same.\\n\\nSorry for the wall of text.. this is just something I'm almost constantly thinking of.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** do I keep going to volunteer somewhere that I love, but absolutely despise the way it makes me feel anxiety-wise? The position is very important to me for several reasons, but I'm scared it's making my SA worse. Without it though, I have basically no social interaction, and I may not be able to go back when my anxiety is better.\",\n",

       " '**Some background**\\n\\nI had a heck of a week last week. My anxiety tends to be a small grumble most of the time, but it increases exponentially as stress increases, and snowballs on itself. I was supposed to buy a car, but the co-worker I was supposed to purchase it from got sick for all of last week. I was supposed to keep in my budget, but my control issues got the better of me and I failed at that. I had issues plotting my future. I didn\\'t go to my court-assigned work service because I forgot suitable pants.\\n\\nSo last week was fun.\\n\\nI got over it though. I kept my attitude even and was happy most of the time.

I was ecstatic.\\n\\nThen my dad posted something on Facebook. The pledge of allegiance as it exists today with the whole \"REAL AMERICANS WILL REPOST\" bullshit at the bottom of it. I did a quick Google and found an article about its origins. I posted it as a comment, and of course he got defensive and we went back and forth a bit. I tried to keep it civil, but he kept going for the pot-shots, accusing me of all sorts of being-in-cahoots-with \"that Kenyan Obama\" and my \"Mexican friends\".

After reading this Ask Reddit thread : \\n\\nAVOID READING IF YOU'RE A HYPOCHONDRIAC\\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1l4wi8/schizophrenics_of_reddit_when_and_how_did_you/\\n\\nI'm worried because I have some symptoms of this that could also be labeled as anxiety.  To clear it up, I don't hear voices, I don't have hallucinations, I'm 26 (slightly past the point of onset for males).  However I do get paranoid about things sometimes (see the people in the thread with Paranoid Schizophrenia).  Like the other day I bought a video card from Best Buy, ended up returning it for another one and then ended up returning that one for a different one (none of them provided me with the graphic performance I was looking for).  For the next day or two I was concerned they thought I was doing fraudulent returns or something and were going to call the police.  Unrelated to that, even driving to work/school whatever, if a cop starts following me I get worried, it's mostly anxiety over being arrested (I have no reasons as to why I would, aside from a bad driving record).  The anxiety is mostly due to being constrained, you know a panic attack makes you feel like you need to get away (fight or flight) and being detained would obviously prevent that.  Now to clarify, I don't feel like the police/government/whatever is out to get me by any means (as a diagnosed Paranoid Schizophrenic would).  I just get nervous over stupid things like that.  I just want some sort of re-enforcement that these feelings are typical of Anxiety and that I'm normal.  \\n\",\n",

I had been meaning to talk to someone for the past 6 months or so.\\n\\n\\nAnd what I get anxious about is whether he loves me or not and he is he\\'s happy, if he\\'s going to leave, etc. Then, what\\'s *even worse* is that I freak out because I\\'m freaking out and apologize a bunch.\\n\\n\\nAnyways, the past week has been hell.

Anyways, he wasn\\'t awake, so I had woken up him to tell him this. We talked for like 15 minutes, and then said he should go because he needs to study which makes sense. I wasn\\'t upset on the phone call, I was just telling him. Honestly, the whole time the situation was surreal.

The irony here is that being high causes her to have more anxiety and she doesn't enjoy the high at all, but it helps more than anything else does with her stomach issues.

My symtoms include the following\\nI have regular panic attacks, for no real reason I get head aches almost every day, numerous times through out the day my balance is pretty bad, but I have had it looked at and they didn't think anything was wrong with it I jumble my words up a lot, so if I think about saying Great or Fantastic sometimes the word 'Grantastic' will come out, rather than just picking up. reading has become a lot more difficult, and I can't seem to comprehend what I'm looking at. And I think about death nearly all day. I am genuinely, 100% convinced I am dying.\\nDoes anybody else experience this? I have been to the doctor, and mentioned a few symptoms but usually what happens when im at the doctor is I don't feel as anxious anymore because I am in a safe place, so the rational side of my brain tells me not to worry about the headaches or dizziness because it's all in my head but as soon as I leave the surgery im so mad at myself for not requesting scans or more tests or just generally mad at the doctor for not picking up on it.\\nMy anxiety is pretty bad. I hate public transport, not because it's incompetent but because there are so many people. I hate busy roads, like i mean i get very very stressed out crossing the street. Supermarkets are my worst nightmare. I even get very tense walking past gas stations. My mind is constantly flooded with awful thoughts of how I'm probably going to die any second and I'm very aware of threats around me and try to avoid them at all costs.\\nAre the above symptoms anything to be worried about?

I have anxiety, it does affect me in social situations generally, some places much worse than others, a lot of times I don't even appear to have it at all though like gym as I feel confident in that environment. Anyway, the place where it most affects me is when it comes to dating, so much so it's never really been possible. I dated one girl (who I still have some contact with) when I was 15 almost 16. It was not a good experience, didn't even kiss her apart from on the cheek. So technically I've never really kissed anyone or had sex. I would never tell anyone because people would be shocked. I'm not a bad looking guy, I'm in really good shape (I spend a lot of time in the gym, it vents frustration) I do get a fair amount of interest from women, I think most people think I'm pretty experienced. People would just think I was weird if they knew I hadn't dated really at all. \\n\\nI think the anxiety derives a lot from fear of 'doing it wrong', whether that be kissing, sex etc etc. At 23 I know women expect you to be experienced and know what you're doing and not like a 14 year old fumbling around.

Just bear with me, alright?\\n\\nI came to that possibility when I looked back on my eating habits and bathroom trips. Normal eating, I've actually been eating and drinking more since my doctor wanted me to gain weight. But I noticed I was urinating a bit more than I usually do (I went maybe about six to seven times the day before? There were times I went but there really wasn't anything to pass to be considered significant urination.)  So that all kinda scared me a bit. It didn't help I began paying extra attention to each time I went afterwards, adding the stress.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the weight loss, I told my mom and she blamed it on things from fluctuation to a fast metabolism. But I don't get how my metabolism suddenly kicks in like that and starts burning things at a much higher rate than normal. So that didn't help my case much.\\n\\nLater on that day I also begin to notice I'm becoming a little itchy in several spots (mainly on my arm) and that there's a slight tingling sensation I'm feeling in my left foot. A very faint one, just in that particular foot and sometimes in the leg. None of these things alleviated my fears. The tingling sort of went away at times, mainly when I tried to relax, but its back today.\\n\\nI haven't lost anymore weight past 151, in fact I woke up yesterday morning and saw myself at 153. And now this morning it was right back at 152, even after eating and drinking like I was all week, significantly more than I usually do, and I've noticed I've been burning it off faster than usual. So that sorta put me back on the spot today.\\n\\nPart of me thinks I really am beginning to obsess and panic, another part still maintains it could be more than anxiety and I just want someone to tell me how it looks from their angle.

I had set a deadline, and been telling everyone that I would finish the master's by September, but started to realize that sticking to this plan would take a huge toll on my mental health, and the few coping strategies I'd developed for my anxiety &amp; depression would probably fall into significant disuse.\\n\\nUp until this point I was strongly averse to medication, and had put all of my energy into trying various mindfulness or cognitive techniques (quite a lot of meditation, have been reading about ACT, but have never made a strong attempt at CBT). Finally, over that weekend I re-watched [this video](http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/drugs) and decided that my current attempts weren't getting the results I had hoped for, and so it was time to try something new. On the Monday I scheduled an appointment with an on-campus doctor. She initially (without a whole lot of inquiry or digging) wrote up a script for Zoloft, but I mentioned that I had read up on Lexapro, and wanted to try it, so she wrote a new one without giving it a second thought. I had my first dose by 7pm that night.\\n\\nThe first week that I was on 10mg of Cipralex was really, *really* shitty for me. I was sleeping in past 10am (which is easier because I almost always work from home), and had zero motivation to do any sort of work on my research. I cancelled several social activities, including plans for the coming weekend, and looking back it's hard to even remember what I did, besides feeling like crap and beating myself up for feeling like crap. \\n\\nI think 3 things kept me from giving up on the meds at that time:\\n\\n* Hearing some stories, either here or on other forums, about people having really high stress/anxiety when they first get on the meds.\\n* Not being sure if this was caused by the meds themselves, or if I'd starting taking them just the nick of time, and that first weekend was just the tip of a particularly depressing &amp; shitty iceberg.\\n* Hearing the guys from Penny Arcade talking about how it changed their lives (and their co-workers').\\n\\nSo that was Week 1. And throughout that whole time, I don't think I got to sleep before 1am, and would often wake up 3-4 times a night, which was extremely unusual for me. I was also getting some mild stomach issues for the first 2-3 days, where I was only eating about half of what I usually do, then feeling full/gassy. \\n\\nBy week 2 I stepped up to 20mg as per my prescription, and was starting to accept that I probably wasn't going to finish the master's by September, and that this is going to be a time when I need to seriously shift my priorities, and focus on getting better. Still having difficulties sleeping, still sleeping in just as late. Still making little or no progress on my research, but starting to change my mindset and not be so hard on myself about that.\\n\\nBy last week I started taking my dose in the morning instead of dinner time, with the small hope that that would reduce the insomnia. It didn't. I met with my doctor and explained the low mood I'd gone through the first week, and she suggested upping the dosage to 40mg, which I told her I wasn't really comfortable with, so she kept it at 20. By the end of the week, when I got the new prescription I mentioned to the pharmacist that I was still having difficulty sleeping, despite the morning dosage. She suggested switching to late evening, and I've been trying that since Friday, with no real change in ability to get to sleep (which, if you haven't already picked up on, is a bit of a concern for me). \\n\\nOn the bright side, this past week the amount of worrying, and random thoughts going through my head *feel* like they've gone down substantially. I'm noticing this when I do sit down to meditate, and I find that I can read a page in a book without thinking about what I should eat for lunch next Thursday. So there are some definite pros, to go with the main downside of not getting more than 4-5 hours of crappy, intermittent sleep, and often feeling like I just want to snooze for another 2-3 hours when my alarm goes off.\\n\\nTwo questions I have for you fine folks:\\n\\n* Has anyone experienced insomnia, but had it subside over time without the addition of some other medication?\\n* Is my concern about my doctor's willingness to change prescriptions at the drop of a hat (which I perceive as a lack of scrutiny), a valid one, or am I just getting anxiety about the person who's trying to help me be less anxious?\",\n",

You\\'d be surprised how powerful acceptance truly is. The moment you try to even remotely push your anxiety away is the moment anxiety will ask, \"What\\'s for dinner? This snack you just fed me was delicious!\" Good luck trying to get anxiety to leave anytime soon after. No worries, just realize you\\'ve accidentally given it a snack, and wait until it decides to leave. If you try to throw anxiety out of the door, it will just come back even more pissed and ready to fuck up your shit. Hope this helps. As a beginner, I recommend just simple breath meditation and watching how the breath moves, especially in relation to different mind states. Once you are more capable of concentration, you\\'ll get better and better at letting any thought or emotion come and go for a cup of tea. Sometimes it can turn into hours of tea. The most important thing to remember is this: the only way to truly let something go is to first allow it to be there. Only then when you are able to dive into the vast jungle of demonic ugliness can you grow power through understanding and cultivated awareness. How can we let go of something we cannot see?\"',\n",

       " 'Okay, I will start from the very beginning. When I started at secondary school I didn\\'t know a soul. I came from a primary school out of town and so everyone else already knew each other. It was hard to make friends because they already had friends from their schools. It was difficult to find people who actually gave me a chance to speak and get to know them. As a result I never really had many friend. Half way through the first term of year 7 the bullying began. Kids found out I was from a private school and so they picked on me. By half way through the year it got so bad I changed forms from 7E to 7B to get away from it. That was fine but it meant making new friends. Made a couple but bullying still went on as it spread around the whole year.\\nBy year 9 the bullying had got even worse. I was a late developer and so I wasn\\'t exactly looking like a girl as much as everyone else. This meant (of course) that everyone (by this time everyone knew everyone so word spread fast) picked on me for being a \"man\". It doesn\\'t sound that bad but people held signs up in lessons saying I was a man, they would shout all manor of insults to me all the time, they pushed me over in the corridors and they made me feel terrible. they signed petitions and handed them too me telling me I should kill myself. There was one part of the school which was a blind spot from the CCTV and so a group of lads would wait there for me to pass, they would grab me and grope me because \"they wanted to see if I was growing boobs yet\" which of course I wasn\\'t.\\nYear 10 and 11 were equally shitty and by this time I was finally becoming more like a woman! I hated my life, one day I very nearly jumped off a cliff near my house but the only thing that stopped me was knowing there wouldn\\'t be anyone to feed the cat. Instead I chose to self harm. I was and still am haunted by nightmares of school.\\nSo sixth form started, I relocated and moved to a different town all together that was about 3 hours away from my old town. I suffered from panic attacks and break downs as I struggled to fight through my anxiety. I just assumed the same thing would happen again. I had counselling for half a year and managed to gain some decent friends and with it I gained confidence. I breezed through the second year of sixth form and for the first time ever I loved being in a learning environment!\\nI am now 1 year clear of sixth form and I thought everything was awesome. Recently though my anxiety has come back and hit me like a train. I can\\'t go anywhere or do anything without shaking and panicking. To top it off most of my friends have gone to uni and so left me. The few friends I have left aren\\'t that supportive as they move on in their lives. Then, the start of this month, my best friend died. He was involved in a head on collision in Edinburgh and 3 days later he passed away. He was the most wonderful person I had ever met and he was so supportive. I truly felt like I had found a friend for life. We told each other so much and we had such fun together. Now he\\'s gone the two people who I had left that linked me to him (who I thought were good friends of mine) have turned their backs on me and have left me to my own. I don\\'t know what to do. I hate my life again and I need to get out of this town. I can\\'t find a job anywhere and I can\\'t think of anything getting better. I have barely any friends and I have no life outside of what little amount of weekend work I have. I need to escape this circle of losing everything and then getting back on my feet to lose everything again. So yeh, that\\'s what I needed to get off my chest. Sorry for the rant.',\n",

I\\'ll hopefully do this eventually. 3) Sorry for the length.\\n\\nI used to think I was just shy and basically a pussy. Then I found out about anxiety, and a lot of the symptoms seem to fit fairly well. Especially social anxiety. However, I never have \"panic attacks\" and I can generally function pretty well. (I mean, I\\'m very unhappy/depressed, but I have a career and some friends/acquaintances although I can\\'t make new ones.) When people talk to me, I usually don\\'t have huge problems and if it seems \"appropriate\" I can address groups of people. When I have to do a presentation I get nervous (but so does everybody else I think) and when I was teaching classes this feeling gradually got less, although I always felt somewhat nervous/anxious.\\n\\nWhat I have a huge problem with is taking initiative, especially for social interaction. I\\'ve heard of \"approach anxiety\" and it sounds appropriate, except that it seems to be reserved for anxiety when trying to hit on women I\\'m attracted to. I absolutely cannot do that, but it\\'s much broader. For instance, this is the reason why it\\'s difficult for me to effectively seek help. I\\'ve done it a bunch of times, but I always get referred elsewhere or told to take the next step and it will take me ages to gather the courage again.\\n\\nFor the last couple of months I\\'ve been telling myself I should ask the cashier at the grocery store about his/her day as practice. I have not been able to do that.

Which is weird, because I have relatively little trouble saying \"Good evening\" and \"No thanks I don\\'t need a bag\". And that\\'s the thing: I can do most of the things that are part of the expected social contract. I don\\'t like it, and I\\'ll postpone going to grocery stores and hair dressers etc. because I don\\'t like the interaction or masses of people (who I feel may be judging me), but I don\\'t really have any problems doing it.\\n\\nI don\\'t think I\\'m really afraid of people. I guess you could say I\\'m afraid of what they\\'ll think of me, although that also doesn\\'t always seem to drive my actions (e.g. I don\\'t drink or dance, no matter how much peer pressure I get). It just seems very inconsistent. And because I\\'m not really afraid of people and don\\'t have huge problems just talking, it seems like it might not be social anxiety.\\n\\nAs an encore: it seems I\\'m just a pretty scared guy in general. For instance, I\\'m always afraid of injuring myself or falling (e.g. when rock climbing, skiing, or standing on a cliff). I\\'m also not a huge fan of animals (especially fish when I\\'m swimming).

       " \"During my last appointment with my doctor, he had suggested that i take a vitamin D supplement. I live in the northwest so he said that most of the people he sees are deficient to some extent and he recommends it to most of his patients. We were talking about the various benefits which include improving brain function, possibly preventing neurological disorders later in life, it acts as a mild anti-depressant, among the obvious known benefits. So i told him i would try it and he wrote me a prescription for 50000 ui capsules once per week for 12 weeks. This seemed like a lot to me considering that most supplements are around 400 ui per day. So, naturally i did some research and found that this is a normal amount given to people who are deficient and because it stores in fat and releases over time that you only take it once per week. Also, in my research i read about the rare bad things it can possibly cause, even people reporting panic attacks from taking it. Great. Now, like every medicine i get i don't want to take it. Even though the possibilities of it working great or even just doing nothing at all far exceed the possible verrrry rare negatives im having a tough time. Shit it took me a long time to even try diazepam, the very thing that helps me with my panic attacks.\\n\\nMy questions are as follows...\\n\\nHas anyone tried vitamin D?\\nIf so, have you taken a weekly large amount like i was prescribed? \\nDid it work?\\nDid you have any negative side effects?\",\n",

We originally were going on a party bus. It turns out the company didn\\'t have enough people so it got canceled. We than decided to switch to a cab. I wasn\\'t thrilled but I was mentally preparing myself and I was just starting to get used to the idea. Now she wants to take trains, buses, and subways. I\\'m crying. I\\'m really scared of public transportation. Subways and buses are the worst for me. I\\'m going to be so terrified and have so many panic attacks that I won\\'t even be able to enjoy myself. \\n\\nI just told my boyfriend to tell her I wasn\\'t going and now we\\'re fighting. Well, he isn\\'t. He\\'s just calmly trying to convince me to go. But they don\\'t understand what I go through. They just think I don\\'t like it. They don\\'t understand that I\\'m so terrified it physically hurts. \\n\\nOh yeah, the concert is tomorrow. \\n\\nSomeone help. :/ \\n\\nEdit #1. \\nThe concert was last night and I did end up going. After I originally posted this we really started fighting back and forth. (Which scared me more because at that point I thought my boyfriend\\'s sister hated me and so I thought I wouldn\\'t even have anyone I trusted on this \"adventure\".) I even picked a fight with my poor boyfriend so he ended up really getting stuck in the middle. When my mom came home she saw how bad of shape I was in and she got on the phone with my boyfriend because I just couldn\\'t talk/fight about it anymore. I got so freaked out I started shaking and throwing up. My boyfriend ended up staying over the night to make sure I was okay. He offered to give me the money for my ticket and go in my place. He had a guys night out planned with his friends and I really didn\\'t want to ruin it. That was sort of my motivation to go. If I didn\\'t go I\\'d ruin his night. He always goes way above and beyond to make me happy and safe. He\\'s amazing and he deserved a guys night. I didn\\'t want to ruin it for him. \\n\\nYesterday morning/the morning of the concert I started freaking out again. I started crying and my boyfriend offered to go once again. Him saying that again reminded me why I decided to go the night before. I started getting sick again but my boyfriend kept finding way to calm me down and make me laugh. \\n\\nEventually my boyfriend\\'s dad came to drop us off at the train station. I\\'ve been on the train by my house before with my grandfather so I wasn\\'t too scared of that part. I was okay. When it came time to take a cab from Grand Central to Penn Station we caused the taxi drivers to fight with each other. (Apparently you\\'re supposed to take the first cab on the street. We took the 2nd one because the 1st one was a van and we thought it would be better to save that for a family or someone with a lot of bags.) So I started freaking out. I might have started to have a panic attack but I\\'m honestly not sure. Because at that point my boyfriend\\'s sister started whispering jokes that made me laugh. At Penn station you don\\'t know where you\\'re going until the train arrives. Once you find out where the train in going to be you and a million other people run down these scary metal stairs. That part made me freak out pretty bad. Once we got on the train there was this man and his son sitting across from us. His son might have been scared too because he kept trying to make him laugh. His jokes made me laugh too so that was nice. He also explained where the shuttle we\\'d have to take to the theater would be and he said it was very easy. Which he was right about. On the way back to the train after the concert was over me and my boyfriend\\'s sister got separated. I got so scared. I tried to close my eyes and relax but the guy I ended up sitting next too freaked me out. It was only a 10-15 minute ride so I guess that\\'s better than if it happened on the 40+ minute train ride. \\n\\nSomeone in the comments said to focus on something like a ring. I had my promise ring so I used that. It worked. I kept thinking about something really funny that happened that morning. I also listened to music. On the way home I was too tired to think about being scared and it was over before I knew it. \\n\\nI found out when I got home that my boyfriend texted my mother and said he was proud of me. :\\') \\n\\nThank you to everyone who helped me!

       " 'Ok so for a couple of years maybe I feel like I have become very anxious, maybe I have always had it and being busy with studies and sports just kept it at bay, but ever since Ive had less time to do things like sports because I work a lot, I feel very insecure, anxious and depressed. My insecurities have almost led to me destroying my relationship with my incredibly loving boyfriend, but thankfully his support and love has made us more stable than anything.\\n\\nLooking back I have had three instances, where I have out of nowhere just fainted. The first time was on holidays, I was standing by a bus stop several years ago with my father and suddenly everything just went black and I fainted. after a few minutes of resting everything went back to normal. I cant recall the onset as it was so long ago but it was quite unexpected, my father just assumed it might be from the heat (38 degrees celsius) and being dehydrated.\\n\\nThen comes another few instances, all in a social setting, most of the time alcohol was involved or even marijuana but both in moderation. Around friends I wouldnt call myself insecure in the slightest, so the one time I do believe it might have been too much marijuana and my body just temporarily failing. Again, after 10 minutes I was fine. (I do not use it anymore, as my anxiety keeps me away from smoking it nowadays, which is ironic because in places of legalization many people take it as remedy for anxiety.)\\n\\nThen another time after a couple beers and having a marijuana joint, the same thing happened, all went black and I fainted for a good 3 minutes. My friends immediately put me in a cab home thinking I had drunk too much.\\n\\nHowever, the reason I believe it is not CAUSED by , but merely made worse by alcohol &amp; marijuana is because one time it was without any intake of substances;\\nI was simply having a shower and freaked out because i thought i had noticed an abnormality on my body (which turned out to be nothing), My heart started racing, I freaked out and once again everything started to go black. I quickly sat down in the shower and after a couple minutes of breathing slowly I was all fine. \\n\\nNow having looked a bit into Anxiety disorders, it does sound a great lot like I suffer from it. I have always been very good at school, never had issues making friends and am not horrible looking either, but somehow I am extremely insecure and have no self esteem...I believe the neglect of hobbies plays a large role since doing things you enjoy and are good at and where endorphins are involved would certainly prevent such anxiety.\\n\\nBut as of right now, being aware I should increase hobbies such as sports, I would really like to know if I need to be worried. Sometimes when I overworry about something my heart starts racing and racing and I actively have to calm myself down.\\n\\n\\nA friend of mine who has similar issues has a psychiatrist for a mother and has been taking anti depressants and said they have greatly improved her quality of life, i am just interested what you all think, how do i go about this, it really does impact my life as my self esteem is just..awful and despite having supporting family and partner who tell me how good I am at things and how pretty I am those things just dont have any effect on me. \\n\\nI noticed I am over observant in social settings, as to how people act, and i think the fact that i am extremely empathetic is a key factor as well. If someone is feeling uncomfortable I immediately pick it up without even intending to. I always feel the need to make them feel better, its as though my brain just picks up all the uneasiness of others, makes them feel better and in return i end up stuck with all these shit feelings...\\n\\ni dont know what to do and am honestly considering therapy or some medications that will just calm me down.

       " \"Hi everyone.  This is going to be somewhat of a long post, so I apologize in advance.  Also, is this is the wrong place for this, please let me know.\\n\\nI'm a 27-year-old male with both an undergraduate and graduate degree in journalism and history, respectively.  I currently live at home with my father (my mother passed away in November), and work a part-time retail job to cover some of my living costs and other expenses.  I started dating a girl about a year ago, and we have been inseparable ever since.  The idea of marriage has come up several times, although we have both agreed that it would be a few years away while she finishes up school and we both get real jobs.  As much as I want this, I'm also scared to death for other reasons.\\n\\nThe idea of commitment doesn't bother me at all.  However, I just have no idea how I'm going to make this all happen.  I have roughly $40,000 left on my student loans; she only has about $1,000.  She's set up to have a pretty well-paying job once she's done, and I am trying to find a teaching job in my field or some kind of decent full-time job.  Even still, once I start thinking about trying to pay rent/get a house, utilities, further loan payments, and other necessities (possible new car, computer, etc.), I start to panic.  I have woken up in the middle of the night for the last five days in a cold sweat and shaking from anxiety.  To complicate matters, two of our best friends just had a baby, and so now I've added child costs to my imaginary budget.  \\n\\nI've talked to my dad several times about this, and he keeps assuring me that everything will work out in the end.  He's 52, works for the government, and still has to figure things out day by day.  I've talked to my gf about sacrifices we might have to make (no cable, vacations, eating out as much), and we're both fine with that.  I know people who are dealing with the same kinds of things all at the same time; they are even worse off than we are, but they make it work, so I know it's possible.  Even still, I'm scared to death of it all.\\n\\nTo make a long story short, I'm worried about paying for a house I don't have, a child I don't have, supporting a wife I don't have, and a job I don't have.  I keep trying to tell myself, as has everyone else, that I just have to take one small step at a time, but I just try to plan it all out ahead of time, and it's making me miserable.  Combined with the fact that I am getting older and that it will take even longer to reach my ultimate goals of a wife and child, it's getting worse.  Obviously, getting a better job is the first step and will affect everything else.  Is there anything else I can do to try and put my mind at ease, at least for a little while?

It\\'s been great reading other people\\'s posts and knowing that what I feel isn\\'t something that only I go through. Because of this, I decided I should reach out.\\n\\nFor reference, I\\'m a 22-year-old female living in the USA. I am currently taking Lexapro. The best definition of the anxiety I have faced throughout most of my life has been contained in the descriptions for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. However, lately, things have been a little different.\\n\\nFor more context, I\\'ll kind of go over what anxiety has been like for me. As a child, my family moved around relatively often. I didn\\'t notice how quiet and nervous I was until I was around 10. Everyone always said I was just \"shy,\" etc. By the time I reached high school, what had started as just a general inability to speak to most people (extreme social anxiety) had become more like depression. I felt that there was something wrong and broken within me and didn\\'t know what to do. I often thought people would be better off without me, or that if I was gone, no one would miss me. This did not make my crippling social anxiety any more manageable.\\n\\nThis kind of went on through my first year or two of college. Though, I managed to make a little progress with the depression. It helped a lot to have such a caring support system behind me. But I still maintained the social anxiety, and actually began to have a lot of trouble sleeping, and be terrified of germs. The thought of even leaving my room was sometimes too much for me to handle. Going anywhere where there might be people sneezing or coughing made me feel intense panic, which made school difficult, and bus rides practically unbearable.\\n\\nBy January of 2013, it had all become too much. Friends could always see that there was something wrong, but finally, one close friend told me he was worried for me, and that he knew how I felt was a burden on me, and that I shouldn\\'t have to manage so much alone. After this conversation, I talked to my mom, and we decided I should go to our family doctor to talk about what I was going through. He asked me a lot of questions, and ended up prescribing Lexapro. \\n\\nThe Lexapro has honestly made such a difference in my life. I am much more willing to talk to people now, and have been able to make my fear of germs and infection at least manageable. Things were really looking up for a while, since the medication was prescribed. I do realize, though, that the pills are just a tool to help me find balance. They don\\'t magically make everything better. I have to be willing to work on things too. And I have been.\\n\\nAs I said, things had been a lot better. That is, until I graduated from college last May. I am currently unemployed and am having a lot of difficulty in finding a job, especially one related to my degree. I\\'ve noticed a switch flip in me the past few months. I feel like I have reverted back into feeling depressed about 60% of the  time. I sleep for hours upon hours every day and have a lot of trouble getting up. It always seems like a better option to go ahead and aim for 10 or more hours of sleep, or even to just stay in bed rather than start the day. I\\'ve also been having panic attacks and getting angry. I\\'m not generally an angry person. I\\'ve always been very chill and calm, but lately I lash out at people for no reason, especially my poor boyfriend, who is so supportive, and someone I\\'m so thankful for. I find myself feeling so unreasonably angry for even the smallest reasons, that would never have usually made me upset. I feel immense guilt, and like a failure, over not being able to find a job, even though I realize that this is actually quite common anymore. \\n\\nI guess I\\'m just here hoping someone may have some advice for me. I\\'m wondering if this is just temporary, from my life changing so drastically recently (graduating, entering the \"real world,\" being unemployed and alone at home all day), or if it might be something more serious that I should do something about. I know no one here can tell me that for sure, or give me medical advice. But does anyone maybe have any tips for dealing with things like I\\'ve described, short of therapy or more/different medication? Anything you can say would be much appreciated.

       " 'If you are having trouble breathing or suffer from asthma then take some time to go over this info.\\n\\nSome people with  anxiety develop a condition called \"air hunger\" the feeling of not being able to get a satisfying breath. You might find yourself constantly yawning or perhaps you feel as though you cannot fill your lungs completely. This condition can range from being annoying to completely debilitating depending on how severe it is. I suffered from this for over a year and spent a lot of money going to doctors and taking tests to no avail. After a really tough year I\\'m happy to say that I was able to reverse this and restore my normal breathing pattern.\\n\\n\\nLong story short, theres a couple reasons why you feel air hunger. First off it may be because your body has low carbon dioxide levels as a result of stress. The other reason being that your body over breathes when stressed out to get ready for the \"fight or flight\" response. People with anxiety find themselves under constant stress so If you continue to over-breathe over a prolonged period of time, then your body deems your increased breathing volume as \"normal.\" As a result you will constantly feel short of breath unless you take in big breaths/yawn. \\n\\nYour goal is to break this habit and restore your oxygen/carbon dioxide levels back to a healthier level. You can do this by practicing the Buteyko method. Dr. Buteyko spent decades researching how our breathing affects the body. The basic idea is to practice simple exercises that train your body to breathe less. Think of over breathing as an addiction that you are trying to stop, it\\'s tough at first but you will beat this as long as you stick with it. I have left a couple links that offer guidance and techniques to restore your natural breathing rhythm. Many folks have messaged me about the great progress they have made so I\\'m confident that this can help you. \\n\\nLastly, it\\'s important that you take proactive steps to combat the source of your stress to make this process easier. I personally took up meditation to help alleviate my stress and relax my breathing. Youtube has a lot of great meditation videos that are worth a listen.\\n\\nhttp://www.buteykobreathing.org/ButeykoDiary.pdf\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOVtuY03gJT00_a_28DhANA/videos\\n\\n',\n",

I\\'m assuming this is a trigger for me as I\\'ve been in a relationship before where they showed interest and I perused to be lead on then dropped like a bad habit and blamed my self for it thinking i went wrong somewhere. Now I have a feeling of inadequacy and have that whole \"I\\'m doing something wrong and don\\'t know what\" feeling and its acting as a trigger bring multiple break downs a day which I have been free of for about 3 years now. I have already talked to her about it and she told me that its not anything I\\'m doing things are just bothering her and she prefers not to talk about it. Regardless I cannot shake the feeling I\\'m whats wrong and every little thing she dose that feels like she\\'s trying to distance herself from me acts as a trigger, it could be anything some thing as little as no response to a text I sent to her, or even receiving a one word response to a text I sent to her expecting a larger response. Anyways I cannot think of any solutions aside from breaking up with her which is the last thing I want to do and want to ask for any ideas on how to cope with this (no meds please). If you have no ideas but took the time to read thanks for listening. Other general info if needed: Age: 16 (Junior in High School), No meds or any drug use. Types of anxiety: Separation and PTSD (from bullying at a younger age). Again thank you.',\n",

       " \"I was diagnosed with GAD more than 30 years ago. This label is like a stigma. Anytime I mention a new health concern, everyone seems to act like it's all in my head, so I'm reluctant to even mention anything anymore. I just tend to treat everything like it's a new symptom of my anxiety. This past few months, however, my symptoms got slowly worse until they were totally out of control. When I finally did go to see the doctor about it, it turned out that I had developed vertigo due to damage to my inner ear from a car crash I was in about 20 years ago. The vertigo was causing some of my symptoms directly (dizziness, lack of balance, and loss of coordination) as well as triggering a whole bunch of other symptoms due to the unsettling nature of feeling like everything is spinning around me. If feeling like the whole world literally just turned upside-down several times each hour won't make you feel anxious, nothing will.\\n\\nHas anyone ever worried that their anxiety symptoms might be masking or hiding other issues like this? I know that I tend to obsess about every little symptom, worrying that it might actually be MS, or a stroke, or a brain tumor, or a heart attack, or whatever. It's not that I think I do have these things, but that I want to rule them out, because the symptoms are very real.\\n\\nBecause of this I procrastinated going in to get my symptoms checked out, worried that I would be perceived as just a hypochondriac, and it turns out that I had an actual medical condition all along that I probably could have gotten treated months ago rather than enduring for so long. It is even possible that what could have been treatable if detected right away might now be a permanent condition due to the months of neglect.\\n\\nHow do you deal with the naysayers who think you're imagining everything? When do you decide to go in and get checked for symptoms which could potentially be due to nothing more than anxiety? At what point do you justify the cost of tests to make sure that you haven't developed an actual heart condition instead of just chest pain due anxiety-related muscle spasms and tightness, or to determine whether your shakiness is caused by anxiety or some physical disorder, etc.?\",\n",

       " \"Anxiety and depression are a freaking mountain.\\n\\nYou start out at the top, living your life, and then one of your feet slips and the rest of you follow suit.  You keep tripping further down and the more you fall and the closer you get to the bottom of the mountain, the harder it is to see the top of the mountain where you came from.  Admitting it's an interference in your life is like finally catching a ledge and stopping your momentum.\\n\\nBut then you're still part of the way down the mountain.\\n\\nMedication is like realizing that you've got some rope or spiked shoes, or maybe that you're just not that bad at shimmying up the rocks.  Therapy, as well.  So you try and find what method works to get you moving.  But you have to keep in mind that your momentum is stopped and you just tumbled yards down a rocky mountain.  It's tricky to get moving again.  Maybe it gets easier after that initial push; you're moving and so you can keep moving.\\n\\nEventually, your arms and legs and entire body are going to get tired.  You'll be weary.  You'll have such a hard time remembering what the top of the mountain was like, how beautiful the view was.  It will seem so daunting to make it back to the top.  Do you want to?  Is it worth it?  Can you even do it?  You'll be so sore.  Maybe you'll start to lose your balance and slip a few times.  After all, you came crashing down a mountain and now you're trying to climb back up.  That's a feat.  You should be proud no matter how slow you move or how much it hurts or how many times the rock crumbles and you slide again.\\n\\nBut again, getting back to the top is a process.  You have to learn to perfect your technique and what ways work for your body and your mind.  There is no magic one-size-fits-all apparatus, this isn't a recreational climbing wall.  Maybe sometimes, you'll need someone else to tell you everything will be okay, to hold your hand and say they'll help you reach the next ledge or replace your rope.  Or maybe something to remind you of the view at the top and the way the sunrise feels.  Maybe you won't need them all the time, or even most of the time, just when you're so worn out that you think you're just going to fall right back down to the ground.\\n\\nWe may be banged and bruised, but we haven't plummeted yet.\\n\\nWe may be weak, but we're still climbing.\",\n",

       " 'Hey folks, \\n\\nI\\'ve been in and out of this forum so many times! The last six months I barely ever dropped in here, only to maybe give some advice. I was feeling wonderful probably 13 out of every 14 days. Only little bouts of anxiety would come and maybe last an hour or so before I nipped them. \\n\\nI\\'ve always been a hypochondriac -- ever since I had a number of new symptoms accompany me and my mind after suffering my first panic attack over two years ago. After cutting out alcohol (one year and two months sober now, and proud of it!) I no longer had anything to trigger feelings of being unsettled, and my anxious symptoms (brain zaps, fatigue, brain fog) disappeared! \\n\\nI then had another panic attack--from weed--that set me off again. Six months of more brain fog, fatigue, constant worrying (seriously -- every hour of every day) followed. Numerous doctors had to tell me I didn\\'t have CFS. A person with CFS had to tell me I didn\\'t have CFS. After finally listening to my therapist, I once again cleared my mind and saw major improvements. My symptoms once again disappeared. I remember feeling better during that rut before a close friend told me she had been diagnosed with fibro, and suddenly I was stuck worrying about her and myself so much that I made myself sick again. \\n\\nAfter the last six months being blissful -- getting on track for my last semester of school and reeling in a major crush, I felt like $1,000,000 again. But, that girl who\\'s now my g/f was diagnosed with mono a week ago. I had mono three years ago. I know everything there is to know about it, as well as all of the hooplah attributed to EBV (which 90% of adults have, so of course it can be blamed for anything). \\n\\nAs soon as she told me she was sick, I started feeling sick again. I started questioning how I felt. I was a week removed from strep throat, so I convinced myself immediately that I was sick as well...with something worse. Some weird manifestation. I worried myself until I felt feverish before seeing a doctor that told me what I already knew, \"worry and stress can make you feel terrible.\" I didn\\'t have mono, of course. They tested me. I felt great leaving the doctor. Amazing. A relief to hear good news! \\n\\nBut, once I let my mind wander and spiral into that dark basement that every hypochondriac knows about, I begin to feel ill. Yesterday I was more tired than usual, and today I had to move some furniture and let myself freak out over the aches and pains that COME WITH MOVING FURNITURE, not having an underlying disease that six doctors couldn\\'t identify. \\n\\nWhenever I see doctors they see me for what I am -- a hypochondriac. Luckily my regular doctor is very patient and understands that hypochondria is, in itself, an illness. \\n\\nBut, instead of letting this become a major problem like the first two times, I\\'ve not had a panic attack yet. I\\'ve used my tools to calm myself down and I\\'ve set up an appointment with a counselor and toughed my down moments. Every few hours I feel a different symptom, and I know it\\'s a result of my emotional stress. \\n\\nThis rut is different, because, while I feel bad, I know that I can gain control. I don\\'t feel helpless like I did before. I remember feeling so hopeless, miserable and sick..and it\\'s great to actually feel how far my mind has come. \\n\\nAnxiety is a crazy thing, and I think a lot of people need reassurance that it can have the physical complications that credible research says it can. \\n\\nIt\\'s amazing how we can believe the worst case scenario when Googling our symptoms, but won\\'t believe when information from a research institution tells us that anxiety and stress can be the culprit. \\n\\nThe more I let myself feel good, the more I do. I\\'m beginning to feel this naturally as anxiety. I know there\\'s a direct correlation between my worry and panic and an influx of symptoms, and after a third time it\\'s reassuring to see that trend and trust what\\'s wrong. \\n\\nFor hypochondriacs out there -- I hope my experience can be reassuring to you. I know that it took for me to believe my problem was in my head before I improved...and I want my messages here to help others with that! ',\n",

I've always been an anxious person prone to the very ocassional anxiety or panic attack. The past month since we found out my emotional and mental state has been turned upside down. Today it all boiled over. I've had multiple panic and anxiety attacks all day today and they just wont go away. They are debilitating. I can barely function. There is no peace or silence in my head.

You\\'re going to be fine twenty minutes from now. That\\'s because if you\\'re scratching yourself, and/or reading this right now, you\\'re freaking out about it. \\n\\nTake a few deep breaths, slow ones, and come back. I\\'ll wait. \\n\\n...\\n\\nOkay. Can you feel the scratches on your skin? Don\\'t over-think it. Either you feel it after your hand is gone or you don\\'t. If you can feel, then you\\'re not dying. And if you\\'re not dying, then, you\\'ve faced the concept of impending death and lived. And if you\\'ve faced the concept of your impending doom once, you can do it again. \\n\\nYou won\\'t die today.

I\\'m still alive, and you will be, too.\\n\\nJust keep inhaling and exhaling slowly, for now. \\n\\nWhen you\\'re ready, we\\'ll move on.\\n\\n....\\n\\nOkay, now that you\\'re ready to move on, think about what you want to do. What makes you comfortable? If it\\'s surfing reddit, get on that. Social contact? Get a hold of someone. You\\'ve found your center, and now it\\'s time to stabilize. Let\\'s just find the thing that gets you where you need to be, alright?\\n\\n...\\n\\nIf you\\'re still reading, you didn\\'t find your calm. That\\'s okay. Sometimes it\\'s not so easy to nail down what kills that attack. Sometimes, it seems like there\\'s nothing that can stop your imminent death. I know how that goes. \\n\\nAt this point, what works for me is *actively* trying to distract myself, but when I think about it, I check all of my limbs to make sure I can feel them. If I can feel my limbs, I\\'m not having a heart attack, I\\'m not having a stroke, I would have felt an embolism beforehand with a persistent generalized pain over more than a week, and I\\'m not smelling blood or anything burning. \\n\\n...\\n\\nThere are a lot of things *I* do when I have an attack that may or may not help others. I just wanted to jump in and let others know that *you are not going to die*. Your body is just freaking out either because you\\'re thinking too much about it\\'s functions or, like me, it\\'s just gone haywire and you have this unshakable feeling that you\\'re going to die.\\n\\nIf you\\'re still here reading this, then, you\\'re preparing for an attack, or nothing has worked so far. This isn\\'t a last resort, so much as it is a \"bodily reset\" sort of thing.\\n\\n**Breathe deeply three times. On the fourth time, tense all of your muscles. Hold your breath and your muscles for a count of four or five. The count to hold is up to you. After this count is up, release your muscles and exhale slowly. Repeat this as often as you need to.**\\n\\nFor me, my doctor says it\\'s a misfire of my \"fight-or-flight\" response, so I get super-stressed. Tensing and releasing muscles can help that.\\n\\nOkay. I\\'ve rambled. I\\'m sure a lot of this has been covered before here. Just remember, take a few deep breaths, and, actually, even IF you were going to die (which you won\\'t, trust me) John Coyne is probably a good dude to relax to if you\\'re going to go out due to stress :)',\n",

       " 'It\\'s a new year so let\\'s start this off with a bang. I\\'m writing this mainly for myself as a reference and to keep me on track through out the year.\\n\\n1. Positive Mental Attitude - Always. I tend to get in these negative mindset loops and it can sometimes take me hours, even days to realize what I\\'m doing and to knock it off. It takes a lot of effort to stay positive and aware of your state of mind, but it\\'s worth it IMO. Also, rephrasing my self talk and how I interact with other people. (I don\\'t NEED to do anything, I WANT/CHOOSE to do X. Negative thoughts turned into positive, or more constructive thoughts. I stay positive and if I find myself being negative I\\'ll analyze the negative thought rather than accepting it).\\n\\n2. No more caffeine. For me caffeine is the bane of my existence and the cause for a lot of my problems. I\\'m much, much better without it but it\\'s really hard for me to cut it out. I\\'m not going to make any excuses, I\\'ve just been a weak little bitch but cutting it out will diminish a lot of the effects.\\n\\n3. Better health habits all around. It\\'s no wonder I feel so down and out of it when my sleep schedule is so erratic and I\\'m constantly eating fast food. I need to stick to a decent sleep schedule, start eating healthier, and working out. Obviously I don\\'t want to be too rigid as that encourages relapsing but there\\'s no reason I can\\'t save the treats and late night gaming sessions for the weekend instead of 24/7. Again, it just feeds into the anxiety when you\\'re constantly sleep deprived and hopped up on salt and sugar.\\n\\n4. Never lose focus, stay occupied. This coincides with number 1 and it\\'s a tricky motherfucker as well. A lot of my anxiety ends up manifesting when I have nothing to do. If I\\'m busy with work, hobbies, etc etc I\\'m usually pretty good. But as soon as my schedule is clear and I find myself aimlessly surfing reddit or watching the same youtube videos over and over again my mind starts to wander. And then I start thinking about the past. Or the future. Or hypothetical situations. What if I had done this? What if this happens? I wonder what would happen if I did this? Why am I always doing \"such and such\"?....why am I constantly thinking about this shit? \\n\\nSo no. That\\'s not happening anymore. I want to stay more focused and goal oriented. Stay positive and in the present moment. If I catch myself where I start looping (thinking negative thoughts, thinking about shit that isn\\'t real/hasn\\'t happened) I find something productive to do. If I can\\'t find something, I\\'ll create something for myself to do. Anything is better than nothing because nothing brings on the thoughts, which creates the feelings, which creates the loops, which creates the cycle. But I\\'m the one in charge, and I\\'m the one who is creating all of this and now I\\'m CHOOSING to put a stop to it and CHOOSING to take a more constructive and positive direction.\\n\\nThank you for reading and/or posting. Happy 2015 and hopefully we have a better 2015 than 2014. Don\\'t strive for perfection, just do a little better each day ;).',\n",
       " \"I feel like I can talk to people pretty easily for the most part but after a conversation/interaction which I initially felt went pretty well, I'll start picking it apart. I'll start to notice awkward moment, moments were I might have come off as stupid, or annoying and I'll just dwell on it. Also, whenever I'm telling someone about something I love, I get really excited and then I apologize for geeking out. I keep telling myself that I shouldn't apologize for something that I love but I just feel like I'm being so annoying. I also can't seem to stand by what I say. If I say something that I feel strongly about and it upsets someone, I'll take it back and apologize, trying to negate the persons feelings. \\n\\nI'm currently in group therapy which I primarily like because I'm meeting wonderful people who are going through the same thing and would never judge me for my problems. But I can't help but feel like I don't belong there. It seems like their problems are so much worse than mine. I've also only had one panic attack so I know my case isn't extreme. The group leaders focus primarily on my fear of driving (never driven a single time, I turn 21 this week), which is actually a pretty problem since I have to learn at some point, rather than my social anxiety. \\n\\nI just feel like all of my little issues are building up into this giant monster which is preventing me from being the person I want to be. \\n\\nI actually came close to apologizing for this post but thought I would do a little out of session exposure (The group leaders have been urging us to do them...however, they might be a little disappointed that I didn't do anything involving driving).

I assumed he had just left his phone and computer in the other room because he didn't want to talk to me.\\n\\nWhen he finally did call me back, he tried to help I guess, but his tone sounded uncaring and annoyed.

       " 'I [29f] am in the process of moving in with my SO [29m]. He has ADHD and can be extremely disorganized and cluttered- the clutter from all his impulse purchases and disorganization from his scattered ADHD brain. I am realizing that his disorganization and clutter is a HUGE trigger for me. Because of that, this move is making me completely balls-to-the-wall anxious. I know the move in is the right step for our relationship, but the stress is driving me crazy and I am having a hard time dealing with it. \\n\\nOn top of the fact that I work for a civil litigation firm that is neck-deep in trial. Last week, I worked 12 hour days EVERY day, plus 6 hours Saturday. I have NO time or energy to move and get things organized and getting my SO to help has proven to be difficult. A lot of my stress comes from the fact that his things are all over the house (he\\'s lived there for a year) and its difficult for me to find room for my things. I dont know what of his I can toss, move, whatever, to make room for my stuff. \\n\\nFor example: we share the master closet. His clothes took 2/3rd of the room even after he \"cleaned\" it out. I pointed this out to him and asked him to make more room for me. He told me just to throw his stuff somewhere to make room for my stuff. While I am happy to have my clothes in their place, there is now a large amount of his clothes sitting on the dresser for DAYS now. I don\\'t want to remove his things to make room for mine, only to have his stuff clutter the space instead.

I\\'m worried that this difference in living styles is going to be the thing that breaks our relationship. We are great partners in every other way, though, and I dont want my anxiety over his living style to end things. But honestly, I seriously cannot live like this. I hoping that once things are moved in and organized (and trial over at work) that my anxiety will be much better. I am not on meds currently, because I had to go get a blood test before my MD will give me meds.

Within two weeks of going to the hospital for it, he passed away from the chemo. He was only 21! He had so much life left to live and it isn't fair. I think what happened to him is triggering this in me. I've always had health anxiety. I've been having panic attacks since I was 10.

       " \"Hello, everyone. This will be my first post on Reddit. I've always found it cathartic to write my thoughts and have them read, so I hope you will be able to offer me some advice. I have always dealt with anxiety, primarily health anxiety. I tend to worry about that which I have no control over. My earliest memory of anxiety was worrying the roof of my mouth was eroding: I was four. I've been seeing specialists since the fifth grade, but I don't feel I've made much progress at all. Up until last year, my anxiety had been tolerable. I was able to suppress it and actually enjoy my life to some degree, I very rarely had panic attacks and only became anxious when in crowds (a concert, movie theater... I did not enjoy gym class). In January of 2011 I became concerned with my environment and the effect it may have had on my life. I live in very close proximity to a main road and an oil refinery, and I have neighbors in my area who use a fireplace to heat their homes. I obsessed over organic food and detoxification, I demanded to know the source of my vegetables and whether they were treated with pesticides and I began to withdraw from friends. I became less interested in school and here is where I believe my anxiety amplified.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n For some incomprehensible reason, in May of 2011 I decided I could no longer live at home. Home was creating my anxiety and I needed to leave immediately. I decided to live with my aunt and uncle for one month as an intermediary before moving into my godmothers (I will not touch on this much, but I will say this was one of the worst months of my life. There was an incident involving an oil furnace, and since I have hypersensitivity to fumes I nearly went mad). I saw my godmothers home as a utopia, an environment where I may finally focus on schoolwork and seek treatment for my mental health. I finally moved into my godmothers in June of 2011. I enjoyed my summer, granted my anxiety was inhibiting me from enjoying it to its fullest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI began a ritual where I would leave my home every third day, because I felt this would minimize my exposure to environmental toxins. I became obsessed with achieving optimum cognitive health and I started to take several supplements (wheatgrass, spirulina, omega-3 fish oil, acai) and go on daily hikes. I was doing well. September introduced the new school year, and as luck may have it I suffered a fall a couple of weeks into the month, nearly suffering a concussion. I was not injured, though my anxiety was leading me to believe I was having secondary effects (intracranial pressure, perhaps a subdural hematoma). I was constantly feeding my anxiety by researching symptoms and complications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n My relationship with my godmother became increasingly negative over the course of the next several months which lead me to moving out in January, earlier this year. I was placed in a shelter while my social worker searched for a new apartment for me. I began to skin pick (my acne), almost unconsciously, and I would do so for the duration of my stay (five weeks). The notion of infection did not cross my mind, I thought what I was doing was harmless. I ended up leaving awful, awful scars over my chest, shoulders and spanning across the entire top of my back. I did not suffer an infection, but I realized the severity of my behavior and told my mother I wanted to schedule an appointment with a doctor. This lead to me moving home with my parents once more, I'd not been living there for seven months. It did not take long for my anxiety to manifest into something more dire. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n I now had an entirety of time to myself since I was not attending school. I used this time to research symptoms and illnesses, all relating to skin infection. I became so frightened that I completely stopped skin picking, and as of now I have not picked for over four weeks. I have been to the emergency room three times in the past month due to fear of infection, and I have been reassured ad nauseum that there is none. I am not overly concerned of whether I am already infected; I am concerned with my susceptibility and risk of infection. My back, though healing, has open scabs and I cannot even shower anymore without noticing blood on the towels. I notice blood on my pillows. I notice blood on my T-shirts (Actually, I should note, I have been prescribed minocycline and a topical cream for my acne, so yes, I have been given medication). I try to treat my wounds as best I can with an antibiotic ointment. Others find my hygiene to be obsessive. I am doing everything I can to prevent infection. Yet I still worry. There are three infections that I am most concerned with: Necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis and cellulitis. I have read all three are mostly found in individuals with compromised immune symptoms, and one of these is actually exceedingly rare, yet my anxiety is convinced that I will become a statistic. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Since I always have minor breakages in my skin, and since these diseases are so opportunistic, seeping in at the slightest trauma, I worry that I will eventually suffer from one of them. Using last night as an example, two scabs broke and bled and I began crying, applying polysporin like a damn maniac. Pathetic imagery, huh? It's gotten to the point where I cannot even enjoy a book anymore. I haven't been to school in over two months because my anxiety has completely consumed me. I am on my sixth day of anxiety medication (celexa) and I am seeing my family doctor once every week, in addition to my psychologist once every week. I'm actually meeting with a psychiatrist this month as well, so I am seeking support. I just need to know what to do in the meantime. I feel like I'm being crushed by my anxiety.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n All I do anymore, really, is lay in bed and sob. just waiting for infection to set in and ravage me. It's funny to note that just under two months ago I'd been digging my dirty fingernails, that I'd not washed in days, into my flesh and freeing the pus from beneath. I've never been so scared of anything in my life, but this has just about ruined me. I feel like I'm missing some things, and this may not be very cohesive, but please, Reddit, help me. If there is anything you are wondering, I will be glad to answer your questions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------\\nAge: \\nTypes Of Anxiety: Health Anxiety -\\nMedications: Stieva-A Cream, Minocycline, Clonazepam, Celexa -\\nTrigger examples: I have a hypersensitivity to pain.

Started with 10mg of prozac for about a month, side-effects were horrible. Switched to 25mg of zoloft right before Christmas, everything was fine, until one day (~2 weeks after) I just detached from reality. Bumped up to 50mg as prescribed.\\n\\nSince then, I've been so-so. You can read about it in my previous posts. Told my doc about it, she thought I should taper off, gave me a vitamin D supplement, and some 25mg of vistaril to tide me over with anxiety. Later I was instructed that instead of tapering off the zoloft, to actually increase to 75 and possibly 100.\\n\\nI've been hesitant but increased back to 50, then 75 after a week or so. I was holding off on using the vistaril so as to not become dependent on it or anything. Not too long into 75mg of zoloft, I started feeling way worse. These past few days I have had uncontrollable breakdowns where I have cried for upwards of 3 hours non-stop. I have wallowed in self-loathing and wanting to cease existence.\\n\\nMy SO suggested I take the vistaril to help me sleep and see if it helps. I've been taking one with every dose of zoloft now and it's shut my mind up, but now I'm stuck in a cycle of sleeping for more than half of the day and having to deal with my extremely vivid nightmares that are hard to dissociate from reality. Just today when my SO got home he woke me from a nightmare and I had a hard time recognising him and why he was there with me because in the nightmare he'd abandoned me.\\n\\nSo it's either becoming close to suicide (I got scarily close to it) or becoming extremely detached and sleeping more than half of my life away...and I don't see my doctor until next month since she never followed up on my message about scheduling in 2 weeks instead of 1 month... I should give her a call but phone anxiety, you feel?\\n\\ntl;dr- Zoloft makes me feel like killing myself, vistaril helps take that edge off but makes me sleep all day and become extremely detached.\",\n",

So I'll go through these weird mental rituals where I'll constantly be trying to identify thoughts and dismiss them without reacting too much to them.

I have an estimate in my head for how long it will take me to do something, and when it comes to getting ready to go out in public I find myself holding out until the very last moment to perform each step of the process, and inevitably I end up going slightly over my estimate.\\n\\nIs that a thing, or am I trying to make excuses for myself?\\n\\nMy specific question: I\\'ve recently gained a new manager at work, who is far less lenient about this sort of thing than even my previous one was. His strict position is that I must be 100% ready at exactly :00 on the clock, and any deviation from that will result in scolding and eventually discipline. This problem has even affected me financially; on my most recent review I got a somewhat poor rating due to \"continued attendance issues,\" which ultimately resulted in me getting less than what I feel I was owed on my annual raise.\\n\\nBecause of this, I\\'m considering asking my manager and/or HR for accommodation.

       " \"For a while now, I've been in between deciding whether or not I am going to travel again or try to finally move out. Like I said, I know this sounds very privileged white guy of me, but I've saved my money myself and worked hard to attain the money I've saved. All in all, both decisions bring me a lot of anxiety. On one scale, the idea of traveling again sounds very enticing, seeing a new place is always fun and refreshing. This was what I was most fixated on, and even actually had semi-planned on meeting a long time friend when I traveled again, but that is done now, unfortunately. Although those plans didn't work out, I still have the desire to travel. I don't even know why because I don't really do what everyone does when they travel, I basically switch one room for another and pout freely in a place where no one will recognize me. I mean that's not all I do, I do see the sites and visit places and sometimes meet people, but for the most part, it's an extended period of solitude, which I enjoy, for the most part. \\n\\nWhat scares me about the alternative is how limited I will be. Living with mom sucks, but here, I save money quickly, get to spend a lot of it on myself, on my friends, on fun times, etc. When I move out I won't be able to do that anymore. I'm afraid I'm going to move out and completely shut out from everyone. I'm bad at contacting friends to hangout, so if I didn't call anybody I probably wouldn't see anybody. Not that that really bothers me, I guess, but it does kind of worry me. I don't want to be a creepy shut in and I don't want to lose my friends. To add to this, not all of my friends have cars, including myself, and the apartment that has been offered to me is in another city (close by, definitely drivable, but still). This would definitely limit the amount of interaction I would have with my close friends. I worry because it's already limited. We all do our own thing sometimes. I don't have many close friends, and at times, we can all be occupied with ourselves. One has a boyfriend so she never hangs out, one is writing a book and he's super focused on it, the other is.. well the third friend is pretty much in my position as well but has more satellite friends than me, so he's usually hangin' with them going to parties and the like. The good side of moving to this new city would mean living in the same city as my father, and seeing him more, which I would love.\\n\\nI'm just scared of the change. Traveling is comforting because it is a temporary change. I will come back and everything will be almost exactly as I left it. Moving out is.. a big step. I've never done it before and the idea of it is both completely exciting and totally terrifying. The stresses of paying bills, not paying bills, what if I can't get food, or smokes, or take a girl out on a date? What if I can't afford an internet connection? What if I make stupid decisions and get myself into a load of debt somehow? Is living by myself really a good idea?

I exercise regularly, I make sure to do things that make me happy as soon as I feel the signs of anxiety coming on. But it wasn't always this way, I struggled for years back in Ireland with it. I worked in a factory when it first surfaced, I was doing zombie work. Stuck in my mind all day. I had anxiety attacks nearly everyday I worked there and I had to try and hide them in front of my coworkers, as I could not leave my station on the assembly line. I cannot count the amount of times I have cried with my head against my work station window, just hoping no-one would notice. \\n\\nEventually I built up the courage to go back to college, which scared the shit out of me. I could barely concentrate at the time and failure is definitely my biggest fear in life. I ended up finishing my Masters and got offered a job in Malaysia straight away. \\n\\nI was packing my bags a week later and made sure to include a few Xanax. Having a panic attack without my support structure around me really scared me. \\n\\nIt is now 2 years later and I am still living here. I have worked through a lot of my problems and I haven't experienced a real attack in over a year, in fact I think last year was one of the best years of my life. I don't think that about this year, I have been struggling with different issues: stress with work, I dislocated my shoulder and haven't been able to exercise as much as I'd like, dealing with the death of close friend in a car crash, dealing with the court trials of the other close friend who was driving the car that crashed. \\n\\nIt built up until last night I started to have a panic attack. Holy fuck I forgot how horrible these things are. My heart really goes out to people dealing with this. It is not easy. \\n\\nBut I refused to allow myself to fall back into a cycle of anxiety. I got out of bed. I called my Mom and we chatted, but I could feel the attack getting worse. So I get dressed I go for a 5 km run. I did my routine of imagining the anxiety as an actual tangible attacker, something I can unleash all the pent up adrenaline on. Finished and felt slightly better. Went back to my apartment and meditated before work. Finally I got a small dose of Xanax to remove the residual effects, as I need to go dominate today, I have deadlines to reach and this fucking anxiety isn't going to stop me. \\n\\nI am terrified of falling back into the cycle, but all I feel is pride right now. I fought it. I beat it for now. It is just insane to think I emmigrated to the otherside of the world while feeling like this. All I feel is pride. I am the captain of this ship.

It has nothing to do with the task itself, just the feeling I get from staring at a computer and having to think and focus.

       " \"Last year I entered college out of state. I have had longstanding problems dealing with depressive episodes and moderate social anxiety. When I got there, the anxiety and depression intensified greatly. On the surface, I was successful; I joined a fraternity, made friends, and aced 20 units of classes. But in reality I felt like I didn't have the support network to maintain meaningful relationships. I also had a roommate I didn't particularly care for, and as someone who was already very introverted and anxious, it was very difficult to ever feel calm considering that there were ALWAYS people around, even in the library. I had difficulty fostering my passions like playing guitar and writing because I felt that I could never do them without the privacy of my own space. A lot of times I would just lie in bed with headphones on and listen to music and pretend that nothing was there. I went to counseling for several months, which helped, but only depressed me further when I was cut off by the university and referred to an outside source. I visited a psychiatrist, who gave me general health tips and told me to get over the counter lithium. I didn't try it out of health concerns and reading about the risk of kidney problems online.\\n\\nI decided to transfer back to go to a state university. I'm already so much happier now that I'm back home for the summer. I still sometimes feel very depressed, but it's mostly subsided compared to what I went through last year. I can just spend my days indoors drawing or playing guitar or reading. It's great. I hang out frequently with a few of my closest friends whenever it strikes me.\\n\\nThe problem is that while the depression went away, the anxiety didn't. It's hard for me to ask anyone outside of my 3 closest friends to hang out. Even replying to emails or sorting out my affairs for enrollment at my new university gives me intense anxiety spells. There are days when I can't leave the house because of the fear of having to ask someone if they want to get lunch. These aren't strangers either; these are some of my best friends for years. The problem is either A) big group gatherings, even if they are all friends, or B) individual meetups with people who I am only okay friends with. Either one of those scenarios results in me making a million excuses and then staying home. It's not even that I say no, it's that sometimes I just get so anxious I can't even reply to a text message inviting me to hang out. I haven't seen some of my best friends all summer out of this anxiety. Today, I was invited to one of my friends' birthday gatherings. I'm trying so hard to get the courage to show up. But I can already anticipate some of them asking me where I've been all summer, or what happened that made me transfer universities and I have no idea what I'll say. I'm still trying to decide if I should go, so if you have any advice on that end, let me know. I've always had this anxiety, but back in high school it was only mild to moderate. Ever since last year, it's been severe and never slowed down. I'm wondering if I should seek medications from a psychiatrist again, at least so I can get it under control in these types of situations and learn how to function again. I have no idea how these medications work or if it's worth starting up during a transition period like the new few weeks when I start classes. I'm honestly a little afraid of going back to classes in a couple of weeks; my anxiety might prevent me from getting help from others in my classes, or making friends at my new school. Any thoughts of advice?\\n\\ntl;dr -- Got over depression, but social anxiety has intensified to the point where I can't leave the house, which I'm worried is going to make me more depressed. Advice?\\n\\nEdit: One thing I'd like to add that I was just thinking about. I gave up drinking and smoking pot. It wasn't doing me any favors for either my anxiety or depression, and I was getting sick of feeling shitty because of it. My friends, however, didn't, and have very much ramped up their alcohol and weed consumption over the past year. Now every moderately sized social gathering seems to have drinking or smoking at the center of it. I don't have any problem with people drinking or smoking in a relaxed environment, but it's a little alienating for me to always be sober at these gatherings. I guess that's the nature of college though.\",\n",

       " 'Hello all, \\n\\nI have posted a couple times in this sub and elsewhere about my issues with anxiety, etc. I started seeing a psychologist/therapist in March for couples therapy with my partner for reasons I\\'ve posted about previously and also meet with her individually to work on things I\\'d like to work on about myself. Namely, my irritability, anxiety, and moodiness. I haven\\'t been officially diagnosed with anything. \\n\\nIt\\'s \"only\" been 5.5 months since I started talk therapy and trying CBT. I am very aware of what a lot of my issues are, and am aware of why I have these issues, which is more than I started with. In that regard, talk therapy has helped. \\n\\nOn the other hand, I have not had much success actually altering my behaviors that are symptoms of my issues. I still have unexplained anxiety, and try to diagnose why I am feeling anxious, but most of the time I cannot. For example, a couple weeks ago, I was driving to a department store to purchase a new set of cooking pans. I was calm, happy, etc. Out of nowhere, I just felt overwhelmingly anxious. I asked myself why. Was it because of traffic? No, it wasn\\'t. Was it because I was worried I was going to overspend? No, I had the means to make my purchase. I was unable to figure out where the anxiety came from, and all I could do was simply wait it out. My irritability is a smidgen better, but not much. Small, petty things still make me angry/tense/irritable, and my temper flares up. A lot of times, I can\\'t catch myself before my temper flares up to figure out why I\\'m so tense or irritable and to consciously talk myself down from it before I react externally (usually getting terse or angry with my partner). I am also still having problems with my mood in general. It varies greatly from day to day. Sometimes I am happy. The next day I could be sad or tense for literally no reason. I\\'m tired of the variance and unpredictability. \\n\\nAt this point, I feel like I know myself well enough that I realize what my issues are and why I have them, but I also know that they are so deeply ingrained in myself that I don\\'t think talking about them by itself is going to help.

I really like /b/; there is just something about its randomness and stupidity that I really love.

Or perhaps I will go in a thread that is talking about video games, but some asshole posts a pic that is CP. I don't click it, I report it, but at the same time, I worry. Can just being on a thread that has a inappropriate pic attached to it get me in trouble, even if I don't click on it?

One is that my anxieties have centered around whether or not I\\'m in a \"normal\" state of mind and if I still have control over my thoughts and emotions.

Here's my breakdown as I see it, and again, this stuff works totally different for different people and I'm not a doctor.\\n\\nXanax (alprazolam):\\n\\nPros-\\n\\n* Great for breakthrough anxiety attacks\\n* Great for knocking yourself out on a airplane, although there will be a hangover\\n* Fast acting with a bit of a rush to know its gonna be okay\\n* Great to keep in your pocket to ward off anxiety because you know you can diffuse it\\n* If you smoke trees or do psychadelics, invaluable for getting you out of a freakout\\n\\nCons\\n\\n* Very short acting, meaning re-dosing often and riding a bit of a roller coaster\\n* Very tough on memory, even .5 mg means I might get some brownout retrograde amnesia about what I did the previous day while on it.\\n* Makes my stomach feel kinda weird, like empty and just a little uncomfortable\\n* I don't drink much, but be careful with booze around xanax\\n\\nKlonopin (clonezepam):\\n\\nPros-\\n\\n*  Don't feel medicated, just feel rather normal and somewhat more confident, good for social anxiety\\n*  The long acting properties means you don't think about it which (if you have an addictive personality) means you just kinda take it occasionally, but there's no reason to be popping these more than once or twice a day (morning and night is a popular regiment)\\n*  Takes less than an hour to kick in, don't really notice it\\n* Great for productivity, doesn't cloud thinking in smaller doses and lowers inhibitions in a good way.\\n* Cuts off anxiety at its source, just seems to stop the worrying cycle\\n* Takes the edge of smoking trees without totally killing your buzz\\n* Nice warm feeling and relaxing\\n* Less amnesia\\n* Easier to get off of as it is longer lasting and tapers itself nicely\\n\\nCons\\n\\n* Not great for instant panic situations, although you'll have less of them.\\n* Not very useful recreationally (yay!)\\n\\nHaving been using it for a few weeks now, I really really like it and how it helps me be the person I knew I should be. Meditation and talk therapy are also part of my regiment, but this is one medicine change I've been very happy with.\\n\\nI find the strength to be somewhat comparable, but to me 1mg xanax feels like 1.5-2mg of Klonopin.\\n\\nBest of luck out there, it's going to be okay.\\n\\n\",\n",

I\\'m coming to terms with the fact that although I believe there is a God, I don\\'t believe a large amount of what is taught in the Catholic church.

       " \"This is my first reddit post ever. I've hardly ever even commented on anything, and by hardly ever, I mean once.\\n\\nI write really very eclectically, so I apologize if my  train of thought is not an easy one to follow. It's hard sometimes to sort feels.\\n\\nI've been chronically depressed for about 8 years, with a rather severe anxiety disorder.\\n\\nFor years, I assumed the depression was the major problem, that the anxiety was just a part of it, I hardly even saw it as anxiety. When I was in college, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and at that point, I felt like someone had taken all my years of sorrow and just told me they were irrelevant, and that it was just anxiety. I had become so protective of my depression. It had and has made me who i am &amp; ultimately, I liked that person, and she wouldn't have existed without that depression and the anxiety. I know they didn't say 'just anxiety', but that was what it felt like, since I had no personal  conscious experience with it yet. My sad had been dismissed, I had to rethink a lot of things. But with a new look at my issues, and the awareness of my anxiety, I really saw what I had been going through, how persistent, and hellish and how somatic my anxiety and my depression had been. I remembered anxiety attacks, I remembered feeling helpless and just crazy, a little. But now, I could focus on that, I could focus on it because I knew what it was.\\n\\nI have anxiety attacks sporadically. Sometimes I get them once or more a day, every day, sometimes once a week, sometimes once a month, sometimes every few days. Recently, I had gone 4 months without one severe enough to require my medication, I was really proud of that. The key was that I was with someone who made me feel valued, safe, comfortable, and happy. That's not something you can prescribe though, and it's something I was ridiculously lucky to find. Today, that changed, I woke up with an anxiety attack that didn't let up for hours on end. It hurt, I cried, I hyperventilated, I continued to cry, my mind snowballed everything out of proportion, and I couldn't speak anymore. The meds didn't help that time, I just walked into walls a lot and felt wobbly woozy.\\n\\nI kind of looked back today, at what my anxiety has been like\\n\\nI know many of you, like myself, know you're not alone in what you go through. It doesn't change anything. It's your anxiety, all I can do is be supportive and empathetic, and if you need me, I'll help. I don't know your anxiety, I don't know how deep it digs, how easily it gets triggered, and I don't know what else is at place, and where your mind takes you. \\n\\nIt's my anxiety, it's mine and you might understand anxiety, but you can't feel mine. Telling me everyone goes through this makes me feel like my problems aren't mine anymore, that they're the problems of the rest of the world, and I am helpless to change them.\\n\\nWhen I'm anxious, I knit.\\nWhen I'm anxious, I listen to rainy mood and Yann Tiersen REALLY LOUD.\\nWhen I'm anxious, I drink tea.\\nWhen I'm anxious, I do my make up.\\nWhen I'm anxious, I might need a hug.\\nWhen I'm anxious, don't hug me unless I ask, you might make it worse.\\nWhen I'm anxious, I burn white sage\\nWhen I'm anxious, I eat chocolate really slowly, I let it melt on my tongue, tiny piece after tiny piece.\\nWhen I'm anxious, I roll my eyes at myself and try to laugh at how hysterical I look.\\nWhen I'm anxious, I remember that I have managed to get through so many other attacks.\\nWhen I'm anxious, don't fucking tell me to stop being anxious.\\nWhen I'm anxious, I want to help people who are anxious, because it feels so alone, having an anxiety attack.\\nWhen I'm anxious, I dive heart first into books.\\n\\nI'm lucky enough to have someone who is supportive of me, and who tries to help me through it, but that's not most people. \\n\\nThank you, /r/Anxiety, I know you've already helped me.\",\n",

The last time I watched them the two year old split her head open because she jumped off a box while I walked to the kitchen to get the older child (5 - boy) a glass of water. While trying to assess the situation the older child kept demanding that I take care of his needs (wanting a glass of water) with no regard to his sister at all.

I do have extreme social anxiety to begin with (which is part of the reason I find it near impossible to say no) I have also felt guilty babysitting for other friends in fear that it will get back to her.

I do not want to hurt her feelings, and especially as a non parent come off as judgmental of her children or her parenting. This last time she asked I explained that I was getting my anxiety medicine adjusted a few days before she needed me to watch them and maybe it would be easier for me.

      "The bitch is that my doctor has checked my thyroid levels at least annually, and it took *seven years* for the blood work to suddenly show up bad. (Real bad.) The first few years, I was tested for everything. At some point, I dropped 25% of my body weight, and when blood tests, heart tests, etc came back fine over that year, my doctor assumed I was **a coke user** or *anorexic*! (Pure joy.) And I'm sure most here can understand how ludicrous is would be for an anxiety sufferer to get near a STIMULANT and use it regularly. I'm quite certain my heart would have exploded into a thousand pieces if I'd done coke. Coffee's a problem, you know; no way I'd seek out and use a STIMULANT —EVER!\n",

I said 'no', since at that point, my trust in doctors and tests dropped to **an all-time low**. As in, I'd trust a street junkie who self-medicates for schizophrenia MORE than anyone with an MD behind their name. Nope: I came my ass home, looked up the apparent death sentence, joined some hard-to-find groups, and realized that most of the stories were from people who had sadly LET endos radiate or chop out their thyroid without looking it up.

      "It's tempting to have it cut out, too, because by the time your bloodwork shows \"hyperthyroid\", you're in danger of \"thyroid storm\" (aka, **instant death**! Yay! JUST the thing an anxious person needs to hear!). So I was going to let myself DIE so at least my family could sue their stupid practice for MALpractice. (Not \"depression\": FURY.)\n",

      "Fortunately, I've met people who've used the anti-thyroid drugs (ATDs, and I think mostly they block iodine which is in everything) and a good diet to get themselves into remission (their thyroid functioning properly again). They can apparently \"feel\" when things aren't normal, like with diabetes and other autoimmunes. There are natural iodine blockers (peanuts, strawberries, a few other things I found on wikipedia) and other dietary tricks someone who is in remission can use to feel well. Imagine, a damned peanut working better than a benzo to help you sleep. (It's not that simple, but almost.)\n",

      "The good news is, since I've been on the MMIs, I'm feeling different (and it's only been a few weeks). I'm getting to sleep better; fewer anxiety attacks by FAR; fewer benzos (but unfortunately more cigarettes). My throat (where the thyroid is) has start to hurt, but that's apparently normal. I felt a little \"too good\" the first few days, and started exercising like a madwoman to get my atrophied muscles toned up some — bad move; caused pain everywhere. Gotta use baby steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the kicker for me, and why I'm writing a *book* on this subreddit, is that what \"they think\" CAUSES thyroid problems is anxiety and stress. Not untreated stress, since I used benzos to keep my body from suffering stress. Apparently, benzos (and SSRIs, yoga, etc) are just treating the symptoms and not a potential underlying problem that's not easy to diagnose early on.\n",

My vision suddenly got blurry; I'm picking up my first pair of Rx sunglasses today, and my eye doctor is trying to keep me from having worse symptoms. I've had a series of doctors who knew nothing about (or didn't respect) thyroid disorders. Many docs think it's just for overweight people, but really, it's autoimmune, they know VERY little about it, and you won't do well long-term with a doc who doesn't believe in thyroid disorders. I could have felt better, and saved a ton of money, YEARS ago.\n",

It seemed to be helping, but lately I've started to feel pretty awful again. My wife and I want to improve our life--pursue better careers, buy a house, etc.--but thinking about these things sends my anxiety skyrocketing. I can't even talk about them without almost panicking. It sends me into an irrational spiral, fearing that I'm a loser and my wife will get fed up and leave, etc. I'm hoping that the Cymbalta will start helping again, but in the meantime, I just need some encouragement or advice on how to deal with this.

      "Hey guys, I'm a victim of hereditary anxiety. I'm guessing the right term would be GAD because I have no reason to be anxious, life is going dandy for me. Nothing great, but nothing bad at all with it. And I was/am chronically anxious, every single day. One day it would be the shaky nervous anxiety, the next it would be the \"I'm about to throw up/diarrhea\" anxiety, and then the next would be the \"Where am I, why are the walls moving, am I in a dream?\" anxiety.\n",

      "&gt;Anyway, I only took clonazepam because my mom had it on hand once when I was having a really bad attack and near forced me to take it. I was worried it would make me feel even worse. To my surprise, it worked. With no side effect other than feeling sedated a little bit. Now I know that clonazepam is not something you take everyday ( I mean you can.. ) but it's something more for emergencies/situational use. Plus I knew I was building a tolerance fast. Only after 5-6 dosages of 0.25mg's, what used to make me feel sedated and crash out now doesn't even affect me. So I had to get onto a maintenance pill. \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Paxil was my doctor's first choice. I don't know how many mg's the pill was but I took half before bed. I fell asleep, and within an hour I woke up like I was on crack. (I've never used before, I'm just assuming.) My whole body was one giant tremor, I stumbled to my parents room because I thought something insane was happening. They calmed me down and let met sleep on their floor in case I had more trouble. I just remember being eyes wide open and my mind just racing. I tried very hard to fall asleep, I closed my eyes and in what felt like a blink 1am turned into 6am and I was wide awake. I did not feel groggy, I didn't feel like I slept at all. The next day was spent not being able to close my eye lids for more than a couple seconds and constantly shaking a limb. Mentally, this medication made me feel like a zombie. I couldn't be depressed/anxious because I couldn't focus on what was making me sad at the time. In fact I couldn't think about anything for more than 2 seconds without my mind switching to some other topic. I couldn't be sad, but I couldn't be happy either.\n",
      "\n",
      "This all was when I was about 17. Today I'm 20, near 21, and my anxiety has come back full force. But in a different way. Over the years I've noticed myself being sluggish, feeling like my brain wasn't on or something was wrong with me. But I didn't associate those feelings with anxiety since the only anxiety attacks I've had were panic attacks. Feeling nervous and shakey. Now my anxiety attacks are mellow but not in a better way. Everyday for a couple weeks I spent in bed feeling ill to my stomach. I was very dizzy and lightheaded, and confused at times. I had this feeling that you get right before you're about to puke and you want your mommy and daddy. The feeling that didn't know that paper was due or that the final was today. Constantly scared, but for no reason. I've been a vegetable in my bed for the passed few weeks. I never registered for classes next semester, because I couldn't even fathom going to class in the state that I'm in. And I've been avoiding going to work a lot. (I have a very tolerant and flexible boss and little financial responsibility at the moment, thankfully)\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went back to the doctor, said I'm not having that Paxil experience again. He prescribes me Buspar. Many hate it or don't care for it, and little love it with a passion. It has many reviews, and they are so mixed. Some people it made nervous and even more anxious, some people said it made them pass out into a pool of their own drool, some say they hallucinated. But whether people said they hated it because of bad reactions, it did nothing for them and they think it's a sugar pill, or it was a miracle drug that turned their life around, they all had one thing in common. It made them incredibly dizzy. I absolutely did not want this, dizziness to me is like being on a roller coaster you can't get off of. And if I was dizzy, for sure I would be nauseous.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; So, being so traumatized by Paxil and not wanting to be dizzy, I literally took a chip off the end of the 5mg pill(The lowest dosage it comes in and I only took half of a half, of a half) and tried to keep my mind off the potential side effects. I was on my phone when I noticed it sort of \"hit\". The phone's colors were a little more vibrant and exaggerated and everything just felt a little odd. Nothing enough to make me freak out yet. I then began yawning over and over for a good 5 minutes and felt like taking a nap, so I did. I woke up from this nap incredibly energized almost like I was on Paxil. But it didn't make me freak out like Paxil did, I just felt like I drank a ton of coffee and I could run 10 miles. My jaw was a little sore though, I think I was grinding my teeth while I was sleeping which has never happened. And while I was awake I caught myself chewing the inside of my cheek or my tongue quite a few times. But the anxiety and dizziness/confusion was gone. I thought to myself, this drug isn't addictive, it's very cheap and if I can build up a tolerance to where I'm not being shocked by overwhelming energy, then I'll definitely enjoy life again while on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;This feeling lasted all the way until night time, but wore off a little. I actually had no trouble going to sleep though. The next day I was still feeling it (I know it has a short half life, but I've never had energy like this, I wan't to believe it was this med) and being at a lower level of unnecessary energy, I was feeling actually really good. No more confusion, no more dizziness, I felt almost euphoric. Grin from ear to ear. I thought to myself, \"Is this how normal people feel? Have I just been mentally suppressed my whole life?\" I did have a moment of sadness though, because I thought for a second about how this may not last. How tomorrow I may feel just as bad as I felt a couple days ago. I did not take a pill that day, because I still had a lot of energy from taking the crumb of the pill the day before. Needless to say, I was back to square one the day after. I took the crumb again, and the anxiety went away, I got really happy again and motivated, but the power rush didn't come back. It did give me energy, but not overpowering how it was before. Like mentioned above, I was in my happy place. The day after that is today. I took another crumb, a little bigger this time. And felt happy and motivated with no anxiety. Although this time within 7-8 hours the anxiety was coming back, where as it lasted 2 days the first time, and all day the second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I have an issue.. It's depressing me a lot to think that for me to be happy in life, that I'm going to have to take this pill every single day. That I'm not the reason that I'm happy, it's these pills. I'm not truly happy, it's just artificial. It's not fixing my unbalanced chemicals, it's synthetically boosting me and it's not natural to feel this euphoric. What if I forget my pills on a trip one day? Why can't I be happy.. by myself?

      "I was diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder NOS back in January, and I've had severe symptoms since June of 2013 (the delay is diagnosis has to do with me resisting to tell anybody about my anxiety). Ever since my anxiety started last summer, I've been getting into these funks where I can't really think clearly, my quality of sleep gets really bad (even though I basically start sleeping all day), my person hygiene falls apart, and the cleanliness of my room goes to absolute shit (plates and cans all over my room). These funks usually happen after freaking out about something (that is often times irrational), and they last anywhere from two days to a week. When I get them, I feel like a shell of my normal self and it causes me more anxiety, which often times lengthens the funk. Is this normal? If so, how do y'all deal with them?\n",

      "Hello, so to make a long story short I have constant-anxiety regarding my vision. Things jolt around in my visual field and I feel like I am able to perceive less and less each day. Some days reading is literally impossible, not because it feels like my mind can't focus but because my eyes are moving too slowly or aren't able to pick up smooth strings of text. My eyes burn with soreness by 10am and as the day progresses and my mind gnaws away my anxiety continues to be fueled by this obsessive thought cycle. \n",

I used to get caught in obsessions like this when I was a kid, I was stuck flaring my nostrils for a few days, watching my breathing for a week or so, and now I've been (I suspect) mentally focusing on my visual perception for nearly 5 years. Suffice it to say that this has had a tremendously negative impact on my life, however I have been resilient enough to not let this hinder my studies nor let anyone of my friends know that I have been plagued by this obsession for half a decade. I am 22 now and I think if I knew others out there had dealt with a similar issue it would help me escape the cycle.\n",

So much so that I would spend money out of pocket to visit doctors and when they would say everything was fine, I wouldn't believe them. I thought they just weren't looking hard enough and missing something. I had no sense of \"This doesn't make sense\", I BELIEVED it. I knew I was going to die.

      "So here is my issue.  Years ago my now fiancée lied to me about sexual involvement with a very close friend.  She also lied when confronted about it.   Even the guy she was in loved with was hitting on her while we were together early on and she kept it a secret from me and claimed that she only lied and kept it a secret not to ruin our relationship because while she only had one night stands with him that I was the first person to actually be interested in her sexually, emotionally and physically all at once.  The fact that these things happened was bothersome enough but the lies are what kind of sent it out of control.  I have tried pushing it out of my mind and getting on with my life but it ends up being ok for a few months or so and then I bring it up again in fights about how I don't trust him and how I don't like him anymore especially since he claimed I was one of his best friends after I found out he was hitting on her behind my back.  Plus the fact that anytime I or anyone says anything bad about him or something he does she defends him without taking a second thought about it even if she knows she's in the wrong but if he or anyone says anything negative about me she won't peep up at all and just let it happen and agree with it unless it's stupid outrageous.  Also I should mention hat this is the type of guy to sleep with any woman that he wants through manipulation of emotions as he has done for his life and has no problems cheating on significant others or helping other people cheat on their significant others (he openly admitted this one night to all of us while drinking) and almost every woman that he has ever been with intimately has told him to fuck off in no fewer words except she stays with him as well a few others.  He claims depression which I can believe but uses it as a manipulation tactic.  She is also a bleeding heart however and I understand her fervor to help anyone who needs help or claims to need help...she has trouble saying no to people but I've noticed many small mannerisms at times that indicate she treats him differently.  When we visited him and other friends at one point we waited at the bar until he was done with work.  A few other friends met us one after the other as time passed but she seemed distant and preoccupied and didn't move to get up and hug any of them and barely greeted them but when he got there she jumped up and ran across the bar and have him a long big but and then came and sat back down mostly only paying attention to him and ignoring other conversations.  I know for a fact she is not cheating and that she would never do it but my anxiety screams at me, at the weirdest fucking times, that she doesn't love me as much as she does him or that she loves me but likes him a lot.  It hurts because I connect all of her mannerisms big or small and sometimes possibly not even in ways that she understands or intends and I could be blowing it all out of proportion but I don't think I am at all.  It's very noticeable to me and even a few of out friend group when it happens if they are looking for it but I love her.  We've been together for 3 years and are planning on being together forever but I fear that I won't be able to because of his irrational fear.  I'm worried that it will continue affecting me as long as we are together and I have to worry about it....I'm just fucking nuts.  Other than that my anxiety is under control better but this issue has been a constant issue ever since the issue occurred and won't go away.  I've tried the confrontation tactic on both of them and was told flat out no cheating was involved but that doesn't make me feel better when I feel that it's more of an emotional cheating rather than a physical one.  It just bothers me...any advice or help...please?\n",

      "I really hate doing this but it seems like anybody that i talk to doesn't really understand, so i guess I'm just going to go off here. Well to start i have two jobs, one in the morning working 7-2 and the other one working 5-2 am. My night job is only like a mile away from my house so i just walk to it however my morning job is about 20 minutes away from my house on a car so i depend on people to take me there because the craziness inside my head doesn't let me drive. Just thinking about driving gives me a panic attack when i try driving i just start shaking uncontrollably and i hate it because i hate depending off other people. now my ride's work schedule has changed so he can no longer give me rides to that job. I'm really stressed out, all of this is overwhelming my family keeps telling me, \"just ignore your fears and get a car you're 20 years old you should have a car by now you're not going to get anywhere in life without one\" i wish it was that fucking easy, i would kill to get over all these panic attacks and fears. It is really difficult for me to hang out with friends not just because im at work half the time but just the thought of going out to a party or anywhere full of people makes me freak out. I used to not be like this, i don't know what triggered all this i used to do stupid stuff that i regret deeply like drive around drunk or high. I always think that triggered it, just my stupid decisions. I am like a level 100 paranoid i have no girlfriend and its very difficult for me to get one, my last girlfriend died of an od about a year and a half ago and my way of thinking is that i cant get a girlfriend without a car, who wants a guy with no car? I cant catch a break i think im finally broken i don't know what to do i can't take meds because i hate having to rely on things like this to get by, this is how i quit cigarettes just cold turkey. To be honest that's the only thing im proud of in my life. I don't know there is so much more i could type but i know you guys have better things to do, i am not the only one with problems like these. I just wanted to vent out.\n",

      "Five-ish years ago when I was 16, I was a disgusting attention-whoring jerk.  There's an unnamed game I used to play and I spent a lot of time on one of its servers whose lax rules essentially turned it into \"4chan: The Game\".  So I spent a little over a year spouting obscenties and slurs with the rest of the regular players (I was more annoying than most and did a lot of all-caps spamming, but I ended up on good terms with most of the regulars).  Disclaimer:  I'm extremely liberal.  Some people (cough cough /r/theredpill) would call me an SJW.  I said the things I said because they were offensive and I knew they could provoke a reaction.  So what's the problem?  Why can't I just forget about it and move on and try to be a better person than my 16 year old self?  Because of the stupidest reason ever: My username was my *real* name.  So after a year of doing this, it suddenly hit me how incredibly, incredibly stupid what I'd been doing was, and so ever since, I've been having panic attacks and intermitent depression about the future.  What happens if search engines become better to the degree that searching my name brings up a post or two on a forum talking about me?  You know how sometimes random people get their 15 minutes of fame by getting hundreds of thousands of shares on a tweet?  What if something like that happens to me on future twitter and someone from that server sees it and remembers me?  There are a dozen scenarios that could completely ruin my life.\n",

And safely assuming I lose my job in this hypothetical worst-case future, I'd be completely fucking over any family that I have.  I used to be hopeful about things and the future before all this, but for these past few years, I've spent half of my waking hours feeling anxious and hopeless and disgusted with myself and above all, guilty for being a complete failure to my parents as their son.\n",

So should I take the more prestigious major?  The less one?  Is there a point, or is the reveal inevitable?

      "So I finally mustered up the courage to go to the doctor for my shitty anxiety that I've had for a while and couldnt deal with anymore. I have xanax from a friend so I was taking quarter of a bar when I woke up in the morning before work and I had a small hour long window where I was a little sleepy and loopy and then I was fine for the rest of the day. I wake up 2 hours before I go to work to get ready and the xanax times perfect so I'm not feeling like that right as I'm leaving for work. My doc said she doesn't want me driving within the first 4 hours of taking the klonopin because it will make me drowsy. Would you guys recommend taking it before bed at night and see how it carries over the next day? Or should I set my alarm an extra 2 hours before I usually wake up to take it and then go back to bed? I'm sure I'll have to try a few things out and see how I'll feel but I could use advice on how you guys time everything with your meds so you're not feeling like a dopy mess at the wrong time.

      "Up until recently my wife has always been a never-ending source or strength, love &amp; support for me. However a couple of years ago I had a particularly bad attack when I was about to start working a new full-time job. Long story short, I ended up not getting this job (because of my anxiety) &amp; my wife not long after had a nervous breakdown. She has always been the main income earner in our relationship and after not being able to keep a good-paying full-time job it all became a bit too much for her. In her words, she broke. As she explained to me not long afterwards she is desperate for me have to a consistent income. She was then put on some pretty strong medication.\n",

      "Fast forward to this year and things have slowly grown more distant between us. I have started working what is essentially my dream job however it is only between 15-20 per week and the pay isn't that great. So, I went out to find another casual job to help bring in that little extra. Sadly, when I got this other job I yet again had extreme anxiety for a few days. It was at this point my wife gave me an ultimatum that I needed to make this job work or our marriage maybe over. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I'm sure most of you will understand having that added pressure hanging over me made the task of starting this new job made it that much more difficult. But, after a few days I did overcame my anxiety and am now currently work 2 jobs and bringing in a relatively regular income.\n",

      "However after a long and difficult discussion last night my wife confessed that while she is happy about me overcoming my anxiety and sticking with this job she no longer feels she has anything more to give me in terms of support and patience when it come to dealing with my disorder. On top of that due to my sporadic incomes over the past 12 years she does not ever see us being able to have children and on top of that she feels a big part of her breakdown &amp; subsequently being on medication is because of me and the trauma she's experienced watching &amp; having to constantly support me having such horrible panic attacks. She told me that whenever she thinks of a future with me, she is now filled with sadness &amp; insecurity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do both still love each other intensely but I just don't think she  can see a positive future with someone like me.

She has also suggested that we may need to separate temporarily for now, while she gets herself together in this way. Which I said I was willing to do.\n",

The only problem is that it increases my mania and anxiety -- which are worse for me than depression.

I asked my Dr. if I could have something to balance the Wellbutrin out just a tinnnny bit. She prescribed me Xanax. Now, I'm not trying to abuse the drug. I understand the risk of addition--but my Dr. gives me so little that it makes my anxiety worse. I am constantly weighing if my panic attack is BAD ENOUGH to take one.

      "Hi this is my first post and I'm just so upset right now I feel the need to vent. I've dealt with anxiety and depression all my life. It has affected me in many ways. In my early years I've been told I was autistic, LD, and a problem child. I've been bullied all my life. During playtime in elementary I would have to go to some LD class and do work in there instead of playing so I made no friends. I got called weird and such, okay not too bad, but I still had no friends. My attempts to be friendly just ended in more bullying. Fast forward to middle school, no longer in LD classes but still bullied like crazy. People said I was a lesbian, and that I was born a boy. That I could handle I just tried to stay out of everyone's way. But the bigger guys at my school decided since everyone was saying I was born a boy that they could beat me up. That didn't end well for me. So by high school I just avoided everyone like the plague, I was alone but that was better than being picked on. Never went out with a group of girls, never went out and did anything really. Now I'm in cosmetology school, I decided to be friendly and talkative and to fight against my anxiety but I still felt left out and I didn't know why. People would walk away when I tried talking to them and little things like that. But then today this girl texts me saying everyone thinks there's something wrong with me, that I'm crazy. I ask her why they think that and she said it's just some of the little things you do. She said *girl in my class * was saying some things about me and judging me for some things. I mentioned that two girls in the class talk about/act like I do and no one thinks theyre crazy and she said that's because everyone loves them but everyone thinks they'res something wrong with you but you can talk to me any time. Now I'm contemplating not even going back. I feel like if I stepped foot in there I would have a panic attack and thinking about everyone talking about me bothers me so much I just don't know what to do. The rational me would say that they're probably just trying to get under my skin for no reason, or that she doesn't like the people in there and is trying to turn me against them but no matter how many times I tell myself that it still bothers me I'm on the verge of tears, I guess I have to go back to being alone again. \n",

I've been extremely anxious in both social situations and pointless everyday situations as well for about four years now. By pointless I mean that there are tons of irrational fears that I deal with.

I have an immensely tough time saying what I feel and expressing myself because I'm terrified that it will come out sounding stupid. I usually just end up stammering out some garbage that I don't even mean to say. I am by no means popular in high school, if that gives you any idea as to my social standings. I do have some friends, but I'm a completely different person around them. They only know me as the guy who's funny but almost tries too hard to be so. I end up doing the same thing with my family but it's a slightly different persona. I feel like i'm trapped inside this guy who doesn't act anything like me, and I hate him. I hate myself for being that guy. I hate myself for never being able to do my homework or study even though it would be so easy to do. I hate myself for being stupid, even though I know, or at least I like to believe, that i'm intelligent. Every past relationship I've had, which isn't much considering that i'm only 17, has lasted about a week. I always end up assuming the worst after every text and every meeting. \"Oh, she must hate me now.\" I think, \"I'm just too weird I can't handle this.\" Almost every aspect of my life is dominated by these fears and irrational excuses that I make to avoid doing anything.\n",

Let's just say he does things without caring about how they will affect the people around him. He doesn't give a shit that they love him and are hurt by what he does. My mother loves him unconditionally, so you can imagine how hard this has been for her. This brings me back to why I can't tell anybody, but you've probably figured it out by now: I can't have my problems become another issue that she has to deal with. The guidance counselors at my school probably have some parental disclosure thing, so that's not an option.

      "\n",
      "- I thought it was environmental, some allergen at my home, so my husband and I gutted our apt. had the carpets cleaned, washed everything with sensitive laundry soap, and still no luck. Also made no sense that my husband has no symptoms like mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "- I finally went to my dr. and she thought it could be something I was eating... however this seemed very unlikely to me, as I have an extremely varied diet and I thought for sure I would have noticed if there was a link there.

When I'm in the middle of an attack, I notice my breathing becomes short and I cannot concentrate.

N.Fowleri lives in warm water so that's adding to my fear.

      "I am a 24 year old male. I have a girlfriend of six years who makes a decent living and everything about my life is above average. I'm finishing up my first year of law school. I've noticed that, within the past year, my anxiety has hit an all-time high. I've always been an anxious person, but it has been generally manageable. This is different. This is affecting my grades and my relationship. I should also note, for the sake of disclosure, that I have been diagnosed with ADHD when I was seven years old. I did not receive medication until I was 22 because of my parents. At 22, I received a low dosage of Adderall, and I went from a C student to a straight-A student. I could actually focus. It was amazing and has been extremely helpful. I should also note that my anxiety is still there if I don't take the Adderall (I tried this because I thought the Adderall was the culprit). I have also done recreational drugs before. I smoke weed once in a while, and it helps me relax. I have done Acid once, years ago. I have done a few pain killers recreationally, but nothing recently. I smoke cigarettes occasionally, and I like good beer. I hardly ever drink during the week, though. I have also, in the past, had a prescription for Ambien and Xanax to help me sleep. I have had sleeping problems for as long as I can remember. I like being awake at night, which screws me up when I have to wake up at 6:00AM for class.\n",

      "Ok, first off - a year ago I had just graduated with my bachelor's degree. I had a hard time finding a job, but I finally found one working in tech support for a company that treated its tech support staff like garbage. But, $9/hr, even if I was being treated like crap, was better than $0/hr. I spent six months at that job, and progressively got more and more unhappy and anxious. I felt like I was going nowhere and nothing I could do would make my supervisors happy, so I stopped doing any more than the bare minimum. It was during this six months that I decided to apply to law school, which I ended up getting into. So I quit that job. Not long after I quit that job, I had a huge falling out with a good friend of mine, who \"took\" three of my other friends with him, which didn't help things. But I just told myself that I knew who my real friends were, and let it go.\n",

The insane homework load caused me to literally freak out if I didn't get it done RIGHT AWAY because I was afraid that I would forget something if I didn't. Normally, this sounds like a good way to do your homework, but it quickly got to the point that if I didn't get EVERYTHING done RIGHT AWAY, I would fret over it to the point of loosing sleep or becoming irritable with my girlfriend, which caused fights and even more lost sleep and anxiety. This anxiety about my homework has spilled over into every aspect of my life. I get anxious about unimportant things that I need to do, because I feel like I will forget about them and they will never get done. I would become anxious that I would end up pissing my girlfriend off if I did something, anything, wrong. When she acted at all abnormal, I would freak out and demand to know what I did wrong. This usually doesn't end well and I hate it. We love each other very much. I seriously don't know what I'd do without her and it kills me when we fight over something I can't seem to control. \n",

The best way I can possibly describe what goes through my head every time I have a conversation with anyone outside of my normal circle is\n",

      "\"Don't say something stupid. You're not talking enough, no talk more. It's silent, stop the silence. Now stop talking, they obviously don't like you. But they have to like you. Don't bring up that topic, why the hell would you do that? Now they think you're stupid. Wow your voice sounds really weird. You just mispronounced that word. What were you thinking about just now? That one word, oh yea. Now they don't understand what you were just saying. Holy fuck man can't you even finish a simple thought? No wonder everyone you meet thinks you're retarded. Does everyone really think I'm retarded? Now it's silent again and they think you're an asshole and don't want to talk to them. Wait, were they talking to me or someone behind me? Ugh, I really would like to weigh in my opinion but they'll just think it's stupid. You should make small talk. What is small talk? The weather? That's stupid. Whatever. Oh yes, the weather. Ok that's over with, what now? Awkward silence. Holy shit, this is awkward. Look at the ceiling. Look out the window. Pretend to check something on your phone. Oh wait, that will make them think you're rude. Put your phone away, even though they probably just noticed I didn't actually check anything on my phone so now they think I'm just rude and now it's been awkward for like ten minutes.\" when in reality it had probably been all of 30 seconds. \n",
      "\n",
      "And this is what happens almost every single time I'm trying to talk to someone I don't know. I have rare times of clarity and anxiety-free social interactions, but they are few and far between. People have noticed that I've gotten worse at this, too. The one thing that has been making me worse has been when people ask  \"why?\" or tell me I need to \"confront my fear,\" like I haven't tried, or that I \"should be ok\" or \"you're life is so great. It's so much better than most people's lives. People would kill to have what you have. Why are you so anxious? What do you have to be so unhappy about?\"\n",
      "It's like, yes, I get it, I suck at interacting with people. I suck at being normal. I can't make small talk. Yes, I know that's a bad thing. Yes, you're right, I should try harder. I'm not doing enough to fix this. Yep, you're right, I can't be a lawyer if I can't talk to people. Yes, I understand that I'll never get ahead in life. Yes, I basically suck as a person. \n",

      "And then I tell myself, everyday, that the stuff I'm worrying about is normal. That I shouldn't worry so much. I have a good life. Stop thinking about that. That won't happen. Stop being sad, you have nothing to be unhappy about. Look at your life. You're fine. You could be poor. you could have a crappy car. You could have shitty parents.

So I went to some mental hospital for a few days and they're like eh he's not gonna kill himself, send him home. So I went home and the lack of attendance died down a bit, only to pick up like 2 months later. The next year I got a [504](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/504faq.html), parents stay in touch with my teachers and all that fun stuff. From there on my attendance only gets worse. Fast forward to 11th grade, I've been absent around 25 times since September, and just the thought of school just gives me this *I can't keep on doing this* mentality, so I don't really know what to do. My narcissistic parents just threaten me, and take away electronics (AKA the only thing I still enjoy doing) when I don't go to school, so I usually end up sleeping for like 7 hours during the day. When they ask what's wrong and I tell them, they don't seem to register it either, because they keep on asking and show little sympathy, more of like a \"How do we deal with this little shit.\" and so yeah, I'm depressed, I have social anxiety, and I can't get myself to go to school on a regular basis. For that to happen, the wiring of my brain would have to mend back together or something. Thanks for listening. Sorry\n",

      "I never really had anxiety much until I was 23 and in the military.  Believe it or not, I feel like most of my anxiety can be traced back to when I was getting promoted at a ceremony that was supposed to be exciting.  I never had an issue with crowds or being the center of attention- I was so excited for this event!  So I'm up there in front of approximately 100 people standing at attention (Standing straight with arms to the side;not moving).  I start shaking a little bit; I've had my normal 5 cigarettes and Monster energy drink by this time of the day (9am).  I think nothing of the shakes and continue to wait my turn to get promoted.  As I'm waiting I notice the shakes get worse- it's not just my legs anymore, now I can feel my back starting to quiver, taking away from the picture perfect sailor (spare me the Navy jokes, I've heard them all :D) I had always been.  I break my thousand-yard stare only to see other people watching, nudging the person next to them to look at me, thinking WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY??  I fight this feeling I have, heart racing, breathing constricted- determined to stay as still as possible for this event.  At this point my back is spasm-ing, legs shaking- I'm a fucking mess.  I made it through the ceremony somehow, as people walked by to congratulate me some asked if I was okay, some smirked, and of course all my friends teased me relentlessly about it.  This small event will go on to define the next few years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The teasing subsided after a few days, and it was business as normal.  Other people got awards in front of the squadron and I stood at attention just fine for them in the crowd watching them, wishing I could have kept my composure for my big day.  I was then due to receive an award for my outstanding service for an inspection we had.  Many others were to receive commendation as well, so I was in the third row receiving the award.  I stood there anxiously while everybody crowded the hangar to observe the ceremony.  My heart started racing, muscles shaking again- I knew this dreaded feeling all too well.  I had to leave.  Luckily I managed to get out of it by telling my superior that I could NOT stand there, and I was allowed to wait outside.  I went to see a doctor after this incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor told me I had an essential tremor that was made worse by stress and anxiety and I was prescribed propanolol.  I didn't notice many benefits while taking it but I could tell by the horrible feelings when I missed a dose.  I continued taking it regardless.  After disgracing myself twice through these awards I started thinking that \"What if I have a panic attack simply watching others get an award\".  The Captain Picard of my brain replied \"Make it so\".. and simply from thinking that thought I caused myself to have anxiety while not being the center of attention.  Damnit, Picard.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Every time an award was to take place, I was nowhere to be found.  Avoiding the feelings I dreaded most.  At this point, I ONLY had anxiety at award ceremonies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward 4 years, I volunteer to go to Iraq (to avoid doing another deployment on a boat).  No anxiety that any normal person wouldn't have during this deployment.  Everything was business as usual for me.  Turns out the U.S. was leaving Iraq 5 months after I got there.  We were faced with the choice of either going back to the U.S. (where my Navy contract would expire and I would be a civilian again), or take reassignment to Afghanistan.  I chose Afghanistan.  While in Afghanistan I was able to take 2 weeks of \"vacation\".  The military puts you on a plane and sends you where you want to go.  I returned home.  Spent two weeks with my family and on my flight from XXX-Atlanta (where I would return to Kuwait, and ultimately- Afghanistan) I had a panic attack on the tarmac headed to the runway.  My irrational mind contemplated telling them to turn around, or even just running out the emergency exit.  I was terrified.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I arrived to Atlanta airport and sought the doctor there, as I had 9 hours until my next flight.  I kept thinking that if I had a panic attack on my last flight, this next leg of my trip would be unbearable as it was a 14 hour flight.  I was prescribed Xanax.  ZZZzzzZZZ all the way to Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "While back in Afghanistan all I could do was dwell on this horrible incident.  Why did this happen to me again?  Was this going to be a recurring event?  I've wanted to be a pilot since I was a child and planned on flight school after this- can I still do that?  Hundreds of questions about myself ran through my mind.  I met with a counselor in Afghanistan and was prescribed Prozac.\n",
      "\n",
      "The counselor helped a little bit, and I'm not entirely sure if the medication helped at all because I still felt anxious.  Keep in mind that I was never involved in a direct gun fight with the enemy.  Once again I felt horrible because here I am in this horrible place and I have anxiety not war-related.  Granted there were a few close calls- a group of rockets passed between 10-20 feet over my head while I was working at a guard shack.  I calculated that from the distance they were fired from had they aimed just a few centimeters lower, I might have been hit.  I'm thankful that I wasn't.  We also got mortared- a lot.  That's scary because you never know where they are going to hit until they land.  Your body adapts and you become used to it to a certain extent.  I did receive my award for service over there though with the help of Xanax.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flight to the U.S. did not bother me when I left.  I guess I was so excited to come home that I forgot that I was supposed to be afraid of flying now.  I returned home and everything was fine and I separated from the military and returned home for civilian life.  I had big plans though.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My fiance and I moved to Florida where I would attend college and take flight training to satisfy my goal of being a pilot.  While very heavy on the wallet- I flew.  I was very good at it and not once did I experience the anxiety that I once knew all too well.  Life was great.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Until Christmas break.  During the few weeks off of school from the beginning of December until early January I had time to think- too much time.  I played a lot of video games and didn't really do a whole lot with myself except think.  I was in the Navy Reserves and had a similar panic attack at an award ceremony one weekend- can't stand still, back tremors, the works.  This got me to thinking.  If I still have that issue, what if I have a panic attack on the plane?  What if I have a panic attack while getting a haircut or something crazy like that?  Well, the good ole Captain Picard \"made it so\".  I could barely keep my head still getting my hair cut that weekend, and I was heavily medicated on the flight to and from home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back to Florida, time to fly again.  I flew once, when I got back and decided I could not do it anymore.  I was on the verge of a full blown panic attack for the entire training flight.  Much to my dismay I dropped out of the flight training course citing \"lack of funds\".  So here I am in Florida, not flying, embarrassed, ashamed.  What was I to do?  I kept going to school and thought of back up plans.  \n",

      "I missed a lot of class that semester, failed a class, and was actually house-ridden for about a week and a half.  I refused to get in a car or go anywhere.  I decided to call the local VA Hospital and schedule an appointment.  I need help and I knew it.  The first thing the VA wanted to do was give me medication.  I didn't want to take medication as the onset of the problem was quite rapid for the most part, so I was determined to get through it without medication.  But they prescribed it anyways and I took it home and took 1 dosage of this SSRI.  They also set me up with an appointment at a Veteran Center- not run by the VA, but there to support Veterans.  I went to this appointment the next day and met with a counselor there who has thus far given me so much help I don't think I could ever repay her.\n",

      "She was an alternative-medicine type therapist and helped me talk some things out and give me some coping strategies.  She taught me a technique called EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) that involves tapping on certain points to calm oneself down.  It actually works, sometimes fast, sometimes it takes time, but it works.  That, combined with the coping strategies, got me on my feet and out the door again.  \n",

      "For the year or so after that, it was a combination of meeting with her, but also trying to find \"The Cure\" to my problem on the side.  I think we've all been there.  The Cure, doesn't exist for most.  I tried looking at vitamin deficiencies, random herb pills that worked short-term at best and all sorts of other things.  I didn't find my Cure.  If you've read this far, I doubt you have either.  \n",

      "The past year or so has been a rollercoaster- some days I would be on top of the world, others- anxiety through the roof.  Through 2 books I've been reading, and my counselors help, I have finally got on the road to recovery.  The books are called \"At Last a Life: Anxiety and Panic Free\" by Paul David and \"Hope and Help for Your Nerves\" by Dr. Claire Weekes.  Just for the record I am not affiliated with them and am not making a cent should you buy their E-books on Amazon (which you can read on your cell phone, as well).\n",
      "\n",
      " I know I'll have days where I am an emotional wreck but through these books and my session, I have learned to not fear fear.  It has been my biggest struggle.  That, and projecting my fear onto future events which eventually come true because that how I pictured they would.  Now, I welcome every bit of anxiety because it gives me another chance to prove to myself that I can do it.  Every time I welcome these feelings, I feel them lose their strength on my life just a little bit.  All of this didn't happen overnight.  Some of it did, after reading a few chapters of the books before bed I would feel more equipped to handle the day's stresses and challenges but I faltered occasionally. \n",

That person hasn't gone through the trials that I (or you) have.  All we can try to do is be a stronger person than we were yesterday.  I will warn you, though- it involves getting out of your comfort zone.  Take baby steps.  For me it was like \"Okay, I'm going to find a barber I'm comfortable with, and go there for a while\".  Believe me, once you start doing things that you never thought you could do again, you will realize how little power anxiety has over you.  \n",

Several times I haven't been able to put the ticket in the slot because I shake so bad, the bus driver has even taken it from me and put it in himself, and I hate the thought of sitting beside anyone, or opening the door on my way out.. it's ridiculous). As well as that, I am nervous about the time I spend at the place I volunteer at. The people there are around my age (big red flag, I'm way more comfortable around people way older as I feel they don't care as much), and I have to interact with them fairly often when I'm there which basically makes me want to puke.\n",

I have been there for 1 1/2 months now, and I've probably gone there a total of 10-15 times. No one even knows my name, which is okay, but I'm sincerely scared they think I'm mentally retarded (my stuttering when I do manage to talk), sketchy (my constant shaking or nervous look), or maybe they just think I'm arrogant as hell which is clearly not the case.\n",

Unrelated to that, even driving to work/school whatever, if a cop starts following me I get worried, it's mostly anxiety over being arrested (I have no reasons as to why I would, aside from a bad driving record).  The anxiety is mostly due to being constrained, you know a panic attack makes you feel like you need to get away (fight or flight) and being detained would obviously prevent that.  Now to clarify, I don't feel like the police/government/whatever is out to get me by any means (as a diagnosed Paranoid Schizophrenic would).  I just get nervous over stupid things like that.  I just want some sort of re-enforcement that these feelings are typical of Anxiety and that I'm normal.  \n",

Anyways, I had an honest talk and said look. I'm like 100% sure I have some type of anxiety order now. And I'm working to figure out the causes/ways to deal. And I just thought he should know I'm working on it, and if we love each other we will be just fine. Anyways, he wasn't awake, so I had woken up him to tell him this. We talked for like 15 minutes, and then said he should go because he needs to study which makes sense. I wasn't upset on the phone call, I was just telling him. Honestly, the whole time the situation was surreal. So, I told him good luck on his final today, and he said \"thanks.\" He sounded so defeated and tired, that this whole time I've been freaked out.

Anyway, the doctor responded by immediately cutting her off and offering nothing to replace it; and this doctor is completely deaf to every argument my girlfriends throws at her regarding how unbearable her anxiety has become as a result.

      "I have regular panic attacks, for no real reason I get head aches almost every day, numerous times through out the day my balance is pretty bad, but I have had it looked at and they didn't think anything was wrong with it I jumble my words up a lot, so if I think about saying Great or Fantastic sometimes the word 'Grantastic' will come out, rather than just picking up. reading has become a lot more difficult, and I can't seem to comprehend what I'm looking at. And I think about death nearly all day. I am genuinely, 100% convinced I am dying.\n",
      "Does anybody else experience this? I have been to the doctor, and mentioned a few symptoms but usually what happens when im at the doctor is I don't feel as anxious anymore because I am in a safe place, so the rational side of my brain tells me not to worry about the headaches or dizziness because it's all in my head but as soon as I leave the surgery im so mad at myself for not requesting scans or more tests or just generally mad at the doctor for not picking up on it.\n",
      "My anxiety is pretty bad. I hate public transport, not because it's incompetent but because there are so many people. I hate busy roads, like i mean i get very very stressed out crossing the street. Supermarkets are my worst nightmare. I even get very tense walking past gas stations. My mind is constantly flooded with awful thoughts of how I'm probably going to die any second and I'm very aware of threats around me and try to avoid them at all costs.\n",
      "Are the above symptoms anything to be worried about? Or should I just chalk it up to some pretty bad anxiety and keep speaking to a psychologist? I know it seems crazy, believe me. When I am not in an anxious state, I realise how silly I look. But right now, I don't care what you think because I think I'm dying.\n",

      "I'm a 23 year old male. I have anxiety, it does affect me in social situations generally, some places much worse than others, a lot of times I don't even appear to have it at all though like gym as I feel confident in that environment. Anyway, the place where it most affects me is when it comes to dating, so much so it's never really been possible. I dated one girl (who I still have some contact with) when I was 15 almost 16. It was not a good experience, didn't even kiss her apart from on the cheek. So technically I've never really kissed anyone or had sex. I would never tell anyone because people would be shocked. I'm not a bad looking guy, I'm in really good shape (I spend a lot of time in the gym, it vents frustration) I do get a fair amount of interest from women, I think most people think I'm pretty experienced. People would just think I was weird if they knew I hadn't dated really at all. \n",

      "I think the anxiety derives a lot from fear of 'doing it wrong', whether that be kissing, sex etc etc. At 23 I know women expect you to be experienced and know what you're doing and not like a 14 year old fumbling around. So I feel stuck. How do I even begin to combat this? There isn't really anyone I'm interested in who likes me and even if there were I'd be too scared to tell them or even get into anything. I don't want to sleep with a prostitute or anything, I don't think I could forgive myself for doing that.

The tingling sort of went away at times, mainly when I tried to relax, but its back today.\n",

So him and his brother witnessed me having what was one of the worst panic attacks I've had for a long time, except I don't think they really knew what was going on because at no point did I tell them 'I'm having a panic attack'. They knew there was obviously something wrong but I played it down and tried to act like I was fine after freaking out and rode out the attack on my own for a good hour and a half.

By the end of the week, when I got the new prescription I mentioned to the pharmacist that I was still having difficulty sleeping, despite the morning dosage.

I'm noticing this when I do sit down to meditate, and I find that I can read a page in a book without thinking about what I should eat for lunch next Thursday. So there are some definite pros, to go with the main downside of not getting more than 4-5 hours of crappy, intermittent sleep, and often feeling like I just want to snooze for another 2-3 hours when my alarm goes off.\n",

      "\"Invite your anxiety in for a cup of tea, but also remember to leave the back door open so that the anxiety can come and go as it pleases. You'd be surprised how powerful acceptance truly is. The moment you try to even remotely push your anxiety away is the moment anxiety will ask, \"What's for dinner? This snack you just fed me was delicious!\" Good luck trying to get anxiety to leave anytime soon after. No worries, just realize you've accidentally given it a snack, and wait until it decides to leave. If you try to throw anxiety out of the door, it will just come back even more pissed and ready to fuck up your shit. Hope this helps. As a beginner, I recommend just simple breath meditation and watching how the breath moves, especially in relation to different mind states. Once you are more capable of concentration, you'll get better and better at letting any thought or emotion come and go for a cup of tea. Sometimes it can turn into hours of tea. The most important thing to remember is this: the only way to truly let something go is to first allow it to be there. Only then when you are able to dive into the vast jungle of demonic ugliness can you grow power through understanding and cultivated awareness. How can we let go of something we cannot see?\"\n",

It was hard to make friends because they already had friends from their schools. It was difficult to find people who actually gave me a chance to speak and get to know them. As a result I never really had many friend. Half way through the first term of year 7 the bullying began. Kids found out I was from a private school and so they picked on me. By half way through the year it got so bad I changed forms from 7E to 7B to get away from it. That was fine but it meant making new friends. Made a couple but bullying still went on as it spread around the whole year.\n",
      "By year 9 the bullying had got even worse. I was a late developer and so I wasn't exactly looking like a girl as much as everyone else. This meant (of course) that everyone (by this time everyone knew everyone so word spread fast) picked on me for being a \"man\". It doesn't sound that bad but people held signs up in lessons saying I was a man, they would shout all manor of insults to me all the time, they pushed me over in the corridors and they made me feel terrible. they signed petitions and handed them too me telling me I should kill myself. There was one part of the school which was a blind spot from the CCTV and so a group of lads would wait there for me to pass, they would grab me and grope me because \"they wanted to see if I was growing boobs yet\" which of course I wasn't.\n",
      "Year 10 and 11 were equally shitty and by this time I was finally becoming more like a woman! I hated my life, one day I very nearly jumped off a cliff near my house but the only thing that stopped me was knowing there wouldn't be anyone to feed the cat. Instead I chose to self harm. I was and still am haunted by nightmares of school.\n",
      "So sixth form started, I relocated and moved to a different town all together that was about 3 hours away from my old town. I suffered from panic attacks and break downs as I struggled to fight through my anxiety. I just assumed the same thing would happen again. I had counselling for half a year and managed to gain some decent friends and with it I gained confidence. I breezed through the second year of sixth form and for the first time ever I loved being in a learning environment!\n",
      "I am now 1 year clear of sixth form and I thought everything was awesome. Recently though my anxiety has come back and hit me like a train. I can't go anywhere or do anything without shaking and panicking. To top it off most of my friends have gone to uni and so left me. The few friends I have left aren't that supportive as they move on in their lives. Then, the start of this month, my best friend died. He was involved in a head on collision in Edinburgh and 3 days later he passed away. He was the most wonderful person I had ever met and he was so supportive. I truly felt like I had found a friend for life. We told each other so much and we had such fun together. Now he's gone the two people who I had left that linked me to him (who I thought were good friends of mine) have turned their backs on me and have left me to my own. I don't know what to do. I hate my life again and I need to get out of this town. I can't find a job anywhere and I can't think of anything getting better. I have barely any friends and I have no life outside of what little amount of weekend work I have. I need to escape this circle of losing everything and then getting back on my feet to lose everything again. So yeh, that's what I needed to get off my chest. Sorry for the rant.\n",

      "During my last appointment with my doctor, he had suggested that i take a vitamin D supplement. I live in the northwest so he said that most of the people he sees are deficient to some extent and he recommends it to most of his patients. We were talking about the various benefits which include improving brain function, possibly preventing neurological disorders later in life, it acts as a mild anti-depressant, among the obvious known benefits. So i told him i would try it and he wrote me a prescription for 50000 ui capsules once per week for 12 weeks. This seemed like a lot to me considering that most supplements are around 400 ui per day. So, naturally i did some research and found that this is a normal amount given to people who are deficient and because it stores in fat and releases over time that you only take it once per week. Also, in my research i read about the rare bad things it can possibly cause, even people reporting panic attacks from taking it. Great. Now, like every medicine i get i don't want to take it. Even though the possibilities of it working great or even just doing nothing at all far exceed the possible verrrry rare negatives im having a tough time.

We took the 2nd one because the 1st one was a van and we thought it would be better to save that for a family or someone with a lot of bags.) So I started freaking out. I might have started to have a panic attack but I'm honestly not sure. Because at that point my boyfriend's sister started whispering jokes that made me laugh. At Penn station you don't know where you're going until the train arrives. Once you find out where the train in going to be you and a million other people run down these scary metal stairs. That part made me freak out pretty bad. Once we got on the train there was this man and his son sitting across from us. His son might have been scared too because he kept trying to make him laugh. His jokes made me laugh too so that was nice. He also explained where the shuttle we'd have to take to the theater would be and he said it was very easy. Which he was right about. On the way back to the train after the concert was over me and my boyfriend's sister got separated. I got so scared. I tried to close my eyes and relax but the guy I ended up sitting next too freaked me out.

I didn't notice how quiet and nervous I was until I was around 10. Everyone always said I was just \"shy,\" etc. By the time I reached high school, what had started as just a general inability to speak to most people (extreme social anxiety) had become more like depression. I felt that there was something wrong and broken within me and didn't know what to do. I often thought people would be better off without me, or that if I was gone, no one would miss me. This did not make my crippling social anxiety any more manageable.\n",

It always seems like a better option to go ahead and aim for 10 or more hours of sleep, or even to just stay in bed rather than start the day. I've also been having panic attacks and getting angry. I'm not generally an angry person. I've always been very chill and calm, but lately I lash out at people for no reason, especially my poor boyfriend, who is so supportive, and someone I'm so thankful for.

      "\n",
      "Some people with  anxiety develop a condition called \"air hunger\" the feeling of not being able to get a satisfying breath. You might find yourself constantly yawning or perhaps you feel as though you cannot fill your lungs completely. This condition can range from being annoying to completely debilitating depending on how severe it is. I suffered from this for over a year and spent a lot of money going to doctors and taking tests to no avail. After a really tough year I'm happy to say that I was able to reverse this and restore my normal breathing pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short, theres a couple reasons why you feel air hunger. First off it may be because your body has low carbon dioxide levels as a result of stress. The other reason being that your body over breathes when stressed out to get ready for the \"fight or flight\" response. People with anxiety find themselves under constant stress so If you continue to over-breathe over a prolonged period of time, then your body deems your increased breathing volume as \"normal.\" As a result you will constantly feel short of breath unless you take in big breaths/yawn. \n",
      "\n",
      "Your goal is to break this habit and restore your oxygen/carbon dioxide levels back to a healthier level. You can do this by practicing the Buteyko method. Dr. Buteyko spent decades researching how our breathing affects the body. The basic idea is to practice simple exercises that train your body to breathe less. Think of over breathing as an addiction that you are trying to stop, it's tough at first but you will beat this as long as you stick with it. I have left a couple links that offer guidance and techniques to restore your natural breathing rhythm. Many folks have messaged me about the great progress they have made so I'm confident that this can help you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, it's important that you take proactive steps to combat the source of your stress to make this process easier. I personally took up meditation to help alleviate my stress and relax my breathing. Youtube has a lot of great meditation videos that are worth a listen.\n",

      "I've always suffered from anxiety and known that and I have great control over it but lately it's comeback and I think may be a result of a relationship. So here's the back story: I recently started a relationship with a girl who used to simply be a friend that I made up every which reason for not being able to chase after her (was secretly crushing on her and we were close friends) and then she came and showed interest in me and I went right for it. I am madly in love with her and find her to be the greatest thing ever and know I am also a bit clingy. Anyways we've been together for almost two months and in the last week or so I feel like she's distanced her self greatly from me and is overall irritated by everything I do. It feels like she's degenerated from being my significant other to a simple acquaintance. I'm assuming this is a trigger for me as I've been in a relationship before where they showed interest and I perused to be lead on then dropped like a bad habit and blamed my self for it thinking i went wrong somewhere. Now I have a feeling of inadequacy and have that whole \"I'm doing something wrong and don't know what\" feeling and its acting as a trigger bring multiple break downs a day which I have been free of for about 3 years now. I have already talked to her about it and she told me that its not anything I'm doing things are just bothering her and she prefers not to talk about it. Regardless I cannot shake the feeling I'm whats wrong and every little thing she dose that feels like she's trying to distance herself from me acts as a trigger, it could be anything some thing as little as no response to a text I sent to her, or even receiving a one word response to a text I sent to her expecting a larger response. Anyways I cannot think of any solutions aside from breaking up with her which is the last thing I want to do and want to ask for any ideas on how to cope with this (no meds please). If you have no ideas but took the time to read thanks for listening. Other general info if needed: Age: 16 (Junior in High School), No meds or any drug use.

      "I was diagnosed with GAD more than 30 years ago. This label is like a stigma. Anytime I mention a new health concern, everyone seems to act like it's all in my head, so I'm reluctant to even mention anything anymore. I just tend to treat everything like it's a new symptom of my anxiety. This past few months, however, my symptoms got slowly worse until they were totally out of control. When I finally did go to see the doctor about it, it turned out that I had developed vertigo due to damage to my inner ear from a car crash I was in about 20 years ago. The vertigo was causing some of my symptoms directly (dizziness, lack of balance, and loss of coordination) as well as triggering a whole bunch of other symptoms due to the unsettling nature of feeling like everything is spinning around me. If feeling like the whole world literally just turned upside-down several times each hour won't make you feel anxious, nothing will.\n",

She doesn't sleep most nights, has terrible panic attacks and has had a couple times where I've had to talk her out of suicide. I want to take her to get professional help but it bothers her so much and I hate to make her sad. I want to do whats best for her.

I'm driving there because it gives me a sense of security being behind the wheel. However, once we get there, we have to get loaded up onto a ferry (car and all) and take a close to an hour boat ride over to the island. I'm TERRIFIED. I'm not terrified of being on the boat, I'm terrified that once on it, I can't get off of it. Keep in mind that going to lake eerie is nothing new to me. My mom, sister and I used to go up there every summer for 13 years. I know what to expect. I'm just not sure how to deal with the anxiety though. It's really, really bad.  Almost to the point of hindering our trip to even go up there. I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice on how to manage a panic attack, or how to help push some of these thoughts pig of my head? I'm afraid once I drive all the way to the dock, that ill have to turn around and drive right back. Not to mention the hotel charges you for canceling on them. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Obviously I don't want to be too rigid as that encourages relapsing but there's no reason I can't save the treats and late night gaming sessions for the weekend instead of 24/7.

But as soon as my schedule is clear and I find myself aimlessly surfing reddit or watching the same youtube videos over and over again my mind starts to wander.

If I can't find something, I'll create something for myself to do. Anything is better than nothing because nothing brings on the thoughts, which creates the feelings, which creates the loops, which creates the cycle.

I have never taken prescription medication before until July 2014 I started on 1mg lorazepam (Ativan) once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and then .5mg at night. I also take 15mg of escitalopram (Lexapro) at night. So I've been on these meds for about four months now. In the morning when I wake up I am very anxious and don't feel \"normal\" until I take my first Ativan. I start feeling a little anxious around the afternoon and take my second and the last one right before I go to bed. I am dependent on this Ativan because once I skipped 3 days of it and had a severe panic attack that was the worst I've ever had in my life. \n",

I am realizing that his disorganization and clutter is a HUGE trigger for me. Because of that, this move is making me completely balls-to-the-wall anxious.

A lot of my stress comes from the fact that his things are all over the house (he's lived there for a year) and its difficult for me to find room for my things. I dont know what of his I can toss, move, whatever, to make room for my stuff. \n",

While I am happy to have my clothes in their place, there is now a large amount of his clothes sitting on the dresser for DAYS now. I don't want to remove his things to make room for mine, only to have his stuff clutter the space instead. I am becoming a nag because I have to constantly ask him to clean stuff, make room, etc., and even with the constant reminders he still wont do it sometimes. I HATE feeling like a nag and I don't want to be in a relationship where that's the role I have to take. I'm worried that this difference in living styles is going to be the thing that breaks our relationship. We are great partners in every other way, though, and I dont want my anxiety over his living style to end things. But honestly, I seriously cannot live like this. I hoping that once things are moved in and organized (and trial over at work) that my anxiety will be much better. I am not on meds currently, because I had to go get a blood test before my MD will give me meds.

I have always dealt with anxiety, primarily health anxiety. I tend to worry about that which I have no control over. My earliest memory of anxiety was worrying the roof of my mouth was eroding: I was four. I've been seeing specialists since the fifth grade, but I don't feel I've made much progress at all. Up until last year, my anxiety had been tolerable. I was able to suppress it and actually enjoy my life to some degree, I very rarely had panic attacks and only became anxious when in crowds (a concert, movie theater... I did not enjoy gym class). In January of 2011 I became concerned with my environment and the effect it may have had on my life. I live in very close proximity to a main road and an oil refinery, and I have neighbors in my area who use a fireplace to heat their homes. I obsessed over organic food and detoxification, I demanded to know the source of my vegetables and whether they were treated with pesticides and I began to withdraw from friends. I became less interested in school and here is where I believe my anxiety amplified.\n",

There was an incident involving an oil furnace, and since I have hypersensitivity to fumes I nearly went mad). I saw my godmothers home as a utopia, an environment where I may finally focus on schoolwork and seek treatment for my mental health. I finally moved into my godmothers in June of 2011.

I have been to the emergency room three times in the past month due to fear of infection, and I have been reassured ad nauseum that there is none. I am not overly concerned of whether I am already infected; I am concerned with my susceptibility and risk of infection. My back, though healing, has open scabs and I cannot even shower anymore without noticing blood on the towels. I notice blood on my pillows. I notice blood on my T-shirts (Actually, I should note, I have been prescribed minocycline and a topical cream for my acne, so yes, I have been given medication). I try to treat my wounds as best I can with an antibiotic ointment. Others find my hygiene to be obsessive. I am doing everything I can to prevent infection. Yet I still worry.

      "So I've had GAD for a little over two years now and I've gotten really good at managing the physical symptoms: racing heart, constant butterflies, feeling like I'm going to pass out etc. But what I think I've taken away from it all is an obsession with my own thought processes. It's hard to explain. I used to be quite capable of chilling out by myself playing video games or whatever, without analysing myself, and my thoughts turning in on myself all the time. It's like I'm not even freaking out over anything specifically, just I feel a constant inescapable need to analyse my thoughts. So I'll go through these weird mental rituals where I'll constantly be trying to identify thoughts and dismiss them without reacting too much to them. I've read that you should allow your thoughts to do this without recoiling from them as this will eventually train your mind into no longer associating introspective thoughts as something negative. It's this which I'm having a problem with; how is it done exactly? How do you begin the process of relaxing into thoughts if you're so used to constantly analysing your mind and trying to figure out? Ultimately I just want to train myself to be comfortable inside my own head. I'd really appreciate some advice from anyone who can relate at all as I'm struggling.\n",

It's not too bad -- I'm almost never more than 10 minutes late, more often like 5 -- but it is consistent and my employer in particular has complained about it (I'm hourly, so I don't get that sort of attendance freedom).\n",

      "For a while now, I've been in between deciding whether or not I am going to travel again or try to finally move out. Like I said, I know this sounds very privileged white guy of me, but I've saved my money myself and worked hard to attain the money I've saved. All in all, both decisions bring me a lot of anxiety. On one scale, the idea of traveling again sounds very enticing, seeing a new place is always fun and refreshing. This was what I was most fixated on, and even actually had semi-planned on meeting a long time friend when I traveled again, but that is done now, unfortunately. Although those plans didn't work out, I still have the desire to travel. I don't even know why because I don't really do what everyone does when they travel, I basically switch one room for another and pout freely in a place where no one will recognize me. I mean that's not all I do, I do see the sites and visit places and sometimes meet people, but for the most part, it's an extended period of solitude, which I enjoy, for the most part. \n",

Living with mom sucks, but here, I save money quickly, get to spend a lot of it on myself, on my friends, on fun times, etc. When I move out I won't be able to do that anymore. I'm afraid I'm going to move out and completely shut out from everyone. I'm bad at contacting friends to hangout, so if I didn't call anybody I probably wouldn't see anybody. Not that that really bothers me, I guess, but it does kind of worry me. I don't want to be a creepy shut in and I don't want to lose my friends. To add to this, not all of my friends have cars, including myself, and the apartment that has been offered to me is in another city (close by, definitely drivable, but still). This would definitely limit the amount of interaction I would have with my close friends. I worry because it's already limited. We all do our own thing sometimes. I don't have many close friends, and at times, we can all be occupied with ourselves. One has a boyfriend so she never hangs out, one is writing a book and he's super focused on it, the other is.. well the third friend is pretty much in my position as well but has more satellite friends than me, so he's usually hangin' with them going to parties and the like.

The stresses of paying bills, not paying bills, what if I can't get food, or smokes, or take a girl out on a date? What if I can't afford an internet connection?

The pain is hard to describe- almost like a sharp yet also blunt shooting, throbbing pain that can last from a couple seconds to 10 seconds. However, the way the pain feels varies greatly.  Sometimes it will feel very sharp, sometimes very blunt, and sometimes in between. I will often also feel some discomfort behind my right eye when this happens, though I don't know if it's real or I am making myself think there's something there behind my eye. I also find that neck is often stiff and when I feel these pains I can help relieve some of the pain by stretching/cracking my neck.

It has nothing to do with the task itself, just the feeling I get from staring at a computer and having to think and focus.

      "Last year I entered college out of state. I have had longstanding problems dealing with depressive episodes and moderate social anxiety. When I got there, the anxiety and depression intensified greatly. On the surface, I was successful; I joined a fraternity, made friends, and aced 20 units of classes. But in reality I felt like I didn't have the support network to maintain meaningful relationships. I also had a roommate I didn't particularly care for, and as someone who was already very introverted and anxious, it was very difficult to ever feel calm considering that there were ALWAYS people around, even in the library. I had difficulty fostering my passions like playing guitar and writing because I felt that I could never do them without the privacy of my own space. A lot of times I would just lie in bed with headphones on and listen to music and pretend that nothing was there. I went to counseling for several months, which helped, but only depressed me further when I was cut off by the university and referred to an outside source. I visited a psychiatrist, who gave me general health tips and told me to get over the counter lithium. I didn't try it out of health concerns and reading about the risk of kidney problems online.\n",

I hang out frequently with a few of my closest friends whenever it strikes me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that while the depression went away, the anxiety didn't. It's hard for me to ask anyone outside of my 3 closest friends to hang out. Even replying to emails or sorting out my affairs for enrollment at my new university gives me intense anxiety spells. There are days when I can't leave the house because of the fear of having to ask someone if they want to get lunch. These aren't strangers either; these are some of my best friends for years. The problem is either A) big group gatherings, even if they are all friends, or B) individual meetups with people who I am only okay friends with. Either one of those scenarios results in me making a million excuses and then staying home. It's not even that I say no, it's that sometimes I just get so anxious I can't even reply to a text message inviting me to hang out. I haven't seen some of my best friends all summer out of this anxiety. Today, I was invited to one of my friends' birthday gatherings. I'm trying so hard to get the courage to show up. But I can already anticipate some of them asking me where I've been all summer, or what happened that made me transfer universities and I have no idea what I'll say. I'm still trying to decide if I should go, so if you have any advice on that end, let me know. I've always had this anxiety, but back in high school it was only mild to moderate. Ever since last year, it's been severe and never slowed down. I'm wondering if I should seek medications from a psychiatrist again, at least so I can get it under control in these types of situations and learn how to function again. I have no idea how these medications work or if it's worth starting up during a transition period like the new few weeks when I start classes. I'm honestly a little afraid of going back to classes in a couple of weeks; my anxiety might prevent me from getting help from others in my classes, or making friends at my new school.

      "\n",
      "On the other hand, I have not had much success actually altering my behaviors that are symptoms of my issues. I still have unexplained anxiety, and try to diagnose why I am feeling anxious, but most of the time I cannot. For example, a couple weeks ago, I was driving to a department store to purchase a new set of cooking pans. I was calm, happy, etc. Out of nowhere, I just felt overwhelmingly anxious. I asked myself why. Was it because of traffic? No, it wasn't. Was it because I was worried I was going to overspend? No, I had the means to make my purchase. I was unable to figure out where the anxiety came from, and all I could do was simply wait it out. My irritability is a smidgen better, but not much. Small, petty things still make me angry/tense/irritable, and my temper flares up. A lot of times, I can't catch myself before my temper flares up to figure out why I'm so tense or irritable and to consciously talk myself down from it before I react externally (usually getting terse or angry with my partner). I am also still having problems with my mood in general. It varies greatly from day to day. Sometimes I am happy. The next day I could be sad or tense for literally no reason.

I would really like to ask my therapist about medication, but I'm scared. I'm scared that she will say she doesn't recommend it. I don't want to be the way that I am anymore, and I don't think I can change myself without the help of medication. I don't want to stop therapy, but I don't think it's enough. I'm also scared of the potential side effects. I already struggle with weight, and I don't want to gain weight. I don't want to lose my sex drive, etc. I don't want to become numb.

However recently I've noticed that my overall anxiety level increases sometimes and that I still feel not my normal self since I started having issues with anxiety over a year ago.

For years, I thought it was just because of my stagnation that was the root of my problem, but now I'm not so sure. Recently, in the past two years, I've made some strides forward. I've been employed part time for over a year now, I only recently started driving at the age of 23, I just started community college, and I've even managed to lose some weight since the beginning of they year (~45 pounds). All said and done though, I still feel empty inside. When I'm not stressing out, I just feel apathetic towards everything. I'm still disgusted with my body, and it doesn't look like I've changed one iota despite what the scale says. Work is at best dull and at worse soul crushing (The only upside is getting to interact with anyone around my age). And College seems eerily familiar to high school, with the exception that it feels more impersonal and cold.
