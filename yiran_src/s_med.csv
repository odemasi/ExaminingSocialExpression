0,I have a feeling that this will only get worse from now on since she's also looking up all sorts of alternative medicine bullshit for OCD now...
1,I've tried medications but they only made me feel like a zombie and going to sit down with a therapist only increases my anxiety.
2,I'm against taking medication after what I had to deal with in the past but I realized this is my only option to get better.
3,I see my doctor next week and I don't know what to tell him about these meds.
4,"A bit of a strange question, I suppose, but here goes:

I've been really trying to focus on getting off of any anti-anxiety medication and overcoming/dealing with this in a more natural way and I really think I've had a lot of success."
5,I'm currently getting off lexapro and I've had this happen to me before I was on this medication.
6,I honestly think the only thing left that would help me is some sort of medication.
7,How can I make it clear to whoever can actually give me them that I want to try medication?
8,"I've always what I'd consider moderate anxiety, I don't need medication, but I'm starting to consider it."
9,I scheduled a GP appointment last week and he diagnosed me with anxiety and panic disorder and referred me to a psych for further evaluation and medication and a therapist.
10,I just recently started getting anxiety and I'm not sure if these are real medical things or just the anxiety.
11,I can't afford a consular right now or medication.
12,This last time she asked I explained that I was getting my anxiety medicine adjusted a few days before she needed me to watch them and maybe it would be easier for me.
13,"I first went it wanting to treat my anxiety which has plagued me for a while but only recently got worse, and he prescribed me some meds."
14,"I've put thought into it, and I still want to attempt to treat it my anxiety with medication, if the option is still viable."
15,Or should I go back to the doctor and tell him I want to keep trying medication?
16,"The medications I've tried are

Fluoxetine: Horrible nausea: lasted all day and interrupted work."
17,"**Actual experiences with meds will be quoted, background story will be in regular text."
18,"Mentally, this medication made me feel like a zombie."
19,BUT I currently do not take any medication at all for either.
20,"I wish it was something they could treat with medicine and be done with, fuck you anxiety."
21,"I do not have depression or anxiety, I have never taken any medication other than antibiotics though I may have some of the symptoms of ADHD."
22,Though recently I heard that some people on anti-depressant medication experience a similar symptom.
23,Is anxiety manageable without meds?
24,"I guess after all this rambling.. my question is, can it really get better without meds?"
25,I'm trying to get pregnant and the last thing  I want to do is try to rely on a medication (though there are times like tonight where I just want to throw my hands up and say OK fine I will just take it).. who knows what it actually does to your brain.
26,"I've gotten myself on some meds for this, and I'm trying."
27,"Also, how do you approach your doctor for a specific medicine?"
28,"Hey guys,

I just got prescribed new meds Lexapro and lorazepam."
29,I also recently found out my first deadline for applying to medical school is August instead of October.
30,But then he goes onto say that it doesn't really get to the heart of why I want to go into medicine and then questions why I want to be a doctor.
31,"Well, the doctor didn't remember any of those conversations (even though they were all in my medical records that she typed herself) and began to scold me for using what she called, ""the joint""."
32,Instead she said that every symptom I've ever discussed with her was because of marijuana and that she would no longer give me any medication.
33,I know it makes me feel better and I've seen people here discuss how it made them feel better but is there any medical documentation anywhere discussing this?
34,I've seen medical studies that showed marijuana increased anxiety for some patients.
35,I took time off from school and work after the relationship ended and my parents were a big help to me as I got my thyroid meds in order and started losing weight.
36,"I cant catch a break i think im finally broken i don't know what to do i can't take meds because i hate having to rely on things like this to get by, this is how i quit cigarettes just cold turkey."
37,I'm sure I'll have to try a few things out and see how I'll feel but I could use advice on how you guys time everything with your meds so you're not feeling like a dopy mess at the wrong time.
38,She was then put on some pretty strong medication.
39,On top of that due to my sporadic incomes over the past 12 years she does not ever see us being able to have children and on top of that she feels a big part of her breakdown &amp; subsequently being on medication is because of me and the trauma she's experienced watching &amp; having to constantly support me having such horrible panic attacks.
40,I stopped taking my medication before leaving because i had decided i wanted to join the military (incredibly stupid for someone in my position.)
41,Now my anxiety and depression are getting to the point where i'm having anxiety attacks a couple of times a week and don't have any medication to help me.
42,"I'm back on my meds now, but a lower dose."
43,The ER doctor gave me muscle relaxants and some pain meds and referred me to a neurologist because they suspect I have some nerve damage.
44,Ive had around 3 attacks in the last 24 hours that leave me crippled and I am on no medication.
45,I've been having issues for about 5 years have been taking medication for 3.
46,"I'm not sure what I hope to achieve by seeing one; I have no problem with taking medicine, but I feel like I have nothing to lose."
47,"The thoughts are fears of me doing something unintentionally... like I'm afraid I'll sleepwalk and overdose on my medication, or sleepwalk and injure someone with a weapon, or do something completely out of my control."
48,So I open these questions up to those that are currently on both meds (Wellbutrin and Prozac) or have been.
49,I don't want to have to try a different medication but this is not gonna fly.
50,I also didn't take any anti anxiety medication before I went to the hospital.
51,My doctor doesnt seem to be concerned at all and has just upped my meds in an effort to help.
52,Topical medications?
53,Oral meds?
54,"I am ok.  

At 10 am I take my ""morning medicine,"" which consists of 1 mg Xanax extended release, 40 mg of prilosec (for my terrible stomach acid), 800 mg of Gabapentin (again, for anxiety), and 25 mg of Seroquel (anxiety)."
55,At 4 pm I take my day time medicines (seroquel 25 mg and gabapentin 800 mg again) and keep playing my game.
56,I am taking my medications exactly as prescribed by my doctor.
57,I spoke with his medical assistant who said I had a panic attack and to stop taking the Vyvanse.
58,I just feel like I am too scared and crippled to do anything now and I'm not sure if I should give anxiety medicine another try.
59,"Please don't tell me to talk to my doctor about this, all he does is suggest different medicines for me and doesn't listen to me at all."
60,I did not receive medication until I was 22 because of my parents.
61,"I have had bad anxiety/depression since I was a child and have been on and off tons of different medicines, when I was around 19-20 I started having panic attack often and it cost me a job or two."
62,I got it under control by going on different medicines.
63,Here's the weird thing that I need advice on- I've been having some medical issues lately with my stomach.
64,I was sent to the ER and decided to take a medical leave to figure our my medical issues once and for all because my stomach problems were keeping me from preforming at work and school.
65,How I stop myself from having panic attacks about medical symptoms?
66,(they do not allow anti anxiety meds before the sedation.)
67,"The counselor helped a little bit, and I'm not entirely sure if the medication helped at all because I still felt anxious."
68,The first thing the VA wanted to do was give me medication.
69,"I didn't want to take medication as the onset of the problem was quite rapid for the most part, so I was determined to get through it without medication."
70,She was an alternative-medicine type therapist and helped me talk some things out and give me some coping strategies.
71,im excited to see how the meds are gonna kick ass over my anxiety!
72,I'm a little iffy about medication after a really bad experience with Paxil last year.
73,I haven't taken medication in a while so I can't remember if it was the same while on it.
74,"My medical issues are quite complicated at the moment, but something that has been bugging me quite bad recently is nausea, insomnia but especially anxiety!"
75,I also feel that it makes me weak as if I cant survive without this medication.
76,"My depression and anxiety are fairly well controlled, I am on meds that help me significantly."
77,"Up until this point I was strongly averse to medication, and had put all of my energy into trying various mindfulness or cognitive techniques (quite a lot of meditation, have been reading about ACT, but have never made a strong attempt at CBT)."
78,"I think 3 things kept me from giving up on the meds at that time:

* Hearing some stories, either here or on other forums, about people having really high stress/anxiety when they first get on the meds."
79,"* Not being sure if this was caused by the meds themselves, or if I'd starting taking them just the nick of time, and that first weekend was just the tip of a particularly depressing &amp; shitty iceberg."
80,"Two questions I have for you fine folks:

* Has anyone experienced insomnia, but had it subside over time without the addition of some other medication?"
81,"I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow if possible, to try and start some medication to help cope with my anxiety."
82,"I'm planning on going to a psychiatrist sometime soon, and I was wondering if they make you use a certain medication, or do you they let you choose?"
83,I'm at the point in my life where I feel like I need to start taking medication.
84,Not the medical explanation.
85,In fact I was on BP meds for YEARS.
86,"Instead of white collar syndrome, I feel safest and least anxious in the presence of medical professionals and most dangerous by myself."
87,"Having google as a medical guide at your fingertips does not help, either."
88,"I would rather be ignorant of most medical conditions, since I will likely never have any experience with them, except fear."
89,"Now, like every medicine i get i don't want to take it."
90,I'm scripted Ativan 1mg as needed (along with a cocktail of other medication for my many disorders) and last month I needed to take it (on average) about once every 2 days.
91,"I always feel the need to make them feel better, its as though my brain just picks up all the uneasiness of others, makes them feel better and in return i end up stuck with all these shit feelings...

i dont know what to do and am honestly considering therapy or some medications that will just calm me down."
92,"Things were really looking up for a while, since the medication was prescribed."
93,"I know no one here can tell me that for sure, or give me medical advice."
94,"But does anyone maybe have any tips for dealing with things like I've described, short of therapy or more/different medication?"
95,Anyways I cannot think of any solutions aside from breaking up with her which is the last thing I want to do and want to ask for any ideas on how to cope with this (no meds please).
96,"Other general info if needed: Age: 16 (Junior in High School), No meds or any drug use."
97,"Because of this I procrastinated going in to get my symptoms checked out, worried that I would be perceived as just a hypochondriac, and it turns out that I had an actual medical condition all along that I probably could have gotten treated months ago rather than enduring for so long."
98,Do I even want medication since it seems like you have to kind of shuffle through them to see which ones work and which ones don't...?
99,I recently had to take some melatonin to improve my sleep quality as well as other medication to calm myself down.
100,"I have never taken prescription medication before until July 2014 I started on 1mg lorazepam (Ativan) once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and then .5mg at night."
101,So I've been on these meds for about four months now.
102,"I am not on meds currently, because I had to go get a blood test before my MD will give me meds."
103,"I notice blood on my T-shirts (Actually, I should note, I have been prescribed minocycline and a topical cream for my acne, so yes, I have been given medication)."
104,"I am on my sixth day of anxiety medication (celexa) and I am seeing my family doctor once every week, in addition to my psychologist once every week."
105,I lasted 3 days and have a severe breakdown and have been off on medical leave since (1 week now).
106,I'm on meds that are supposed to help with the obsessive thinking.
107,I've been on multiple medications.
108,"I suppose my medication is for laziness too, and the cuts on my arms are just coincidental."
109,What anti-anxiety meds have worked for you that don't cause vertigo or nausea?
110,"My Psychologist suggested medication, which has been a fear of mine for some time."
111,I am just exhausted emotionally and wanted to hear some POV of fellow anxious redditors who may have good / bad experiences with medication therapy.
112,"I've had insomnia issues before, a lot actually, so I'm not sure if this is just my brain not turning off again or an actual side effect of the meds that will maybe eventually clear up."
113,I'm really starting to feel scared about what my meds are doing to me in the long-term.
114,"I really wish I could quit taking meds altogether, since I'm also afraid of what Zoloft is doing to me now."
115,"I'm wondering if I should seek medications from a psychiatrist again, at least so I can get it under control in these types of situations and learn how to function again."
116,I have no idea how these medications work or if it's worth starting up during a transition period like the new few weeks when I start classes.
117,"I have to take medication for it, so i guess that puts a little more feedback on how ""severe"" it is, but i don't really think it's that bad."
118,"I would really like to ask my therapist about medication, but I'm scared."
119,"I don't want to be the way that I am anymore, and I don't think I can change myself without the help of medication."
120,"My boyfriend is on SSRIs for his depression, and he has the common side effects, and has tried different medications, but eventually just settled on one that made his mood feel the best, regardless of the side effects."
121,I've been on the medication since January and fortunately haven't had any anxiety attacks for several months now.
122,"The doctors, mental health professionals, and a psychiatrist that I've spoken to have all recommended that I increase the dosage of my medication as they believe that changing my medication is the only solution to me getting better."
123,And I also have anxieties about psychoactive substances like my medication having control over my mind and making me unable to exercise free will over my thoughts and emotions and instead making me into someone that is unhappy but still functional in society.
124,So I'm just curious as to other people's experiences regarding dosage change on this medication.
125,"Reddit, how do you deal with the weight gain from your medication?"
126,"And then one day i realized I'd been so much happier &amp; less stressed lately, &amp; that I hadn't taken or needed any of my meds in months."
127,I've been off any &amp; all anxiety meds &amp; antidepressants for going on 4 years now.
128,I'm just putting this here for anyone who's having trouble treating their anxiety or doesn't want to have to take meds long-term...
129,I was lucky enough to get state aid for the past year for my prescription medications and the discount helped a lot because otherwise I would be paying a ridiculous amount.
130,"However, I've now been told that I make too much money and will therefore no longer be able to receive the discount on my medications starting April 1."
131,The thought of not being able to get my meds is making me really anxious and last time this happened I ended up in the hospital.
132,TL;DR My discount for my meds is ending soon but I need the meds to function.
133,"Meditation and talk therapy are also part of my regiment, but this is one medicine change I've been very happy with."
134,Then I had a massive panic attack so I took 1mg Lorazepam (my first time taking any anxiety meds).
135,I've been on 3 different SSRI medications in the past and HATED the way they've made me feel.
136,"Recently, I had gone 4 months without one severe enough to require my medication, I was really proud of that."
137,"The meds didn't help that time, I just walked into walls a lot and felt wobbly woozy."
138,The only meds she is on now is Buspirone 30mg and Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day.
139,Are these meds making her nauseas or is it her “nerves”?
140,I know that no one wants make medical advice without having more information but I really could use some guidance here.
141,"I then found out that over the months leading to now she had been asking various friends that she had about it, she went to a doctor's clinic to get it checked, she has been calling various medical professions about it, etc."
142,"I'm considering going to see a psychologist about anxiety meds, but it seems so weird to me that dating is the only thing I can think of that brings this out in me."
143,Considering meds.
144,Today is my first time ever taking any type of medication for my anxiety/depression.
145,I know it takes a few weeks for meds to take effect so I don't know if it's because of the Prozac that I feel like this.
146,Is this normal or am I having a bad reaction to the meds?
147,"Hey y'all

I am on a medication right now for my severe anxiety and noticed something now when having sex with my GF:

I can't cum!"
148,"EDIT:  I don't know the name of my meds I have to look at them, I'm also on an anti-psychotic for my psychosis."
149,"During my last semester abroad in graduate school, I was living independently, long-distance with my girlfriend, taking 9 courses in school, and was given news before arriving abroad that my kidney condition, although stable, was acting up a bit, but not enough for him to say I definitely needed medication."
150,I can't stop thinking about what they might find and if the medical costs will keep me from moving out of my family's home next spring.
151,"I have been attempting to self diagnose what ever might be wrong with me for quite some time, unfortunately I am no medical professional and my fear of allowing myself to speak truly to a doctor has left me on the one previous occasion I visited to lie, although it was not to do with the problem I present to you today."
152,"I'm getting migraines from stress, I'm trying to use my medications sparingly but I find myself crying and having a hard time pulling myself together more and more."
153,"I had to pull over on my way to work today and force myself to keep driving because I can't lose my job, I'm already in a massive financial crisis from medical bills."
154,"but I'm hoping I can get some advice:

I suffer from social anxiety and have tried multiple medications for this but they all failed (I am currently prescribed 100mg lamictal &amp; 30mg adderall which I have been on for years) but I never tried benzos until yesterday when I was prescribed .5mg of clonazepam from my psychiatrist."
155,I'm new to this medication and would do anything to get rid of this social anxiety so I could use all the advice I can get.
156,"Then comes being poor, not being able to afford medical care, the constant near-PTSD actions I still sometimes do (check my bank balance every day, being paranoid although I know I have some money)."
157,"I'm also on medication for anxiety, and I'm seeing a therapist."
158,"She's never seen a professional about it, had any medicine, or anything like that."
159,"I think this has helped me realise that the medication I'm on, while dulling the anxiety and depression, also dulls the good feelings sometimes as well."
160,"I think I'm going to mention this to my doctor and see what she says about it, because if there are other medications I could try that dull the anxiety but don't necessarily dull the happiness as much then I'd like to try them."
161,"This discovery is the result of an accident, and I intend to get back on medication as soon as I can, because I know I'm still not at a place mentally where I can handle the anxiety without meds."
162,I put on a lot of weight when I found out my mother had a series of medical issues.
163,"Last night my girlfriend and I had sex while my parents weren't home, and due to my medication I took forever to climax so we eventually stopped."
164,"I have not taken any medication other than Acetaminophen, which has no side effects."
165,I have recently gone off my meds for anxiety because my Dr told me it was possible that my brain chemistry could change.
166,I have been off of them for over a month now and I have now realized the thoughts and irritability I exhibit off of my meds are bad/different.
167,I want to stay off the meds but I need to control my issues.
168,"Are there any meds that help with nausea, bloating and loss of appetite because Im losing lots of weight ever since my life has begun to get more social."
169,"I don't have, and I can't afford, any medications or professional help at the moment."
170,My best friend is studying to get his Phd in homeopathic medicine and has been using me as his case study.
171,I was hesitant because I am a nurse so I'm trained in western medicine and don't have much knowledge of herbal remedies.
172,"I've always been anti-meds (because taking medication makes me anxious; I'm always afraid I'll be allergic to it, or that I won't be able to handle the side effects), but right now all I want is for someone to hand me a pill that will let me sleep and feel ""normal"" for a while, whatever normal is."
173,"I mentioned this to my Doc, but I don't know if he considered it when he started me on meds."
174,I've gone to various doctors and gone through numerous medications to no avail.
175,I need to be armed with information about what to ask for when the topic of medication comes up.
176,"Please only answer if you are open-minded and have had experience or know someone w/ experience for adderall as a medication for anxiety and being a more productive, better person."
177,Does anybody know about this anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication?
178,"It's frustrating because I am not asking for a medication I could potentially become addicted to, I am just asking for something to improve my functioning."
179,"If I do, I'm just curious what medications worked for you guys, if any?"
180,Share your stories of what has worked for you medication or otherwise.
181,I'm on meds for this but I feel like they're wearing off.
182,"Because I don't want her to always rely on the meds and only take them when she needs them, but I have already told her that she needs to have them with at all times in case it gets too bad."
183,"In perfect world I would love to see her off meds and be able to not be bothered by all these things but I know that might not ever happen, which is okay."
184,I currently take depression medicine and am going to talk to my Doctor for anxiety medicine.
185,I'm currently off the medication I used to take but I am thinking I might need to go back on.
186,"Also, I obviously need a job to have money to pay for treatment and medication but until I get that, are there any medications I can get without a prescription for anxiety?"
187,I have had an embarrasing and scary medical issue the past week and I am finally going to be seen by a Doctor today.
188,I do have a minor medical issue to take care of but I deffinetly got some piece of mind and a Rx to help with my abnormality.
189,"I am currently conducting some research (For my Postgraduate MSc HPaB Psychology degree) on Depression/Anxiety and I would be very, very grateful if members currently taking medications would take a moment to complete the survey in the link below."
190,"The broad goal of my research is to examine the different classes of anti-depressant medications in relation to side effects, specifically addressing the severity level, type and tolerability of side effects in relation to medication BNF classification (the pharmacological body which classifies antidepressants into categories depending on the primary proposed mechanism for how the medication works)."
191,"Personally I have tried to avoid getting medication, as I don't feel risking side effects is worth it."
192,I'm struggling with something normal people would find easy even with the correct dosage of medication.
193,"Although my medication has worked great for the past months i have been on it, i can feel the anxiety building and im worried ill suffer another large attack, im terrified."
194,I'm wondering if anyone else here has had minimal help with Valium and has had help from another medication like Xanax or something alike or if I should just stick to Valium?
195,"I'm out of meds, dads in the er and mom won't answer her phone and I have no idea what's going on and I'm in charge of two little siblings rn (asleep for now)


I.just.fucking.can't."
196,"Here's my background: I'm 19 years old, male, and I recently enlisted in the military (I've wanted to do this since a young age), I've never been diagnosed with anxiety or never taken any medication, I keep it to myself, never told anyone about it."
197,I've been on medication for the past several months.
198,"After a few days of trial and error with meds, turns out that just a little increase in my Zoloft was all it took to make me feel pretty much back to normal."
199,Im at the local library and my moms car broke down and i have no meds i dont know what im going to do
200,"So, here I am, not talking to anyone but my family and one single best friend, being angry and confused since I can’t find a way to be more talkative and not shy again (even though I am on Atarax, the medicine one doctor prescribed me to use against the anxiety, it doesn’t seem to help much so far)."
201,"We've tried counselling and medication, but we gradually lost hope in finding a 'cure'."
202,I am dealing with a TON of anxiety and derealization disorder (everything feels like im in a dream) and am trying feverishly to get meds that actually work.
203,Side note: I do receive profesional help and was diagnosed with a GAD and given meds just looking for support or someone similar I guess.
204,I've had to go back on medication...
205,"i felt like they jumped to conclusions and the trip to the psych ward was really not necessary, i really feel like i shouldn't trust anyone in the medical field or that works in a hospital for that matter."
206,I am currently on meds now plus birth control since I believed it was hormonal.
207,Anyways a little over a week ago I got really sick and bedridden for 3 days in which caused my anxiety to sky rocket because I never had to call out of work once (other than earlier this year when I first started due to getting bad attacks and to get put on meds to control them better) and I never sat at home that long before in a looong time either.
208,"(in which I think being bored is another trigger and with drinking coffee making me hyper and not knowing what to do with myself)

Also I did get my meds changed from citalopram to the generic of zoloft because of the attacks last week."
209,"Sorry it was a random post, but I would love to hear some opinions though :) I am okay now although a little zoned out due to the new meds."
210,I started taking meds again two weeks ago.
211,"I recently switched to an extended release anti-anxiety medicine, so I'm really hoping to get through this day with no attacks, or at the very least, few tears."
212,I take my medicine in the mornings and after about an hour I'm more stable.
213,Could it just be morning anxiety or possiblly medication related?
214,"She says her fear is of taking medicine that might make her want to kill herself, but I think it is also the anxiety of going to a doctor that prevents her from going."
215,Afraid of medicine but not herbs.
216,I'm not sure if the return (and subsequent worsening) of my anxiety is a result of becoming tolerant to the medicine.
217,"I know i need to seek professional help, ive been on several medications before everything from once a day pills like zoloft, paxil... shit its a long list and normally those end up really fucking me up."
218,We have begun to more seriously discuss medication as an option.
219,"The opinion of the professional was that meds could help, but doing as much natural remedies as I could before turning to them."
220,"He's on medication (Prestique), but has used alcohol as a crutch for too long."
221,I have been taking meds for about a month now and felt pretty good the last 2 days but today the scalp tingling is back.
222,And did medication help (beta-blockers in partciular)?
223,"At the beginning, when nobody was sure about what's happening with me, there was a suspicion on epilepsy, although, different medical inspections, such as EEG or MRI denied it and doctors have announced that the problem is fully mental."
224,My boyfriend loves me to let me stay home and go to school again but he doesn't understand that I wouldn't be able to make it in the workplace even with the medication I take.
225,I am on meds to no effect I suppose and therapy seems insane and stressful to me.
226,I guess Im going to try to get some meds prescribed for the first time just for this interaction that lasts moments every day I work.
227,And I don't know how much longer I can go without my medication.
228,I'm generally pretty sensitive to medicine and this is no exception.
229,Anyone else have experiences with this cough medicine or any others?
230,"Before you mention it I've tried the medication route with horrendous results, Zoloft made me have extreme Akathasia, so much so I was almost committed, one of the worst experiences of my life."
231,"I feel like some of you go on about how it's the *only* option, but meds are a big no for me, and others like me."
232,How do you beat anxiety without meds?
233,I take meds.
234,It's a very sad way to live life and I am hoping the meds and meditation will help snap me out of this a bit.
235,I feel like I can't and won't set foot in an airplane unless someone drugs me so today I got some medication.
236,"I've got some questions that I hope someone might be able to answer:

- The doctor told me to try some medication at home to see what kind of side effects I can expect, so I'm thinking about trying one tomorrow."
237,I'm really worried I'll get to the airport and board the plane and realise that the medication isn't working.
238,"**Just** **some** **general** **info:**

21, Male

General anxiety, been taking medicine

Don't have anything that triggers it

**Symptom:**

I'm transferring to a new university for several different reasons and I don't know but one or two people there."
239,"This isn't the first time I've been in this situation, but regardless anxiety creeps in even with the medications I take."
240,I'm already on medication for depression (10mg per night) and on bc.
241,"If she's right, do you have any suggestions for medicine that will cause less damage?"
242,"Yesterday, I had accidentally left my meds at home."
243,"Hi Reddit,

So yesterday after having a bit of a break down, I realized I might have to back on my meds."
244,"I have anxiety/panic disorder and agoraphobia, which I have been medicated for and have overcome (which subsequently led to me stopping my medication."
245,I don't know what to do and I don't have much time to properly deal with the issues.... right now the only thing I can think of is going back on my meds and hope that I can manage it when school starts.
246,"TLDR; going back to school is making me feel depressed and bringing back my anxiety, wondering if I should go back on meds."
247,I was laid off from work a while ago and used up the last of my meds (prozac).
248,"The reason I am writing this is to tell you that your anxiety and panic disorders *can* be cured, and it doesn't require medication, or endless doctor/ER visits."
249,"I didn't want to deal with what had happened, and decided to take medication (zoloft, started at 25mg) and it seemed to take the edge off, but it never truly helped me."
250,"What about anxiety meds, is that something that can come about from starting here?"
251,"I sometimes wonder if medication would relieve this at all, but my mom is *very* much against me going on medication."
252,"I don't take any medications, or drugs."
253,My counselor suggested it because I want to try to get over my anxiety without and serious medication.
254,"I went to my doctor a few weeks ago to discuss my meds and she mentioned looking into getting a workbook as anxiety is one of the more 'managable' mental ""problems"" (sorry, not sure how to phrase it) and that workbooks can help find triggers and overcome them etc."
255,I never really learned how to manage the anxiety without medication.
256,"Recently, my symptoms have greatly improved with therapy and meds."
257,Recently I've started the process of taking medications for my anxiety.
258,"To the main question, how many medications must I try before I find one that doesn't cause me side effects?"
259,"How long did it take to find the right medication for you, and how did it improve your life?"
260,"Sorry if this question has been asked before, I'm just always leery of starting new medications (WOO, HYPOCHONDRIA!)."
261,Is there a medication (for daily use) that has been successful for you with anxiety?
262,I went to see a therapist and the intern (the person who gathered my info) said SA is usually treated with 50/50 medication and therapy.
263,I had no idea that it was my anxiety killing me so I never went to a doctor to get checked out hence never got any medications.
264,Tried some meds but the doc gave me this really weak shit that didn't help much.
265,"After a year of doc visits and multiple medications,  I'm turning to the collective wisdom of reddit, if for no other reason than to find some common ground."
266,"So far, my medications and effects have been:

Citalopram - Intensified the yucky mental feeling (anxiety?)"
267,"Wellbutrin - Seemed to level things out, but would still make me feel worse for a few hours after taking the medication."
268,"The first 3 medications I gave up after 1-6 weeks, depending on how shitty they made me feel."
269,"Second I'm on two medications already (Zonisamide for seizures, Concerta for ADHD) and this just sounds like it will counteract or cause some problems."
270,I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety six years ago and been on medication since that time.
271,"We don't know what caused it, but she was put on medication and discharged and hasn't had a seizure since."
272,I'm someone who is afraid of drug interactions and side effects so it's hard to find a medication that works.
273,This is probably the last thing stopping me from getting actual medical help now and I can't find my way around it...
274,"I just wonder if I'm better off seeing her more often and working through the cognitive distortions and unhealthy patterns on my own, which seems better, or taking the medication as well, even though it's not really ""me."""
275,"At this point, I've already taken my sleeping meds, and I'm still a bit dazed from an anxiety attack earlier, so while I'm stumbling groggily down the very steep steps whilst admiring the moon, I think I'm at the bottom of the steps, and stick my leg out, but I'm not at the bottom - In fact, I'm a good 3 steps away."
276,Wondering if anyone has had any luck with meds helping these kind of things OR anything that I should probably stay away from.
277,She's on meds for it but didn't get counseling.
278,"If this is all or mostly anxiety-caused as people are telling me, I both do and don't want to turn to the meds as the solution for the reasons above."
279,"I have been on two different types of medication since September, and I don't think the dosage is right for me yet but I won't stop trying."
280,"And if medication is not the right answer for me, that's okay, I'll try something else if it comes to that."
281,"My psychiatrist suggested I do this test that involves swabbing the inside of my cheek with a cotton swab and sending it to a lab where they run your genetics against the common gene that the meds are composed of (all are in a different ""class"") and it tells you that based on the make up of your body and the class of the drugs, which class of drug your body metabolizes normally."
282,I don't take any medicine whatsoever.
283,"I trust my doctor, but I can't help wondering if my different medications are reacting poorly with one another."
284,"I've been working for years with different medication, as I get closer to college,I just don't see how I'll be able to function in the real world or work place when I can barely make it through high school."
285,"The combination of serious medical conditions and my anxiety cause me to miss tones of school, and im starting to lose it."
286,I've been on anxiety meds for a long time now.
287,Since the major reason for taking the legit meds is gone I'd like to get rid of them; the side-effects are still there and reduce my quality of life.
288,"I'd told her very clearly that I was dealing with overwhelming anxiety over all these estate issues to the point where I was having to get medical treatment for it, but after dinner, despite what I'd told her, she started talking about estate matters with the phrase she always uses for this, ""Well, we need to ."
289,"I have been seeing a psychiatrist for a little over six months now, and she's been fantastic - as far as helping me to find the right medication to alleviate my anxiety and depression."
290,My psychiatric sessions focus solely on the efficacy of the medication.
291,"I've been on a number or medications such as citalopram, fluoxetine and pregabalin but nothing has worked."
292,"I have an appointment with a psychologist next week, but I know she can't help me with medication management."
293,"I need to have my medication adjusted *right now,* but it seems like no one can help me."
294,With this new look and lifestyle I began to realize how good I was feeling without taking my daily anti-anxiety medication.
295,So now that time has passed I'm wondering if I should/could stop taking any medication all together.
296,Is there anything I can do to ease the anxiety during the appointment if I don't have access to medication?
297,"I need to learn to start controlling them because my attacks are situational, and meds aren't really necessary at this point."
298,"Over the last few months, my doctor and I have been experimenting with different anxiety medications with little success."
299,"I'm getting tired of switching medications every 4-5 weeks, so I'm wondering first of all if anyone here has had success with this medication."
300,"Part of me wants to try medicine just to see if it'll help, but I'd rather try out some natural remedies."
301,"I don't have any medication to deal with this, or anything?"
302,So I've been off the meds now for over 3 weeks and have been doing pretty well.
303,"There was always some kind of a problem, either medical or financial."
304,I have a couple of medical problems.
305,I cannot afford therapy or medication.
306,I am scared of what other medical problems another ten years will bring.
307,I'm on medication for anxiety.
308,"You would probably tell me something about ""*It'll be fine*"" or ""*You have all your life before you*"" or even ""*There is medication for this*""."
309,I don't want medication.
310,"I know it's bad to continue to ignore such an issue, but I don't want medication."
311,"Unfortunately, I do not know what kind of doctors specialize in herbal medications."
312,Decided it might be best to totally abstain from all medicine and supplements to see if I just need a reboot of some kind.
313,"This was about 4 months ago and since I got out of the hospital I had been off medicine and kind of strolling along, trying to keep my head up and keep on keepin on."
314,"I developed a drinking problem after my boyfriend lied and left me for slutsherface and didn't see a way out, and I had refused medication all my life saying there was ""another way"" but needed a helping hand other than my therapist and took the pill route."
315,"I had no sex drive, before and during the meds after starting birth control in 2008."
316,I've had panic attacks my whole life and was treated with medication from 6th grade through early college.
317,Should I go back on the medication?
318,I thought it would of came back as the meds kicked in but still nothing.
319,"this might be a dumb question, but is there a definitive moment when i can truly know the meds are working ?"
320,ive never taken meds before so im not sure what to expect
321,I KNOW they suck and I KNOW how bad they feel to go through but fuck that we are all gonna get through this together without meds or doctor bullshit.
322,I'm currently on Lexapro (Cipralex in Canada) and I'm worreid about the sexual side effects of this medication.
323,I'm on my first week of taking medication and i'm already starting to notice these effects.
324,Last year I decided that I didn't want to rely on medication for this anymore and prompted instead for finding other ways.
325,I have been off Paxil for my anxiety and depression for a few days because my psychiatrist office and my insurance company screwed me out of coverage and no longer taking appointments and I ran out of meds a few days ago.
326,"EDIT: Also, I've never been to therapy, or been on any medication."
327,"The patient must go through a series of Cognitive therapy practices and medication must be supplemented to overcome these harmful thoughts."""
328,"I don't know how to talk to my doctor about pain medication, I've been taking tylenol extra strength and it only barely numbs the pain."
329,"I owe thousands of dollars in medical bills, I need to come up with $2000 upfront for all the testing they want to do for MS, I feel like my husband is miserable and I don't feel like I'm worth much."
330,"I haven't been on any medication because I can't afford to go back to my doctor, and I really can't miss as much work as I have been."
331,"However, I am heading to the Dr's tomorrow after numerous people have told me to seek medical help, as I've attempted to battle it alone."
332,Or is it okay to try this medicine?
333,"&gt; 
&gt; I've been on countless medications and few things have helped."
334,"&gt; 
&gt; I'm on medications now and they barely help."
335,My family and I determined it was caused by this medicine I had been taking for my acne.
336,I have been off the medicine for 3 days but yesterday the anxious feeling came back.
337,Will it take a little time for the medicine to get out of my system before I feel normal all the time again?
338,I'm so scared to tweak my meds.
339,This mostly went away after I started my meds until about a month ago.
340,Perhaps talk to my psychiatrist and switch meds?
341,I've been off my meds for a really long time- almost two years.
342,"During those two years, I was out of school and didn't really need the medications to help me through it."
343,"Well, I decided to go back to school this summer, and realized that I would need meds as well."
344,"I was worried that my doctor would judge me for quitting them, and wouldn't want to give me any more meds because I would stop taking them."
345,"She helped me get the medications that I do need, the ones I feel actually work for me."
346,I started a new medication and my appetite has completely gone away.
347,I know this can be a side effect of the medication and I'm hoping it will even out in a few days but... should I be worried?
348,I'm on meds (effexor) and have seen two separate psychologists.
349,I have nausea meds incase I do feel nauseous but I'm tired of constantly feeling sick and worried.
350,I haven't had attacks like this since 2.5 years ago before I started taking medication and the only way I had of dealing with it then was cutting myself.
351,Is it even possible to do without meds?
352,"I have been on meds for just over 6 months now and have been through cbt therapy, I would say i have a clearer direction in my life and a lot less depressed then before, but my anxiety is still a major problem."
353,"Due to a mix up at the clinic pharmacy, my medication wasn't filled and now i'm out."
354,I need that medication for my blood sugar and my anxiety meds are almost up too but now I'm afraid to go back to the clinic.
355,"Usual questions at first, what medications do you take etc."
356,I have been to the pharmacy many times to pick up medication and I never end up taking it because I am scared.
357,"I have read all the negative stuff, which is why I haven't started taking this medication for a while."
358,"Please help
Im not currently on any medication"
359,"I was able to deal with it when I was on anxiety meds, but I'm not on them anymore."
360,I have GAD and it was pretty out of control until mid-July when I went on meds.
361,Are there things the regularly happen because of the use of the medicine that I should be worried about?
362,"I have taken god knows how many prescription meds (Paxil and Wellbutrin, currently) and struggled through 10 years of therapy, including DBT, but I'm not doing so hot right now."
363,I'm not asking for medical advice - I've been to the doctor plenty of times in the past 2 years (yeah.....I'm a bit of a hypochondriac) to know with about 90% certainty that nothing's wrong with me.
364,I cant remember putting the medication in or actually sitting there doing it.
365,"I have a few medical conditions that i often stress about too, but never thought i was overwhelmed with anxiety cause of them."
366,He is really old and just started a new medicine so I don't know if it was making him feel loopy or what.
367,"It's a strong ache, and probably nothing, but my brain keeps screaming 'blood clot' (which I know is wholly irrational, especially considering I have medical training to spot these things...)  worst thing is, I don't know why it's hurting."
368,"The only time I go outside is to take the dog out (and chain smoke while we're out there) 

I feel like I'm unravelling everything I accomplished this year, and I know I should see my doctor, and talk about meds, but I'm too afraid/ashamed to even call."
369,I'm close to being off as my doctor and I thought it worth an attempt to get off medicine and see how that goes.
370,I was originally on medicine for anxiety.
371,I attribute this to the phasing down of the SSRI medicine.
372,I think I need to go back onto medicine and I want to switch to something different.
373,"I have no idea what options are available to me, I've tried for a couple years to get a grasp on this mentally, but that hasn't worked so in terms of help I'm looking to medication."
374,"And I'm not sure if this is a situation that deems worthy for anxiety meds, but I'd prefer not to have to take some medication that will numb me and not make me feel anything, although I'm open to anything that will help with any of these symptoms."
375,"and im no good with keeping up with meds long term, so SSRIs are out."
376,I'm currently unmedicated but I'm seeking medication in July (the earliest they could get me in).
377,I will no longer judge these medications.
378,"while therapy helped a little, i am starting to realize that it would be great to get a proper evaluation and try out some meds."
379,"What medications, or combinations of medications, have you personally found helpful for managing your anxiety?"
380,"I realize all meds are ""your mileage may vary"" but it's still nice to hear from people who have had success on theirs since often you read horror stories online."
381,I'm on two anti anxiety/ depression medications and they seem to help for the most part.
382,My mother has diagnosed anxiety and takes medication for it; but the level of anxiety appears to lessen with each generation.
383,I know that meds effect everyone differently.
384,"I'm just afraid of becoming dependent on these meds, especially Xanax as I hear it can be addictive."
385,I finally got on meds to try and help with my adhd so I can maybe finish college.
386,"I have not seen a Dr. Id really like to avoid medication if possible, however with the worse it gets I'm starting to not care about what they give me as long as they can make it stop."
387,"Like I lost my computer charger cable, I freaked out, and then my mom told me that if I didn't stop acting like a two year old then I would have to take medications."
388,But I don't want to take medications and I don't want to see a therapist and she doesn't want to pay for it or have to drive me to a therapist so I'm not going.
389,I'm on day 4 and I haven't felt exactly the same any of the 4 days I've been taking the medicine.
390,I've read it can take up to 2 weeks to start feeling a more positive effect of the medicine.
391,Or a psychiatrist who concludes medicine isn't a good fit because I'm fine most of the time and to just suck it up.
392,I have had anxiety disorder for roughly three years and have managed to get it under control (with very little use of medication) but every time someone starts talking about it I start feeling anxious.
393,"So far I've tried/had checked:

- Careful attention to diet (Low glycemic index foods, lots of vegetables)

- Heavy cardio exercise 3-5 times a week (3km runs and soccer)

- General blood tests (Vitamin and mineral levels, e.g - iron)

- Thyroid via blood test

- Testosterone levels via blood test

- A sleep study, to rule out sleep apnoea

- 3 years of seeing a psychologist (ACT I think, some CBT)

----

Yet to check:

- Adrenal function tests (Maybe that was already tested as part of blood tests, to be confirmed)

Anything else I should check before accepting the side effects I might get from medication?"
394,It's been well-controlled for 15 years with medication.
395,I've scheduled appointments with my medical professionals but those aren't for a couple of days.
396,Did you change your meds?
397,"He also said that he would give me an anti sickness medication before I came round, and that it wouldn't make me feel woozy or sleepy."
398,I'm not on any medications at all.
399,I had a bad experience with benzodiazepines and it's put me off of the whole medication thing.
400,"On our very first date, he explained to me that he is bipolar and has pretty bad anxiety issues (on medication for both)."
401,I only came out to my parents on the seriousness of the issue a few years back and need to get medical help.
402,"Girlfriend is leaving me because she can't ""be there for me"" through this positive process of change and growth I'm going through due to therapy and medication."
403,I have had anxiety attacks daily which are bad enough to warrant meds.
404,However the meds she likes to give me when I go through periods of extreme anxiety or depression just make me stupid.
405,"I finally found a medication and therapist  that works for me (the combo was a complete game changer), my life is 10 fold better and I know many of the triggers that can kick in this anxiety so I can avoid them."
406,"TL;DR - need over the counter medication to help relieve my public speaking anxiety, any suggestions?"
407,Anyways I wanted to ask could it be a side effect of the medicine?
408,"i've seen doctors, all who refused to refer me to mental health specialists and reccomended me antidepressants/anti anxiety meds which i am vehemently opposed to taking."
409,I have anxiety but I can't take meds.
410,"I barely made it 2 weeks, had a 4 day long panic attack (while on medication) that made me book and early flight and come back home."
411,"I just became so overwhelmed with medical, family, and relationship issues, including keeping my S/O sober."
412,No medication please!
413,I've tried to tell him he needs to go to therapy and get medication but he refuses to even entertain the idea.
414,I'm 30 and have been off meds and happy for years.
415,"Well a couple weeks ago, my endocrinologist tested my TSH levels and they were low (hyperthyroidism), so he changed my medication (increased metformin and decreased levothyroxine), then I proceeded to go on vacation and LEFT MY ANXIETY MEDS AT HOME."
416,All the meds I'm taking mimic some of the side effects of pregnancy and I'm sufficiently freaked every time one of them makes an appearance.
417,"I went through some meds, none did anything beneficial, a couple had mild side effects like sleeplessness stomach stuff etc., but nothing too bad."
418,"After trying three meds, my doctor decided to tell me I need to talk to a therapist about the problem and that she would not be able to help me further."
419,I went back to the doctor today for an unrelated illness and mentioned that I have not been able to call the therapist and was damn near accosted for not having done so and then she begrudgingly prescribed me a new medicine with the requirement that I come back to her in 30 days and having talked to a therapist.
420,What if medication doesn't work?
421,"I'm going in today for a therapy session, and then am being diagnosed soon and put on medication soon after that."
422,We made the decision that I'll try to control it on my own and not go on medication.
423,I decided not to because I feel like it will change who I am and I also don't want to depend on meds.
424,"So guys, I was wondering what medicines are prescribed and how dependent you are on them?"
425,(I stopped taking my meds because I feel better generally without them).
426,"I've been on and off anti-depressants and/or anti-anxiety meds for the past six years, each to varying effects: Paxil, Lexapro, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Effexor, Remeron, Trazadone, Abilify."
427,"I took the first pill last night, and it's my first experience with any sort of SSRI, or any form of medication other than aspirin/tylenol/etc."
428,"Now here's my question:
I'm going on a 4 day cruise in 10 days and am thinking I should stop medication until after the cruise."
429,"I'm not on medications right now and can't get on any for a few months at least, so I just have to figure out a way to deal with these I guess."
430,There's no shame in considering medication.
431,"Taking medicine turned my life around, find the one that's right for you, I tried three before I found one that doesn't make me hazy."
432,I have no medical coverage and I'm broke so seeing a professional about this is impossible.
433,"It's been a while since I've had an attack (I don't take meds/I haven't discussed it with my family, so that's dumb on my part)."
434,I don't want to go back on my anti-depressents and I am already taking a medication for my anxiety that I love.
435,"I have never sought professional help for my anxiety, and although this is largely because my anxiety has prevented me from doing so, even when I've felt confident enough I've refused to seek help because I don't want to be put on medication."
436,"Surely if one has a mental problem, allowing your brain to become reliant on medication to correct it is just going to make it impossible to function properly without it?"
437,"I've never had any kinds of medicine or treatment for anxiety before, mostly because I'm too scared/embarrassed/proud to ask for any (which is stupid, I know), but I also didn't start noticing many problems with anxiety until July 2012."
438,The city I live in has the best medical center in the world.
439,"TL;DR Currently on Wellbutrin for GAD, what are your experiences/opinions; what other medicines (preferably non-ssri/srni) may help?"
440,I was on medication for about 2 months then stopped.
441,"I had been doing so well off meds, and now have had a lot of stress in my life."
442,"So here they are again, and I will resume my meds since they did work well."
443,"Recently started a new medication, which was very scary for me because I don't like taking things that I don't know what they will do."
444,"Even when I started this medication, my thoughts were ""How is this going to help?"
445,The medication is allowing me to get to a point where I have the resources to care for myself.
446,"For me medication will not be the answer, but it provides a door to a long tunnel to the other side of this mess if I'm willing to do the work."
447,"Now a couple of years ago, I started having extremely bad panic attacks out of the blue, to the point that I am now currently on medication (Lexapro) for it."
448,"They discouraged me from seeing a therapist/taking meds, but this isn't about them, this is about me."
449,"I've also tried Lexapro and Zoloft, but I'm not keen on meds and I got off them earlier than recommended (weeks.)"
450,"I'm not keen on meds for a few reasons, all of which are my personal beliefs and I don't mean to belittle or offend anyone on them."
451,Just in case: I'm not on any meds (aside from some pain killers for now) and I've never been diagnosed with anxiety problems of any kind.
452,I have health insurance that covers what I would need to see someone about therapy or medication.
453,"Girl in above story actually gave me some meds that helped her in similar situations (which again, I should focus on that she cares about me enough to try to help me instead of dumb phone shit) but I havent noticed any difference really."
454,I've had panic attacks all my life and I have been she people about it and taking meds.
455,"* - I used to eat very healthy and do a lot of cardio, but since my sleep meds has lowered my blood pressure I can't do cardio without fainting D: and I have been eating very bad unhealthy stuff lately."
456,"Coincidentally, this is how long I've been taking my meds (escitalopram, 10mg once a day)."
457,Could the meds and/or anxiety be causing it?
458,"I know this did not happen on its own, I did years of therapy, studying, and medications (I am no longer on.)"
459,Ive never taken any meds for my anxiety before and today was the first time I talked to somebody about it (except my mother).
460,"I took off last week to allow myself to adjust to the medication, but also because I was scared something was going to happen go me on my way to work... Now, it's 1230M, I'm supposed to go to work tomorrow and I'm profusely sweating and have myself believing something is going to happen if I go to work tomorrow...."
461,"A month before her graduation she began to take medications for the attacks- I don't remember which ones specifically, but there were two."
462,"She was on the daily medication for about eight months, and closer to our wedding she got off it."
463,She still has the other anxiety medication to take when the attacks get bad.
464,"The medication is helping, but full-effect is still a little while away."
465,I went on medication and it's been 4 months so I've decided to re-test.
466,Been on anxiety meds for about 1.5.
467,I don't want to take meds because I'm trying to get off of them.
468,should i get an anti-anxiety medication to help me sleep?
469,It's my first time taking any kind of medication and to begin with I was feeling very positive about it.
470,I know medication isn't going to be a miracle cure but I'd like to know how long it normally takes to kick in to see how well it's working for me.
471,"My doctor told me that a side-effect of the medication is anxiety, and I expressed myself probably a little too hostile-- ""NO, I don't need MORE anxiety, THAT makes me feel anxious, just thinking about it!"
472,"This is the first time I've ever been on any kind of medication, and I suppose it's a bit worrisome."
473,"Edit: just thought i'd add, I haven't been on any medication for probably a year now, and I've been a lot better."
474,I was going to a doctor and got some meds.
475,I've seen my primary and in the past 4 years I've had countless medical tests and procedures done.
476,"i go to bed panicking i won't wake up the next day..  and go throughout my day checking my temperature with my thermometer i carry with me if i'm feeling particularly anxious about my temp..  (probably should stop doing that)..  

i have smallish pains in my body..  

i wonder how much of it is my head making the issue out and how much are actual issues..  i know a decent bit can be caused by anxiety, but i don't know how much..

my nurse practitioner told me it was okay i take myself off the anti-depressants i was on if they were making it weird..  increased panic and weird dreams = taking myself off..  

only thing is that's the 3rd time i've ""failed"" a particular class of medication, and she's told me that she can't do anything for me if that's the case."
477,Foundation of my therapy was samatha and vipassana meditation + cognitive behavioral therapy rather than taking meds.
478,"Met an amazing girl, made new friends, went on some trips - made the mistake of going off my medicine."
479,I am confident and hopeful that returning to my medication and potentially going back to therapy will help me get back into recovery.
480,I see a therapist and psychiatrist every month and take my daily medications every morning.
481,"I feel like i have the right tools through therapy and medication to stop the anxiety/panic but it just steam rolls over me.I try to read, go for a walk, talk to someone but it feels like if a panic attack wants to get me, its going to get me."
482,I am wondering if anyone has any advice for temporary meds with a short half life and minimal withdrawals to take during a withdrawl from venlafaxine .
483,"Well a few weeks ago,  the doctor decided to check my prostate, but instead of stick his fingers up my ass, he decided to stick a giant stick up there to take pictures of my prostate and bladder (Was not a pleasant experience) Well all came back normal and he said I have an overactive bladder and gave me this medicine to take for 2 months."
484,"I took an oxycodone to help ease it and am waiting for it to kick in fully, but I know it may not help the headache itself since different pain medication types work on different kinds of pain."
485,"Therapy and medication are not to be overlooked, despite the unfair stigma that may surround them."
486,"This past month he's been going to a psychologist and a psychiatrist because he decided that he wants to stop using medication (the Parotexine, which he has been using without any supervision from either a psychologist or a psychiatrist for about eight years now, I think)."
487,"I am on medication, so I no longer actively have outward panic attacks...but my fear inside is just as strong."
488,I pushed through it as I am not on any medication.
489,"Im not against taking medicine again, but im not exactly looking forward to it."
490,"If I play along with my health anxiety, I will end up spending all of my money and free time visiting doctors and going through medical tests."
491,That I am registered and receive accommodations through our school and that I seek medical help.
492,"I just started a low does of Lexapro (for anxiety, social anxiety and depression, may be adding more meds later but psych wants to do one at a time to see how i react) and I've had some side effects."
493,"So I'm not asking for medical advice at all, I'm just trying to figure out if anyone else has experienced this."
494,"I haven't been on anxiety medicine for a long time, probably for 5 years."
495,I think these are things that would make normal people freak out so I'm not sure if it's reason to get back on anxiety medicine.
496,"If I do need to get back on medicine I worry about the doctors appointment, hospitals and doctor offices stress me out and it embarrasses me a lot to cry with a room full of people in a waiting room, does anyone have any suggestions to help me out with that?"
497,"TL;DR: If I have a reason to have a lot of anxiety, do I still need medicine?"
498,"If I do need medicine, is there a way for me to not embarrass myself at the doctors office?"
499,I have trouble breathing and writing and I'm out of medication.
500,"Is it possible to try out anxiety medication without it ""rewiring"" your brain forever?"
501,"But also wanted suggestions of some meds that don't cause weight gain due to struggling with that from Paxil and finally losing all of that, I want to avoid it coming back."
502,"I dont know where to start really I would ask a friend but I dont trust any of my friends to help me so ill ask here the last 8-9 years I have been afraid to go out anywhere but I still do as hard as it is im mostly afraid of being laughed at or humiliated and it always feels like everyone is ready to do so every year it gets worse I cant really tell you how meny panic attacks I have per week I really dont know mostly because I try to forget them as soon as I can but I can tell you this there level of severity ranges from very low to very high at a very low level I tell myself to calm down over and over and at the worst well the worst was a few years back it hasnt been that bad sence (leave it at that) I have panic attacks when standing in line or just being in a group of people I wont even go to family outings any more I know I need help but im not sure who to goto or who to ask I dont have medical insurance all im asking for is maybe a few suggestions or a few helpful hints 





Update: 10/28/11 so i know i took waaay to long but i just made the frist call ill update more after my appointment witch is in a few days"
503,"She is on medication, something along the lines of Prozac, and seeing therapy but I don't think she is completely honest with the therapist."
504,I used to be on medication for anxiety.
505,I have anxiety disorder and I've taken my medicine but it doesn't seem to be helping.
506,"When I first developed this anxiety I went to this doctor S. Doctor S prescribed me Ativan and a sleeping medication and sent me on my way, but he made me feel a little uncomfortable and I wanted to try someone new."
507,"I am moving out of state soon, I don't have the time to be trying new medicines like this."
508,"Last time I told him to please just let me start taking the prozac again, side effects were minimal compared to these new meds and it works."
509,I would like to get on a good medication now so I can think straight and sort this stuff out.
510,"This, by the way, is with the help of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication."
511,"Now I don't like psych meds and I don't like homone replacement therapy, so I started doing some research on my own."
512,I'm confused as to why I'm still feeling like this and why is it still so intense even when on meds.
513,"Do you suggest asking to change my meds, or have I just not stuck with the citalopram long enough??"
514,I'm hesitant about changing meds and it would feel like I'm starting all over again.
515,"I'm on meds, I've tried a million different types, I've been through countless hours of therapy and was even inpatient once in the hospital for behavioral health."
516,Last week I was told by my doctor that I could remove my daily dose of Buspar from my medications due to my new abilities to help control my anxiety.
517,"I was on this medication for years, so to be finally able to come off of it was a huge accomplishment."
518,"It's still a daily struggle, but coming off these meds is a big step!"
519,"However, I have talked about my therapist about the possibility of going on medication."
520,The option I was given was the kind of medication that you take regularly and the kind you take as needed.
521,that's just a guess off the top of my head) and am wondering if anyone would share their experiences with those types of medication.
522,"I'm a student of psychology at university and, particularly lately, studies have shown that cognitive therapy can be equally, if not more, effective as medication."
523,I've also tried 3 daily anxiety meds to no success as my body absolutely does not react well to changed in the serotonin levels.
524,2) For the meds - has anyone found good daily medicine to control anxiety outside of the serotonin inhibitor family?
525,I am wondering if anxiety medication could be useful for when I have these episodes.
526,"Technically, if I asked him ""I think I have anxiety attacks and I think anti-anxiety meds would help"" that is drug-seeking."
527,I feel the best thing for me is medication because I've been living my whole life with depression and social anxiety.
528,"Basically the point of this post is to get this stuff off my chest and also, how can I convince my mom to allow me to get medication?"
529,She is on a lot of medication and not eaten will obviously make her feel like that.
530,Did you try counseling + medication?
531,I was able to go without any meds and didn't have many panic attacks.
532,"i have anxiety as it is (it's normally manageable so i don't take medication for it, and it really hasn't been bad at all for the past few months), so right now it's through the roof."
533,"i'm having a lot of back pain and some nausea, which i'm sure is from muscle strain/stress, but i'm really worried that i'm having a heart attack and brushing it off like my family friend did (he had a bit of health anxiety and thought everything was serious too, and this time he had a medical emergency going on for days and brushed it off, but by the time he actually went to the hospital he died hours later)."
534,"After 18 years of dealing with panic disorder I'm at the end of my rope so to speak, so I have found a place that focuses on functional medicine and getting to the root cause."
535,"I've posted about it again and again whenever I get anxious, and I've received feedback telling me to try medication."
536,But I was just wondering about medication and how it actually worked.
537,"But to give him and *myself* a piece of mind, I've been thinking about going to therapy and asking for medication."
538,Let me know your past experiences with the medication.
539,I have to get some kind of medicine or see some kind of therapist because my life is being controlled by this.
540,"Found out in my first visit that three meds I am currently on (two psychotropics,  and one to treat my migraines) all leach away Vit B's."
541,I don't want to boost my meds again.
542,Thank you if you guys know any medicine can help me.
543,What are your views of taking the medication Lexapro.
544,I am on medication for depression and have emergency medication for panic attacks/severe mood swings.
545,"Anxiety medication is the last resort (again), and I'm kind of hoping they end up putting me on some type of mild sedative, so I can at least do some type of work."
546,"I was beginning to feel like I'd gone in a kind of remission to my anxiety/panic attacks and depression, so I wanted to see how I'd do off medication."
547,"I've quickly realized I wasn't any better, the medication just suppressed it..."
548,"I need to know that if I'm going to be on medication forever, there's one out there that doesn't cause SO many long term side effects."
549,"I am calling my mothers social worker tomorrow to organise daily care for her, a social worker for my dad is supposed to call me tomorrow morning
and i will also call his own doctor to see if there is some type of monitoring that can be done, or medication to settle him."
550,"My tools, my medication, my stubborn attitude aren't enough this time."
551,"He then suggested that I can try Ciprolex, which he said about 40% of his patients suffer from decreased libido, but is also a good medication and much cheaper."
552,I spoke with my doctor about medication but I felt as if I would try to seek advice and counselling first.
553,Should I take more medicine that day?
554,Would pursuing drugs or medications be helpful or am I just being wishful?
555,I also don't have a lot of money to try to pay for therapy or medication.
556,"I know I can't get better by myself, but the thought of being on medication and having it not work scares me to death."
557,What else is there to do if no medications are able to help me improve.
558,The only medications I've tried seemed to kill my emotions EXCEPT for the anxiety.
559,He gets medication monthly.
560,"The only benzo that has relieved my suffering is Clonazepam, and I have developed a tolerance to that medication due to using it daily to help me get through my last partners suicide."
561,"The medication still works, but only at high doses (3-4 mg) my psychiatrist doesn't like the idea of giving it to me on an as needed basis because of its long half life, and while I understand the point he makes, it's also hard to accept because it was the only thing that helped me through my darkest moments and panic attacks."
562,But I just keep thinking man what in the hell would I do without my meds?
563,I want to give the medication at least a month but I don't want to be uncomfortable the entire time.
564,"About a year ago, I got prescribed escitalopram and thought 'fuck it - I've tried most other anti-anxiety medications so why not?'."
565,"Is it me, my failing relationship or my meds?"
566,"I'm not on xanax or the other medication thats for anxiety (I'm really sorry I'm such a noob at this, the meds that start with a C) and I'm trying to get an appointment with my psychiatrist and a therapist, but I really hate relying on meds to be ""okay""  

I feel really weak and pathetic because I need almost constant reassurance that things will be okay eventually"
567,I took it for awhile but eventually i kind of just started taking it here or there and it didnt really feel important since there was no proof it was a seizure and i hate taking medicines i think i dont need especially stuff that involves my brain.
568,Also i had just taken my anti seizure medicine before leaving for my friends house so i guess that rules that out.
569,2 have said it could've been the mixture of meds I was given after my car accident.
570,They never really found a medication that has worked for me.
571,A lot of side effects wore off as the weeks went by and the medication worked it's magic.
572,"For about a week and a half, after the meds had time to set itself, I felt amazing."
573,"I've been struggling with general anxiety fpr quite some time now, and I've been getting professional help without medication for the past year."
574,"For the first time, after getting my medicine, I have an anxiety attack and needed the xanex."
575,"I never thought my anxiety would get this bad, and xanex is an addictive medicine."
576,"My mom doesnt know I went to the doctor and got my medicine, but I feel better."
577,"So every time I notice this ""feeling"" of emptiness/sluggishness/ weak feeling, I trust myself in believing that there has to be some kind of underlying medical problem."
578,"I of course hope I have no medical condition, but if it's not medical then I'm completely horrified."
579,I started medicine recently but it hasn't been long enough to kick in.
580,"I lost my insurance and could not afford my medication, so over the course of a month-2 months, I halved my dose and then halved it again until I ran out."
581,I know as soon as I get back on my medicine I'll be fine again and I'm afraid of scaring off a guy I really like early on in our relationship.
582,"I got my approval letter for insurance, but my coverage does not start until March 1st so I can begin my medications again and get back on track, however that is still awhile away and I'm having a hell of a time in the mean time."
583,"My question is, has anyone else withdrawn from this medication?"
584,"Being the anxious person I am I've googled every horror story involving meds but I've gotten to the point where I have a lot of stress coming up (in med school, boards are in 5 months) and I've finally let my pDoc prescribe me something."
585,So being on the medicine doesn't bother me at all.
586,Im afraid of switching medication and it not working.
587,"I may take my medicine a few hours early and head to bed, or not."
588,I don't know if it's medical or not but my chest feels like its caving into my lungs.
589,I don't want to go off of the meds because they help so much and I'd rather be spacy all the time than be extremely depressed and have anxiety/panic attacks.
590,Over the years it kind of ebbs and flows but I've always been able to keep it together on my own and I had always hoped that I would never need medication.
591,"I'm not sure what - therapy, counseling, medications, whatever ..."
592,"At any rate, I was on some anti-anxiety medication (paxil and later, lorazepam) from the ages between 16 and 23 (I'm 27/m now)."
593,Originally I began medication because a friend of mine took his life when I was in highschool.
594,"I didn't want to go back on medication because I was slowly getting off of it, but I thought it was best."
595,Should I be going back on medication?
596,"I was thinking of seeing a psychologist, especially because I am very hesitant to use medicine."
597,Neither do I want to start on some meds.
598,Do you think getting medication can be a good start?
599,I don't know do meds for anxiety really work and change you or they are just blocking the symptoms or something like that...
600,I don't want to be put back on any sort of medication.
601,I had really slipped when things started to get pretty bad and then took a year off... came back this year and finally was diagnosed and on the way to get my meds sorted out.
602,I've been through different meds but never quite found the perfect one.
603,"I've been off meds for a year and a half after a terrible experience with desvenlafaxine, but now I've gone through a major life change and my symptoms are starting to overwhelm me again."
604,I think it's time to get back to meds for a while.
605,"Haven't done it since I went off the meds, but it always goes through my head."
606,"I also have ADHD but have decided to not take meds for that, since they made my anxiety worse."
607,"I've been seeing a therapist for awhile at a clinic, and she recommended seeing the resident Psychiatrist to get meds, so today I finally went."
608,I'm not on any meds other than Progesterone only birth control pills and the Ativan I just took when I got home.
609,"For this instance, its because her father is visiting and he hounds her about her meds and such."
610,"Fast forward a bit more (after my train breakdown incident and letting go of crappy ADD meds) I recall quite often, at night being in bed with my girlfriend and watching ONCE AGAIN the door."
611,My medical record was finally reviewed by a psychiatrist which then switched my meds completely.
612,First time taking this heavy of meds
613,I should've started weeks ago but I've got a fear of medication (I hate not knowing what reaction I could have with substances as I have an unknown allergy that almost killed me in the past.)
614,"My main fear of this medication is because my ""allergies"" are now so broad that I know that these pills will set me off, but my doctor has told me just to keep going regardless of what they do to me."
615,"Has anybody else experienced increased allergies as a result of anxiety, or noticed an improvement with medication?"
616,"I have never been diagnosed or treated, am I a candidate for medication (what about side effects, possibly with birth control)?"
617,Are there medications that I should flat out avoid?
618,I've finally come to terms with the fact that I need meds...for whatever reason it bothers me greatly to go on meds.
619,"I've studied psychology (just graduated with a degree in it, actually) and I know anxiety can be the same thing as diabetes; both can be manageable with no medication, but sometimes meds are necessary."
620,I'm terrified that any medication I go on will make me gain weight.
621,"After trying to cope with meditation and other methods, I feel as though I would benefit from seeing a psychiatrist and receiving some short lasting medication, and was wondering how medicine has helped anyone in a similar situation to me."
622,I know the dangers of becoming addicted to benzos etc...I just want to know how medicine has or has not helped any of you.
623,I sought CBT and took meds for this particular conundrum before but honestly just want someone to talk to that gets it rather than another terrified look and unnecessary apology for my situation.
624,"* I’d tell my other sister she needs medication for her depression

* I’d wear my diapers proudly and without fear

* I would fix people’s computers and bill them, for the obscene amount of money I deserve

* tell the CEO how much she hurts me when she bullies me

* be alone with my own brain for a day

* Have a conversation with a stranger

[update] In the light of day, some of these seem extra crazy (I should be afraid) and many seem like 'i could do that'."
625,"Basically I'm schizophrenic, and while my psychiatrist and care worker will give me help and meds for the psychosis, they don't seem to care about the anxiety attacks that I experience daily, and everywhere."
626,"I guess the point of this is do I need some kind of anti-anxiety medication, temporarily?"
627,"I try to do all the stuff I'm supposed to do to calm myself and change my thinking (therapy, changing self talk, mindfulness, meditation, medication, exercise, etc.)."
628,"Since I did that, I went about 3 days where the meds weren't seeming as effective, but that has seemed typical that every two weeks around the same time I'd have a few days like that."
629,"Now they're effective again but now I'm back to where the effects will fade over night and I feel okay, but I don't feel ""great"" until about an hour after I take the meds."
630,I know it's a side effect of the medication but it brought back that intense fear from anxiety that I'm dying and no one will know hecause I'm the only one who's awake.
631,So I'm wondering for those who suffer from similar situations what was your bodies reaction to the treatment/medication.
632,I honestly have no idea about any anxiety meds or anything...
633,I have meds but meds are meds (in other words I still feel this anxiety) &amp; I don't have enough ativans to keep popping them over the next 10 days or so.
634,I'm considering going back on meds.
635,"A giant part of why I'm anxious about seeing a psychiatrist is I've been misdiagnosed before, and been on the wrong meds."
636,I went to counseling for two years and on medication for two years as well.
637,I don't want to go back on medicine.
638,I got my medical record from when I was in ER for chest pain.
639,Number 10: people with ADD/ADHD like me that dont take stimulant medications NEED exercise!
640,"In the end if nothing works dont be afraid of getting medical help, even if drug therapy is a definite option."
641,Being on drugs under medical supervision is potentially a very good way to incorporate and shape ur positive lifestyle.
642,"It's been about a year now on the meds, and my anxiety and obsessive thoughts have been basically null."
643,"Now, don't get me wrong, I'm totally supportive of her being on ADs and have never pressured her to change medications or stop taking them, because sex isnt important enough for me to make her stop taking something that makes her feel normal, and good."
644,"It's just something we talked about together, and she's considered changing medications because nothing else was helping her orgasm."
645,"Also, since she's on a higher dosage of Cipralex, would she have weird effects when changing her medication to something that's a little more libido-friendly?"
646,"So I've posted here before and thankfully have been helped out quite a bit and made an amazing recovery in a short span of 3 months from my anxiety(only took meds a handful of times ) and it was great, for that I will always be thankful to this subreddit, but today and the past three days I've been feeling these symptoms and would like an opinion:
New symptoms not present before:
-Pain in left arm (only began today) and it went away after a few hours, has not returned
-the feeling of something stuck in my throat permanently 
-my limbs go numb really fast when I sleep on them (never used to)
-very constipated(I get enough fiber and drink lots of water)
-my throat feels incredibly dry all the time even after a healthy dose of water throughout the day 
Returning symptoms:
-the feeling of my heart dropping in my chest 
-churning stomach as If I were nervous all the time
-shortness of breath

Last time this happened I had a handful of EKGs done and all looked fine, I'm keeping my meds and aspirin at hand when I sleep in case of emergency but this is driving me insane, I keep having paranoid thoughts of an impending heart attack."
647,"I'm worried about working tomorrow because I don't want to have to take meds while on the job, or if I will be allowed to at all."
648,"Anyway, just wanted some opinions/thoughts I don't expect a professional medical opinion of course but reassurance is always helpful especially when someone speaks from experience and I've felt this before and pulled through but these new symptoms are what are fueling my paranoia right now, thank you for any responses and stay strong everyone!"
649,"Only side effects have been some yawning, a little dry mouth but i can still wank and i still feel horny just takes a little longer but it's better as i was wanking like 5 times a day before

so ill hopefully give an update in a month too see where i am and how im going

also starting a nice execrise and diet program on monday to shed that 10kg's i want and get a sixpack for summer yew

feeling good people, id suggest trying medication for those at are afraid it may work for you so don't look for reviews online because if i listened to them i'd say nope wont work and wouldn't be enjoying myself as i am now."
650,"I'm not sure if the meds are speeding things along, or if I'm just THAT out of shape."
651,"Since that happened, I figured I would go and see a professional about medication."
652,The suggestions provided here are not explicitly medical advice and are not intended to replace psychotherapy treatment.
653,"However, I have had this compulsive thought that I have obsessed over for about 3-4 years (I have been taking medication for OCD since kindergarten, same dosage, just fyi) and it is very hard to describe; I just keep thinking about how I don't get how I can move my body, like just all of a sudden I'm moving my body and I don't know how I am doing that, and then that makes me afraid that I am not going to be able to move my body or something and it just keeps on going like that."
654,Should I try to back off the Xanax and talk to my doctor about getting my OCD medication upped?
655,"Usual coping strategies:

* yoga 2-3 times per week

* relaxation exercises before bed

* setting small goals for daily progress (like, get dressed upon waking)

* adequate &amp; restful sleep

* taking my supplements daily (not currently on medication other than BC, which lessens my mood swings)

* planned social outings with a couple friends at a time (not spontaneous - I always know who, what, when, and where)

So my overall strategy is to focus on my thesis and get that done, but I've been having anxiety attacks every couple nights as I'm going to bed, and I won't get to sleep until 2 or 3am, which has created this cycle of sleeping in and then not being productive that day."
656,I have never been officially diagnosed but I tried out a few meds from a doctor with no luck a few years ago and tried a therapist.
657,I did a therapy and got daily medication (which I still take today).
658,"I have an ""emergency medication"" for those moments, lorazepam (I think in the US it's compareable with *Ativan* or *Orfidal*) but I can't take that every time I'm feeling striked by a slightly but constant panic-attack."
659,"We are seeking help in the medical community, so that is covered."
660,Anyway starting to feel like maybe zoloft/meds in general are not for me.
661,"I've been prescribed many other medications which had little to no benefit and I've seen several psychologists, social workers and psychiatrists, some better than others but none of whom who could ""fix"" or even really help at all with my declining mental state as the panic, anxiety and depersonalization pretty much took over."
662,"They prescribed me synthroid, and it put my mind at ease, knowing that finally, these meds will help this awful feeling go away."
663,I also really don't want to go on any SSRI's or anti-anxiety meds.
664,Except medication.
665,"Anyway is that unheard of, reduced anxiety due to taking anti inflamm meds?"
666,I asked if he had any medical issues I should be aware of and he told me that he had suffered from mental illness a few years ago and had had to go into a psychiatric hospital.
667,He said that he was on medication now and desperately wanted to reintegrate into society.
668,"And I really feel legitimately scared - even if he is now on medication and has his illness under control, I still feel that somebody who has committed such a severe crime is a danger to me and to other women."
669,He has recommend I go on medication.
670,The two medications of choice are Lexapro or Celexa.
671,"Now, I knew people who go on medication for anxiety+derealization/depersonalization+depression but I feel that I hear so much about those medications leaving the taker unfulfilled, with a void in their life."
672,"Here I am, no anxiety, no panic attacks, no medication, just a normal dude."
673,It's my first time being prescribed any sort of medication so I'm a bit skeptical/worried on what to expect.
674,Or is it just a fact that meds can only do so much when my head is full of screwed-up thinking that can't even be changed by understanding logic?
675,I should also mention that I can't see my psych until June 8th and that the meds she suggested I adjust over the phone haven't been working.
676,Should I seek out medical attention and maybe medication?
677,"I want to stop, but more than I want to stop taking the medicine, I want the ANXIETY to stop."
678,"I was first diagnosed and put on medication a little over 10 years ago, but I haven't been medicated for approximately 3 years due to lack of health insurance."
679,"I wasn't able to fight through it over the past few weeks to have my records sent from old doc to new one, and now I'm worried that the new doc won't trust me when I tell her what meds to put me on (because I already know what works and what doesn't)."
680,"I've never taken medication for my anxiety before (just therapy for coping mechanisms, it was very helpful overall) but I'm really considering making an appointment for that purpose, because I think my fear of losing this job may just turn into a self-fulfilling prophesy soon."
681,Hooray for medication!
682,"(Maybe I'm making up symptoms, what if medicine changes me, etc.)"
683,I'm diagnosed adhd and take meds for it and my significant other is highly introverted.
684,"A few years ago I was diagnosed officially with GAD, although I'm no longer on medication as it was too costly to keep going to the doctor's at the time."
685,I should mention I have ADD and was taking medication for that as well.
686,"Once DH got a better job and were doing better financially, I decided that I was sick of taking my meds."
687,"The doctors determined that the diuretics had taken a toll on her kidneys and she could no longer be ""aggressively treated"" for her water retention problem, and the hallucinations were due to her medication poisoning her."

694,I have been a bit sloppy lately (bad sleep schedule leads to late mornings and outside of my routine taking meds is easy to forget).
695,I take other medication as well but theres no interaction there.
696,"Ive also tried benzo's without other meds and diazepam as well , same reaction."
697,"As of yesterday, back on therapy, and meds (I hate that I'm on them, but we dicussed that they are for short term.)"
698,Do people who have anxiety issues always seek medication or are there other ways of dealing with it?
699,A glass of water and medicine.
700,He upped my dosage of Lexapro from 10mg to 20mg and also prescribed this new medication in the title to take as needed.
701,"**

Anyone have anything to say about this medication?"
702,I am not on medications because my mom doesn't want me getting hooked on them and I don't have a counsellor to talk to.
703,It would also be helpful if you could give a brief description of your symptoms that led you to medication.
704,"My dad pretty much told me ""you shouldn't walk out of that office with some sort of medication""."
705,"If I tell him that a few attacks have arisen due to weed, will that impact an ability to get some sort-of medicine?"
706,Would revealing that weed has caused some (not all) of my panic attacks impact the possibility for some sort of medication?
707,For about 5 years now my doctors (I've moved around) have suggested that I take anxiety medication.
708,I've always refused medication.
709,I'm very afraid to take medication.
710,"Please, someone tell me that the meds don't make you numb."
711,**TL;DR** I'm afraid of what getting on anxiety medication will do to me.
712,"But recently I've discovered that my dad has anxiety too, and even was prescribed medication (my mom made it seem like it wasn't a huge deal) but after a while quit taking it because he ""didn't want to be propped up on it his whole life""."
713,"I'm kind of scared to talk to my family or friends about it because they all think I'm a pretty well adjusted, happy person....and I don't want to blind side them with something crazy like this and freak them out......I feel like I need to go to a therapist and maybe get medication or something."
714,But I don't know if there's any medication to deal with this kind of thing....and I really don't like the idea of medication but I'm not sure what else I can do.
715,"Truthfully, I was in a much worse place mentally when I was taking that medication."
716,Reassurance that its okay to give meds a try?
717,"I don't plan on being on the meds for an extended period, just until I can get into some counseling and get things under control, until I learn to deal with my anxiety."
718,Should I talk to my Dr about changing medications?
719,I'm also nervous about medication because I write music and I am afraid of what it will do to that.
720,I just wanted to point out the irony that adjusting to my anxiety meds has made me over the top anxious.
721,"I had started taking medication weeks before this and it has completely made my thinking worse, and how I feel about things."
722,"I panicked every single day and ended up texting her to remind her this isn't me, and it's the medicine that she even wanted me to take to help myself."
723,"All but one of my friends just say ""be mentally stronger"" or tell me how bad medication is for me."
724,Or should I try a different medication?
725,"He doesn't realise it but he's very naturally against mental illness or medicine/tablets such as anti-depressants, it's just kinda of sub-conscious."
726,"I'm seeing a doctor about it soon, i'm not on any medication currently and whether i need to be i don't know at all."
727,should i get medication?
728,I'm thinking now medication might be the next step.
729,I don't really know if I'm seeking advice on medication or if I just need to vent but I'm not in a good place today.
730,I don't like having to use medication because I think the cons outweigh the pros.
731,"I've tried everything so far except medication, I'm sick of wanting to stay home, not spending time with friends, my poor boyfriend basically has to beg for even a kiss because I just feel like shit."
732,"I stayed at my parents house for 3 days this past weekend and forgot to bring my medication with me, so the last time I took my pill was on Thursday night."
733,I currently do not take medicine to control anxiety as I have not had much success with medications.
734,This has been going on consistently through therapy and various anxiety medications for essentially as long as I can remember.
735,I've just been put (just over two weeks) on the meds but it's the first time I've felt hopeful.
736,I also plan on maybe getting medication sometime early next year if it continues.
737,I was curious if anyone has gotten medication for it and if it's helpful.
738,"At the age of 19 I was then put on Lexapro by my GP, then began seeing a psychiatrist soon after who continued me on the same meds."
739,"So, long story short, I want to get off of SSRIs and all medication."
740,I'm not currently on any medication but perhaps I should talk to my doctor about going on some.
741,A few weeks ago I started taking medication for anxiety/depression.
742,The first time I sat down to meditate after the medication started to kick in I was amazed…at how *freaking easy* meditation is now.
743,I feel like my life is not genuine when I am on the medication.
744,"I talked to my bishop and he said ""The Lord made medication to help us, this doesn't make you a weaker person""

My question and topic is."
745,Should us who need medication just accept the fact that we need chemical help; or should we find a way to deal with it sans medication?
746,About to start taking it and I've never been on any meds before.
747,If needed though I will incorporate actual anxiety meds but im currently optimistic that Passionflower and CBT will help me overcome anxiety.
748,"**NEEDLESS TO SAY**, DO NOT take with any other anxiety meds without talking to your doctor first."
749,"That's what we'd really love to do, but unless one of you wants to volunteer to pay the medical bills, it's not an option."
750,"We've considered disability, but the catch to that is that you have to have extensive medical documentation of your problems to have any hope of winning a disability case, and how are we supposed to afford such medical documentation without insurance?"
751,"She did some simple tests on me to rule out further testing for brain MRI's as I thought I had brain cancer/tumor but this one doctor could feel my worry and concern and instead of prescribing me medication (as all docs before her did), she told me to buy this book that only cost me $3.49 from amazon."
752,I'm so terrified of being put on medication because I don't want to feel plastic.
753,"Can you think of anything, outside of meds (a last resort option for me) that I could do to try to resolve this?"
754,"I have been medicated, but then I get the thought process of ""I hate that I need medications to be normal."
755,I was just diagnosed with panic disorder and PTSD and started meds (a combo of very low doses of Prozac and Xanax) a few days ago.
756,"I've also been curious about trying shrooms, but don't know if my anxiety (or new medication) would get in the way of having a good experience."
757,"Anyway, since I started my medication my anxiety has been at an all time high."
758,"Anyway, I know the medication isn't fully in my system yet, I just worry about my anxiety being at an all time high since I've started taking it."
759,TL;DR when do signs and symptoms of anxiety start to fade with combined therapy and medication?
760,Doctors mentioned medication but I don't want to become reliant on a drug to regulate my mood (I know I smoke weed already but I'm gradually cutting this down).
761,I've been going to a local clinic to receive medication that charges based on income.
762,I was being prescribed a benzodiazepine by a doctor at this clinic but this medication has been blacklisted from being prescribed.
763,I'd like to continue this medication so I'm thinking of visiting a psychiatrist outside of this clinic who will continue my prescription.
764,"I know that psychiatrists charge per visit and I'm not looking for psychiatric counseling, so I'm wondering how often a psychiatrist expects someone to come in if they're just doing medication management."
765,"I'm guessing it depends on the psychiatrist, but I'd like to ask if anyone here is seeing a psychiatrist to receive medication and not for psychiatric therapy and if so how often are the follow-ups?"
766,"(if you want the link just ask) Is there some medication I can take that makes it just go away, and I keep my sex drive?"
767,"I have a history of GAD and am about 2 months into a new medication, could this be contributing to the symptoms?"
768,I was depressed for 3 years and took some medication to help me out of it.
769,I've been seeing a councilor and we've both agreed that medication was the next logical step.
770,"I didn't eat anything yet, just sipped water and took my meds as usual and something got me to the point of puking."
771,"The meds didn't work, well they did help with the anxiety, but so far the SSRIs I've been on all make me horribly depressed ... but hey they stop the panic attacks!"
772,I'm currently on NO medication because my last round of Lexapro wanted to make me kill myself.
773,"She has access to quite a lot of medicines to treat her autoimmune disease, so overdosing wouldn't be too hard of a thing to do."
774,"I was given a prescription for meds for my short term anxiety, and those have helped me, but I don't want to take them unless I absolutely need them since they aren't the long-term type of meds."
775,My partner wants me off the meds badly but I don't know if I shouldgo back on something to get some relief.
776,now its the 3d month and I don't feel that the meds are working.
777,"I'm not used to taking meds in the morning, so it's not uncommon for me to be sleepy enough in the morning to forget to take my meds before I head to work."
778,"I don't usually drink any caffeine, but I had one morning last week where I was literally falling asleep at my desk after forgetting to take my meds and so I grabbed a cup of coffee."
779,"I noticed that my anxiety was actually better than when I was on my meds, but it's kind of a sweet spot; too much or too little and it screws with me."
780,"I've noticed that the best combination is when I remember to take my meds AND I have about 2 cups of coffee, but the second best is no meds with 2 cups of coffee."
781,I have recently gone off my meds a month ago after 7 years on them.
782,"So a two years ago I went to a doctor that was recommended to me and I asked for anxiety meds, I got my prescription and came home and realized he gave me exactly 15 xanax - for a year."
783,"But he made me feel like a pill seeker when I asked for the meds, it's VERY difficult for me to ask for help, so I lived with it."
784,Is my body adjusting or should I talk to my psychologist about switching meds?
785,"I take medicine for it but of course, it doesn't always help."
786,"I am a little afraid to try other medicines, but I want to know, what should I look for as potential alternatives?"
787,Have any of you guys ever have something similar to this happen to you on any medication?
788,"I'm worried that if I take the Prozac I might have some nasty side effects and/or experience withdrawal if I try to stop, which is a concern as I really don't want to be on medication more than a year at most."
789,That way I can also continue to work on it with my therapist and hopefully be off of the meds sooner.
790,Or any other medication?
791,What meds would I most likely be given?
792,"Pregame: Honestly, I probably should have taken small bottles of liquor with me to take the edge of since meds are no longer a thing for me, but instead I pregamed with my crochet (like knitting)."
793,"I don't know what's worse, the idea of losing him for his own mental health or the idea of admitting that I'm a worthless piece of shit who needs mental help and committing to a lifetime of heavy-duty medication and being a zombie."
794,I've been in therapy but I always refused medication when it was suggested.
795,"I was assisting in surgeries, euthanasia, office work, janitor work, grooming, animal care, medication dispensing, and going to multiple unpaid meetings."
796,I can't afford therapy and I can't afford anything but Anxiety medications from my general dr and they just make it SO MUCH WORSE!
797,I've never taken anxiety medication because of this.
798,"I decided that I don't like feeling so drowsy and out of it all the time, due to the medicine, and wanted to stop taking it."
799,"My anxiety is at a phenomenal level, one that I have not even experienced ever prior to taking this medicine."
800,"I believe I'm psychologically addicted to it because once I start experiencing this sheer panic of having a seizure from stopping the medicine, it subsides a second after taking my dose, and I know the medicine doesn't work that fast."
801,"I told her I wanted to go through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, not be on any long term medication after she tried pushing an SSRI on me, and even after me telling her this, she prescribed this medication ""just to take the edge off while I'm doing the therapy."""
802,"I am going to be put back on medication soon, and thinking about it terrifies me."
803,I've never had a good history with pills or any sort of medication.
804,The rare times I could visit my Dad he would take all the medication and flush it in one go since he doesn't believe in medication.
805,"My friends all said that it wasn't healthy to mess with my medication and constantly be going on and off, but none of them had any problems (or so I had thought), medication, therapists, so I would get in arguments and have breakdowns."
806,After faking a happy act for a while I was taken off of the medication when I was barely 12.
807,"Two months into the school year and I had begun to form very unhealthy eating habits (skipping meals and binging later, restricting), but my Mom thought that the medication was really helping me, when I was really the acting classes I took after school twice a week."
808,"Every little blob was disfigured in a bright colorful palette that made it burn to open my eyes, I felt like it was some sort of lucid dream, someone had messed with my medication, no I threw away my medication this morning."
809,But I'm about to be put back on medication soon.
810,"I no longer use pain medication, sunscreen, commercial toothpaste, or anything weird to ingest/ put on my body."
811,"I eventually settled with Biomedical Engineering, which I am *incredibly* happy with."
812,I was in charge of one of the many hotel rooms and this dog usually gets medication with this meals (in the past some supervisors usually take his dinner and put in the meds) well this dog went swimming earlier so he wasn't allowed to get his dinner until later.
813,When the time came to feed him I was wondering if my supervisor had given the dog his meds because he didnt get fed yet.
814,"So I went over to the meds sheet and read it, and I read it wrong."
815,"I thought the dog had not gotten his meds, so my thought process was:

""Okay he gets meds in his food."""
816,"He said he already gave the dog the meds without food and came running in the room, he then showed me that I had misread the medication sheet."
817,Its like my brain completely failed me because even if the dog actually didn't get his meds ITS NOT MY JOB TO GIVE THEM.
818,"Late November, I finally decided it was time to try out medication."
819,"But really, to think I may have found the right meds so soon alone makes me joyful."
820,"A few months ago I switched to a new medication, mirtazapine."
821,Now on this new medication it's making me feel panicky.
822,"It seems like I've learned to control that better now - thanks to meds, therapy, and my girlfriend."
823,"The appointment went great, my doctor prescribed me some meds to try and we headed back home."
824,"If I had to put a number on my anger and irritability before any meds, I'd say I was a frequent 8/10."
825,"After starting on meds, an often 6/10, and sometimes 8/10."
826,"She refuses to try medication and never did the ""homework"" given to her by her therapists (ie."
827,"I am in therapy &amp; on medications, and have recently been reading about Buddhism, since I need something more."
828,"MY ONLY concern is that she doesn't get put on all these medications her whole life, i am very much against long term usage, if she needs to take whatever medicines for a few months, i'm okay with it, but i don't want her on anxiety or depression pills her whole life, its not curing the problem, its just masking/numbing it."
829,"I have an appointment with a psychiatrist for next week, but I don't think any non-medicine things will make a difference."
830,Lifelong (until now) anxiety and trepidation about any kind of doctor visit or medical procedure.
831,tl;dr Childhood medical procedures fucked me up with serious anxiety about anything to do with doctors; decided after 16 years it was time to fix it; fixed it.
832,"I go to therapy, and I take psych meds for my anxiety and other mental illness but I also drink passion flower tea and it helps when my anxiety is so bad that my body just feels ""off""."
833,For clarification on my medical background in case you're wondering: I've never been diagnosed with any mental health issue before and I've never gone to a therapist.
834,"Edit: As well, I'm 22 and no longer taking medication or attending therapy."
835,"However, after some bouts with meds and some years, I've leveled out about as nicely as I can hope for."
836,When I first saw a doctor for anxiety I was prescribed Celexa (20mg) and given clonazepam to take as needed until the meds kicked in.
837,I'm going back to my doctor soon and want to ask her about some medicine combinations.
838,Once I go back to work I won't be able to return to the doctor every month to adjust my dosage or the medication I'm on.
839,TL; DR- The medications I've been prescribed thus far have been limited in effectiveness but have crappy side effects.
840,Before going back on my meds my resting heart rate was between 95bpm-105bpm and everyday was an anxiety fulled nightmare.
841,"Now that I've been on my meds I am able to function and go out and do things, and my resting heart rate is between 75bpm-85bpm."
842,I was just wondering if it's normal or ok for a persons heart rate to have that much of a change with just medications.
843,I know 5-HTP isn't a 'real' medication like SSRIs but it's my last line before I approach a doctor for them.
844,"I realized that over the course of several months of being on this medication I began to stop answering my friends text messages, stopped becoming enthusiastic about anything, and my interest in anything was very slight at best."
845,So this is why Ive decided to stop taking my medication.
846,"Im nervous to try new medicine, but i really need to get a hold on my anxiety before i go back to college."
847,"I am a pretty anxious and neurotic person as is, but due to some bad experiences with medication in the past, I've tried to find non-pharmaceutical routes to dealing with my anxiety."
848,"Now, the psychologist who did my ADD testing simply recommended a stimulant medication (adderall, vyvanse, etc.)."
849,"I feel like the medication is the only thing that could potentially help my attention defecit, but i don't want to have to go through more panic attacks if i have to."
850,"To get to the question, can anybody with anxiety here take a stimulant medication without it triggering a panic attack or making your anxiety worse?"
851,"I have taken a friend's ADD medicine during high school (i know, i know) before my anxiety began, so i know what it feels like."
852,"It doesn't affect my day to day life like my panic attacks did, so I'm wondering if it's something just associated with my anxiety that I don't need medication for exclusively?"
853,"**


I've suffered from anxiety since I was 17, exactly the time I was taking anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications for my mental issues at the time."
854,"Before taking the medications, I was perfectly fine when it came to anxiety and never, ever suffered from a panic attack."
855,"I can't take medication for it and even if I could, I don't want to have to live off of medication for the rest of my life in order to function."
856,I only left to do groceries and pick up prescriptions and medications.
857,"I'm not sure if my recent spike in general, constant anxiety is due to a increase dose of medication or what."
858,"I finally decided to accept medication, and I have been on cipralex for about 2 months."
859,I rejected the idea of medication because I didn't want to believe I needed it to be happy.
860,"Not just medication, but in anything that offers you some kind of peace."
861,Do i need to consult and doctor and take meds?
862,"Background: 
I had to take a medical leave of absence due to depression &amp; anxiety from graduate school last year."
863,I took a medication named Risperdal for 3 months.
864,The last time I took the medication was match[march] of 2013.
865,"I am unmedicated due to my mom not wanting me to have medicine, because of a suicidal almost attempt thing."
866,"I have no history of anything medical, physical, psychiatric or otherwise."
867,"A bit of background, I'm at 20 year old male who's a third year college student, I'm not on any medications and nor do I want to be."
868,"Trust me, I am seeking the right kind of support, I've been on dozens of meds and I am still figuring it out."
869,"Nothing feels okay, I've been seeking different forms of treatment for years and nothing has paid off, not even medicine."
870,I feel like medicine doesn't help me.
871,Effexor worked great (only noticed a bit more sweating) and I took that up until about 5 months ago when I decided that I wanted to try living without medication.
872,More recently: My anxiety is not nearly as bad as before but I still often get that sick feeling when I go out with friends so I had my doctor prescribe me Klonopin at .5 mg to take as needed because I wanted to try everything that I could before going back to taking meds every day.
873,"My ADD medications were not helping me focus anymore, they only helped combat the tired feeling in my head."
874,I went back in 2011 and finally found medical help.
875,After reading some of the side effects I became really anxious about taking the medicine and am now having second thoughts.
876,"** The puppy and it's owner have recently been abroad on vacation, and because of a tapeworm called Echinococcus Multilocularis, there's a whole regimen of medication you need to give the dog at a vet's within 5 days before departure - and then when you're abroad (again, at a vet's) if you're gone for more than 5 days - and then *again* within five days after you get home."
877,"**The owner knows I'm a hypochondriac,** so I usually just ask her about these things (I've had a lot of dog related hypochondria scares), and she'll tell me what the dog has done, what vaccines it has, meds it has taken, and so on - but what if she hasn't followed the tapeworm medicine regimen?"
878,"I went off my meds (Cymbalta/SSNRI), and I feel good about that decision because I'm meeting the ""demons"" that cause my issues head on, and no more side effects, but I'm beginning to wonder if I'm really strong enough at this point in my life to live without them."
879,"He is on medication with some improvement, but anxious feelings and attacks persist."
880,"I was in therapy (cognitive behavioral, no meds) for around a year but haven't been seeing anyone recently."
881,At the moment it's reasonably managed with medication.
882,I currently take depression medicine and am going to talk to my Doctor for anxiety medicine.
883,I'm in pre-medicine so it's a lot of work and competition.
884,"I was put on Zoloft (100mg I believe) for that, but then I was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and was given medication for that as well."
885,I told my therapist I didn't want to up my medication (10mg lexapro) until this term is over.
886,"I politely declined every offer and tried explaining the anxiety was getting worse, and I'd been taking the medication as prescribed."
887,My medication runs out in almost a week.. and I'm freaking out.
888,"Just before i jump into my story when i say self medicate i mean i am using the anxiety medications i was prescribed from 1-2 years ago, now."
889,"I have 2 months until the course, 2 months to entirely stop the medication, 2 months to improve myself as a person and 2 months to decrease my anxiety by doing exposure type therapy, good luck to you all with anxiety, i wish you all luck, anxiety is such a motherfucker but the fact that you are seeking help simply by looking on this forum means you are TRYING."
890,We currently owe a lot in medical bills because our son has had health problems the last few months.
891,And I really don't want to take any meds unless absolutely necessary.
892,"He didn't prescribe me medication but encouraged me try some tricks to help with my anxieties.If I get prescribed, what medications work for you guys?"
893,I feel fine on the 100mg when I'm also smoking weed but I don't want to have to rely on that until my state has medical marijuana.
894,"i currently don't have health insurance so meds/therapy are out of the picture, and i would much rather use techniques and natural methods to help my situation."
895,I was in for a consultation and before I knew it I was signed up for $2000 medical loan and added $800 to my visa for a program of pills and lazy help.
896,I started aggressively trying to treat my anxiety/depression with the help of some medications.
897,"A lot of blood tests, an MRI of my head, and a chest xray later, i still cannot find out what would be medically wrong."

908,"Anxiety disorders are often treated with SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medications, such as Zoloft or Prozac."
909,"Benzodiazepines are often effective in providing short-term relief from anxiety symptoms; however, they do carry some risk for dependency and addiction, which physicians must take into account when prescribing these medications in Northport."
910,"Benzodiazepines as Treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Benzodiazepine medications are commonly prescribed in Northport as part of treatment for generalized anxiety disorder."
911,"In fact, four common benzodiazepines--- alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan) --- are among the top 100 most prescribed medications."
912,"Although not everyone who takes a medicine like alprazolam is necessarily going to become dependent on it, physicians in Northport generally take these risks into account when prescribing them."
913,I have always had it to a degree but it has got progressivley worse after a rough year last year dealing with medical (heart problems) and family problems (wife miscarried).
914,"It didn't immediately hurt so I don't think it was too bad, and the only pain I have now is the burning of the scraped/slightly bleeding skin.. so I'm pretty sure it's nothing to worry about medically.. but I need to keep telling myself that in order to not freak out."
915,"I get as much sleep as I can (lost my sleep meds, a couple nights of hell)."
916,"I've tried probably 20 different medications, most of which have fucked me up more."
917,"And even if I get medication, there's the potential of going through a fucking medical laundry list trying to find something that works."
918,I just started taking medications.
919,I think that this could be because of the medication and maybe it literally one day just kicked in.
920,"Because of my medication, not I can."
921,"My whole life, I couldn't fathom how to control my feelings and with this medication I finally can."
922,I've only seen life full of anxiety and I guess maybe I had REALLY bad anxiety and now the medication is making me normal and who I am.
923,Is my medication just kicking in and is this a great success story?
924,I have been having to rely on my medication.
925,"The medication is working, but it's a short term effect.."
926,"Is there any medication that works in the long term that you take, that you think I should ask my doctor about?"
927,"I see a therapist weekly but I feel like I get nowhere without medications, and even then, I don't notice any progress."
928,"I have Health Anxiety, so of course I googled up the medicine, even though I've taken it before, in fact, earlier this year."
929,How can I calm down and take my meds?
930,I also started meds (Pristiq) just yesterday.
931,Thankfully with the help of medication I was able to get it under control.
932,One of my big triggers is medical issues (hypochondriac).
933,Even though less than a year ago I had a full medical work up where they said I was perfectly healthy.
934,I've reached a stage where I'm extremely dependent on the medication to even get tired at night.
935,So the question I have is this: Has anyone encountered medication for anxiety which doesn't have effects on your sleepiness?
936,I'm already on a low dose of depression medication is it better to ask my doctor for a acute anxiety medicine like Xanax or try other coping methods for the attacks?
937,However I got my diet under control and got a started on some meds.
938,My anxiety is recognized by my primary care physician and I'm on medication.
939,It has existed before and after my medication.
940,I'm off meds now and stopped seeing the therapist I saw for 4 years.
941,I began a D supplement and thyroid meds.
942,"I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's, then needed more thyroid meds, then adrenal fatigue, then Epstein Barr Virus, and that's likely not the end of it."
943,"She told me to take my klonapin, but because of my issues, I HATE medications and will avoid them until there is no other option."
944,I just picked up my medication and I've never had it before.
945,I know never to mix the two but with my problem I want this medication to help as soon as possible
946,"I'm not asking for medical advice, I'm just wondering if, in the meantime, I can even call what I have, ""panic attacks""."
947,"I have been irritable, unreasonable and weepy for about 3 weeks now (I was on the medication for 9 weeks before I quit)."
948,"Anyways, medication sounds like it could be a good idea."
949,I am not currently on any meds due to only recently having started with my health professional and I have been given relaxation techniques but I find myself worried over my work and my job and providing for my wife and baby.
950,Oh and not to mention the 30 plus K medical bills from my dad's hospital bills after he passed away.
951,"I thought I would share my experience with my medication in the hopes that it may help someone, or at the very least resonate with people."
952,"Obviously medication isn't for everyone, but it definitely saved my life."
953,Hate being dependent on medicine to keep me rational.
954,"My concern is, today I've still got a cramp like feeling in my chest, I normally worry about medical issues and heart attacks."
955,Back on meds but not Paxil.
956,Came off meds.
957,I'm back on meds.
958,She is on medication for it.
959,"Anyway I post again asking for any assistance, I've had it recomended to me to try to come off of paxatine to try new medication, but paxatine is well known as a heavy side effect drug to come off of, I've lowered my dose from 40mg to 30mg and am alredy feeling like hell."
960,I bought some generic Tylenol Cold Multi-Symptom Daytime and Nighttime cold medicine.
961,"I started having chain panic attacks shortly after my first dose, and they lasted for hours until the medicine finally wore off."
962,"It didn't take me too long to catch on that the meds must have caused it, so I looked up the ingredients."
963,"Some side effects are worth researching, and I'll be sure to check out the ingredients in my replacement cold medicine prior to purchasing for sure."
964,It's completely infeasible for me to meet with a doctor to get any kind of meds.
965,Later this month I will be going to see my old psychologist and looking at medication for the first time in four years.
966,The people at the place I go to have told my mom that medicine is an option that can be discussed later.
967,Can medicine help me?
968,"And no meds, no way of getting them."
969,I waned off both the meds and therapy only to find myself back drowning in it as soon as college started.
970,"I got back on the meds and I've been completely fine, until last week."
971,"Hey everyone,

As per my doctor's recommendation I'm slowly weaning off my medication that I've been on for +/- 10 years (Paxil 40mg), to be put on another medication, and I was wondering what kind of things to expect (physical sensations, moods, etc)?"
972,I hope the medicine helps soon.
973,She has gone to see psychologists and psychiatrists and she is currently on a few different forms of medication.
974,"Male, 20 y/o, no psychiatric diagnoses/medications."
975,"She told them she takes klonopin and paxil, which are, if you don't know, anti-anxiety and anti-depressant meds."
976,"I then found out that over the months leading to now she had been asking various friends that she had about it, she went to a doctor's clinic to get it checked, she has been calling various medical professions about it, etc."
977,"She's been on some form of anxiety medication (she won't tell me what it is) for about a week, and I like to think it's getting better."
978,"Things had been going really well for me, my therapy was going great and things were improving, and then my medical exemption ran out (meaning the government now expects me to start looking for work)."
979,"My psychologist and my GP recommend that I am nowhere near ready for this (I have social anxiety, some agoraphobia and severe depression), and usually I get a medical certificate, it gets accepted and I am exempt until I have to go through it all again."
980,"I'm so tired of people looking at me like I'm faking it, like I'm trying to cheat the system, when all I want is a little breathing room while medical professionals help me start to improve."
981,I told my boss I was on prescribed medicine before I took the test.
982,"To be honest, I am quite scared of taking a medication that is going to hide or change my emotions."
983,"Also, I don’t want to become dependent on this medication every single day (for the rest of my life) to have a happy life."
984,I am prepared to stop so that I can get used to my new medicine and so that in four weeks my doctor can make a clear evaluation.
985,Should I have to worry about smoking while on my medication?
986,"I know that serotonin syndrome is a risk in combining these meds, but doc says it is very minimal and I would be slowly increasing the amount of Elavil I'm taking daily until it was at an ideal level for me."
987,"With therapy and medication, I've come to realize that those kinds of thoughts were caused by the anxiety, and were not an actual reflection of reality."
988,I was just diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and told my job I was having a hard time with medications.
989,I knew at the time he had anxiety problems and was taking medication from it.
990,"He told me a bit about is problems, but since he was on meds, symptoms were never really an issue."
991,About a month ago he told me that he felt really confident and that he decided that he was happy enough that he didn't need his meds anymore.
992,I'm destructive to those around me; when i'm off my meds i just cant control.
993,I know that since he is only recently coming off his meds (been coming off for about 8 weeks now) he may be suffering from withdraw.
994,I'm taking meds for depression an anxiety and that seems to be going ok.
995,"Problem is, when I was given a 3 month dose, I went to a different place for my medicine for convenience."
996,Anyone have this sort of problem with generic medicines?
997,"I've always had sleep-related issues (difficulty maintaining sleep, 7/8 wakings/night), but I've never taken specific medications besides melatonin."
998,"Meanwhile, Mum's sister has been diagnosed with depression and has been on therapy and medications."
999,"She's getting worse, she's becoming incapable of dealing with her life, and I just want her to be her old capable self, or at least learn some coping techniques or find some medication which could help."
1000,"I realize that I should speak with a psychiatrist --and trust me, I will not take medication without the assistance of a trained professional-- but I was wondering about my fellow Redditors experiences with Lexapro..."
1001,"I've never taken any meds since then, other than birth control."
1002,"So recently I was taking some medication and while on the medication I was experiencing eye twitches(standard side effect of the medication) and the occasional muscle twitch in my arm, doctor said that was caused by tiredness."
1003,I don't feel like I need therapy or meds on a general basis as I am still functional.
1004,"I have been on meds since November, but I am still feeling suicidal."
1005,"As a caveat, I am not looking for medical advice."
1006,"I have been agoraphobic with panic disorder for 23 years (agoraphobic on and off, the last 6 years on) and although I do have a doctor for meds for anxiety, I have not had therapy in 7 years."
1007,I'm 24 and haven't taken medication before for any of my issues.
1008,"I wasn't doing great, but I was a bit better when I was on medication, seeing my doctor &amp; a therapist."
1009,all this happened when i started medication and therapy.
1010,I can't tell if I'm just worry way to much about things or if I should call the doctor and get some medication.
1011,"I have an appointment this Friday to discuss the medication with my GP, but I'm curious if this is normal or not?"
1012,And I've been getting headaches and intense dreams after finishing up the meds.
1013,"******

&gt;Many of you know that I live with a few physical medical conditions."
1014,Back then the medications for anxiety were in their infancy and not covered by insurance.
1015,&gt;(Now of course the medication available for mental illness are a godsend.
1016,"I will state that not everyone with a mental illness has access to either therapy or medications, which I believe is a crying shame."
1017,"Remembering to get Pollux's medications refilled on time, not to mention getting him to not vomit up said medications."
1018,&gt;So I talked to our doctor and was given a short-term medication.
1019,But it bought me time and gave me relief enough to do some research into other medications.
1020,"**As an aside, I won't be mentioning the specific medications, as every person's body chemistry is different."
1021,&gt;Shortly thereafter we (our doctor and I) started playing with new medications.
1022,The first long-term medication we tried actually made me depressed as a side effect.
1023,We switched to another medicine that night and suddenly I felt like myself again.
1024,"I work in a group home for people with intellectual disabilities and when giving meds we have a 2 hour window to do so (so if it's an 8pm med then you have from 7 until 9), if it's outside the window you get a med error."
1025,Basically in the dream I had waited until the last minute to give meds so I had 15 minutes to do the meds for the four individuals.
1026,At one point I was yelling at them to turn the lights on so I could read the medications and pop them in the med cup.
1027,So after I got up and turned the lights on and went back to doing meds I started to hyperventilate in my dream.
1028,"Then, in the fall of 2013, I started trying out different meds, to see if I could find one that worked better for me."
1029,"So how this relates to meds: Leaving the hospital, the doctors wanted me on no narcotics."
1030,"This is pretty rough considering I had loads of broken bones -2 burst vertebrae, 2 broken vertebrae, 4 broken ribs, cracked manubrium, broken ulna and radius- and am now off opiate pain meds."
1031,**UPDATE:** I ought to add that BuSpar isn't my first medication.
1032,"Ive been doing well with them lately, ive noticed that once I have tappered off my meds (Paxil and Xanex) that the severity of the panic attacks have gone down."
1033,"I really want to try anxiety meds again, but I know I did not trust myself with them 3 years ago."
1034,"I'm on medicine for my anxiety, effexor XR, and it's working pretty well for me."
1035,"I have tried therapy, medication etc."
1036,As my education is being effected now I decided to go on medication and using beta blockers is probably a place to start.
1037,"everyday from there out till today id wake up and have crappy thoughts and feel crap, feel sick in the stomach and vomit and go to the toilet all the time ""Number 2"" on Saturday and Sunday i would fell amazing and normal so i always looked forward to it, however i did not seek help because i thought what i experienced everyday was normal as it runs in my family and my dad and his dad has it, other symptoms i get is freezing feet, always tired, horrible memory, horrible concentration, and always think something bad iss going to happen eg, house burn down :Z.

anyhow i am now 19 and seeing a therapist and started taking Paroxatine 14 days ago i have yet to see any improvement but i know medication takes time 6 weeks at least."
1038,"i have come to terms that my anxiety will not go away i am just hoping that the medication at least aids in the severity of it, and the therapy gives me techniques on how to deal with it which therapy is all about."
1039,"I had panic attacks, but I was still able to deal with every day life, and I attribute that to my medication."
1040,The week between the two medications was crazy.
1041,I want to get off my medication because I feel like I could do better in school.
1042,I want to get off of my medication but I don't think I can every be in a romantic relationship without it.
1043,"and
Do you think it is smart to get off my medication if it is clearly helping me deal with everyday life?"
1044,I'm wondering if medication could be the best option for now.
1045,I just don't want to visit a doctor and tell them I just want meds because I don't have time for therapy... That seems a little sketchy.
1046,"For those of you taking medications, could you share your experiences?"
1047,How can I talk to my doctor about taking medication without seeming like a potential drug abuser?
1048,"It's been treated on and off since I was 12 or so, first just the symptoms-migraines, dizzy spells, etc., but I was finally diagnosed and got appropriate meds around age 30."
1049,My SO is super supportive and was pretty much responsible for my finally getting the right doctors and meds.
1050,Should I get my meds adjusted or changed?
1051,"From the sound of it, it seems quite bad and we're in the process of getting her some professional/medical help."
1052,"I told my friend about this though and she was making a big deal out of it asking how do I know that it's from the anxiety and meds, it could be something serious and I need to talk to my doctor because even if it is a side effect, it's a serious side effect."
1053,"I'm pretty sure it's maybe more apparent because of the meds and as my ""issues"" have gotten more serious, I've become a ton more anxious."
1054,"And if so, what medicine do you think would work for me (if the Concerta is part of the issue)?"
1055,"I'm also wondering about your guys' medication stories--BuSpar, ADs."
1056,"I'd love to do it without medications, but I feel like I might be in too deep and too afraid of too much to be able to re-integrate into a social life without crashing and burning."
1057,Did medication help you?
1058,"Thanks for taking the time to read this :)

A little background, I've dealt with anxiety/panic attacks since I was 10 years old, I've learned how to manage it on my own without any medications about a year or so ago, still present but have the skills to calm."
1059,I finally broke down and decided to try medication for my anxiety.
1060,"My mom in particular keeps telling me how worried she is about me, and how she wishes I was on medication so she could feel better."
1061,"They're all convinced that lexapro wasn't for me, and I need to keep trying different medications, but being on lexapro was such a frightening experience I don't think I can ever go on medication again."
1062,What have your experiences with medication been like?
1063,I know it's probably too early to tell but I just hate wasting time on medications when I feel like such crap :(
1064,UPDATE: It turns out that one of his friends that he went to see yesterday happened to have a medical emergency later into the evening.
1065,"I have taken Kavinace and it done wonders last year for me, for a herbal medicine alternative."
1066,I can't tell if this is a panic attack or something medical...
1067,I have been prescribed multiple anxiety medications as well but have yet to get past my problem.
1068,Does anybody have any experience with appealing a university decision on the medical grounds of anxiety?
1069,My counselor told me that she would not recommend a doctor's note if I can help it because in many circles professors would not recognize anxiety as a legitimate medical problem.
1070,My attention never improved with the medication.
1071,I chose to stop taking the medication after a few months.
1072,"I started 20 mg Viibryd 1 month ago today, after over 10 years of unsuccessful treatment, over 7 different medications, and almost no hope remaining in my soul."
1073,"I am open to taking medication, but a little nervous about the idea as well."
1074,I took those meds for about an entire month out of fear of getting more anxious.
1075,"Experiencing new weird stuff, almost like paranoïa, and figure I should write this stuff to wait for my meds to kick in rather then building up more anxiety by letting my brain go free."
1076,I asked my doctor for medication for social anxiety and he prescribed me paxil.
1077,I really hated the idea of taking medication that would numb my emotions.
1078,I also hated the stigma around such medication.
1079,Should I look for a better medication?
1080,"All in all, I ended up getting started on 10mg of lexapro, even though i'm strongly against medication personally, she assured me that it would help."
1081,"Gotta get through the first couple weeks, today is day one and the medicine is sort of making me a bit tired."
1082,Does anyone have any experience with this medication?
1083,I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was pretty young and my parents opted to keep me off medication.
1084,"I'm very nervous to get help though, my ex-gf passed away from being on too many prescriptions, and my family is very ""organic everything"" and ""nobody needs medications, you just got to be more disciplined"" and shit."
1085,"Depression aside, bipolar aside, other symptoms aside, what medications are you taking /r/anxiety, and does it help?"
1086,"I'm on several meds that should help and getting therapy, but I'm getting no relief."
1087,I had anxiety all my life but am on medication now so im a lot better.
1088,"I don't particularly want to get on medication (I was previously with some terrible side effects), but I can't even get an initial consult with the mental health center until November."
1089,"I'm on meds now and haven't had an attack since starting them, until this."
1090,I make good money but not quite enough to pay for health insurance separate from my own (Of which she isn't covered) so taking her to a doctor and getting her some medication seems to be out of the realm of possibility.
1091,I tried to look for over the counter anxiety medication and apparently it doesn't exist.
1092,Been on anti anxiety/depression meds for the last 8 years.
1093,Tried so many different therapies combined with different meds but nothing ever seemed to work.
1094,"I had been struggling with stress, social anxiety and depression for a while before this, and it got to a point where I was actually thinking of talking to my parents about it and seeing if I could find some meds that might help me."
1095,"I know there are some people who actually do have serious problems such as severe anxiety and depression, and some of those people do need medication to help, but I think a huge number of people diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and a number of other problems don't need to be on meds, and if they can just take the time and effort to better their lives, they can do it."
1096,It's been a while since I've posted (or needed to) because my meds have been absolutely amazing (aside from some memory loss).
1097,"At the start of my 15 birthday i started taking medication for my anxiety, as it was getting worse and forming panic attacks, starting home phobias and social disturbances ."
1098,I was in amazing shape and i believe i quitting medication or slowly got off it myself (sorry cant remember) it seemed everything was working out and i grew out of it.
1099,I attend community  college and beginning of my 2nd semester of freshman year i cold turkey my medication and felt great and exercised and went to school clubs and what not.
1100,"I scheduled myself to see the same therapist and plan to follow through on everything she says, yet i don't know if i should go back medication."
1101,The whole reason i quit medication was because it was making me sick.
1102,I have tried several medications and combinations over the 3 years (18 now).
1103,Should i go back to medications?
1104,What medications would not have the most side effects?
1105,"I'm on meds, but I generally rarely take benzos."
1106,I was told I should see a doctor about anti-anxiety medication.
1107,"Last year, I stopped taking my anxiety medication."
1108,I decided to get on medication and have been on Prozac for about 6 weeks.
1109,"I am going out for a bachelorette party tonight and want to have a couple drinks, because I feel like my anxiety is pretty well managed by medication."
1110,Have you gone on medication and been able to control your anxiety the next day?
1111,My doctor has put me on some meds that don't seem to be doing anything but give me pain &amp; headaches.
1112,I'm just wondering if it's worth the money and time of getting all sorts of medical scans to ease my mind...
1113,"My sleep patterns are all screwed up because of my medication (I almost think I may also have chronic fatigue syndrome as well, I sleep for at least 16 hours a day, but still feel exhausted and really anxious when I'm awake)."
1114,I feel more relaxed being off medication than on it as I worry about medication side effects.
1115,"I know this subreddit isn't for medical diagnosis, but I'd really appreciate some opinions about what my issues sound like or how best it'd be for me to go about approaching professionals."
1116,"I stopped taking a medication that I had been taking for a while, and as a result my job performance has weakened significantly in the last few months (don't feel like going into details on that for now)."
1117,TL:DR ENT says Eustachian Tubes (previous doctor said I probably have ETD) are pretty finicky and don't respond to medicine/there's really no treatment.
1118,"That had never happened to me before, so now my only reliable medicine is either not working or making shit worse."
1119,"My shit normally starts from medical related things like chest discomfort, odd feelings, ect... Health anxiety i suppose."
1120,"So, naturally taking new meds sucks for me, especially when im reading about bad experiences people have had."
1121,I haven't had the chance to start on any medications or therapy since I've been visiting my dad in another part of the country all summer.
1122,I finally started seeking help by getting on medication and seeing a psychologist.
1123,My Dad regulates it through meditation and using a workbook and my sister uses medication.
1124,"I've been thinking about trying meds again, but I have no idea what to try."
1125,"I've been thinking about meds again, but I am really not fond of SSRIs."
1126,"tl;dr: Tried meds and therapy, but I'm ready to try again."
1127,"Also, i find that within the first few hours of taking the medicine, i feel kind of spacy and tight chested, kindof like the beginnings of a panic attack."
1128,"I'm currently on medical leave from a job I thought I genuinely enjoyed because one night last week, I had a panic attack and somehow convinced my brainmeats that the only way to make the bad feelings stop was to injure myself."
1129,"The first session with him wasn't bad but he revealed to me that he is against treating anxiety with medication (while, admittedly, meds were what I was hoping for) and insisted that if we went through some of the more troubling memories from my childhood, it would fix everything."
1130,Has anyone else tried this ayurvedic plant medicine?
1131,"New meds, more therapy, move back home with parents because I can't be trusted to be alone."
1132,"About a month ago, I was put on 75 mg of Effexor for generalized and social anxiety, as well as minor depression, and it's proven to not be the medicine for me."
1133,"I've started the process of weaning myself off it and will probably look into cognitive behavioural therapy as an alternative to medication in general, but I understand coming off the drug can be rather difficult."
1134,I've had bouts of therapy and medications throughout my teens and early 20's.
1135,"Note: When my anxiety medication wears off, I now GET anxiety immediately."
1136,After that I decided I didn't want to depend on the medication any more and started working with a Psychologist on my anxiety.
1137,I started it 14 days ago and I felt like it is the right medication to help me quit lorazepam completely.
1138,I'm reluctant to be on any medications because I used to be addicted to drugs.
1139,I've tried so many medications in my life it's ridiculous.
1140,"I made it to my first therapy session today, and the doctor said I should go on medication considering how long I've had panic disorder (almost 10 years now)."
1141,This medication has ruined my life.
1142,"I've started CBT, and I'm trying new meds to help deal with it."
1143,"I don't want to get back on medications, but I need a breather and to find work that doesn't have me possibly having panic attacks."
1144,I've tried a few different types of medication but they all seemed to make me feel worse.
1145,"I'm thinking about seeing a GP and asking for a different kind of medication, I heard Lyrica and Gabapentin are quite effective for anxiety."
1146,"My parents won't let me see a psychiatrist anymore (not like I have time anyways, I am at school from 7 AM to 5 PM, and until 11 PM I am doing homework), and they are deadset on not allowing me to take medicine."
1147,"Their are totally medical descriptions of this, but among people I've spoke to who have had attacks, and who have spoken about them publicly, there seems to be huge variation in what they feel like and consist of."
1148,I find myself doing really well on my new medicine of Lexapro.
1149,"It was just awful, but I got medication and by the time I was 13 I was totally anxiety free."
1150,I stopped taking my medication back when I was 18 and from then on it wasn't an issue.
1151,"So, I have suggestions to start taking Xanax to ""deal"" with my anxiety, but I'm strongly against all kind of medications,because I heard many stories that antidepressants and anti-anxiety pills can help you temporary to ease up the symptoms,but it fuck you up in the long run."
1152,I thought I had my medication in a good place until recently.
1153,There's not a direct medication that can be prescribed for everyone.
1154,What meds plug that mental hole for you?
1155,"Celexa and Seroquel, are my current meds..."
1156,"I don't know what's wrong with me, I always take a good 8 hour sleep everyday so that's out of the things that would make me feel sleepy, and I don't take any meds except for Vitamin C supplements."
1157,Maybe it's time to get some meds but I don' t like taking medication.
1158,I've tried meditation and several kinds of sleeping medications.
1159,Now I'm even more stressed because I owe so many medical bills and have no job.
1160,"I've tried multiple medications (Lexapro, Celexa, Cymbalta, Abilify, Zoloft, Xanax), and most of them haven't done much for me except relieve my insomnia."
1161,TLDR: I've been through a lot of trauma I haven't dealt with even in 2 years of therapy and a shit ton of medication.
1162,I've had benzos in my medicine drawer for 5 years.
1163,I don't fit the profile of someone who abuses meds.
1164,"Open to other effective meds, of course."
1165,My medication doctor hasn't filled my anti anxiety medication so I've been off it for 3 days.
1166,Anyone else decide to stop using medication?
1167,"I am seeing a therapist a couple times a month, and I am not taking meds (I don't want to be on them)."
1168,Currently I'm on no meds besides the methadone and my depersonilization is always present.
1169,I've been seeing a therapist for half a year and I do not take medication (I have lorazepam and beta-blockers but I never use them).
1170,"I am not a 12 year old, I am a 30 year old who was just diagnosed with GAD and have been working through it with a variety of methods, therapy, medicine, breathing exercises and stuff like that."
1171,Ever since I have been having recent massive panic attacks and got diagnosed and on meds I have not had an epiphany like this.
1172,"I know that the meds and the therapy have helped me in these weeks, and helped me realize that I have had this problem for a long time, but I just want to say ""fuck you anxiety, seriously, fuck you."
1173,"I've tried ginger root, drinking flat 7up, antinausea meds, and antacids."
1174,"I don't feel like I noticed the ""night and day"" difference that some people describe when I started taking it, my anxiety and depression symptoms aren't as debilitating as they used to be, but I don't know if I should attribute that to the medication or just lifestyle changes, and I don't want to experiment with stopping it because the withdrawal symptoms make me feel like crap."
1175,"Hello all,
So I've been seeing a therapist and counselor and taking meds and whatnot for a few years."
1176,"While all this is going on, My mother is in a rehab center to try to become independent enough to come home as she has tardive dyskenasia from her meds she was on, but after visiting with her after viewing an apartment, it became clear that she wouldn't be able to come home and I will have to turn it over to Adult Protective Services to have them assume guardianship and have her put in a Nursing home (something she always dreaded because she used to work in one)."
1177,D: Should I seek medical attention?
1178,"I usually trust my mother's opinion medically (she's not a doctor, but she works as a Pharm."
1179,I took myself off a lot of medications actually.
1180,I just recently moved to Atlanta and pre-move my anxiety was managed and I was off of medication.
1181,"On top of that, I got a lecture from a dentist of all people this week about anti-anxiety medication and about how useless therapy is because, ""people can solve their own problems."""
1182,"They've tried everything to help me, therapists, ADHD medication (even though I feel  I don't have it)."
1183,"*necessary stuff*


There is a huge stigma attached to meds in my my household, my mom personally knew a man taking antidepressants who killed himself, and my dad had a terrible father who also abused many substances, so he believes that anything that alters the way you thing is bad and it took tons of convincing to try a barely helpful amount of ativan

I was wondering what the best course of action is."
1184,Any specific medications that are all natural?
1185,"Is medication needed, or even an option?"
1186,"**

*EDIT: The medical professional would obviously know better than the average citizen, but I am still a bit perplexed by the diagnosis."
1187,"By first time, when nobody was sure about what's really happening with me, there was a suspicion on epilepsy but medical examinations, such as EEG or MRI denied it and doctors announced that my problem is fully mental."
1188,"He also really wanted me to get off the meds as well, so I decided to stop."
1189,I had a breakdown at work so I am in therapy along with on a medicine regime to try and control my OCD and anxiety.
1190,Stuff I tried: Taking meds in the evening instead of morning didn't really change a thing.
1191,"Hi, I have anxiety and been on medicine for 8 months, am coming off them now and I feel like my chest is so tight, am kind of lonely..my family in another country and my friends I feel like they don't really know what am talking about when it comes to anxiety and depression."
1192,I'm not on medication.
1193,"Maybe its the change to my anxiety meds, but I do not feel the need to post on a social website about this anymore, but my family sees it as this huge insult."
1194,I do not take birth control or any medications.
1195,I'm going to talk the a psychiatrist soon to talk about medication I might take.
1196,Just wanted to ask if anyone knows any medication that doesn't make you feel weird?
1197,I've been to a doctor and have gotten some anxiety meds along with depression meds.
1198,I've been on and off meds and working through therapy.
1199,Currently I am on adhd medication and my doctor has given me the option of starting Prozac or doing .5mg of klonopin in the morning and night.
1200,"So to recap I'm supposed to take these two medicines and I ""might feel better by Easter"" in the mean time I'm supposed to just stop thinking anytime I feel anxious and breathe, not take the klonopin I got from my school doctor that I took maybe three times a week tops, and then he might do therapy."
1201,I started on lexapro and switched to various other medications.
1202,I started college last year and decided that I would be fine without medication.
1203,"So, I use them as my medication."
1204,His is worse then mine (at least at this stage of my life) since without his meds he can't be in  a crowd of people without losing it.
1205,"I should go and talk to someone about medication, but at the same time I'm a stubborn ass."
1206,It s amazing how fast the panic settled when we told him he could get medicine to help him.
1207,Is it realistic to get sedatives for every medical procedure?
1208,"I was told I should go on anxiety medication temporarily to learn how to regulate my anxiety since it would be unlikely I'd be able to do it myself in my current situation, but psychiatrists in this area are always booked, and I have no idea when I'll be able to get an appointment."
1209,"One of the major hurdles convincing them to go that they are worried that if they seek therapy, the therapist might force them on medication."
1210,"Asides the medication side effects, they are afraid that might it affect their employment record."
1211,"She manipulated me into leaving my gp &amp; urologist (I have an incurable chronic illness) and told me her method was the only way and my original doctors were ignorant - then got me to lie about my condition so she could prescribe me medications not relevant to my illness and got angry when I asked questions or said it wasn't working, saying that it was my fault."
1212,"I could get a medical note to explain that I need this absence from work, but that causes issues too."
1213,"I've started to see a therapist recently and she's come to the conclusion that I most likely have GAD, and is going to refer me to a psychiatrist to possibly get me prescribed some medication while we start therapy."
1214,I tried getting off the meds a few weeks ago and had such bad panic/anxiety that I started taking them again.
1215,Do I try and talk to a dr about being on meds that are safe while pregnant?
1216,"It took me so long to find one that works, and to be honest, I don't want to take meds while pregnant."
1217,"I've tried many meds to control it over the years, along with counseling, but I continue to spiral downward."
1218,What medication worked best for you that had minimal side effects?
1219,"I'm not looking for suggestions of therapy or medication, though that has been a real consideration recently, because I know most of the medication has horrible side effects I'd like to stay away from."
1220,"I truly couldn't get any schoolwork done then, because without the medication my anxiety was too unbearable to even make it to the doors of my classroom."
1221,"My sophomore year of college, I got so drunk (wouldn't take meds when I knew I would be drinking) that I fell off a balcony, broke my neck, which now has two rods in the back of it and a metal plate in the front."
1222,"Any medicine, teas, powders?"
1223,"I work at a full time internship for a medical technologies company and I would like to work here in the future, but obviously they won't hire anyone without a degree."
1224,"This helps usually, but lately it has been hard for me to follow through with the techniques, so my psychologist suggested I get a prescription for a mild medication that'll relax me a bit so I can do my breathing techniques, etc."
1225,I recently spoke to my therapist about this and asked for some help to deal with this and she suggested the possibility of medication to help me cope.
1226,My only problem is that i'm really hoping to avoid the use of any sort of medication if possible to help overcome this.
1227,"My questions are:

1.Depersonalization-wise, does anyone know any good strategies to help cope with depersonalization without the use of medication?"
1228,What type of medication are most normally used to help with depersonalization?
1229,and what type of things do the medications normally do to help fight the feeling of depersonalization?
1230,"To anyone who's currently using medication to help fight depersonalization, do you think it's effective?"
1231,Normally I force a panic attack just to stop the feelings (off meds) but today..
1232,"i've been coping well(ish) with my anxiety, i see a therapist and take medication but it just feels unbearable right now."
1233,I'm in therapy and have been taking medication but it's not helping.
1234,I want to be able to control my anxiety without meds.
1235,I really want medication because nothing else has helped and I have tried everything!
1236,My doctor won't give me medication for this.
1237,I might have to transfer schools because I may lose my scholarship and I feel like any possibility of me getting into medical school is kind of fucked.
1238,"Fiddled with meds at first until they got the right combo, 10mg Lexapro daily, added 150 mg daily of Wellbutrin to help combat sexual side effects."
1239,"Over the last 4 or 5 months, however, I feel like the meds have been having *more* of an effect."
1240,"After doing some reading, talking with my wife, my therapist, etc, I think I'm ready to taper off the meds."
1241,"In the past, when I've gotten out of the habit of taking my meds for a couple weeks, I've had a few symptoms of withdrawl (brain zaps, teeth grinding, etc)."
1242,"So please, if you'd be willing, share your experience coming off meds?"
1243,"I went to visit my doctor again and he recommended that I stay on the medication (also on the same dosage - 10mg) and that it will get better, but it already has been 2 weeks and I'm not sure if I'm willing to commit."
1244,Or should I ask to switch meds?
1245,I don't like taking meds if i don't have to so i'm curious if this happens to anyone else; if so how have you dealt with it ?
1246,Here I am one week after stopping taking my meds feeling like crap.
1247,Is it possible that the meds are still in my system and I'm going through withdrawal?
1248,I have no idea if the way I'm feeling is because the meds or if it's unrelated.
1249,The reason I'm posting here is because it feels like how I used to feel when I would either miss a dose of my meds or because I quickly tapered for medical testing.
1250,Has anyone dealt with something similar coming off of meds?
1251,"I feel like a shell of the former person I used
To be and it's depressing me and getting worse :(

EDIT: I should mention that last month I had really bad sleeping problems/anxiety and took various meds to help me."
1252,"Some background information: I have general anxiety and ADHD, which I both take medicine for."
1253,I have doubts and questions surrounding a medication that changes the chemistry in your brain.
1254,"I mean, I know how meds are supposed to work, but then sometimes it is discovered how they actually work."
1255,I know that the medication may help.
1256,"I am trying to look at it and ask “what would be worse, taking medication and facing your anxiety and going against an idea you’ve held as a principle for a long time, or not being able to continue and live your life because of your anxiety?”."
1257,More and more the answer to that question has been that meds may help so I should at least TRY.
1258,Blah blah it sounds melodramatic but going to 3 different professionals and being told 3 different medications will help me does not inspire confidence.
1259,"I don't know if I should see a primary care physician (which I don't currently have) to try and get medication, or start therapy with a psychologist or psychiatrist."
1260,"I have depression and anxiety

I was feeling so anxious I wanted to throw up

Took anxiety meds and felt like shit for about 30 min

Now it kicked in and now I just feel really sad instead of anxious

Fuck

Fuck

Fuck

What is wrong with me

I hate mental illness

Makes me so sad"
1261,"I have never been on any medication for anxiety

I've also been to a ""therapist"" type person who taught me some techniques on how to deal with the anxiety (E.g breathing and relaxation techniques) and they helped cure it for a short period of time but now they are only just about getting me by."
1262,"I can't seem to get rid of it
I've tried herbal remedies, chamomile tea, acupressure etc but I still feel sick everyday
I'm also currently on SSRI medication (citalopram) and receiving counselling sessions from university (on my third one currently)
Also, I've always had trouble socialising and now I think I've realised that I don't have a personality really."
1263,I have always had anxiety about the medications I am prescribed for being sick etc.
1264,After stupidly going on Google and researching the medicine I found that there was a report that says it can cause sudden cardiovascular death.
1265,I haven't taken the medicine yet but I already have anxiety over it and I feel as though I will have an anxiety attack if I take it.
1266,I looked into it and CBT years ago because I had no money to afford therapy and I wanted to fix this problem without taking medication.
1267,"Tried some meds, didn't work, and I got worse and worse."
1268,"Finally got on the right medicine, life is going so much better."
1269,"So, I'm off those meds and I begin having panic episodes."
1270,They had been wanting to put me on depression meds but I had been fighting it.
1271,I started on a new medication.
1272,"**TODAY:** About 1.5 or 2 years later now, the medication is working great, no side effects, and the majority of my symptoms have gone away now."
1273,I work in the creative field and I think one of those go-to arguments was that meds may affect your creativity and such.
1274,"Truthfully, for me, it didn't affect me but positively once I found the medication that worked for me."
1275,"I basically went to my school counsellor, who told me there's 'take as needed' medication for anxiety (which I wanted, my anxiety was never that bad), I went to my doctor, he told me it's too addictive and gave me Effexor XR which I took gladly because like I said, my anxiety was topical; I'd feel anxious before presenting, or before meeting someone new."
1276,"It was never an issue I suffered everyday with, and because my anxiety wasn't that bad, I was brave to start this new medication."
1277,i do not want to take medicine.
1278,I have memory problems and I'm on anxiety and clinical depression medicine aswell.
1279,"But I just wanted to make a post saying that for the last 4 or 5 days I've felt pretty much like the old me, the pre-medication, pre-seizure me."
1280,TLDR: Starting to feel like me again after struggling with my diagnosis and medication.
1281,I have considered all other things that involve someone with a phD prescribing me meds that I can't pronounce and talking to a councellor but first I would like to gain some perspective on my situation.
1282,"After suffering from severe social anxiety for my whole life and taking meds for 9 years, I decided to start seeing a psychologist 2 months ago."
1283,Is there any way the medicine could hurt my anxiety even more?
1284,You know the person who cares so much about their job they will literally put their HRT medication at work?
1285,Anyway me and my doctor decided to try a medication swap as I just wasn't functioning.
1286,Talking to a psychologist or taking medication and all are not really options for me.
1287,"(no meds because doctors suck so hard) I'm not afraid of flying, I'm just worried that with this increased anxiety things that didn't bother me are suddenly going to make me have an anxiety attack."
1288,This is the first time I have taken a medication for it longer than a month.
1289,"I don't feel like the medication was helping (especially considering the amount of anxiety I still feel about getting refills despite being medicated), but the withdrawal is unbearable."
1290,"So I'm on a few meds, saphris (anti physcotic) tegretol  (mood stabilizer) and Zoloft I have been on this mixture for over a year now and it seems to be working but I have no sex drive at all I was wondering if anyone else experiences this or I'm just totally crazy and on my own (commence anxiety about posting this nowwww)"
1291,"I was recently diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks and was given a prescription for an as-needed medication, 'ativan' to use during panic attacks."
1292,"I was wondering though, if anyone else has experience with a similar medication who might be willing to share strategies they have for only using the medicine when they need it so they can avoid getting addicted."
1293,And nobody is willing to rearrange my meds because I'm only 24 and it would set me up for a life of disaster.
1294,"Hey Reddit, I'm crazy-terrified of getting cancer before the age of 40 (long story but health problem + surgery = medical anxiety!)."
1295,Side note: I'm not allowed any anti anxiety medication because I'm on blood thinners related to the traumatic event.
1296,"My Councillor tells me I need to consider ""Mild"" anxiety medication."
1297,"I was offended because my initial response was 'that's a bandaid not a solution' then she told me 'well you better consider it because I don't see a reason for us to talk anymore so it's your only option'

TLDR; My Councillor said I'm not doing CBT, go on Anxiety meds."
1298,"My question is, has anyone else been skeptical about ""Mild"" anxiety meds, given it a try and it actually made a difference??"
1299,"It started when i was 16, I took a medication that I happened to later find out I was allergic to."
1300,Lexipro...Buspar (both anxiety medications) stomach medication (due to the anxiety I was producing too much stomach acid) I was in HELL...
1301,Fast forward to 3 therepists and 4 medications later I met someone who saved my life.
1302,I am now 23 years old and on no medications for anxiety.
1303,"Upon taking the medication, I experienced a high."
1304,I almost fainted when I was writing my exam (reason for taking expired allergy medication).
1305,"I got used to been an aspie and kind of thought of it as a privilege, but know matter how many psychologists i saw and medication i took i still could not get to school."
1306,"While I know you're not medical professionals, could I just get some insight?"
1307,"Also, I've never been to the doctor for this and I'm not on any medications."
1308,I don't have medical insurance.
1309,I hate medical procedures.
1310,"I'm very phobic of blood, wounds, needles, medical things in general."
1311,"I've just started taking this medication and had high hopes for it, but this dizziness is very unpleasant."
1312,"I guess what I'm hoping for is some glimmer of light, a reason to believe that I could get rid of this somehow, preferably without meds."
1313,"I only work part time, usually 3-4 shifts a week, but my work is very physical and near the end of the night when I'm feeling tired and weak is when they happen; I'm wondering if there is some unrelated medical condition I have that I'm not aware of."
1314,"I know this probably looks very stupid to be posting this here before seeking medical advice, but doctors and hospitals make my anxiety flare up to the point of crying when I think about going."
1315,I just downed some sleep meds.
1316,I have tried some medications which just heightened by depression and anxiety.
1317,"I have also always got faint in biology lessons when discussing things like the anatomy of the heart, because I quickly become afraid of getting heart disease or whatever and having to go through any sort of medical procedure that's any more invasive than taking drugs."
1318,"If I were to guess at a diagnosis, it sounds very similar to [blood-injection-injury type phobia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-injection-injury_type_phobia), except there is no one specific thing that triggers my fear and subsequent faintness - it transfers itself to absolutely anything medical that could cause pain or discomfort."
1319,So I repeated the same thing medication.
1320,I wanted to see if anyone has similar experiences and has found a way to cope - either through medication or some other method.
1321,**tl;dr I get nervous when performing in social settings and want to find possible medications or methods to get over it.
1322,I was taking several anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications for years.
1323,Anxiety medicine is the only thing that makes me sleep but turns me in an angry zombie for 24hrs.
1324,Problem is this medication is making me extremely tired.
1325,Or maybe see if they changed medication (like Celexa) and had a lesser side effect.
1326,I've been thinking about it/ talking about it lately with my therapist and she has told me all of the signs of early set schizophrenia but I'm still scared.. still afraid of having it on my medical record.
1327,Having to tell people that I have anxiety and panic attacks is one thing... telling them that I have to take schizophrenia medication is another.
1328,I know it would be well controlled with the medication but with all the medication I do take it makes it harmful to have children..
1329,I've never been for medication.
1330,"I was diagnosed with clinical depression in high school, which, combined with several family related issues, caused me to fail out and generally be in a daze until a couple of years ago when my meds started working and I was able to get (mostly) back on track."
1331,"Now, in my second year of college, I'm off my depression meds and having anxiety issues remembering what happened to me in high school, and it's gotten so bad that I can barely attend classes."
1332,"Should I just keep it to myself, even if I going back on medication?"
1333,"(Quick info: F, 21, stressed about school and being around others + their expectations, no medication now but previously on Wellbutrin and Ritalin)"
1334,"I do not want to take any medicine for this though, because I hear that those can be addictive and do not work long term."
1335,"But anyway, I'm on meds this time so hopefully it won't end up like that again."
1336,It's like the anxiety is getting too strong for the meds to handle.
1337,"I haven't taken anything including Tylenol since January because I have bad acid reflux from all the stress

I guess my questions are: how do you guys get over anxiety to taking medications and also have any of you taking the one day dose and what side effects did you have?"
1338,Pro tip: don't read medicine side-effect pamphlets
1339,"This goes for any other type of product (toothpaste, pop, lotion, medicine, etc.)"
1340,"I am scared of medication as I don't quite believe pharmaceutical companies have the best interest for us, but our money."
1341,"I started medication 3 weeks ago and I'm working on it slowly with my therapist, but money's getting tight."
1342,My sister woke me up early this morning looking for meds because she had vomiting and diarrhea.
1343,"I totally feel apart 
at work the other day and my boss suggested I take the summer off to reevaluate my medication and whatnot."
1344,I am on 2 medications but it is not getting better and i'm starting to wonder if it has to do with my mental state.
1345,I went back on my anxiety medication (nortriptyline 50 mg at night) and was in counseling for a while.
1346,"I saw my doctor today who told me that she would tell the people at the mental health services place to get me in pronto, and she prescribed me a medicine to take before driving."
1347,I would like a medicine to take before driving to calm my nerves but not something that could possibly lower my blood pressure to dangerous levels (I have anxiety about having heart problems.)
1348,all i have in terms of medication is a 25mg dose of hydroxizine  (which i usually only use part of).
1349,"I also read over the counter cough meds can cause simmilar affects, oddly enough dylsem causes the same thing to happen when I take it."
1350,"I used to want to study medicine, but I can't anymore because I am too terrified of being around sick people."
1351,I keep saying that I don't need this medication and that I should just go to a spiritual retreat or something but I do think that I have been downplaying the extent of my issues to myself.
1352,Last November I decided to stop taking my meds.
1353,"I didn't want to be on medicine forever, I thought I could handle it through proper exercise and meditation."
1354,I was trying so hard not to be on meds.
1355,I really do have an imbalance that can't be handled without meds.
1356,Tldr: tried not taking meds and failed miserably...
1357,I already took my dosage of antidepressant/antianxiety meds but I think I'm having a minor mental break/panic attack all of the sudden and I can't stop shaking.
1358,I've been on 3 different types of medication in my life and nothing has worked.
1359,"Now that the doctors have given anti-anxiety medication, she has been able to start eating more but she is still struggling with anxiety attacks."
1360,"I'm constantly thinking about me not being me, like depersonalisation/derealisation, that I will go insane, and If I will leave this untreated with meds , my brian chemistry will change forever and I wouldn't be able to feel again me."
1361,"For example: I have now finished my exams with marks over 90% , I'm in the last year of medicine school."
1362,I don't want psychotherapy or meds.
1363,Please share your experiences as well on getting off your meds.
1364,I don't want to take medicine.
1365,"Can you start reacting to the medicine differently later on, or if it works for you will it tend to keep on working?"
1366,"If this is going to be a long lasting side effect, I'd almost rather deal with learning to control my anxiety without medication."
1367,"Tried several meds, currently on Prozac."
1368,No meds have seemed to help.
1369,"I've never taken medication for anxiety before, but I'd certainly consider it as this pain is already starting to drive me crazy."
1370,So unless I find a job real soon I’ll be in a world of pain once I run out of Cipralex and the withdrawal from my medication kicks in.
1371,I decided to write it here because the other mental health professionals that I've spoken with where I live only seem to focus on increasing the dosage of my medication when finding some sort of regular income would actually be more helpful.
1372,"Around 2007 I got these really scary panic-attacks that resulted in me getting SSRI medication, which worked for me."
1373,"I tried to get myself of them too early though so I ended up getting back on another medication(Mirtazapin, since I had trouble sleeping due to anxiety)."
1374,"Because honestly, before my OCD episode this year, I had never considered myself to need meds and looked down on people who were on them."
