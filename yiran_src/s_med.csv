0,I have a feeling that this will only get worse from now on since she's also looking up all sorts of alternative medicine bullshit for OCD now...
1,I'm not sure where to start.
2,I've been lurking here for a while and I guess I finally felt the need to post.
3,I'll start by saying I'm 34 with 2 beautiful daughters.
4,They've helped me more than anytning.
5,I've had several failed marriages.
6,They ended either from them cheating or abuse.
7,I always tried the best I could and it was never good enough.
8,I'm not very social.
9,My anxiety creates facades that no one likes me or judging me.
10,The relationship I'm in now has created a few anxiety problems for me once again.
11,With everything I've been through I keep worrying about us too.
12,Whether he's happy and if he'll stay.
13,If he wants to marry me even down to if he likes my kids or cooking.
14,I don't know how to explain it.
15,I just know I'm tired of living with the burden of constant worry.
16,I've tried medications but they only made me feel like a zombie and going to sit down with a therapist only increases my anxiety.
17,The thought sucks.
18,I don't know what to do but the constant checking on my boyfriend with worry hell be like the rest or looking for problems when there isn't any is driving me crazy.
19,I'm against taking medication after what I had to deal with in the past but I realized this is my only option to get better.
20,I see my doctor next week and I don't know what to tell him about these meds.
21,"A bit of a strange question, I suppose, but here goes:

I've been really trying to focus on getting off of any anti-anxiety medication and overcoming/dealing with this in a more natural way and I really think I've had a lot of success."
22,I'm currently getting off lexapro and I've had this happen to me before I was on this medication.
23,I honestly think the only thing left that would help me is some sort of medication.
24,How can I make it clear to whoever can actually give me them that I want to try medication?
25,"I've always what I'd consider moderate anxiety, I don't need medication, but I'm starting to consider it."
26,I scheduled a GP appointment last week and he diagnosed me with anxiety and panic disorder and referred me to a psych for further evaluation and medication and a therapist.
27,I can't afford a consular right now or medication.
28,This last time she asked I explained that I was getting my anxiety medicine adjusted a few days before she needed me to watch them and maybe it would be easier for me.
29,I've been working with my doctor over the past few months to treat my anxiety.
30,"I first went it wanting to treat my anxiety which has plagued me for a while but only recently got worse, and he prescribed me some meds."
31,Since then each med I've tried has given me some side effect and when I go to talk to him he gives me another to try.
32,After about the fifth med he said lets just throw that all out and go for psychotherapy.
33,"Problem being, the area I'm in is extremely underserved for psychiatrists and therapists and I have to go with a hospital group that has pay on a sliding scale for uninsured/poor people, and the only one anywhere close is apparently booked for two months."
34,"I've put thought into it, and I still want to attempt to treat it my anxiety with medication, if the option is still viable."
35,"My question is: should I wait until a psychiatrist becomes available, two months from now and go talk to them?"
36,Or should I go back to the doctor and tell him I want to keep trying medication?
37,"Or, perhaps, should I try and find a different doctor in the area and get a second opinion?"
38,"The medications I've tried are

Fluoxetine: Horrible nausea: lasted all day and interrupted work."
39,Though were I not working I might've been able to put up with it for a while.
40,"Buspirone: Caused me increased heart rate and anxiety, headache and light headedness, though only once I moved up to 15 mg after starting out on a lower dose and gradually moving up."
41,"Trazodone: Started at half a pill, moved up to full pill after a week."
42,Caused me panic attacks right before bed.
43,Paroxetine: I don't actually remember why I stopped this one.
44,"Might've also been nausea, but I can't recall."
45,Cymbalta: Awful nausea and extreme drowsiness.
46,Basically slept for two and a half days after one pill.
47,I'm currently taking clonazepam whenever I have a panic attack and just going about my daily life.
48,But I'd really like to feel like I'm at least taking steps towards improving my life.
49,"**Actual experiences with meds will be quoted, background story will be in regular text."
50,"Mentally, this medication made me feel like a zombie."
51,BUT I currently do not take any medication at all for either.
52,"I wish it was something they could treat with medicine and be done with, fuck you anxiety."
53,"I do not have depression or anxiety, I have never taken any medication other than antibiotics though I may have some of the symptoms of ADHD."
54,Though recently I heard that some people on anti-depressant medication experience a similar symptom.
55,Is anxiety manageable without meds?
56,"I guess after all this rambling.. my question is, can it really get better without meds?"
57,I'm trying to get pregnant and the last thing  I want to do is try to rely on a medication (though there are times like tonight where I just want to throw my hands up and say OK fine I will just take it).. who knows what it actually does to your brain.
58,"I've gotten myself on some meds for this, and I'm trying."
59,"Also, how do you approach your doctor for a specific medicine?"
60,"Hey guys,

I just got prescribed new meds Lexapro and lorazepam."
61,But then he goes onto say that it doesn't really get to the heart of why I want to go into medicine and then questions why I want to be a doctor.
62,Instead she said that every symptom I've ever discussed with her was because of marijuana and that she would no longer give me any medication.
63,I took time off from school and work after the relationship ended and my parents were a big help to me as I got my thyroid meds in order and started losing weight.
64,"I cant catch a break i think im finally broken i don't know what to do i can't take meds because i hate having to rely on things like this to get by, this is how i quit cigarettes just cold turkey."
65,I'm sure I'll have to try a few things out and see how I'll feel but I could use advice on how you guys time everything with your meds so you're not feeling like a dopy mess at the wrong time.
66,She was then put on some pretty strong medication.
67,On top of that due to my sporadic incomes over the past 12 years she does not ever see us being able to have children and on top of that she feels a big part of her breakdown &amp; subsequently being on medication is because of me and the trauma she's experienced watching &amp; having to constantly support me having such horrible panic attacks.
68,I stopped taking my medication before leaving because i had decided i wanted to join the military (incredibly stupid for someone in my position.)
69,Now my anxiety and depression are getting to the point where i'm having anxiety attacks a couple of times a week and don't have any medication to help me.
70,"I'm back on my meds now, but a lower dose."
71,The ER doctor gave me muscle relaxants and some pain meds and referred me to a neurologist because they suspect I have some nerve damage.
72,Ive had around 3 attacks in the last 24 hours that leave me crippled and I am on no medication.
73,I've been having issues for about 5 years have been taking medication for 3.
74,"I'm not sure what I hope to achieve by seeing one; I have no problem with taking medicine, but I feel like I have nothing to lose."
75,"The thoughts are fears of me doing something unintentionally... like I'm afraid I'll sleepwalk and overdose on my medication, or sleepwalk and injure someone with a weapon, or do something completely out of my control."
76,So I open these questions up to those that are currently on both meds (Wellbutrin and Prozac) or have been.
77,I don't want to have to try a different medication but this is not gonna fly.
78,I also didn't take any anti anxiety medication before I went to the hospital.
79,My doctor doesnt seem to be concerned at all and has just upped my meds in an effort to help.
80,"Hi, I stumbled upon this group searching for some answers about GAD and itching."
81,I have been having disruptive bouts with itchy skin for about 8 months.
82,"There have been times when I've felt about [ ] this close to a breakdown over it, and have often ended up crying and in a panic attack."
83,"I've gone through all the possible causes I can think of:

- I thought it was dry skin for awhile, but no creams/soaps/lotions/etc."
84,help even a little bit.
85,"- I thought it was environmental, some allergen at my home, so my husband and I gutted our apt."
86,"had the carpets cleaned, washed everything with sensitive laundry soap, and still no luck."
87,Also made no sense that my husband has no symptoms like mine.
88,"- I finally went to my dr. and she thought it could be something I was eating... however this seemed very unlikely to me, as I have an extremely varied diet and I thought for sure I would have noticed if there was a link there."
89,"But, I did try to eliminate things I'd been eating more of, like coffee, and still no change."
90,"So, long story short, I mentioned it to my sister, who replied, ""OH I had that too!"
91,"It stopped after I finished school and quit my stressful job."""
92,!!
93,"I have had a pretty intense year... over a year ago, my other sister left home and cut off our family, so that has been stressful."
94,"I've felt very discontent at work for over two years, and finally decided to go back to school online to get my degree and get out—which hasn't really helped with the situation presently, but has added extra stress/time constraints."
95,"I also recently saw my doctor about depression, probably induced by all these factors, and she subscribed 5-HTP which I have been taking for nearly three weeks now."
96,"So with that new suggestion, I've begun to see strong links between my stress and anxiety level and the itching."
97,"Since taking 5-HTP I've still had some itching attacks, but they are much more manageable."
98,"When I can get out of my situation, take a walk, drive, watch TV, BREATHE, I start to feel better almost immediately."
99,"When I'm in the middle of an attack, I notice my breathing becomes short and I cannot concentrate."
100,"The one time I had significant relief with no attacks for a week was when I was sick on the tail end of taking time off from work—so I was out for almost two weeks straight, and NO itching during that time."
101,"MY QUESTION IS THIS: I find relief from taking Benadryl, because it calms me down, but makes me VERY drowsy."
102,And I do not want to take it for a long period of time.
103,"I am taking the 5-HTP and meeting with a therapist to try to help, but this week after my first meeting I have had even more attacks of itching (even reading this group to find some answer had me scratching all over)."
104,TLDR: So what do you (those who have these same symptoms) do to manage it in the meantime?
105,Topical medications?
106,Oral meds?
107,Something else?
108,Is it OK to be taking Benadryl consistently for this?
109,I just need some relief so I can work on getting to where I can manage this anxiety.
110,OK I am going to go ahead and apologize for the long wall of text you are going to get.
111,So I start off the day yesterday at about 5:30 am.
112,"I get up and eat two bowls of cap'n crunch (I know, razor blades!!!)"
113,and everything seems ok.  At 7 am I take 30 mg of Vyvanse that my doc prescribed last week on Monday for anxiety and 500 mg of nabumetone for some pain I am having in my back and legs.
114,"Again, everything seems ok.  Day isn't bad."
115,Wife gets up and gets ready for work.
116,Everything is ok between my wife and I.
117,No problems there (that I know of) and she goes off to work.
118,At about 8:30 or 9:00 am I go for a walk (about 1.5 miles) and talk to my mother (mostly just listening to her go on and on about nothing).
119,I get back from the walk feeling sweaty and take a quick shower.
120,So far I am feeling my usual anxious self and some depression but nothing really bad.
121,I am functional.
122,"I am ok.  

At 10 am I take my ""morning medicine,"" which consists of 1 mg Xanax extended release, 40 mg of prilosec (for my terrible stomach acid), 800 mg of Gabapentin (again, for anxiety), and 25 mg of Seroquel (anxiety)."
123,My day goes on.
124,Nothing bad happens to me.
125,No one yells at me.
126,Nothing goes wrong.
127,"I am doing research on the internet, playing my 3DS, playing around with Blender 3D."
128,At about 11:30 am I eat a bag of Reese's cups.
129,I didn't intend to eat as many as I did.
130,Probably 5 and a half servings of them.
131,I usually eat candy but not that much.
132,I am trying to cut back on sugary things because of my weight (about 210 lbs).
133,I think this was my obvious first mistake.
134,I don't eat anything for lunch.
135,Just the candy.
136,At 12:30 pm I start to feel tired.
137,This is when I do something new.
138,"I drank an orange flavored ""5 hour energy."""
139,I usually feel tired early afternoon and my doc didn't have any advice for me so I went this route.
140,My wife thought it was a good entry point for someone who doesn't regularly consume caffeine.
141,I feel ok.
142,I don't go to sleep or anything.
143,I don't feel super jacked up.
144,I just feel a little tired but nothing too bad.
145,My anxiety still isn't over the top or anything.
146,The day goes on.
147,I spend time with my 3DS and talking to a friend on the internet.
148,At about 3 pm I start experiencing pain in my pectoral area.
149,"Not sure if it is muscular or what, but whenever I moved just a little bit I would feel pain on both sides."
150,I also notice that I am feeling a little more jittery than usual.
151,Anxiety is starting to build up.
152,I try really hard to focus on my game.
153,"I think maybe it is just the caffeine (again, not that much."
154,Less than a cup of coffee) and go on.
155,At 4 pm I take my day time medicines (seroquel 25 mg and gabapentin 800 mg again) and keep playing my game.
156,The pain is getting worse.
157,the anxiety is getting worse.
158,Everything is getting worse.
159,I am having trouble focusing.
160,Having trouble concentrating.
161,Not feeling well.
162,My wife gets home at about 5 or 5:30 pm and is super happy that she got me some xmas presents from Target for a super good deal.
163,Wife is in a great mood.
164,She seems happy.
165,She is being super nice to me.
166,"For some reason, though, every word she says upsets me."
167,I feel like even the smallest move she makes is going to make me start yelling.
168,I am super irritated and aggravated.
169,The pain is getting worse now and it is starting to move to the center of my chest.
170,I tell my wife I am not feeling well.
171,I try to just let it go and think about something else.
172,My wife has me put a pizza in the oven for her.
173,I didn't put one in the oven for myself because I wasn't feeling well and I didn't know what was going on.
174,I keep stressing to my wife that I don't feel well.
175,I tell her that maybe I want to go to the emergency room after I think about it for a minute.
176,"She goes, ""that bad?!"
177,""", and then doesn't really talk too much about it."
178,"She does ask, ""what do you think they can do?"
179,""", which is something that has been going on in my head for a while now."
180,The pain is pretty intense now.
181,The anxiety is way high.
182,Every small sound and movement in the house seems like it is specifically engineered to infuriate me.
183,I sit down on the couch and watch Hotel Impossible with my wife.
184,The pain is bad.
185,Strong burning sensation in my chest.
186,I feel like maybe I am dying.
187,This doesn't feel like heart burn.
188,I know it can't be a heart attack.
189,I start to think that maybe I am having a panic attack.
190,My wife looks over and sees me in pain and checks on me.
191,I tell her I want to go to the emergency room.
192,We end up going.
193,The ER is only about a mile from my house.
194,We get in there and it is a long wait.
195,I tell them I am having chest pain and I feel like I am dying.
196,They take my vitals and hook me up to an EKG and check on my heart.
197,Everything is normal except for my blood pressure.
198,"It was a bit high, but the nurse said it was normal for someone in an agitated state like I was."
199,Then I wait.
200,I am starting to feel some discomfort in my stomach now on top of the pain in my chest.
201,I ask my wife to find me something to eat.
202,"She disappears for a while and then comes back with a small bag of chips, a pack of crackers, and a bag of cheez-its."
203,I eat the bag of chips and some of the crackers.
204,"After eating, I was starting to feel a little better."
205,The burning in my chest was starting to go away.
206,I wait in the emergency room for hours.
207,No doctor visit.
208,I play my 3DS for a while.
209,I realize that I could probably just go home now and call my doctor tomorrow.
210,"After waiting 3 hours to see the doctor, I end up leaving the ER and just going home and going to bed."
211,This wasn't heartburn.
212,I have had heartburn before.
213,That is not what this was.
214,I don't think being hungry had a causal link to all the shit I was experiencing.
215,I have been hungry before.
216,This hasn't happened before.
217,Did the panic attack pass as I was eating and calming down?
218,Was I suffering from low blood sugar?
219,High blood sugar?
220,Was it the 5 hour energy?
221,Was it the Vyvanse?
222,Why would I have chest pain 5 hours after drinking a 5 hour energy.
223,Why would I have chest pain and all these problems after I was getting near the end of the half life on my Vyvanse.
224,Why did I start to feel better?
225,What the hell happened?
226,I am a 30 year old man diagnosed with a bunch of psych stuff.
227,I live in the US (if you couldn't tell by my measurements in the post).
228,My doctor told me in my last visit (monday last week) that I was going to start ECT soon.
229,The Vyvanse was an attempt by the doctor to at least hold me over until the ECT got started.
230,I hadn't taken a psycho stimulant before.
231,I am not taking any recreational or illegal drugs.
232,I am taking my medications exactly as prescribed by my doctor.
233,I do not smoke.
234,I do not drink alcohol.
235,What happened?
236,Thank you for reading my insanely long post.
237,I apologize for the typos that you will read.
238,I hate proofreading.
239,EDIT 1: Formatting to make post easier to read.
240,"Also, I have contacted my doctor's office and am waiting to hear back."
241,I spoke with his medical assistant who said I had a panic attack and to stop taking the Vyvanse.
242,"I was on Klonopin for a while, it seemed to really help me with my anxiety."
243,"(It was a yellow pill, this might not be important, but I've also had white kolopins and they didn't do anything is there a difference or am I crazy?)"
244,"I felt very relaxed while on my anxiety pill, BUT I felt like I wasn't myself."
245,I was also on an antidepressant at that time.
246,Now I am off both things and only taking birth control.
247,"But here is my problem, I don't leave my bed."
248,"I mean it, I don't leave my bed unless I am getting food from the kitchen or going to the bathroom."
249,I just feel like I am too scared and crippled to do anything now and I'm not sure if I should give anxiety medicine another try.
250,"Please don't tell me to talk to my doctor about this, all he does is suggest different medicines for me and doesn't listen to me at all."
251,I did not receive medication until I was 22 because of my parents.
252,"I have had bad anxiety/depression since I was a child and have been on and off tons of different medicines, when I was around 19-20 I started having panic attack often and it cost me a job or two."
253,I got it under control by going on different medicines.
254,"About a year ago I weened myself off prozac because I was feeling depressed anyways and the side effects were too much, including feeling numb,emotionless and zero sex drive."
255,Since then I have been fine albeit some depression bouts.
256,Here's the weird thing that I need advice on- I've been having some medical issues lately with my stomach.
257,On the 20th last month I ended up feeling faint at work and having maybe a panic attack or maybe a dizzy spell I don't know what it was.
258,I was sent to the ER and decided to take a medical leave to figure our my medical issues once and for all because my stomach problems were keeping me from preforming at work and school.
259,"So since the 20th I have been staying at my moms and having an endless amount of panic attacks, when I was previously not having any at all!"
260,"Out of no where I am anxious all day, I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown."
261,I feel like I am dying and every weird little symptom is convincing me I have a brain tumor or stomach cancer or that I'm bleeding internally etc.
262,I have no slept at all.
263,I've been waking up with nocturnal panic attacks and generally haven't left the house.
264,I feel like my life has been totally taken away from me and I am at the mercy of these panic attacks.
265,I was scheduled to have a endoscopy is figure out whats wrong with my stomach on friday but I had a panic attack and they took me to urgent care instead of preforming the operation.
266,"(I have emetophobia so anyone sticking anything down my throat and into my stomach, while i'm conscious is my worst fear) But I have to have it to know whats wrong with my body and to get healthy."
267,"So I have some questions for you guys..

Have you ever had a insanely strong resurgence of panic attacks and GAD out of seemingly nowhere?"
268,Where you able to move on and return to normal life in a timely matter?
269,How I stop myself from having panic attacks about medical symptoms?
270,How can I make myself have this endoscopy without having a panic attack?
271,(they do not allow anti anxiety meds before the sedation.)
272,any help with amazingly appreciated.Thank you
273,"The counselor helped a little bit, and I'm not entirely sure if the medication helped at all because I still felt anxious."
274,The first thing the VA wanted to do was give me medication.
275,"I didn't want to take medication as the onset of the problem was quite rapid for the most part, so I was determined to get through it without medication."
276,She was an alternative-medicine type therapist and helped me talk some things out and give me some coping strategies.
277,im excited to see how the meds are gonna kick ass over my anxiety!
278,I'm a little iffy about medication after a really bad experience with Paxil last year.
279,I haven't taken medication in a while so I can't remember if it was the same while on it.
280,I also feel that it makes me weak as if I cant survive without this medication.
281,"My depression and anxiety are fairly well controlled, I am on meds that help me significantly."
282,"Up until this point I was strongly averse to medication, and had put all of my energy into trying various mindfulness or cognitive techniques (quite a lot of meditation, have been reading about ACT, but have never made a strong attempt at CBT)."
283,"I think 3 things kept me from giving up on the meds at that time:

* Hearing some stories, either here or on other forums, about people having really high stress/anxiety when they first get on the meds."
284,"* Not being sure if this was caused by the meds themselves, or if I'd starting taking them just the nick of time, and that first weekend was just the tip of a particularly depressing &amp; shitty iceberg."
285,"Two questions I have for you fine folks:

* Has anyone experienced insomnia, but had it subside over time without the addition of some other medication?"
286,"I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow if possible, to try and start some medication to help cope with my anxiety."
287,"I'm planning on going to a psychiatrist sometime soon, and I was wondering if they make you use a certain medication, or do you they let you choose?"
288,I'm at the point in my life where I feel like I need to start taking medication.
289,In fact I was on BP meds for YEARS.
290,"Now, like every medicine i get i don't want to take it."
291,I'm scripted Ativan 1mg as needed (along with a cocktail of other medication for my many disorders) and last month I needed to take it (on average) about once every 2 days.
292,"Ok so for a couple of years maybe I feel like I have become very anxious, maybe I have always had it and being busy with studies and sports just kept it at bay, but ever since Ive had less time to do things like sports because I work a lot, I feel very insecure, anxious and depressed."
293,"My insecurities have almost led to me destroying my relationship with my incredibly loving boyfriend, but thankfully his support and love has made us more stable than anything."
294,"Looking back I have had three instances, where I have out of nowhere just fainted."
295,"The first time was on holidays, I was standing by a bus stop several years ago with my father and suddenly everything just went black and I fainted."
296,after a few minutes of resting everything went back to normal.
297,"I cant recall the onset as it was so long ago but it was quite unexpected, my father just assumed it might be from the heat (38 degrees celsius) and being dehydrated."
298,"Then comes another few instances, all in a social setting, most of the time alcohol was involved or even marijuana but both in moderation."
299,"Around friends I wouldnt call myself insecure in the slightest, so the one time I do believe it might have been too much marijuana and my body just temporarily failing."
300,"Again, after 10 minutes I was fine."
301,"(I do not use it anymore, as my anxiety keeps me away from smoking it nowadays, which is ironic because in places of legalization many people take it as remedy for anxiety.)"
302,"Then another time after a couple beers and having a marijuana joint, the same thing happened, all went black and I fainted for a good 3 minutes."
303,My friends immediately put me in a cab home thinking I had drunk too much.
304,"However, the reason I believe it is not CAUSED by , but merely made worse by alcohol &amp; marijuana is because one time it was without any intake of substances;
I was simply having a shower and freaked out because i thought i had noticed an abnormality on my body (which turned out to be nothing), My heart started racing, I freaked out and once again everything started to go black."
305,I quickly sat down in the shower and after a couple minutes of breathing slowly I was all fine.
306,"Now having looked a bit into Anxiety disorders, it does sound a great lot like I suffer from it."
307,"I have always been very good at school, never had issues making friends and am not horrible looking either, but somehow I am extremely insecure and have no self esteem...I believe the neglect of hobbies plays a large role since doing things you enjoy and are good at and where endorphins are involved would certainly prevent such anxiety."
308,"But as of right now, being aware I should increase hobbies such as sports, I would really like to know if I need to be worried."
309,Sometimes when I overworry about something my heart starts racing and racing and I actively have to calm myself down.
310,"A friend of mine who has similar issues has a psychiatrist for a mother and has been taking anti depressants and said they have greatly improved her quality of life, i am just interested what you all think, how do i go about this, it really does impact my life as my self esteem is just..awful and despite having supporting family and partner who tell me how good I am at things and how pretty I am those things just dont have any effect on me."
311,"I noticed I am over observant in social settings, as to how people act, and i think the fact that i am extremely empathetic is a key factor as well."
312,If someone is feeling uncomfortable I immediately pick it up without even intending to.
313,"I always feel the need to make them feel better, its as though my brain just picks up all the uneasiness of others, makes them feel better and in return i end up stuck with all these shit feelings...

i dont know what to do and am honestly considering therapy or some medications that will just calm me down."
314,Sorry about the lack of formatting and structure but I have never really talked to anyone about this so am a bit disheveled.
315,Would appreciate ANY kind of advice and thoughts.
316,"Much love,
M"
317,"Things were really looking up for a while, since the medication was prescribed."
318,"But does anyone maybe have any tips for dealing with things like I've described, short of therapy or more/different medication?"
319,Anyways I cannot think of any solutions aside from breaking up with her which is the last thing I want to do and want to ask for any ideas on how to cope with this (no meds please).
320,"Other general info if needed: Age: 16 (Junior in High School), No meds or any drug use."
321,Do I even want medication since it seems like you have to kind of shuffle through them to see which ones work and which ones don't...?
322,I recently had to take some melatonin to improve my sleep quality as well as other medication to calm myself down.
323,"I have never taken prescription medication before until July 2014 I started on 1mg lorazepam (Ativan) once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and then .5mg at night."
324,So I've been on these meds for about four months now.
325,"I am not on meds currently, because I had to go get a blood test before my MD will give me meds."
326,"I notice blood on my T-shirts (Actually, I should note, I have been prescribed minocycline and a topical cream for my acne, so yes, I have been given medication)."
327,"I am on my sixth day of anxiety medication (celexa) and I am seeing my family doctor once every week, in addition to my psychologist once every week."
328,I'm on meds that are supposed to help with the obsessive thinking.
329,I've had anxiety as long as I can remember.
330,"I'm not sure of a diagnosis, because at any given time I can meet the diagnostic criteria for at least two (possibly three) disorders--so I'm not sure how I'm classed."
331,"My armchair opinion (and that of a couple therapists) is that I've basically had pretty severe GAD my whole life, and when you combine that with stuff that's happened through my life, I've picked up the symptomology of other disorders."
332,I've been on multiple medications.
333,"With the exception of benzos, nothing has worked."
334,"When I'm in therapy, I'm always at such a crisis point that the therapy has to focus on the immediate need, and not on long-term."
335,I'm constantly so strung up that I cannot focus on learning coping skills.
336,"Every session is ""talk her off the edge of a proverbial cliff""."
337,"Trying stuff at home is a battle between motivation, and then becoming so anxious I cannot concentrate on the activity (like yoga)."
338,Distraction is my main coping method.
339,The absolute *biggest* trigger for my anxiety is the unknown.
340,"It can be in any area--social, my pets, work, etc."
341,The biggest trigger lately has been finances.
342,"I spent some time unemployed, and money was a huge issue."
343,"So now I have a hard time spending money, make decisions are large purchases impulsively (because the anxiety is so great I just want to get it over with ASAP), and constantly worry about having enough for the future..among other things."
344,I'm in the process of (probably) trading my car.
345,"The car is at the point where repairs, and the potential for more repairs probably outweighs the value..and is frankly causing my a ton of stress through worrying."
346,"So the dealer ordered the car I think I want (gotta drive it first), and if all goes well, I'll be talking trade-in."
347,"This is a decision I have again snap made because of anxiety, but everyone (except reddit) agrees this is the right decision."
348,"So here I am sitting on the internet looking up every bump and clunk and whine that the car makes, self-diagnosing every single awful thing that could be wrong with the car."
349,"I'm convincing myself that the dealer will come back and say ""Yeah, we told you we'd give you $X for the trade-in, but we really are going to give you $0."""
350,(Dealer provided a trade-in value without seeing it).
351,And I know this isn't rational.
352,I'm getting rid of the car because I'm not going to spend the money to fix it.
353,The car is at the point where shit starts to go majorly and expensively wrong.
354,And I'm certainly not going to basically overhaul the car to get a couple thousand extra dollars in trade-in.
355,"But as soon as I convince myself of all of this, I see/hear a new thing and start the whole process over."
356,But this is only a symptom of a bigger problem.
357,"If I'm not worrying about the car, it's my cat (he's got a chronic illness), my financial solvency, the fact that I think I spend too much on groceries (but hate cooking), my health/teeth, my job (no reason to worry, they love me), my (non-existent) love life...it goes on and on and on."
358,I'm tired.
359,"I suppose my medication is for laziness too, and the cuts on my arms are just coincidental."
360,What anti-anxiety meds have worked for you that don't cause vertigo or nausea?
361,"My Psychologist suggested medication, which has been a fear of mine for some time."
362,I am just exhausted emotionally and wanted to hear some POV of fellow anxious redditors who may have good / bad experiences with medication therapy.
363,"I've had insomnia issues before, a lot actually, so I'm not sure if this is just my brain not turning off again or an actual side effect of the meds that will maybe eventually clear up."
364,I'm really starting to feel scared about what my meds are doing to me in the long-term.
365,"I really wish I could quit taking meds altogether, since I'm also afraid of what Zoloft is doing to me now."
366,Last year I entered college out of state.
367,I have had longstanding problems dealing with depressive episodes and moderate social anxiety.
368,"When I got there, the anxiety and depression intensified greatly."
369,"On the surface, I was successful; I joined a fraternity, made friends, and aced 20 units of classes."
370,But in reality I felt like I didn't have the support network to maintain meaningful relationships.
371,"I also had a roommate I didn't particularly care for, and as someone who was already very introverted and anxious, it was very difficult to ever feel calm considering that there were ALWAYS people around, even in the library."
372,I had difficulty fostering my passions like playing guitar and writing because I felt that I could never do them without the privacy of my own space.
373,A lot of times I would just lie in bed with headphones on and listen to music and pretend that nothing was there.
374,"I went to counseling for several months, which helped, but only depressed me further when I was cut off by the university and referred to an outside source."
375,"I visited a psychiatrist, who gave me general health tips and told me to get over the counter lithium."
376,I didn't try it out of health concerns and reading about the risk of kidney problems online.
377,I decided to transfer back to go to a state university.
378,I'm already so much happier now that I'm back home for the summer.
379,"I still sometimes feel very depressed, but it's mostly subsided compared to what I went through last year."
380,I can just spend my days indoors drawing or playing guitar or reading.
381,It's great.
382,I hang out frequently with a few of my closest friends whenever it strikes me.
383,"The problem is that while the depression went away, the anxiety didn't."
384,It's hard for me to ask anyone outside of my 3 closest friends to hang out.
385,Even replying to emails or sorting out my affairs for enrollment at my new university gives me intense anxiety spells.
386,There are days when I can't leave the house because of the fear of having to ask someone if they want to get lunch.
387,These aren't strangers either; these are some of my best friends for years.
388,"The problem is either A) big group gatherings, even if they are all friends, or B) individual meetups with people who I am only okay friends with."
389,Either one of those scenarios results in me making a million excuses and then staying home.
390,"It's not even that I say no, it's that sometimes I just get so anxious I can't even reply to a text message inviting me to hang out."
391,I haven't seen some of my best friends all summer out of this anxiety.
392,"Today, I was invited to one of my friends' birthday gatherings."
393,I'm trying so hard to get the courage to show up.
394,"But I can already anticipate some of them asking me where I've been all summer, or what happened that made me transfer universities and I have no idea what I'll say."
395,"I'm still trying to decide if I should go, so if you have any advice on that end, let me know."
396,"I've always had this anxiety, but back in high school it was only mild to moderate."
397,"Ever since last year, it's been severe and never slowed down."
398,"I'm wondering if I should seek medications from a psychiatrist again, at least so I can get it under control in these types of situations and learn how to function again."
399,I have no idea how these medications work or if it's worth starting up during a transition period like the new few weeks when I start classes.
400,"I'm honestly a little afraid of going back to classes in a couple of weeks; my anxiety might prevent me from getting help from others in my classes, or making friends at my new school."
401,Any thoughts of advice?
402,"tl;dr -- Got over depression, but social anxiety has intensified to the point where I can't leave the house, which I'm worried is going to make me more depressed."
403,Advice?
404,Edit: One thing I'd like to add that I was just thinking about.
405,I gave up drinking and smoking pot.
406,"It wasn't doing me any favors for either my anxiety or depression, and I was getting sick of feeling shitty because of it."
407,"My friends, however, didn't, and have very much ramped up their alcohol and weed consumption over the past year."
408,Now every moderately sized social gathering seems to have drinking or smoking at the center of it.
409,"I don't have any problem with people drinking or smoking in a relaxed environment, but it's a little alienating for me to always be sober at these gatherings."
410,I guess that's the nature of college though.
411,"I have to take medication for it, so i guess that puts a little more feedback on how ""severe"" it is, but i don't really think it's that bad."
412,"Hello all, 

I have posted a couple times in this sub and elsewhere about my issues with anxiety, etc."
413,I started seeing a psychologist/therapist in March for couples therapy with my partner for reasons I've posted about previously and also meet with her individually to work on things I'd like to work on about myself.
414,"Namely, my irritability, anxiety, and moodiness."
415,I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything.
416,"It's ""only"" been 5.5 months since I started talk therapy and trying CBT."
417,"I am very aware of what a lot of my issues are, and am aware of why I have these issues, which is more than I started with."
418,"In that regard, talk therapy has helped."
419,"On the other hand, I have not had much success actually altering my behaviors that are symptoms of my issues."
420,"I still have unexplained anxiety, and try to diagnose why I am feeling anxious, but most of the time I cannot."
421,"For example, a couple weeks ago, I was driving to a department store to purchase a new set of cooking pans."
422,"I was calm, happy, etc."
423,"Out of nowhere, I just felt overwhelmingly anxious."
424,I asked myself why.
425,Was it because of traffic?
426,"No, it wasn't."
427,Was it because I was worried I was going to overspend?
428,"No, I had the means to make my purchase."
429,"I was unable to figure out where the anxiety came from, and all I could do was simply wait it out."
430,"My irritability is a smidgen better, but not much."
431,"Small, petty things still make me angry/tense/irritable, and my temper flares up."
432,"A lot of times, I can't catch myself before my temper flares up to figure out why I'm so tense or irritable and to consciously talk myself down from it before I react externally (usually getting terse or angry with my partner)."
433,I am also still having problems with my mood in general.
434,It varies greatly from day to day.
435,Sometimes I am happy.
436,The next day I could be sad or tense for literally no reason.
437,I'm tired of the variance and unpredictability.
438,"At this point, I feel like I know myself well enough that I realize what my issues are and why I have them, but I also know that they are so deeply ingrained in myself that I don't think talking about them by itself is going to help."
439,"I would really like to ask my therapist about medication, but I'm scared."
440,I'm scared that she will say she doesn't recommend it.
441,"I don't want to be the way that I am anymore, and I don't think I can change myself without the help of medication."
442,"I don't want to stop therapy, but I don't think it's enough."
443,I'm also scared of the potential side effects.
444,"I already struggle with weight, and I don't want to gain weight."
445,"I don't want to lose my sex drive, etc."
446,I don't want to become numb.
447,"My boyfriend is on SSRIs for his depression, and he has the common side effects, and has tried different medications, but eventually just settled on one that made his mood feel the best, regardless of the side effects."
448,Does anyone who's gone through anything like this have any advice or words of encouragement?
449,I've been on the medication since January and fortunately haven't had any anxiety attacks for several months now.
450,"The doctors, mental health professionals, and a psychiatrist that I've spoken to have all recommended that I increase the dosage of my medication as they believe that changing my medication is the only solution to me getting better."
451,And I also have anxieties about psychoactive substances like my medication having control over my mind and making me unable to exercise free will over my thoughts and emotions and instead making me into someone that is unhappy but still functional in society.
452,So I'm just curious as to other people's experiences regarding dosage change on this medication.
453,"Reddit, how do you deal with the weight gain from your medication?"
454,"And then one day i realized I'd been so much happier &amp; less stressed lately, &amp; that I hadn't taken or needed any of my meds in months."
455,I've been off any &amp; all anxiety meds &amp; antidepressants for going on 4 years now.
456,I'm just putting this here for anyone who's having trouble treating their anxiety or doesn't want to have to take meds long-term...
457,So I work full time and my job pays very little and doesn't offer health insurance.
458,I was lucky enough to get state aid for the past year for my prescription medications and the discount helped a lot because otherwise I would be paying a ridiculous amount.
459,"However, I've now been told that I make too much money and will therefore no longer be able to receive the discount on my medications starting April 1."
460,(I didn't have a job at all last year at this time so that's how I qualified.)
461,The thought of not being able to get my meds is making me really anxious and last time this happened I ended up in the hospital.
462,"I can't go through that again-- the emotional toll on me and my family, the money, missing many days of work, etc."
463,Has anyone been in a similar situation?
464,Can anyone help?
465,TL;DR My discount for my meds is ending soon but I need the meds to function.
466,I have no insurance.
467,What can I do?
468,"Meditation and talk therapy are also part of my regiment, but this is one medicine change I've been very happy with."
469,Then I had a massive panic attack so I took 1mg Lorazepam (my first time taking any anxiety meds).
470,Dr put me on Cymbalta today for my anxiety issues.
471,Not sure what to expect?
472,I've been on 3 different SSRI medications in the past and HATED the way they've made me feel.
473,"He said this wouldn't be like those times, as it is a SNRI."
474,Basically just need opinions or experiences.
475,What can I expect?
476,I don't want to be a zombie again.
477,"Recently, I had gone 4 months without one severe enough to require my medication, I was really proud of that."
478,"The meds didn't help that time, I just walked into walls a lot and felt wobbly woozy."
479,The only meds she is on now is Buspirone 30mg and Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day.
480,Are these meds making her nauseas or is it her “nerves”?
481,"I'm considering going to see a psychologist about anxiety meds, but it seems so weird to me that dating is the only thing I can think of that brings this out in me."
482,Considering meds.
483,Today is my first time ever taking any type of medication for my anxiety/depression.
484,I know it takes a few weeks for meds to take effect so I don't know if it's because of the Prozac that I feel like this.
485,Is this normal or am I having a bad reaction to the meds?
486,"Hey y'all

I am on a medication right now for my severe anxiety and noticed something now when having sex with my GF:

I can't cum!"
487,"EDIT:  I don't know the name of my meds I have to look at them, I'm also on an anti-psychotic for my psychosis."
488,"During my last semester abroad in graduate school, I was living independently, long-distance with my girlfriend, taking 9 courses in school, and was given news before arriving abroad that my kidney condition, although stable, was acting up a bit, but not enough for him to say I definitely needed medication."
489,I've been struggling with anxiety ever since my brother committed suicide 3 years ago.
490,"It's become increasingly worse, and this month is destroying me."
491,"One year ago this month one of my best friends killed himself, and I was the last person he talked to."
492,He had been trying to date me but I wasn't interested due to my being in a relationship.
493,I'm struggling so badly with it that I don't want to leave the house.
494,"I'm getting migraines from stress, I'm trying to use my medications sparingly but I find myself crying and having a hard time pulling myself together more and more."
495,"I've reverted to having to go sit in the car when a store is too loud, I'm spending more and more time in my pajamas and using it as a reason to not leave the house because I have ""standards."""
496,"I've been hanging out with my boyfriend for an hour at a time, max."
497,I feel bad because I know it's impacting him.
498,I don't know what to do.
499,I don't even want to be at work.
500,"I had to pull over on my way to work today and force myself to keep driving because I can't lose my job, I'm already in a massive financial crisis from medical bills."
501,"hi guys, I hope I'm writing this in the correct subreddit."
502,I'm new here.
503,"but I'm hoping I can get some advice:

I suffer from social anxiety and have tried multiple medications for this but they all failed (I am currently prescribed 100mg lamictal &amp; 30mg adderall which I have been on for years) but I never tried benzos until yesterday when I was prescribed .5mg of clonazepam from my psychiatrist."
504,I took my first .5mg dose yesterday to see how I would react to it (as opposed to first taking it when I am forced to socialize).
505,I woke up feeling very calm...
506,I'm usually very anxious upon starting my day.
507,and throughout the day I also noticed I felt very mellow.
508,in a good way.
509,I took my second dose today except I broke it in half.
510,so I took .125mg at around 5:30pm &amp; the second .125mg at around 7:00pm.
511,I still feel mellow but I keep wondering whether or not this will work this weekend (forcing myself to leave my cave and socialize ha ha).
512,I want to be able to just be okay in a social setting.
513,"even if I don't interact with anyone.... haha if that even makes any sense...

so can anyone tell me your thoughts?"
514,or experiences?
515,I would really appreciate it.
516,I'm new to this medication and would do anything to get rid of this social anxiety so I could use all the advice I can get.
517,thanks guys
518,"I'm also on medication for anxiety, and I'm seeing a therapist."
519,"She's never seen a professional about it, had any medicine, or anything like that."
520,"I've been on antidepressants for quite a while now, but recently because I made a mistake before travelling, I've run out of antidepressants and can't get any more for another week or so until I'm back home."
521,"I was watching a youtube video about these glasses that can help some colourblind people see colour properly, and this guy got so overwhelmed and was just fascinated by the fact he could differentiate red and green."
522,"I just started welling up and happy crying for no reason, other than this guy was so happy."
523,"I haven't happy cried in a long long time, I think since before I even realised something was wrong in my head."
524,"I think this has helped me realise that the medication I'm on, while dulling the anxiety and depression, also dulls the good feelings sometimes as well."
525,"I think I'm going to mention this to my doctor and see what she says about it, because if there are other medications I could try that dull the anxiety but don't necessarily dull the happiness as much then I'd like to try them."
526,"**NOTE: I in no way condone or encourage people to take themselves off antidepressants without first speaking to their GP about it, and getting their opinion of it, and doing it in a safe and controlled, usually gradual, way."
527,"This discovery is the result of an accident, and I intend to get back on medication as soon as I can, because I know I'm still not at a place mentally where I can handle the anxiety without meds."
528,**
529,"Last night my girlfriend and I had sex while my parents weren't home, and due to my medication I took forever to climax so we eventually stopped."
530,"I have not taken any medication other than Acetaminophen, which has no side effects."
531,I have recently gone off my meds for anxiety because my Dr told me it was possible that my brain chemistry could change.
532,I have been off of them for over a month now and I have now realized the thoughts and irritability I exhibit off of my meds are bad/different.
533,I want to stay off the meds but I need to control my issues.
534,"Are there any meds that help with nausea, bloating and loss of appetite because Im losing lots of weight ever since my life has begun to get more social."
535,"Even though I'm so much better than I was when this all started, I still have trouble going out alone sometimes."
536,"Specifically, going to the movies is really hard."
537,"I think this is mainly because in the last year and a half, the only major panic attacks I've had have been after/during movies."
538,"Sometimes this is brought on by the usual reasons (outside stress/exhaustion/not eating properly), but sometimes there are specific triggers and I've actually had to leave the theater."
539,"Or worse, leaving the theater makes me even more anxious because I become self conscious of having to leave on top of having to go back outside."
540,"Does anyone else have this problem, and how do you deal with it?"
541,"I don't have, and I can't afford, any medications or professional help at the moment."
542,My best friend is studying to get his Phd in homeopathic medicine and has been using me as his case study.
543,I was hesitant because I am a nurse so I'm trained in western medicine and don't have much knowledge of herbal remedies.
544,"I've always been anti-meds (because taking medication makes me anxious; I'm always afraid I'll be allergic to it, or that I won't be able to handle the side effects), but right now all I want is for someone to hand me a pill that will let me sleep and feel ""normal"" for a while, whatever normal is."
545,"I mentioned this to my Doc, but I don't know if he considered it when he started me on meds."
546,"I really don't know what posting about this on here is going to do, but I'm trying anyway."
547,I've had Generalized Anxiety for as long as I can remember.
548,"I'm 21 (M) now, but as a child, all the way through school, and presently, my anxiety is and has been so bad that I've found it nearly impossible to function as a normal person."
549,"The worst part about it is that my anxiety and stress does not and has not ever gone away, even for a split second."
550,I'm completely and totally exhausted because I honestly do not know what it feels like to be relaxed.
551,"I want, more than anything in the entire world, to simply be able to be comfortable."
552,"Even when I'm alone in my bed, I'm just stressed out of my mind."
553,I don't have panic attacks or have my anxiety triggered by anything because it's already there in the first place.
554,It never goes away.
555,I can't even seem to understand what it is that I'm stressed or anxious about.
556,"I'm not particularly worried about anything, I don't have an irrational fear of people or going outside or anything like that, I'm simply tremendously uncomfortable at all times."
557,I've gone to various doctors and gone through numerous medications to no avail.
558,"I've also gone to a therapist, and that had no outcome other than strengthening my preconception that talking to a random person that happens to have a degree in the same way that I've talked to dozens of others in the past wouldn't do anything for me."
559,I really don't know what to do anymore.
560,"I'm totally exhausted as a result of my discomfort, and I'm fairly certain that there's nothing that can help me other than finding a way to overcome it in my own mind which, as I'm sure most of you in this subreddit know, can be nearly impossible for someone in this situation."
561,Thank you for your time and for any information you may give.
562,I need to be armed with information about what to ask for when the topic of medication comes up.
563,"Please only answer if you are open-minded and have had experience or know someone w/ experience for adderall as a medication for anxiety and being a more productive, better person."
564,Does anybody know about this anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication?
565,So I have SEVERE anxiety.
566,To the point where I sometimes have panic attacks while driving on the freeway or I start hyperventilating in the checkout line at the grocery store.
567,I am dating this guy and do not want to take it further with him because I am scared.
568,I have also gone through periods of agoraphobia where I don't leave the house for weeks.
569,It got really bad about 6 months ago when I went to rehab.
570,I had been on klonopin for my insomnia for about 4 years but I became very addicted to it and was on far above the legal dose.
571,I was weaned off of it and over the months I became more and more paralyzed by fear.
572,I have never known anxiety of this caliber ever before in my life until now.
573,I didn't realize how much the klonopin affected how I perceived the world until it was no longer there.
574,"I've tried alternative treatments such as biofeedback and other forms of mindfulness, yoga, supplements, etc."
575,Nothing is providing lasting relief.
576,I also see a psychiatrist for psychotherapy every two weeks and he is amazing.
577,He does help some but it's not enough to get through the every day trials I deal with in regards to my anxiety.
578,I asked him if he could prescribe an SSRI or something to take the edge off just for now but he refuses because I have been to rehab.
579,"It's frustrating because I am not asking for a medication I could potentially become addicted to, I am just asking for something to improve my functioning."
580,I am miserable.
581,I cry every day and can't handle having relationships.
582,"I am scared to be alive, genuinely."
583,So I am thinking of finding another doctor.
584,"If I do, I'm just curious what medications worked for you guys, if any?"
585,Obviously I know that just because it worked for you doesn't mean it will work for me but I just need some comfort that there is something out there that might make me feel a little bit better.
586,I desperately need some hope right now.
587,"Also, any other alternative therapies you have tried that I didn't list."
588,"Please, tell me more about them."
589,I am interested.
590,tl;dr I need some hope right now that I can feel better.
591,Share your stories of what has worked for you medication or otherwise.
592,Thank you!
593,I'm on meds for this but I feel like they're wearing off.
594,"Because I don't want her to always rely on the meds and only take them when she needs them, but I have already told her that she needs to have them with at all times in case it gets too bad."
595,"In perfect world I would love to see her off meds and be able to not be bothered by all these things but I know that might not ever happen, which is okay."
596,I currently take depression medicine and am going to talk to my Doctor for anxiety medicine.
597,I'm currently off the medication I used to take but I am thinking I might need to go back on.
598,I've been out of a job for over a year and I don't know what to do.
599,I would prefer something online with little to no contact with other people.
600,There are a lot of scams so I'm very skeptical.
601,Does anyone know of any legit online jobs/sites?
602,"Also, I obviously need a job to have money to pay for treatment and medication but until I get that, are there any medications I can get without a prescription for anxiety?"
603,"(And for the negative commenters, this is a serious question and I do not abuse drugs.)"
604,----thanks.
605,Hello everyone!
606,"I am currently conducting some research (For my Postgraduate MSc HPaB Psychology degree) on Depression/Anxiety and I would be very, very grateful if members currently taking medications would take a moment to complete the survey in the link below."
607,"The broad goal of my research is to examine the different classes of anti-depressant medications in relation to side effects, specifically addressing the severity level, type and tolerability of side effects in relation to medication BNF classification (the pharmacological body which classifies antidepressants into categories depending on the primary proposed mechanism for how the medication works)."
608,"The link is: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3933B5L

Again, I am very grateful to those who are willing to contribute the 5-10minutes it will take to complete the survey, an introductory page; disclosure and debriefing are included within the first and last pages, also an exclusion criteria is presented on the first page (For example, only persons +18 years can participate)."
609,Thank you again!!!
610,P.S.
611,"Please feel free to forward on the survey link, the higher the amount of responses and the more varied the participants the more robust my research findings will be."
612,"- Again, many thanks."
613,Nick.
614,"Personally I have tried to avoid getting medication, as I don't feel risking side effects is worth it."
615,I'm struggling with something normal people would find easy even with the correct dosage of medication.
616,"Although my medication has worked great for the past months i have been on it, i can feel the anxiety building and im worried ill suffer another large attack, im terrified."
617,I'm wondering if anyone else here has had minimal help with Valium and has had help from another medication like Xanax or something alike or if I should just stick to Valium?
618,"I'm out of meds, dads in the er and mom won't answer her phone and I have no idea what's going on and I'm in charge of two little siblings rn (asleep for now)


I.just.fucking.can't."
619,"Here's my background: I'm 19 years old, male, and I recently enlisted in the military (I've wanted to do this since a young age), I've never been diagnosed with anxiety or never taken any medication, I keep it to myself, never told anyone about it."
620,I've been on medication for the past several months.
621,"After a few days of trial and error with meds, turns out that just a little increase in my Zoloft was all it took to make me feel pretty much back to normal."
622,Im at the local library and my moms car broke down and i have no meds i dont know what im going to do
623,"So, here I am, not talking to anyone but my family and one single best friend, being angry and confused since I can’t find a way to be more talkative and not shy again (even though I am on Atarax, the medicine one doctor prescribed me to use against the anxiety, it doesn’t seem to help much so far)."
624,"We've tried counselling and medication, but we gradually lost hope in finding a 'cure'."
625,I am dealing with a TON of anxiety and derealization disorder (everything feels like im in a dream) and am trying feverishly to get meds that actually work.
626,Side note: I do receive profesional help and was diagnosed with a GAD and given meds just looking for support or someone similar I guess.
627,I've had to go back on medication...
628,I am currently on meds now plus birth control since I believed it was hormonal.
629,Anyways a little over a week ago I got really sick and bedridden for 3 days in which caused my anxiety to sky rocket because I never had to call out of work once (other than earlier this year when I first started due to getting bad attacks and to get put on meds to control them better) and I never sat at home that long before in a looong time either.
630,"(in which I think being bored is another trigger and with drinking coffee making me hyper and not knowing what to do with myself)

Also I did get my meds changed from citalopram to the generic of zoloft because of the attacks last week."
631,"Sorry it was a random post, but I would love to hear some opinions though :) I am okay now although a little zoned out due to the new meds."
632,I started taking meds again two weeks ago.
633,"I recently switched to an extended release anti-anxiety medicine, so I'm really hoping to get through this day with no attacks, or at the very least, few tears."
634,I take my medicine in the mornings and after about an hour I'm more stable.
635,Could it just be morning anxiety or possiblly medication related?
636,"She says her fear is of taking medicine that might make her want to kill herself, but I think it is also the anxiety of going to a doctor that prevents her from going."
637,Afraid of medicine but not herbs.
638,I'm not sure if the return (and subsequent worsening) of my anxiety is a result of becoming tolerant to the medicine.
639,"So I've always had anxiety problems, i had my first panic attack when i was 6."
640,But God i love people i love being around people i love when i can be social.
641,I used to be in theatre in high school and i felt like i had pretty good control over my anxiety.
642,I knew it was there i knew i was going to have attacks occasionally and i just accepted it and kept on keeping on.
643,"I had good friends, i still do somehow."
644,"But i mean, since i graduated from College it's become hard to leave the house."
645,I've been through a lot.
646,A whole lot of shit.
647,to much to really get into and a lot of it no one really knows about.
648,I want to go out i want to be social i want to be able to do the things i love.
649,I want to further my career.
650,"But lately, i can't move."
651,I'm stuck so bad right now.
652,"I know i need to seek professional help, ive been on several medications before everything from once a day pills like zoloft, paxil... shit its a long list and normally those end up really fucking me up."
653,"And i end up stopping them because it gets really bad, only thing that's helped me in the past is xanax really and most doctors don't want to prescribe that regularly."
654,"I know i need professional help, and i want to try counseling but right now sadly my families in a bad place financially and i cant afford to go in at all not even to urgent care to try to get a prescription."
655,I even have insurance but i still cant afford the copay and pills or a psychiatrist.
656,I have no idea what to do anymore.
657,I feel so miserable and tied down by my anxiety and it's gotten to the point where i can hardly see a point anymore.
658,I know what i want from life but i can't seem to make myself do anything anymore.
659,It's really bad.
660,Its so shitty right now and i feel like its just going to continue to get worse.
661,"If any one has any ideas or advice please, help me."
662,I have to do something.
663,I can't keep being so afraid of everything.
664,We have begun to more seriously discuss medication as an option.
665,"The opinion of the professional was that meds could help, but doing as much natural remedies as I could before turning to them."
666,"He's on medication (Prestique), but has used alcohol as a crutch for too long."
667,I have been taking meds for about a month now and felt pretty good the last 2 days but today the scalp tingling is back.
668,And did medication help (beta-blockers in partciular)?
669,My boyfriend loves me to let me stay home and go to school again but he doesn't understand that I wouldn't be able to make it in the workplace even with the medication I take.
670,I am on meds to no effect I suppose and therapy seems insane and stressful to me.
671,I guess Im going to try to get some meds prescribed for the first time just for this interaction that lasts moments every day I work.
672,And I don't know how much longer I can go without my medication.
673,I'm generally pretty sensitive to medicine and this is no exception.
674,Anyone else have experiences with this cough medicine or any others?
675,"Before you mention it I've tried the medication route with horrendous results, Zoloft made me have extreme Akathasia, so much so I was almost committed, one of the worst experiences of my life."
676,"I feel like some of you go on about how it's the *only* option, but meds are a big no for me, and others like me."
677,How do you beat anxiety without meds?
678,I take meds.
679,It's a very sad way to live life and I am hoping the meds and meditation will help snap me out of this a bit.
680,I feel like I can't and won't set foot in an airplane unless someone drugs me so today I got some medication.
681,"I've got some questions that I hope someone might be able to answer:

- The doctor told me to try some medication at home to see what kind of side effects I can expect, so I'm thinking about trying one tomorrow."
682,I'm really worried I'll get to the airport and board the plane and realise that the medication isn't working.
683,"**Just** **some** **general** **info:**

21, Male

General anxiety, been taking medicine

Don't have anything that triggers it

**Symptom:**

I'm transferring to a new university for several different reasons and I don't know but one or two people there."
684,"This isn't the first time I've been in this situation, but regardless anxiety creeps in even with the medications I take."
685,Just the uncertainty of not knowing who I'll meet makes me nervous right now.
686,"I will be on a backpacking and camping trip this next week with people who are new to the university like me, I've found plenty of ways to get involved on campus, lots of welcome week events to go to as well."
687,"Not looking for any remedies, I think my nervousness is normal, but I can't help but get it off my chest that I'm not very relaxed right now about going to a new school alone."
688,I'm already on medication for depression (10mg per night) and on bc.
689,"If she's right, do you have any suggestions for medicine that will cause less damage?"
690,"Yesterday, I had accidentally left my meds at home."
691,"Hi Reddit,

So yesterday after having a bit of a break down, I realized I might have to back on my meds."
692,"I have anxiety/panic disorder and agoraphobia, which I have been medicated for and have overcome (which subsequently led to me stopping my medication."
693,I don't know what to do and I don't have much time to properly deal with the issues.... right now the only thing I can think of is going back on my meds and hope that I can manage it when school starts.
694,"TLDR; going back to school is making me feel depressed and bringing back my anxiety, wondering if I should go back on meds."
695,I was laid off from work a while ago and used up the last of my meds (prozac).
696,"The reason I am writing this is to tell you that your anxiety and panic disorders *can* be cured, and it doesn't require medication, or endless doctor/ER visits."
697,"I didn't want to deal with what had happened, and decided to take medication (zoloft, started at 25mg) and it seemed to take the edge off, but it never truly helped me."
698,"What about anxiety meds, is that something that can come about from starting here?"
699,"I sometimes wonder if medication would relieve this at all, but my mom is *very* much against me going on medication."
700,"Whether I'm at rest or having a panic attack, I'm almost constantly nauseous."
701,Does anyone else get this?
702,Is there any way to combat this?
703,"I don't take any medications, or drugs."
704,I also drink a lot of water and take vitamins.
705,I think it has to do with all the thoughts racing in my head.
706,It's been going on since about August.
707,"Thanks, if you bothered to read this :-)"
708,My counselor suggested it because I want to try to get over my anxiety without and serious medication.
709,"I went to my doctor a few weeks ago to discuss my meds and she mentioned looking into getting a workbook as anxiety is one of the more 'managable' mental ""problems"" (sorry, not sure how to phrase it) and that workbooks can help find triggers and overcome them etc."
710,I never really learned how to manage the anxiety without medication.
711,"Recently, my symptoms have greatly improved with therapy and meds."
712,Recently I've started the process of taking medications for my anxiety.
713,"A huge step for me, especially since I'm uninsured."
714,"But with the financial assistance program the local doctor's office offers, health care is extremely affordable and I can finally go to the doctor without fear of racking up huge debt."
715,"To the main question, how many medications must I try before I find one that doesn't cause me side effects?"
716,"I'm on either my fourth or fifth now, and it's getting a little discouraging as it feels like throwing rubber darts at a board and hoping one sticks."
717,I know I'm going to persevere and keep trying.
718,I won't lose to this.
719,But I was wondering if anyone had any similar experiences?
720,"How long did it take to find the right medication for you, and how did it improve your life?"
721,"Sorry if this question has been asked before, I'm just always leery of starting new medications (WOO, HYPOCHONDRIA!)."
722,"Long story short I've been consistantly on benzo's (Ativan, Xanax and now Klonopin) for a little over a year and have been unresponsive to SSRI's (I've tried Wellbutrin, Zoloft and Celexa)."
723,"I just met with my new psychiatrist and she spent a good deal of time explaining to me how, even though it's most often used for to treat bi-polar patients, that she has found that it's had success for those who suffer from acute anxiety and panic attacks."
724,Was wondering if anybody here could share their experiences...
725,Is there a medication (for daily use) that has been successful for you with anxiety?
726,I went to see a therapist and the intern (the person who gathered my info) said SA is usually treated with 50/50 medication and therapy.
727,"This is gonna be super long so if you don't feel like reading this I totally understand :) 

My life's been an absolute roller coaster for the past few years and my anxiety finally fucked me over really hard starting from last year."
728,I never had any sort of health issues growing up until last year when I decided to move back to my hometown after spending a year in a uni far away from home.
729,I had to somehow cope with my anxiety and weed was the only thing working for me.
730,I had no idea that it was my anxiety killing me so I never went to a doctor to get checked out hence never got any medications.
731,"After feeling very sick for a few weeks when I realized that I had basically wasted a year of my life doing nothing and failed all of my courses, I decided to move back."
732,Now that was really not the best thing to do.
733,I was a wreck.
734,"Had lost a few pounds, emotionally I was fucked up because of all the problems with family and moving back and starting from beginning."
735,"Then both of my grandfather passed away, I accidentally ran my mom over with my car because she was laying on the fucking drive way, the program that I wanted to go into got cut and a lot of other stuff lead me to get worse and worse day by day."
736,"Then my parents had to go back to my home country for the memorials and such, so I had to take care of my younger brother and do the house chores and also manage to do my own school work and whatnot."
737,"Long story short, I'm now 20, it's been around 4 months that my anxiety has really taken over my life, my parents found out that I smoke weed and that did not make anything better since my parents are VERY anti drugs."
738,My dad did not react well when he found my stash which happened twice.
739,"Both of the times he just started shouting and saying horrible things that no one ever wants to hear them for their dad such as things like "" I should have never brought you guys to this country, I have wasted my whole life because of you and now my own son is a drug addict."
740,"I have been dealing with people like you (junkies) my entire life and now I have to take care of my own son."""
741,and just other horrible stuff.
742,They are kind of acting normal now that it's been 3 months since he found out about weed but he still searches my car every time I come home and stares into my eyes for a few seconds every single time I see him so he makes sure I'm not high.
743,"I have thought about moving out but let's be honest, I'm a 20 year old guy who doesn't work, has no money, has nothing really so I can't move out, I don't want to ask my parents for money after all the things that has happened in my life for the past few weeks."
744,I'm just stuck in this house and feeling miserable.
745,They don't really know what's going on.
746,"They think the reason why I puke sometimes is because of the fucking drugs, or the reason why I can't eat anything in the morning is because of the drugs, or the reason why I'm smoking weed is because of them so I can just fucking relax for half an hour."
747,Now I just don't know how to deal with this.
748,"I started taking venlafaxine on a low dose about 3 months ago, stopped taking it twice for a few weeks because I thought that there is nothing wrong with me and I'm just taking these because I was told by my doctor but 2 weeks ago after not taking venlafaxine for 3 weeks, My symptoms got worse but it's been a few days that I haven't woken up from stomachache at 3 in the morning but that has moved to 8 which is a nice change..."
749,I'm just tired.
750,I'm devastated.
751,I keep having this fake fucking smile on my face whenever I'm with my family but deep down I'm a wreck.
752,There is just so many things going on with my life that I don't know how to deal with them all AT THE SAME FUCKING TIME.
753,I just don't know what to do and how to go on with my life.
754,I hope I can get some feedback from you folks but this felt really good writing out my life story sort of.
755,"I also hope that y'all have a great day, week and just a great life ahead of you."
756,This anxiety thing is horrible.
757,"edit: Oh by the way, I don't have any drug dependencies or anything as such.."
758,I'm just a regular stoner
759,Tried some meds but the doc gave me this really weak shit that didn't help much.
760,"After a year of doc visits and multiple medications,  I'm turning to the collective wisdom of reddit, if for no other reason than to find some common ground."
761,"Around this time last year, I started developing consistent headaches around my sinus area, gradually increasing tinnitus, and general restless, which I probably brought onto myself from worrying."
762,"A month or two in, the doc ordered an MRI of the brain and sinuses which came back showing a golf ball sized arachnoid cyst (not_a_tumor.jpg), but it appeared to have been there since the beginning of (my) time."
763,The neurosurgeon was unconcerned; said there was no pressure and it wasn't the cause of the headaches.
764,ENT said sinuses were clear and everything looked great.
765,"Between the time of having the MRI ordered, having several days in limbo between knowing there was some things to be looked at with brain doctors, and eventually getting the all clear, I seemed to have psyched myself into an issue which I can only describe as anxiety."
766,I'm not sure if this is correct.
767,"It's not generally an attack of sorts where I'm afraid I'll die, or my heart will explode, but rather a string of 4-6 days of feeling general tweaky hell."
768,Fast forward to today.
769,My life is generally low-stress.
770,I work a 9-5 in a great company.
771,"Expectations are not unusually high, and I have a great family."
772,"However, I continue to feel as if I've downed a case of red-bulls on a daily basis."
773,"I've sloppily self-diagnosed myself with some sort of anxiety disorder, and the doctors that I've seen tend to go along with this."
774,"My symptoms which have been going on for the last year, in varying levels of intensity are twitchy eyelids, lots of goop in my eyes, stiff neck, strong tinnitus, mild nausea, and most of all, a general but strong feeling of uneasiness/racing thoughts/and irritability."
775,Like I've seriously half drowned myself in rockstar/redbull/coffee/whatever.
776,"So far, my medications and effects have been:

Citalopram - Intensified the yucky mental feeling (anxiety?)"
777,"many times over, to the point where I didn't want to do anything, although doing nothing was probably the worst way to deal with it."
778,"Venlafaxine - Similar to the effects of citalopram, but with lesser intensity."
779,"Wellbutrin - Seemed to level things out, but would still make me feel worse for a few hours after taking the medication."
780,Xanax - Mostly works.
781,I'm taking this in small doses (.5mg) once every few days.
782,"Since it is habit forming and makes me drowsy, I'd rather not take it, but it does help to knock the edge off."
783,"The first 3 medications I gave up after 1-6 weeks, depending on how shitty they made me feel."
784,"I understand that most antidepressants take longer to work, but the side effects were just too much."
785,I'd like to know if anyone has a related experience and what may have helped along the way.
786,"Obviously I could (and probably will) switch doctors several times until something clicks, but getting appointments takes an amazingly long time."
787,"I feel bad for those who are worse off than me, and have to wait months for an opening."
788,tl;dr:  I feel like shit 75% of the time and don't know why.
789,"Okay first of all I hear 10,000 different horrible things about it and that there are better drugs out there."
790,Can someone tell me their experiences and perhaps some drugs they've taken they liked?
791,"Second I'm on two medications already (Zonisamide for seizures, Concerta for ADHD) and this just sounds like it will counteract or cause some problems."
792,My doctor says it's fine but it still makes me nervous.
793,Especially the concerta mixed in  part.
794,I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety six years ago and been on medication since that time.
795,"We don't know what caused it, but she was put on medication and discharged and hasn't had a seizure since."
796,I'm someone who is afraid of drug interactions and side effects so it's hard to find a medication that works.
797,"I just wonder if I'm better off seeing her more often and working through the cognitive distortions and unhealthy patterns on my own, which seems better, or taking the medication as well, even though it's not really ""me."""
798,"At this point, I've already taken my sleeping meds, and I'm still a bit dazed from an anxiety attack earlier, so while I'm stumbling groggily down the very steep steps whilst admiring the moon, I think I'm at the bottom of the steps, and stick my leg out, but I'm not at the bottom - In fact, I'm a good 3 steps away."
799,Wondering if anyone has had any luck with meds helping these kind of things OR anything that I should probably stay away from.
800,She's on meds for it but didn't get counseling.
801,"If this is all or mostly anxiety-caused as people are telling me, I both do and don't want to turn to the meds as the solution for the reasons above."
802,"I have been on two different types of medication since September, and I don't think the dosage is right for me yet but I won't stop trying."
803,"And if medication is not the right answer for me, that's okay, I'll try something else if it comes to that."
804,"My psychiatrist suggested I do this test that involves swabbing the inside of my cheek with a cotton swab and sending it to a lab where they run your genetics against the common gene that the meds are composed of (all are in a different ""class"") and it tells you that based on the make up of your body and the class of the drugs, which class of drug your body metabolizes normally."
805,I don't take any medicine whatsoever.
806,Almost one year ago (11 months) I had a--well I'm actually not sure what to call it as my doctors never really gave it a name.
807,I was only told that it was caused by a build-up of stress.
808,"One day I realized that I felt strange, but I couldn't put my finger on it."
809,"Over the next 2-3 days I developed a migraine that wouldn't go away, a fogginess in my thoughts, tremors, and a stutter so bad that I couldn't effectively communicate verbally anymore."
810,Yesterday I woke up with a migraine that still hasn't completely gone away.
811,I took something new that my doctor had prescribed (I get migraines 2-4 times a week).
812,"I felt foggy for the rest of the day and noticed slight tremors in my hands, but I didn't think much of it and dismissed it as side-effects."
813,Today I've noticed that the tremors still haven't gone away.
814,I feel like there are little vibrations through my entire body.
815,The fogginess comes and goes.
816,It makes it hard to focus on a single thought.
817,"I haven't experienced any stuttering, but I'm terrified that it's coming."
818,"Last time it took a little more than a month of constantly slowing myself down, reading out loud, and singing to work my way out of stuttering."
819,It was absolute hell.
820,"It tanked my self-esteem when I had to speak to strangers (ordering at restaurants, etc."
821,"), and I felt like I was going crazy half the time."
822,I'm not sure if I'm still just experiencing side-effects or what is happening.
823,It's not characteristic of my panic attacks.
824,"I trust my doctor, but I can't help wondering if my different medications are reacting poorly with one another."
825,"I take Bupropion for anxiety, something for blood pressure that I can't recall the name of, Tramadol for the headaches, and Gianvi (birth control)."
826,"I think I just more-or-less needed to share that and get it off my chest, but if anyone has any advice on how to calm down or stop tremors it would be greatly appreciated."
827,"I've been working for years with different medication, as I get closer to college,I just don't see how I'll be able to function in the real world or work place when I can barely make it through high school."
828,I've been on anxiety meds for a long time now.
829,Since the major reason for taking the legit meds is gone I'd like to get rid of them; the side-effects are still there and reduce my quality of life.
830,"I have been seeing a psychiatrist for a little over six months now, and she's been fantastic - as far as helping me to find the right medication to alleviate my anxiety and depression."
831,My psychiatric sessions focus solely on the efficacy of the medication.
832,I've been to my doctors today as I've had a number of bouts of intense anxiety (or what I think is anxiety!)
833,"over the last few days, spurred on by situations which would barely affect the average person."
834,They've been so bad that I've been bursting into tears and contemplating suicide.
835,"I've been on a number or medications such as citalopram, fluoxetine and pregabalin but nothing has worked."
836,"Due to how worse it has been, plus the fact I've got a situation coming up which I think is going to trigger the same effect in me, I went back to my GP who prescribed 14 2mg diazepam tablets to help me."
837,"I'm really hoping these have a positive effect on me and I'm feeling confident, however I'm concerned that doctors are very reluctant to prescribe benzos long term because of addiction, so I'm worried that I'll find something that helps me in these situations and I won't be able to get them again."
838,"I don't plan on taking them everyday, only a max of once per week when things too much."
839,"If I take them like this, rather than everyday, is the chance of addiction/reliance reduced?"
840,"I have an appointment with a psychologist next week, but I know she can't help me with medication management."
841,"I need to have my medication adjusted *right now,* but it seems like no one can help me."
842,With this new look and lifestyle I began to realize how good I was feeling without taking my daily anti-anxiety medication.
843,So now that time has passed I'm wondering if I should/could stop taking any medication all together.
844,Is there anything I can do to ease the anxiety during the appointment if I don't have access to medication?
845,"I need to learn to start controlling them because my attacks are situational, and meds aren't really necessary at this point."
846,"Over the last few months, my doctor and I have been experimenting with different anxiety medications with little success."
847,"Most recently, he's prescribed me Buspirone HCL 15mg."
848,"I'm getting tired of switching medications every 4-5 weeks, so I'm wondering first of all if anyone here has had success with this medication."
849,Is it worthwhile in the treatment of anxiety disorder?
850,"Part of me wants to try medicine just to see if it'll help, but I'd rather try out some natural remedies."
851,"I don't have any medication to deal with this, or anything?"
852,So I've been off the meds now for over 3 weeks and have been doing pretty well.
853,I cannot afford therapy or medication.
854,I'm on medication for anxiety.
855,"You would probably tell me something about ""*It'll be fine*"" or ""*You have all your life before you*"" or even ""*There is medication for this*""."
856,I don't want medication.
857,"I know it's bad to continue to ignore such an issue, but I don't want medication."
858,I haven't have positive experiences with traditional pharmaceutical anti-depressants.
859,"They make me feel numb, and drain all of my creativity..."
860,"So, a couple of years ago I started experimenting with herbal remedies like St. John's Wort and Rhodiola Rosea."
861,"I realize how dangerous it is to self-prescribe, so I want to find a specialist."
862,"Unfortunately, I do not know what kind of doctors specialize in herbal medications."
863,Neuropaths?
864,Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
865,Decided it might be best to totally abstain from all medicine and supplements to see if I just need a reboot of some kind.
866,"This was about 4 months ago and since I got out of the hospital I had been off medicine and kind of strolling along, trying to keep my head up and keep on keepin on."
867,"I developed a drinking problem after my boyfriend lied and left me for slutsherface and didn't see a way out, and I had refused medication all my life saying there was ""another way"" but needed a helping hand other than my therapist and took the pill route."
868,"I had no sex drive, before and during the meds after starting birth control in 2008."
869,I've had panic attacks my whole life and was treated with medication from 6th grade through early college.
870,Should I go back on the medication?
871,I thought it would of came back as the meds kicked in but still nothing.
872,"this might be a dumb question, but is there a definitive moment when i can truly know the meds are working ?"
873,ive never taken meds before so im not sure what to expect
874,I KNOW they suck and I KNOW how bad they feel to go through but fuck that we are all gonna get through this together without meds or doctor bullshit.
875,I'm currently on Lexapro (Cipralex in Canada) and I'm worreid about the sexual side effects of this medication.
876,I'm on my first week of taking medication and i'm already starting to notice these effects.
877,Last year I decided that I didn't want to rely on medication for this anymore and prompted instead for finding other ways.
878,I have been off Paxil for my anxiety and depression for a few days because my psychiatrist office and my insurance company screwed me out of coverage and no longer taking appointments and I ran out of meds a few days ago.
879,"EDIT: Also, I've never been to therapy, or been on any medication."
880,"The patient must go through a series of Cognitive therapy practices and medication must be supplemented to overcome these harmful thoughts."""
881,"I don't know how to talk to my doctor about pain medication, I've been taking tylenol extra strength and it only barely numbs the pain."
882,"I haven't been on any medication because I can't afford to go back to my doctor, and I really can't miss as much work as I have been."
883,Or is it okay to try this medicine?
884,Hi guys.
885,"24/F, diagnosed with depression/anxiety/OCD/schizophrenia/mess of things."
886,I'm living at home because I can't work due to my illnesses.
887,"I've talked to my mom a number of times about applying for disability/SSI and she's always said ""It's no use, you'll just get denied, too much work, etc."""
888,"but after my psychiatrist strongly recommended it yesterday and said she thinks she can make a good case for me, I'm determined to do it."
889,Here's my write up about how my disability affects my day to day life.
890,Let me know what you think.
891,"If anyone who's familiar with the disability application process has any tips for making it better, please let me know."
892,&gt; Every day I wake up and getting out of bed feels like a chore.
893,Sometimes it takes me hours to work up the energy to do it.
894,Not because I'm still tired but because I feel so emotionally drained and empty right off the bat.
895,"On top of that, I worry."
896,I worry I'll stand up and twist my ankle and fall.
897,I worry I'll leave my room to discover something terrible has happened to my family or the world.
898,I worry about everything that could go wrong that day.
899,I just feel awful from the moment I get up.
900,"&gt; 
&gt; I spend almost the whole day in my room by myself."
901,Even being around my family in other parts of the house makes me nervous most the time.
902,My room is my safe space where I can feel slightly less on edge.
903,"I have no friends to hang out with because I get too nervous meeting new people to actually establish a connection with anyone, so I am isolated."
904,"&gt; 
&gt; It's near impossible for me to find enjoyment in anything."
905,"I'll lie in bed for hours just staring at the TV because I can't be bothered to do anything else, but it doesn't entertain me."
906,I just stare blankly.
907,I don't care about it.
908,Sometimes after a lot of struggle I can will myself to play a game or something but I rarely enjoy myself doing it.
909,"It makes the time, which always feels to move so slowly, pass a little quicker but I rarely have fun."
910,I get little to no enjoyment out of the things I supposedly enjoy.
911,I have no real hobbies because I can't be bothered to do anything.
912,"&gt; 
&gt; I hear voices I shouldn't hear."
913,They usually make no sense.
914,"""Radar blue CD patrol!"
915,"Don't forget your horse!"""
916,Just nonsense that won't shut up and leave me be.
917,Oftentimes they aren't pleasant.
918,"They're often reaffirming every negative thing I think about myself, telling me I'm useless, worthless, fat, ugly, annoying."
919,No one likes me.
920,I'm a burden on my family.
921,I'd be better off dead.
922,I'll never get any better.
923,The world is ending.
924,People are watching me.
925,They can hear me.
926,I'm not alone.
927,The voices are loud and angry and they scare me and they don't stop.
928,"&gt; 
&gt; I can never stop the worry, either."
929,"No matter how much I try to focus on other things, the intrusive thoughts always find a way into my head."
930,I worry about getting hurt.
931,I could stand up and twist my ankle and fall.
932,I could trip and smash my head into the floor.
933,The next time I go somewhere we could get into a car accident.
934,I could have a brain tumor I don't know about.
935,"I worry about getting old, dying."
936,I'm terrified of death and I can't stop thinking about it.
937,I worry about the people I love dying.
938,"Sometimes I start to cry because I can't stop thinking about my parents, sister, grandma, or boyfriend dying."
939,The thoughts disturb me and I can't get them out of my head.
940,"Gruesome images of my pets being harmed pop into my head and repulse me, make me feel physically sick and horrified and there's nothing I can do about it."
941,"I fear terrible things happening to the world, like nuclear war or a comet striking that will wipe out humanity."
942,I become convinced the world is coming to an end and I can't stop worrying about it.
943,I fear something happening to my home - a fire or tornado hitting.
944,"My safe place gone, everything I own and that is important to me, gone."
945,I'd have nothing and nowhere to go and the thought terrifies me.
946,All my thoughts terrify me and I can't make them stop.
947,"&gt; 
&gt; Then I panic."
948,I have trouble breathing.
949,My chest feels tight and painful.
950,My limbs go numb.
951,I cry and shake.
952,"I feel like I'm dying, and then I panic more because of my fear of death and it all amplifies."
953,"Sometimes it lasts a few minutes and sometimes it lasts an hour but it feels like days, weeks of agony in just a few minutes."
954,Can't breathe.
955,Can't think anything except that I'm dying.
956,"Can't feel anything but my heart pounding, ready to explode."
957,"It happens at least weekly, sometimes multiple times a week, and it's agony every time."
958,"&gt; 
&gt; I avoid going out places at all costs."
959,As soon as I get around people the anxiety amplifies and I get more on edge.
960,In crowds I feel like I'm being smothered.
961,"I become terrified of embarrassing myself in front of people, saying or doing something stupid."
962,"I constantly worry people are judging me for how I look, walk, talk, act."
963,I become convinced that the people surrounding me can read my thoughts so I have to keep my mind blank.
964,I can't look at someone and think anything about them because they'll know and they'll think I'm weird or crazy.
965,"I worry something bad will happen while I'm in the store, like a shooter or hostage situation."
966,I spend the whole time worrying it's going to happen.
967,I can't talk to people in public by myself either.
968,My mother has to be standing right there when I check out at the grocery store because I can't do it alone.
969,I can't talk to strangers without panicking.
970,I need a chaperone.
971,"&gt;  
&gt; Whenever I do have to go somewhere I have to go with my mother because I can't drive."
972,I'm too anxious and panicky to drive.
973,I'm terrified of having to control a vehicle.
974,I don't want to get in an accident and get hurt or killed.
975,"I'm convinced I'll accidentally hit another vehicle, pedestrian, or animal."
976,Even the thought of accidentally hitting an animal makes me sick and so I'm petrified of driving in case it happens.
977,"&gt; 
&gt; I had a job for a few months and it was hell."
978,"It started with just a couple days a week, just six hour days, and that was too many and I had to be cut down to one day a week."
979,"Even that, just six hours a week, and I was miserable."
980,I would have panic attacks before work every day.
981,"I would be a nervous wreck in the car ride on the way in (Mom driving me of course, since I can't drive)."
982,Once I got there I'd just go emotionally numb.
983,"Everything was so overwhelming - being out of my safe space, being around people I don't know, having to talk to people and do things on my own."
984,I'd get more and more anxious throughout the day.
985,I'd shake and get cold sweats and have to cry in the bathroom.
986,I ended up losing my job and instead of being upset I was relieved.
987,I could just stay at home where it's safe again.
988,"&gt; 
&gt; Night time is difficult for me."
989,"I get more paranoid at night, and I'm afraid of the dark."
990,I can't look out windows at night because I'm convinced I will see something or someone staring back at me.
991,"Ghosts, aliens, intruders."
992,All the curtains have to remain closed at night because I can't look out.
993,As I walk through the dark house I need to turn on every light I can to reveal anyone or anything that might be lurking in the shadows.
994,"I'm afraid to look behind me because I worry something is there, watching me."
995,"&gt; 
&gt; I can't go to sleep without something on the TV to provide light and noise or it's too dark and quiet and I worry things are watching me and listening to me."
996,"Oftentimes once I close my eyes I'm terrified to open them again because I become convinced that when I do, there will be something/someone there over my bed staring at me, watching me try to sleep."
997,"I fall asleep each night terrified and worrying again, always worrying."
998,&gt; I often have nightmares of all the things I'm afraid of happening.
999,I thrash and moan in my sleep and wake up with my arms scratched up from clawing at myself.
1000,&gt; Then the next day it all happens again.
1001,I feel dead and empty inside.
1002,Can't be bothered to do anything.
1003,Nothing is enjoyable and all I do is worry.
1004,It's miserable and no way to live.
1005,"&gt; 
&gt; I've been on countless medications and few things have helped."
1006,I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 11 and they've given me so many different pills and treatments and nothing helps.
1007,I've been hospitalized multiple times and would always leave in the same state I entered in because nothing they did made any difference.
1008,"&gt; 
&gt; I'm on medications now and they barely help."
1009,They quiet the voices a bit and take the edge off to a degree but I'm still constantly plagued with the intrusive thoughts and fears.
1010,I'm still hard pressed to enjoy anything.
1011,I still barely know what fun is.
1012,I still loathe myself.
1013,There's still always that underlying level of anxiousness and depression.
1014,"&gt; 
&gt; I worry I'll never get better."
1015,"&gt; 
&gt;"
1016,My family and I determined it was caused by this medicine I had been taking for my acne.
1017,I have been off the medicine for 3 days but yesterday the anxious feeling came back.
1018,Will it take a little time for the medicine to get out of my system before I feel normal all the time again?
1019,I'm so scared to tweak my meds.
1020,This mostly went away after I started my meds until about a month ago.
1021,Perhaps talk to my psychiatrist and switch meds?
1022,"Hi all, I just wanted to share a small victory I had today."
1023,I've been off my meds for a really long time- almost two years.
1024,"During those two years, I was out of school and didn't really need the medications to help me through it."
1025,"Well, I decided to go back to school this summer, and realized that I would need meds as well."
1026,I had a ton of anxiety about seeing my doctor again.
1027,"I was on antidepressants, but had abruptly stopped taking them."
1028,"I was worried that my doctor would judge me for quitting them, and wouldn't want to give me any more meds because I would stop taking them."
1029,"So I let a long time pass, being too afraid to call and I let myself drown in all the ""what ifs""

I finally made an appointment and saw my doctor today."
1030,She wasn't at all angry that I went off my antidepressants.
1031,"She helped me get the medications that I do need, the ones I feel actually work for me."
1032,"Anyway, I just wanted to share my victory, I know it doesn't seem like a big deal or anything, but I was seriously stressed about this for a very long time."
1033,Maybe it will inspire anyone else in a similar situation.
1034,"Also, I hope this format looks ok; I'm on mobile."
1035,And I'm sorry if this looks like it was written like a little kid.
1036,I am bad at writing.
1037,I started a new medication and my appetite has completely gone away.
1038,I know this can be a side effect of the medication and I'm hoping it will even out in a few days but... should I be worried?
1039,I'm on meds (effexor) and have seen two separate psychologists.
1040,I have nausea meds incase I do feel nauseous but I'm tired of constantly feeling sick and worried.
1041,I haven't had attacks like this since 2.5 years ago before I started taking medication and the only way I had of dealing with it then was cutting myself.
1042,Is it even possible to do without meds?
1043,"I have been on meds for just over 6 months now and have been through cbt therapy, I would say i have a clearer direction in my life and a lot less depressed then before, but my anxiety is still a major problem."
1044,"Due to a mix up at the clinic pharmacy, my medication wasn't filled and now i'm out."
1045,I need that medication for my blood sugar and my anxiety meds are almost up too but now I'm afraid to go back to the clinic.
1046,"Hi /r/anxiety,

So I had my first visit with my new doctor as the last one I didn't like because he seemed to not really give a shit about what I said was wrong."
1047,"Usual questions at first, what medications do you take etc."
1048,"Told him I take Adderall XR for my ADHD as-needed for work/school and I was given a few Xanax as-needed from the ER after a particularly bad panic attack I had recently (been starting to get them recently, same age my sister started)."
1049,"The second I said Xanax and panic attacks he instantly did the same thing the past two doctors have done when they are mentioned ""Okay first thing you need to do is stop taking Xanax immediately, its a bad drug."""
1050,"First thing I thought was ""Oh boy.. this again.."" he then asked exactly what I was feeling during what I called a panic attack and said ""Okay look, you need to get out of this mindset you have that when your heart races a little or you get a little bit scared that its a panic attack."
1051,"You need to stop calling those panic attacks.""."
1052,"After which I started to feel shitty and anxious because I felt like I was being accused of bullshitting on what's wrong with me, to which he said ""You are a very nervous and anxious man.""."
1053,"Yes, because I'm sure most people when being told what they are feeling is made-up or playing down how awful they feel from it wouldn't get a bit defensive or nervous."
1054,"Hearing that honestly caught me off-guard, I've had doctors (or my psychiatrist even) be wary of prescribing Xanax, but not essentially just flat out call my fucking panic attacks bullshit."
1055,"I KNOW the difference between a little bit of anxiety and a panic attack, not to mention I have had a Psychiatrist, Therapist and the doctor during the ER visit confirm these recent occurrences were panic attacks."
1056,"Borderline passing out/passing out, extreme panic and feeling like I'm going to die for 45min-4 hours is not some ""heart races a little or a little bit scared.""."
1057,"The second I even mentioned I see a Psychiatrist he got this slight rolled-eye look on his face and began asking for his phone#, office &amp; name."
1058,I'm so sick of this shit.
1059,"I wish I could have my Psychiatrist be a doctor for everything because nearly every doctor I've ever come across always talks down to me after I tell them whats going on and plays down any anxiety, ADHD or depression issues I have (depression thankfully the past)."
1060,"I'm sick and tired of the two times I've gone to ER for panic attacks and given Xanax that the pharmacist talks down to me like I'm only getting the pills for the purpose of abuse, when it's just so I don't pass out from a bad panic attack."
1061,"I feel like these are supposed to be some of the people that help me GET BETTER, not just make me worse and feel like I'm crazy, an outcast or over-exaggerating my issues."
1062,I have been to the pharmacy many times to pick up medication and I never end up taking it because I am scared.
1063,"I have read all the negative stuff, which is why I haven't started taking this medication for a while."
1064,"Please help
Im not currently on any medication"
1065,"I was able to deal with it when I was on anxiety meds, but I'm not on them anymore."
1066,I have GAD and it was pretty out of control until mid-July when I went on meds.
1067,Are there things the regularly happen because of the use of the medicine that I should be worried about?
1068,"I have taken god knows how many prescription meds (Paxil and Wellbutrin, currently) and struggled through 10 years of therapy, including DBT, but I'm not doing so hot right now."
1069,I cant remember putting the medication in or actually sitting there doing it.
1070,He is really old and just started a new medicine so I don't know if it was making him feel loopy or what.
1071,"The only time I go outside is to take the dog out (and chain smoke while we're out there) 

I feel like I'm unravelling everything I accomplished this year, and I know I should see my doctor, and talk about meds, but I'm too afraid/ashamed to even call."
1072,I'm close to being off as my doctor and I thought it worth an attempt to get off medicine and see how that goes.
1073,I was originally on medicine for anxiety.
1074,I attribute this to the phasing down of the SSRI medicine.
1075,I think I need to go back onto medicine and I want to switch to something different.
1076,"I have no idea what options are available to me, I've tried for a couple years to get a grasp on this mentally, but that hasn't worked so in terms of help I'm looking to medication."
1077,"And I'm not sure if this is a situation that deems worthy for anxiety meds, but I'd prefer not to have to take some medication that will numb me and not make me feel anything, although I'm open to anything that will help with any of these symptoms."
1078,"and im no good with keeping up with meds long term, so SSRIs are out."
1079,I'm currently unmedicated but I'm seeking medication in July (the earliest they could get me in).
1080,This is my first post on reddit.
1081,"I don't really expect any responses or anything, I just want give a little backstory and a little hope for people."
1082,There is definitely a light at the end of the tunnel...
1083,"I am a married 30 year old female dealing with a Panic Disorder, Anxiety and Depression."
1084,"I have been suffering with these issues since I was a child, but I never took care of it."
1085,"Everyone (myself included) described me as high strung, a worry wart, and so on."
1086,I have a knack for talking myself out of the fact that something is wrong.
1087,I would have a panic attack and then deny I even had it a day later.
1088,I understand now that it was fear.
1089,Fear of the reality of the situation.
1090,Fear of the gravity of it all.
1091,Fear of taking the next step.
1092,"The constant looping doubt in my head, ""What does this mean for me?"
1093,How will I deal with this?
1094,"Oh god, making the appointment for a doctor...I don't even know where to begin."
1095,How do I get them to believe me?
1096,WILL they believe me?
1097,I'm sure I'm fine.
1098,Other people deal with far worse than me.
1099,I'm overreacting.
1100,I don't have the money for this anyway.
1101,Plus I feel fine today.
1102,It's not that bad.
1103,"I'm fine."""
1104,And that's pretty much how I would talk myself out of taking care of my mental health for over 20 years.
1105,But I was/am not fine.
1106,The amount of physical ailments I've dealt with over the course of my life is staggering.
1107,"Aside from just the panic attacks and depression, I had shingles at 10, multiple outbreaks of hives in high school and college, IBS since high school (and to this day), acid reflux, TMJ, psoriasis flare ups....and so on and so forth."
1108,"My body has been screaming out for help for years, but I still made excuses."
1109,I even went as far as to get a colonoscopy and endoscopy certain that there was something wrong.
1110,"But of course, everything came back fine."
1111,The only thing they said to me after giving me my results is that stress can do a number on your body.
1112,No shit.
1113,Four months ago I finally took my mental health seriously after a very intense breakdown.
1114,It was probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in my life.
1115,"I had to be really honest with myself and say, ""I can't live like this anymore."
1116,"I have a problem, and I need help."""
1117,It was SO difficult to make that step to do research and call doctor after doctor just trying to get in as soon as possible so that I wouldn't end up making an excuse and not go.
1118,But I went.
1119,And what an amazing experience.
1120,"To have someone look you in the eyes and believe you, and validate you and to know you're not alone and that you have a chance at a ""normal"" (whatever that is) life."
1121,For the first time in my life I have a name for what I'm dealing with.
1122,I can recognize it.
1123,I'm learning to not let it control me.
1124,"It is a struggle for sure, and it's like being in school again."
1125,I have to relearn everything it seems.
1126,But it's worth it.
1127,"I go to counseling once a week, I'm learning to meditate and be mindful, I'm eating healthy, and I am also on Zoloft."
1128,"I used to be judgmental and scared of anti depressants, but I was so desperate with this last meltdown that I was open to anything at that point."
1129,I will no longer judge these medications.
1130,It's like a whole new world has opened up for me.
1131,"Of course there are side affects and it's not perfect, but it sure as shit is better than dealing with it on my own."
1132,I'm going to attack this shit at every angle!
1133,I hope that with this post someone will find the inspiration to just go ahead and make that call.
1134,Take that step.
1135,I wish someone had pushed me and encouraged me earlier in my life.
1136,But at least I'm doing it now.
1137,Better late than never!
1138,!
1139,"while therapy helped a little, i am starting to realize that it would be great to get a proper evaluation and try out some meds."
1140,"What medications, or combinations of medications, have you personally found helpful for managing your anxiety?"
1141,Did you have side effects?
1142,"If you could indicate the type of anxiety you have as well, that would be helpful."
1143,"I realize all meds are ""your mileage may vary"" but it's still nice to hear from people who have had success on theirs since often you read horror stories online."
1144,I'll start off with a quick background.
1145,"I'm a seventeen year old girl and I've been dealing with ""depression/anxiety like"" symptoms almost all my life, however only recently diagnosed on having a disorder."
1146,I'm on two anti anxiety/ depression medications and they seem to help for the most part.
1147,"(Along with exercises and eating right)

The main triggers for my panic attacks are events/thoughts I can't control."
1148,To my main point.
1149,I don't consider myself to be a clingy person.
1150,"I don't enjoy people hanging off my for hugs, or, any unwanted  touching."
1151,"&gt;.&lt;

I've being ""with"" my boyfriend for about 4 months now and I love being around him."
1152,So much so that it makes me physically sick when he leaves.
1153,I'm scared that something might happen to him and I won't be able to protect him or vice versa.
1154,He is a few years older than me.
1155,We have an appointment tomorrow to look at a basement suite for him.
1156,"I'm excited that he's looking, but I'm nervous that it might not be safe."
1157,What it there's a fire?
1158,Murderous landlords that live upstairs?
1159,Carbon minoxcode?
1160,The list gets ridicules at parts.
1161,":P

I just want to be around him all the time."
1162,He's the one person who I feel makes me truly happy at this point in my life.
1163,I don't really know what to think.
1164,Anyways.
1165,Thank you for reading and attempting to help.
1166,(:
1167,My mother has diagnosed anxiety and takes medication for it; but the level of anxiety appears to lessen with each generation.
1168,I know that meds effect everyone differently.
1169,"I'm just afraid of becoming dependent on these meds, especially Xanax as I hear it can be addictive."
1170,I finally got on meds to try and help with my adhd so I can maybe finish college.
1171,"I have not seen a Dr. Id really like to avoid medication if possible, however with the worse it gets I'm starting to not care about what they give me as long as they can make it stop."
1172,I guess this will be my anxiety alt because if anyone found my regular username and saw I posted here I would die.
1173,Because one of the bullshittiest part of my anxiety is that talking about it triggers it and my heart is going 3000 BPM right now just posting this...
1174,So I used to keep my feelings in a bottle.
1175,But that didn't work out very well for me.
1176,"I got racing thoughts, (that repetitively said 'kill yourself') and told my mom after never having a quiet moment in my own fucking head for almost two-and-a-half weeks."
1177,This got me stuck in a hospital for 3 days.
1178,And now I have a dx of generalized anxiety disorder.
1179,This was in September.
1180,And now I try to put less in the bottle but it's kinda not working because I end up wearing all of my emotions very close to the surface because I can't seem to find a middle ground between 'fake emotion' and ALL THE EMOTION!!!
1181,"(Which results in people thinking I'm annoying and hyper)

And I keep getting worked up over the most minor situations."
1182,"Like I lost my computer charger cable, I freaked out, and then my mom told me that if I didn't stop acting like a two year old then I would have to take medications."
1183,But I don't want to take medications and I don't want to see a therapist and she doesn't want to pay for it or have to drive me to a therapist so I'm not going.
1184,But anyway.
1185,The main problem is that I can't seem to control myself in situations like this where it seems like my entire life is going to shit but it's just a fucking computer cable.
1186,And I realize how stupid it is later but at the time it's the Worst Thing In The World and she tells me I need to get perspective but I don't have any perspective in that moment because I just lost my fucking computer charger and everyone will laugh at me and I won't be able to study for my finals and I'm going to look like an idiot and I've lost something AGAIN and my mom is going to hate me.
1187,"(By the way, I'm 15, and I'm pretty sure my mom doesn't actually hate me)."
1188,I'm on day 4 and I haven't felt exactly the same any of the 4 days I've been taking the medicine.
1189,I've read it can take up to 2 weeks to start feeling a more positive effect of the medicine.
1190,Or a psychiatrist who concludes medicine isn't a good fit because I'm fine most of the time and to just suck it up.
1191,I have had anxiety disorder for roughly three years and have managed to get it under control (with very little use of medication) but every time someone starts talking about it I start feeling anxious.
1192,"So far I've tried/had checked:

- Careful attention to diet (Low glycemic index foods, lots of vegetables)

- Heavy cardio exercise 3-5 times a week (3km runs and soccer)

- General blood tests (Vitamin and mineral levels, e.g - iron)

- Thyroid via blood test

- Testosterone levels via blood test

- A sleep study, to rule out sleep apnoea

- 3 years of seeing a psychologist (ACT I think, some CBT)

----

Yet to check:

- Adrenal function tests (Maybe that was already tested as part of blood tests, to be confirmed)

Anything else I should check before accepting the side effects I might get from medication?"
1193,It's been well-controlled for 15 years with medication.
1194,Did you change your meds?
1195,"He also said that he would give me an anti sickness medication before I came round, and that it wouldn't make me feel woozy or sleepy."
1196,"I'm a 22 female and I've had GAD for a number for years, but this past week it has been extreme."
1197,"My depression also goes hand in hand with the anxiety, and it has felt like I am going to explode and I want to tear at my skin for pretty much 24/7."
1198,"I've had a really rough past (bullies, abuse) but I can't figure out any triggers for this current episode."
1199,I'm not on any medications at all.
1200,I had a bad experience with benzodiazepines and it's put me off of the whole medication thing.
1201,I'm currently seeing a psychologist but I won't have another session for a month since she is on vacation.
1202,"**Anyways**, I'm currently at work and have been doing my meditation exercises, but what else can I do to help relax and diminish the feeling while I'm currently at my very professional workplace?"
1203,How do I not lose my cool?
1204,It's been really hard.
1205,"On our very first date, he explained to me that he is bipolar and has pretty bad anxiety issues (on medication for both)."
1206,"Girlfriend is leaving me because she can't ""be there for me"" through this positive process of change and growth I'm going through due to therapy and medication."
1207,I have had anxiety attacks daily which are bad enough to warrant meds.
1208,However the meds she likes to give me when I go through periods of extreme anxiety or depression just make me stupid.
1209,"I finally found a medication and therapist  that works for me (the combo was a complete game changer), my life is 10 fold better and I know many of the triggers that can kick in this anxiety so I can avoid them."
1210,"TL;DR - need over the counter medication to help relieve my public speaking anxiety, any suggestions?"
1211,Anyways I wanted to ask could it be a side effect of the medicine?
1212,"i've seen doctors, all who refused to refer me to mental health specialists and reccomended me antidepressants/anti anxiety meds which i am vehemently opposed to taking."
1213,I have anxiety but I can't take meds.
1214,"I barely made it 2 weeks, had a 4 day long panic attack (while on medication) that made me book and early flight and come back home."
1215,No medication please!
1216,I've tried to tell him he needs to go to therapy and get medication but he refuses to even entertain the idea.
1217,I'm 30 and have been off meds and happy for years.
1218,"Well a couple weeks ago, my endocrinologist tested my TSH levels and they were low (hyperthyroidism), so he changed my medication (increased metformin and decreased levothyroxine), then I proceeded to go on vacation and LEFT MY ANXIETY MEDS AT HOME."
1219,All the meds I'm taking mimic some of the side effects of pregnancy and I'm sufficiently freaked every time one of them makes an appearance.
1220,"I went through some meds, none did anything beneficial, a couple had mild side effects like sleeplessness stomach stuff etc., but nothing too bad."
1221,"After trying three meds, my doctor decided to tell me I need to talk to a therapist about the problem and that she would not be able to help me further."
1222,I went back to the doctor today for an unrelated illness and mentioned that I have not been able to call the therapist and was damn near accosted for not having done so and then she begrudgingly prescribed me a new medicine with the requirement that I come back to her in 30 days and having talked to a therapist.
1223,What if medication doesn't work?
1224,"I'm going in today for a therapy session, and then am being diagnosed soon and put on medication soon after that."
1225,So 2013 was a pretty rough year for me.
1226,During the summer I finally went to a doctor and she told me I have anxiety.
1227,We made the decision that I'll try to control it on my own and not go on medication.
1228,I decided not to because I feel like it will change who I am and I also don't want to depend on meds.
1229,"Since this decision though, it's been really up and really down and now I'm kind of regretting my decision."
1230,"So guys, I was wondering what medicines are prescribed and how dependent you are on them?"
1231,(I stopped taking my meds because I feel better generally without them).
1232,"I've been on and off anti-depressants and/or anti-anxiety meds for the past six years, each to varying effects: Paxil, Lexapro, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Effexor, Remeron, Trazadone, Abilify."
1233,"I took the first pill last night, and it's my first experience with any sort of SSRI, or any form of medication other than aspirin/tylenol/etc."
1234,"Now here's my question:
I'm going on a 4 day cruise in 10 days and am thinking I should stop medication until after the cruise."
1235,I've been experiencing panic attacks almost daily and it takes almost all of my strength to just calm myself down and do what needs to be done during the day.
1236,"Unfortunately though, I don't have any real ""away time"" when panic attacks hit because I take care of a toddler full-time and my husband works weird hours which lead us to different sleep schedules."
1237,"I don't want to wake him up and bother him when attacks hit because I know he needs his sleep just as much as I do, but a lot of the time the only thing that calms me down is to be able to talk to someone."
1238,"As a ""new"" mom (I use the term loosely because she's not an infant) I don't have many friends I can hang out with."
1239,"That's normal, I know this, but I don't want my child picking up on the fact that I'm feeling horrible anxiety all of the time."
1240,So I usually pretend to be okay and do things with her like playing or watching things.
1241,All this alone time makes my anxiety even worse and most of the time I don't want to bother anyone so I never reach out.
1242,Though admittedly I definitely should.
1243,"I'm not on medications right now and can't get on any for a few months at least, so I just have to figure out a way to deal with these I guess."
1244,Just sucks to get hit with such paralyzing anxiety that turns what feels like five minutes into two hours and I don't know where all my time's gone.
1245,There's no shame in considering medication.
1246,"Taking medicine turned my life around, find the one that's right for you, I tried three before I found one that doesn't make me hazy."
1247,"It's been a while since I've had an attack (I don't take meds/I haven't discussed it with my family, so that's dumb on my part)."
1248,I don't want to go back on my anti-depressents and I am already taking a medication for my anxiety that I love.
1249,"I have never sought professional help for my anxiety, and although this is largely because my anxiety has prevented me from doing so, even when I've felt confident enough I've refused to seek help because I don't want to be put on medication."
1250,"Surely if one has a mental problem, allowing your brain to become reliant on medication to correct it is just going to make it impossible to function properly without it?"
1251,"I've never had any kinds of medicine or treatment for anxiety before, mostly because I'm too scared/embarrassed/proud to ask for any (which is stupid, I know), but I also didn't start noticing many problems with anxiety until July 2012."
1252,I just started Wellbutrin for GAD.
1253,Ive heard a lot of mixed reviews on it-- tell me your experiences/opinions.
1254,"Feel free to go into detail, currently studying psych/brain cognitive science so I have a decent understanding of neurology and brain structure."
1255,"So far I feel as if the physical symptoms have been alleviated, but my mind is racing faster than ever and short-term memory may also be a budding problem."
1256,"I've tried Zoloft (concentration/sexual problems), Lexapro (sexual dysfunction/clouded cognition), Cymbalta (liver damage-- but worked great other than that), and Xanax (developed a dependency)."
1257,"TL;DR Currently on Wellbutrin for GAD, what are your experiences/opinions; what other medicines (preferably non-ssri/srni) may help?"
1258,I was on medication for about 2 months then stopped.
1259,"I had been doing so well off meds, and now have had a lot of stress in my life."
1260,"So here they are again, and I will resume my meds since they did work well."
1261,"Recently started a new medication, which was very scary for me because I don't like taking things that I don't know what they will do."
1262,"Even when I started this medication, my thoughts were ""How is this going to help?"
1263,The medication is allowing me to get to a point where I have the resources to care for myself.
1264,"For me medication will not be the answer, but it provides a door to a long tunnel to the other side of this mess if I'm willing to do the work."
1265,"Now a couple of years ago, I started having extremely bad panic attacks out of the blue, to the point that I am now currently on medication (Lexapro) for it."
1266,"They discouraged me from seeing a therapist/taking meds, but this isn't about them, this is about me."
1267,"I've also tried Lexapro and Zoloft, but I'm not keen on meds and I got off them earlier than recommended (weeks.)"
1268,"I'm not keen on meds for a few reasons, all of which are my personal beliefs and I don't mean to belittle or offend anyone on them."
1269,Just in case: I'm not on any meds (aside from some pain killers for now) and I've never been diagnosed with anxiety problems of any kind.
1270,I have health insurance that covers what I would need to see someone about therapy or medication.
1271,"Girl in above story actually gave me some meds that helped her in similar situations (which again, I should focus on that she cares about me enough to try to help me instead of dumb phone shit) but I havent noticed any difference really."
1272,I've had panic attacks all my life and I have been she people about it and taking meds.
1273,"* - I used to eat very healthy and do a lot of cardio, but since my sleep meds has lowered my blood pressure I can't do cardio without fainting D: and I have been eating very bad unhealthy stuff lately."
1274,"Coincidentally, this is how long I've been taking my meds (escitalopram, 10mg once a day)."
1275,Could the meds and/or anxiety be causing it?
1276,A few months ago I had a sudden drastic alteration in understanding of self after anxiety attack.
1277,"I feel I am the same person, but, awake, alive, and unafraid."
1278,"I still feel anxiety/fear, although it creeps up I feel it recognize it and it goes away."
1279,"I find this change to be incredible, strange, and wonderful."
1280,"I used to have panic attacks that made me miss work, cause horrible painful swelling in my joints and skin."
1281,I would get a temperature and experience the most awful mental distress where I felt I was coming apart.
1282,I would self harm and wail.
1283,"So a few months back after a bad storm that made life at work hell (cops involved, people becoming ill and injured, other crap) and the decision that I was going to be moving out."
1284,I had the panic attack of all panic attacks.
1285,I had been inside wailing (that uncontrollable cry you hear from a mourner) It is distressing for all involved to hear that sound so I went outside sat in a chair (to be away from others) and slumped forward and I have no idea what happened.
1286,For 2 hours I sat on the porch.
1287,I had the strangest experience (probably from lack of oxygen) where I saw warm and cold light.
1288,"The feeling of becoming super small, but also a feeling of ""Oneness."""
1289,I came out of it when someone came out to check on me.
1290,"When I went inside I felt very VERY strange but everything felt very real, I was ready to get ride of everything I ""owned"" I did two weeks later donate bags and bags of things to goodwill and threw away trash bag after trash bag of junk."
1291,"But since then, I have not had a panic attack, instead when I feel one, the need to cry or my heart going nuts, or my skin swelling- I become calm- I feel warmth and that ""oneness"" again I feel loving- still fearful but with a sweet undertone."
1292,"I know this did not happen on its own, I did years of therapy, studying, and medications (I am no longer on.)"
1293,"This event, altered the way I see the world and respond to it, it stripped away a part of my built up reactions to stress."
1294,"So, any idea of what the hell happened?"
1295,I do not miss the extreme anxiety.
1296,I do not miss missing work or school and I do not miss the pain and stress.
1297,But what the heck happened?
1298,How?
1299,I feel like a person who is stable.
1300,"Like this is what living was supposed to feel like the entire time,,, wtf?"
1301,Ive never taken any meds for my anxiety before and today was the first time I talked to somebody about it (except my mother).
1302,"I took off last week to allow myself to adjust to the medication, but also because I was scared something was going to happen go me on my way to work... Now, it's 1230M, I'm supposed to go to work tomorrow and I'm profusely sweating and have myself believing something is going to happen if I go to work tomorrow...."
1303,"*This is a new account, as some of our friends know my other handle, and I'm sure my wife would want me to keep her private affairs private."
1304,Thanks for you understanding.
1305,"*

My wife has been suffering lately from anxiety attacks and some depression, and I want to help her, but I don't know where to start to be honest."
1306,"I'm okay with her seeing a professional- it only makes sense, right?"
1307,"When the car is broken, you see a mechanic, when your teeth are bad, you see a dentist."
1308,"When your thoughts hurt, you see a therapist."
1309,Let me try to explain her (our) situation.
1310,"If I miss anything or it isn't clear, please let me know where and how I can fix it."
1311,"We are both young, early twenties."
1312,"We've been married for a year, dated for five- the tail end of high school and all through college."
1313,We both graduated college one year ago.
1314,"Like most high school kids, my wife and I both had self esteem issues in our teens, though I feel that she should be nothing but proud of her accomplishments- she graduated in the top three at our high school."
1315,"In college, she graduated college suma cum laude from the honors program at the best university in the state."
1316,"She has always had a little bit of anxiety, but over the last two years it's gotten much worse."
1317,It started towards the end of college.
1318,"With graduation and our wedding around the corner, she started having crippling anxiety attacks."
1319,She would become very upset with hysterical crying and pains in her chest.
1320,"The attacks almost always came accompanied with feelings that she was a ""bad person"" and she would recall embarrassing memories (sometimes from a long time ago, sometimes very mundane) that caused regret and remorse."
1321,"This is the part that I find most frustrating, though my frustrations aren't directed at her- it's just frustrating because she's the most considerate and selfless person I know, and had never intentionally harmed another person or said anything malicious about anyone."
1322,"A month before her graduation she began to take medications for the attacks- I don't remember which ones specifically, but there were two."
1323,One was a once daily and the other was for when the attacks got very bad.
1324,"She was on the daily medication for about eight months, and closer to our wedding she got off it."
1325,She still has the other anxiety medication to take when the attacks get bad.
1326,"Over the last few months since our wedding, her anxiety has gotten worse and it has come to take on an air of depression."
1327,She says things like she doesn't love herself.
1328,This part scares me very badly to the point where I feel like I'm going to be sick.
1329,She feels remorse and even shame over events that happened a long time ago.
1330,"Sometimes it's over small interactions that most people would dismiss without thinking twice about, but she keeps revisiting them and reading into them over and over until she comes to the conclusion that she's a bad person."
1331,It's like she can't help but wander into these darker corners of her mind.
1332,"I can sympathize, I'm familiar with this kind of sudden regretful memory or revisiting bad points, but I've grown able to quash those feelings by keeping my mind and hands occupied."
1333,"So I understand where the feelings stem from, that's not the part I need help with."
1334,My attacks like this largely started going away after I started dating her.
1335,It gave me the self esteem to be able to deal with those thoughts.
1336,"She on the other hand, hasn't been able to build up a defense mechanism."
1337,"Anyways, she gets the attacks more often now."
1338,Anything I try to say or do to make her feel better doesn't work- she refuses to accept anything I say when I try to calm her down.
1339,"She will, however, listen to her mother, who has had similar anxiety attacks."
1340,I guess the most frustrating part for me is that her mom will tell her the exact same thing I will and it will calm her down.
1341,"I say it frustrates me because I'm her husband for crying out loud, I should be able to comfort her."
1342,"I should be able to  fix her problems, she's my wife."
1343,Here is the external situation- our home life is good.
1344,"We're not awesome money wise, but we are comfortable."
1345,"She is very close to her mom (we both are, actually), and we have an apartment in the next town over from her parents."
1346,The work situation is not as good.
1347,In a month we will be moving a few states away for my job.
1348,"Since graduating college, she has been working a job where she is underemployed for her credentials."
1349,"She loved the job when she got it 10 months ago, but has gradually learned to dislike it because it involves some physical labor aspects to it, which she struggles with because she physically small in size- just over 5'2 and under 100 pounds."
1350,"I think this inability to perform some of her job's tasks has taken a toll on her as well, since her self esteem thus far has been built on her successes."
1351,"She was very (VERY) successful academically, but now that school is over she is struggling even more with her self esteem issues."
1352,"Now that I've given you a back story, here is what I need help with-
*I don't know where to begin to look for help."
1353,"This is something a therapist can help, right?"
1354,Or is it a psychologist?
1355,Is there a difference between the two?
1356,"There's so much I don't know, and I don't know where to start."
1357,"*After I find out what kind of professional help she needs, I need to locate one."
1358,Is there a way I can find out if the therapist is a good one?
1359,I need to know because she's too important to me for this to be handled improperly.
1360,"*Once I find a professional, I need to be able to affectively communicate with them the problem."
1361,"Where can I find a list of anxiety disorders (is that the right word, disorders?)"
1362,and look for the one she might suffer from?
1363,Do any of you know what it might be called?
1364,"*When she is having these attacks, what can I do to mollify them or help her?"
1365,I need help with these things.
1366,I also need *guidance*.
1367,"If anybody knows of *anything* that might help, please, I'm listening and willing to do it."
1368,"The medication is helping, but full-effect is still a little while away."
1369,I went on medication and it's been 4 months so I've decided to re-test.
1370,Been on anxiety meds for about 1.5.
1371,I don't want to take meds because I'm trying to get off of them.
1372,should i get an anti-anxiety medication to help me sleep?
1373,It's my first time taking any kind of medication and to begin with I was feeling very positive about it.
1374,I know medication isn't going to be a miracle cure but I'd like to know how long it normally takes to kick in to see how well it's working for me.
1375,"My doctor told me that a side-effect of the medication is anxiety, and I expressed myself probably a little too hostile-- ""NO, I don't need MORE anxiety, THAT makes me feel anxious, just thinking about it!"
1376,"This is the first time I've ever been on any kind of medication, and I suppose it's a bit worrisome."
1377,"Edit: just thought i'd add, I haven't been on any medication for probably a year now, and I've been a lot better."
1378,I was going to a doctor and got some meds.
1379,"i go to bed panicking i won't wake up the next day..  and go throughout my day checking my temperature with my thermometer i carry with me if i'm feeling particularly anxious about my temp..  (probably should stop doing that)..  

i have smallish pains in my body..  

i wonder how much of it is my head making the issue out and how much are actual issues..  i know a decent bit can be caused by anxiety, but i don't know how much..

my nurse practitioner told me it was okay i take myself off the anti-depressants i was on if they were making it weird..  increased panic and weird dreams = taking myself off..  

only thing is that's the 3rd time i've ""failed"" a particular class of medication, and she's told me that she can't do anything for me if that's the case."
1380,Foundation of my therapy was samatha and vipassana meditation + cognitive behavioral therapy rather than taking meds.
1381,"Met an amazing girl, made new friends, went on some trips - made the mistake of going off my medicine."
1382,I am confident and hopeful that returning to my medication and potentially going back to therapy will help me get back into recovery.
1383,Hello.
1384,"I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, general anxiety disorder, and panic disorder early last year."
1385,I see a therapist and psychiatrist every month and take my daily medications every morning.
1386,I'm doing ok with the schizoaffective except that anxiety and panic is still there.
1387,"I feel really stupid, dehumanized and sad when anxiety manifests itself into a full blown panic attack and i cant stop it."
1388,"I feel like i have the right tools through therapy and medication to stop the anxiety/panic but it just steam rolls over me.I try to read, go for a walk, talk to someone but it feels like if a panic attack wants to get me, its going to get me."
1389,Any advise on how you guys handle anxiety attacks or panic attacks would be vary helpful.
1390,Thank You in advance.
1391,I am wondering if anyone has any advice for temporary meds with a short half life and minimal withdrawals to take during a withdrawl from venlafaxine .
1392,"Well a few weeks ago,  the doctor decided to check my prostate, but instead of stick his fingers up my ass, he decided to stick a giant stick up there to take pictures of my prostate and bladder (Was not a pleasant experience) Well all came back normal and he said I have an overactive bladder and gave me this medicine to take for 2 months."
1393,"I took an oxycodone to help ease it and am waiting for it to kick in fully, but I know it may not help the headache itself since different pain medication types work on different kinds of pain."
1394,"Therapy and medication are not to be overlooked, despite the unfair stigma that may surround them."
1395,"This past month he's been going to a psychologist and a psychiatrist because he decided that he wants to stop using medication (the Parotexine, which he has been using without any supervision from either a psychologist or a psychiatrist for about eight years now, I think)."
1396,"I am on medication, so I no longer actively have outward panic attacks...but my fear inside is just as strong."
1397,I pushed through it as I am not on any medication.
1398,"Im not against taking medicine again, but im not exactly looking forward to it."
1399,"I just started a low does of Lexapro (for anxiety, social anxiety and depression, may be adding more meds later but psych wants to do one at a time to see how i react) and I've had some side effects."
1400,"I haven't been on anxiety medicine for a long time, probably for 5 years."
1401,I think these are things that would make normal people freak out so I'm not sure if it's reason to get back on anxiety medicine.
1402,"If I do need to get back on medicine I worry about the doctors appointment, hospitals and doctor offices stress me out and it embarrasses me a lot to cry with a room full of people in a waiting room, does anyone have any suggestions to help me out with that?"
1403,"TL;DR: If I have a reason to have a lot of anxiety, do I still need medicine?"
1404,"If I do need medicine, is there a way for me to not embarrass myself at the doctors office?"
1405,I have trouble breathing and writing and I'm out of medication.
1406,"Is it possible to try out anxiety medication without it ""rewiring"" your brain forever?"
1407,"But also wanted suggestions of some meds that don't cause weight gain due to struggling with that from Paxil and finally losing all of that, I want to avoid it coming back."
1408,"She is on medication, something along the lines of Prozac, and seeing therapy but I don't think she is completely honest with the therapist."
1409,I used to be on medication for anxiety.
1410,I have anxiety disorder and I've taken my medicine but it doesn't seem to be helping.
1411,"I'll try and keep this short, but I could use some help dealing with my doctor."
1412,"When I first developed this anxiety I went to this doctor S. Doctor S prescribed me Ativan and a sleeping medication and sent me on my way, but he made me feel a little uncomfortable and I wanted to try someone new."
1413,"A new urgent care opened down the street that also does primary care, so I went to talk to doctor M there and she was much better."
1414,She put me on prozac and it seemed to stabilize me and I got my shit in order.
1415,"I tried to quit taking prozac because of the sexual side effects, and I thought I didn't need it anymore."
1416,"Fast forward 6 months and my life has taken a bad turn, and the anxiety and panic attacks are back in full force."
1417,"I try going to doctor M but she is on maternity leave, and the staff there laugh at me from behind the door (thought it was my anxiety at first, but no it *was* about me) because I never actually made her my primary care."
1418,"Go back to doc S, he tries diagnosing me with ADD which could be true, but the anxiety is more important to me."
1419,Doc S has given me three different prescriptions that do not work well with me now.
1420,"I am moving out of state soon, I don't have the time to be trying new medicines like this."
1421,It's driving me up a wall.
1422,"Last time I told him to please just let me start taking the prozac again, side effects were minimal compared to these new meds and it works."
1423,He writes me a script for fucking Effexor instead!
1424,Why?!
1425,"The Effexor is making me sick, I didn't want this."
1426,What do I do?
1427,I'm done wasting money going to the doctor for this bullshit.
1428,"I have two weeks(ish) before I leave, but my anxiety is becoming a real bitch."
1429,I would like to get on a good medication now so I can think straight and sort this stuff out.
1430,"This was way longer than I anticipated, but what should I do?"
1431,"I could wait until I move, but it feels like years away."
1432,"Thank you for reading this, I could just use a little guidance."
1433,"This, by the way, is with the help of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication."
1434,"Now I don't like psych meds and I don't like homone replacement therapy, so I started doing some research on my own."
1435,I'm confused as to why I'm still feeling like this and why is it still so intense even when on meds.
1436,"Do you suggest asking to change my meds, or have I just not stuck with the citalopram long enough??"
1437,I'm hesitant about changing meds and it would feel like I'm starting all over again.
1438,"I'm on meds, I've tried a million different types, I've been through countless hours of therapy and was even inpatient once in the hospital for behavioral health."
1439,Last week I was told by my doctor that I could remove my daily dose of Buspar from my medications due to my new abilities to help control my anxiety.
1440,I would not have made it this far without the assistance and tips from you wonderful people.
1441,"I was on this medication for years, so to be finally able to come off of it was a huge accomplishment."
1442,"It's still a daily struggle, but coming off these meds is a big step!"
1443,Thank you!
1444,"However, I have talked about my therapist about the possibility of going on medication."
1445,The option I was given was the kind of medication that you take regularly and the kind you take as needed.
1446,that's just a guess off the top of my head) and am wondering if anyone would share their experiences with those types of medication.
1447,"I'm a student of psychology at university and, particularly lately, studies have shown that cognitive therapy can be equally, if not more, effective as medication."
1448,I've also tried 3 daily anxiety meds to no success as my body absolutely does not react well to changed in the serotonin levels.
1449,2) For the meds - has anyone found good daily medicine to control anxiety outside of the serotonin inhibitor family?
1450,I am wondering if anxiety medication could be useful for when I have these episodes.
1451,"Technically, if I asked him ""I think I have anxiety attacks and I think anti-anxiety meds would help"" that is drug-seeking."
1452,I feel the best thing for me is medication because I've been living my whole life with depression and social anxiety.
1453,"Basically the point of this post is to get this stuff off my chest and also, how can I convince my mom to allow me to get medication?"
1454,She is on a lot of medication and not eaten will obviously make her feel like that.
1455,Did you try counseling + medication?
1456,I was able to go without any meds and didn't have many panic attacks.
1457,"i have anxiety as it is (it's normally manageable so i don't take medication for it, and it really hasn't been bad at all for the past few months), so right now it's through the roof."
1458,"After 18 years of dealing with panic disorder I'm at the end of my rope so to speak, so I have found a place that focuses on functional medicine and getting to the root cause."
1459,"I've posted about it again and again whenever I get anxious, and I've received feedback telling me to try medication."
1460,But I was just wondering about medication and how it actually worked.
1461,"But to give him and *myself* a piece of mind, I've been thinking about going to therapy and asking for medication."
1462,Let me know your past experiences with the medication.
1463,I have to get some kind of medicine or see some kind of therapist because my life is being controlled by this.
1464,"Found out in my first visit that three meds I am currently on (two psychotropics,  and one to treat my migraines) all leach away Vit B's."
1465,I don't want to boost my meds again.
1466,Thank you if you guys know any medicine can help me.
1467,What are your views of taking the medication Lexapro.
1468,I am on medication for depression and have emergency medication for panic attacks/severe mood swings.
1469,"Anxiety medication is the last resort (again), and I'm kind of hoping they end up putting me on some type of mild sedative, so I can at least do some type of work."
1470,"I was beginning to feel like I'd gone in a kind of remission to my anxiety/panic attacks and depression, so I wanted to see how I'd do off medication."
1471,"I've quickly realized I wasn't any better, the medication just suppressed it..."
1472,"I need to know that if I'm going to be on medication forever, there's one out there that doesn't cause SO many long term side effects."
1473,"I am calling my mothers social worker tomorrow to organise daily care for her, a social worker for my dad is supposed to call me tomorrow morning
and i will also call his own doctor to see if there is some type of monitoring that can be done, or medication to settle him."
1474,"My tools, my medication, my stubborn attitude aren't enough this time."
1475,"He then suggested that I can try Ciprolex, which he said about 40% of his patients suffer from decreased libido, but is also a good medication and much cheaper."
1476,I spoke with my doctor about medication but I felt as if I would try to seek advice and counselling first.
1477,Should I take more medicine that day?
1478,I don't know if I have anxiety problems.
1479,When I had talked to a school counselor she suggested it briefly.
1480,It was only a passing moment because she seemed more concerned with getting me through a really hard transition of colleges.
1481,It was a very helpful experience but it ultimately didn't work out too well.
1482,Because of this I'm afraid of going back to her because I initially went to wonder why I had been having so much trouble connecting with people.
1483,The problems is really getting out of hand.
1484,I'm a mid-twenties male.
1485,Only recently finished taking classes at a community college and never had a job.
1486,"Constantly feeling hopeless, lost, and confused with just about everything involved with my life."
1487,I have enough friends and family I could count on one hand.
1488,"Even so, I keep then only at arm's length."
1489,I can't go out and make friends because I'm horrible at conversation.
1490,Trying to find a job has been the worst feeling in the world.
1491,"After reading some more into social anxiety, it feels likes so right to me."
1492,"I sometimes get breathing problems, my mind will often become so overwhelmed with thoughts or emotions that I have to step back."
1493,I usually just have to go somewhere alone and curl up for a little bit.
1494,My chest gets tight feeling and I start to just feel entrapped.
1495,It's incredibly embarrassing and I'm so ashamed of the problem that I have trouble even reaching out for help.
1496,"This shouldn't be a concern to anyone, I mean it's a part of life, and moving on, even if it's a transition."
1497,I can sit and rationalize through it as much as I can but sometimes I just act entirely on fear.
1498,"I want help, I feel like I need help."
1499,"If I can't find a resolve for things soon, I fear I may result to poor tactics that really damage ad ruin my life."
1500,It's become a horrible catch twenty-two with my life that I want to be alone and isolate myself for everyone but it's in that loneliness that things become the worst and I miss everyone I use to know.
1501,"Alternatively, Are there any jobs that someone with social anxiety would be good for?"
1502,Lately I've been possessed with the concept of just wanting to turn my thoughts off.
1503,Would pursuing drugs or medications be helpful or am I just being wishful?
1504,Is finding someone to help this difficult?
1505,I'm not sure how to find someone when I can't really even talk to those around me about it.
1506,I also don't have a lot of money to try to pay for therapy or medication.
1507,I woke up eight hours ago and have spent every moment worrying.
1508,I tried playing a video game but my mind was too distracted to get any enjoyment from it.
1509,"I usually spend a good portion of the day worrying, but not EVERY second."
1510,"I know I can't get better by myself, but the thought of being on medication and having it not work scares me to death."
1511,What else is there to do if no medications are able to help me improve.
1512,The only medications I've tried seemed to kill my emotions EXCEPT for the anxiety.
1513,It's frustrating to talk to anyone in real life because I don't want it to seem like I'm whining.
1514,"Everyone has problems, I would rather have my family think I'm ok than have them worry about me or think I'm being a baby."
1515,"Sorry if this is jumbled, anxiety also tends to make it hard for me to put my thoughts into words."
1516,He gets medication monthly.
1517,"The only benzo that has relieved my suffering is Clonazepam, and I have developed a tolerance to that medication due to using it daily to help me get through my last partners suicide."
1518,"The medication still works, but only at high doses (3-4 mg) my psychiatrist doesn't like the idea of giving it to me on an as needed basis because of its long half life, and while I understand the point he makes, it's also hard to accept because it was the only thing that helped me through my darkest moments and panic attacks."
1519,But I just keep thinking man what in the hell would I do without my meds?
1520,I want to give the medication at least a month but I don't want to be uncomfortable the entire time.
1521,I've been dating my partner for three years and he's seen my anxiety through some tough times...
1522,"I used to have panic attacks quite regularly and though with meditation and a healthier life, anxiety attacks without serious triggers subsided, I still had an overwhelming sense of generalized anxiety."
1523,"About a year ago, I got prescribed escitalopram and thought 'fuck it - I've tried most other anti-anxiety medications so why not?'."
1524,"It was a bit rockier to acclimate to (gave me horrible nausea for about three months - it hadn't even occurred to me that though it was an SSRI, it wasn't necessarily selective for neural serotonin and also affected your gut), but I acclimated nonetheless and honestly kind of liked it at first."
1525,"Over the next few months, I wasn't so anxious about getting to work or a function on time, my worst-case-scenario thoughts had dulled quite a bit and for the most part, I was comfortable."
1526,"Then maybe about seven or eight months in, I realized my libido had dramatically decreased."
1527,"I was bloated frequently, didn't feel attractive, wasn't attracted to my partner... some more time passed and I realized I was falling out of love with him."
1528,"Fast forward to now (a year from the start of lexapro) and though I love my partner, I'm just not feelin' him at all."
1529,"Libido aside, I don't even know if I want to spend the rest of my life with him and we've built a life around that goal together."
1530,I should mention - my libido is zero just towards my partner (or so I think).
1531,"I haven't really given it much thought otherwise but there is one person I'm attracted to that gets me wet just by looking at me, but my partner can't seem to get me on even after putting some serious work in..."
1532,Does anyone have some insight?
1533,"Is it me, my failing relationship or my meds?"
1534,Has anyone else experienced this kind of distancing as a reaction to an SSRI?
1535,"(PS, if you haven't read Is It Me or My Meds?"
1536,"by David Karp and are fighting the good fight between any kind of mental 'illness' and being medicated, I recommend it)."
1537,"I'm not on xanax or the other medication thats for anxiety (I'm really sorry I'm such a noob at this, the meds that start with a C) and I'm trying to get an appointment with my psychiatrist and a therapist, but I really hate relying on meds to be ""okay""  

I feel really weak and pathetic because I need almost constant reassurance that things will be okay eventually"
1538,sorry for bad formatting and wall of text.
1539,Im currently 20 sitting at my parents house getting worse and worse everyday and just don't know what to do anymore.
1540,i dont know where else to post this and am hoping typing this out calms me down.
1541,I've had anxiety problems all my life but i always felt like i could handle them.
1542,"It did cause me to miss alot of social events growing up and i've always kind of been a shut in, i was also homeschooled which didn't really help at all but i just saw all of that as part of being me and i liked being alone so whatever."
1543,"But everything went downhill december of 2012, it honestly feels like thats when my life ended."
1544,I woke up in the middle of the night feeling weird like my thoughts were different or just like i was out of it and started freaking out.
1545,"Eventually i was able to fall back asleep writing it off as just being tired, but i woke up the next day and while the panicky feeling was gone everything still felt different/off like i everything was just suddenly uncomfortable or something."
1546,I was freaked out but was able to keep it together for 2 more days but then in the morning i woke up and had the same thing but worse it felt like my thoughts were distant and i was having weird sensations in my head but it also felt like i was calm or drunk even though i was freaking out at the same time.
1547,I got really scared i was having a stroke or had a brain lession and ended up going to the hospital where i had an MRI and CT scan done and they took blood.
1548,Everything came back fine and they said they wanted me to see a neurologist because i was also dizzy/was shaky walking.
1549,He decided it MIGHT have been a seizure and put me on keppra just to be safe because i wanted to keep driving.
1550,I took it for awhile but eventually i kind of just started taking it here or there and it didnt really feel important since there was no proof it was a seizure and i hate taking medicines i think i dont need especially stuff that involves my brain.
1551,Meanwhile i was feeling absolutely terrible but back then i still cared enough to be embarrassed and never let on how weird i felt and how much it was ruining my life.
1552,"Every thought i had i questioned like ""did i used to think like this?"
1553,am i different then i was?
1554,"is this normal?"""
1555,"I felt super out of it all the time like everything wasnt real, i felt dull like i couldn't concentrate or like i wasn't thinking enough."
1556,"Eventually stuff got kind of ok, i still felt weird/dull but it wasnt as bad and  i started thinking about stuff in the shower that wasn't about how i felt weird or how i was scared."
1557,During that time though i still got a terrible feeling if i had to go somewhere in the next week or if i thought i had a health problem.
1558,I still worried about something constantly in the back of my head.
1559,Then about 10 months later do to alot of stomach problems(which was causing alot of worry) i had to have a colonoscopy.
1560,This caused me an INSANE amount of stress even though i knew it was no big deal i was freaking out and then i was up all night trying to drink the prep which made everything worse.
1561,I got home all whoozy from the twilight anesthesia and went to sleep.
1562,I woke up at like 11pm which isnt too crazy for me and went about my night normally until about 5 am when i started to feel super out of it again like i had when this first all started.
1563,I knew immediately that i was going to feel even worse for months and months and couldnt do anything but pace around freaking out.
1564,"After this i felt even worse then i did right after my first ""attack""."
1565,"Weird sensations all the time, having so much trouble going to sleep since being left alone to my thoughts without a distraction causes everything to get way worse,  i have no perception of how much time has passed, remembering something from an hour ago sometimes feels weird, like its from a week ago or something."
1566,i still feel like im almost drunk all the time like its too much work to think about something sometimes.
1567,Like ive just been living in a cloud of fog ever since this first happened.
1568,"Then i started feeling like i tipped over a point or something, suddenly i started losing all of my emotions and it feels like im losing connection to my body."
1569,"I can't tell what i like, i can't tell if something taste good, i can't tell if i feel sick, my heart beat feels far away and feint in my head."
1570,Thats when my brother finally got me to smoke weed for the first time with an old friend that was back in town about a week ago.
1571,I took 1 big hit and we started watching a movie which i dont remember anything from.
1572,I basically just sat there while my heart rate was getting faster and faster until suddenly i felt this terrible terrible feeling in my head like i was having a stroke or my head was exploding and i thought i was dying and i started freaking out and ended up going to the hospital again where the doctor brought up anxiety/panic attacks and since i had been there before about a year ago without anything showing up i was discharged with instructions to see a therapist.
1573,Also i had just taken my anti seizure medicine before leaving for my friends house so i guess that rules that out.
1574,"This last week has just been me getting worse and worse, that feeling in my head comes and goes and i can feel my body panicking but in my head i still don't feel anything."
1575,The distant feeling is causing my more and more distress which is probably making the distant feeling be there in the first place.
1576,I feel like a zombie and trying to sleep is absolutely terrifying.
1577,ive been having super vivid dreams and i think i had sleep paraylsis for the first time last night.
1578,The feeling in my head feels like its seeped into my brain and turned into agitation like i just want to flail around or run i cant explain it.
1579,And then i started thinking about brain lessions/strokes again and i can't stop thinking about how one side of my face feels weird even though i know its from panicking/anxiety.
1580,Theres no relief from feeling scared/nothing/agitated anywhere.
1581,Everything i look at just makes me want to scream.
1582,Then this morning i had a doctors appointment with my family doctor just to get advice about everything and maybe some suggestions for therapist and to make sure it was actually anxiety/panic.
1583,Then i got in a 3 car accident on the way there because of an old person who didnt realize he was running a red light and my car is totaled so my doctors appointment got delayed until tomorrow and i don't know if i can make it.
1584,So here i am sitting here with all these weird feelings in my head hoping i don't die or have brain damage from a stroke even though this has happened before to a lesser extent and they didnt find anything.
1585,I still want to go to the hospital but i know i'd just get discharged again with nothing and my mom says its definately just anxiety and wont take me but i feel like im going to die.
1586,My thoughts feel so far away and everything seems so drained of life and meaningless.
1587,"everything seems to be coated in gray that just makes me ""feel"" scared."
1588,I can't find comfort in anything and have to wait another like 14 hours to go to the doctor who will probably tell me to go see someone else in like a week.
1589,I don't know what to do.
1590,Sitting around trying to browse reddit just makes me feel even worse that i don't feel anything anymore.
1591,I can't take this feeling of being seperated from my emotions/thoughts and everything else in the world.
1592,I don't want to die i don't want to live i don't know what to do.
1593,I just wish i could go to sleep for 6 months and hope i feel better when i wake up.
1594,im not even sure why im writing this.
1595,its giving me something to do i guess.
1596,"im so lost, i feel like im out of options theres no relief theres nothing."
1597,I feel so awful its impossible to even want to get it fixxed since its stressful and seems hopeless.
1598,i don't know how a therapist will help since my thoughts seem to have no effect on my body or my mood or how i feel.
1599,i can't imagine ever feeling normal again.
1600,"im just sitting here not even able to cry hoping im not currently getting irreversable brain damage, questioning ever thought i have, feeling like im a level above my body and all my thoughts/emotions like i trapped outside but can look in through the window and see them."
1601,help me
1602,2 have said it could've been the mixture of meds I was given after my car accident.
1603,They never really found a medication that has worked for me.
1604,A lot of side effects wore off as the weeks went by and the medication worked it's magic.
1605,"For about a week and a half, after the meds had time to set itself, I felt amazing."
1606,"I've been struggling with general anxiety fpr quite some time now, and I've been getting professional help without medication for the past year."
1607,"For the first time, after getting my medicine, I have an anxiety attack and needed the xanex."
1608,"I never thought my anxiety would get this bad, and xanex is an addictive medicine."
1609,"My mom doesnt know I went to the doctor and got my medicine, but I feel better."
1610,I started medicine recently but it hasn't been long enough to kick in.
1611,I have diagnosed anxiety and depression issues along with Fibromyalgia and Rheumatoid Arthritis.
1612,Up until September I had been receiving psychological counseling and was on Celexa and Ativan  to treat my anxiety and depression and it was being managed decently well.
1613,"I lost my insurance and could not afford my medication, so over the course of a month-2 months, I halved my dose and then halved it again until I ran out."
1614,I have been without if for a few months now and my anxiety and depression are getting out of control.
1615,I find it very hard to get out of bed.
1616,I feel sick as soon as I wake up and I'll lay in bed and cry and not want to do anything.
1617,I get anxiety attacks before/during work and it has caused my work performance as well as attendance to drop.
1618,"Along with racing heart, sweating, trembling, etc, I will literally get sick to my stomach and vomit from anxiety, and I have been loosing weight because it is hard for me to eat."
1619,"Eating has become one of my most dreaded daily chores because food NEVER sounds appealing even when I'm really hungry, and I have to fight the urge to throw up with every bite and I feel sick for hours after."
1620,"I have been finding it very hard to interact with my friends normally as well as I often feel uncomfortable and can't really let loose or have ""fun"" and I often just want to stay home."
1621,"I feel like I have nothing to add to conversations but complaints about how bad I feel, and it's really hard to relate to anyone."
1622,"I've been dating a guy and I really like him, but I haven't been able to talk to him about what's going on because I feel very embarrassed by it, but that only makes really difficult when (for example) I get sick from anxiety on a date and can't eat/have to run to the bathroom, or cancel our plans all together because I'm stuck in downward spiral of anxiety and can't stop crying/running to the bathroom."
1623,I've just been saying it's a really bad winter and I must be getting every stomach bug.
1624,I know as soon as I get back on my medicine I'll be fine again and I'm afraid of scaring off a guy I really like early on in our relationship.
1625,"I got my approval letter for insurance, but my coverage does not start until March 1st so I can begin my medications again and get back on track, however that is still awhile away and I'm having a hell of a time in the mean time."
1626,I know it's only a few weeks but every single day is a struggle and I feel like I'm just at the end of my rope here.
1627,"I already regularly practice meditation and other anxiety reduction techniques from my counseling, and try more alternative things like aromatherapy and some over the counter natural anxiety remedies, and while it helps a little big, I'm just counting down the days until I have insurance again."
1628,I never would have believed what a physical nightmare anxiety can really be until I experienced it myself.
1629,"My question is, has anyone else withdrawn from this medication?"
1630,"Being the anxious person I am I've googled every horror story involving meds but I've gotten to the point where I have a lot of stress coming up (in med school, boards are in 5 months) and I've finally let my pDoc prescribe me something."
1631,So being on the medicine doesn't bother me at all.
1632,Im afraid of switching medication and it not working.
1633,"I may take my medicine a few hours early and head to bed, or not."
1634,I don't want to go off of the meds because they help so much and I'd rather be spacy all the time than be extremely depressed and have anxiety/panic attacks.
1635,Hi fellow anxiety sufferers ...
1636,I need help.
1637,"I've never been diagnosed, but I've suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember."
1638,Over the years it kind of ebbs and flows but I've always been able to keep it together on my own and I had always hoped that I would never need medication.
1639,"Lately, the last 6 months maybe, I've felt worse and worse."
1640,I started having serious abdominal pain earlier this year and even ended up in the emergency room for a day.
1641,"I've been to my Nurse Practitioner's office 3-4 times this year for all kinds of tests for the pain and when nothing was found, I was sent to a gastroenterologist who diagnosed IBS and prescribed a smooth muscle relaxer, which I've been taking for a month."
1642,It's not really helping (yet).
1643,My mental health has deteriorated dramatically in this time.
1644,I'm afraid I'm slipping into depression.
1645,"This is as bad as I can handle - I think I really, really need help."
1646,"I'm not sure what - therapy, counseling, medications, whatever ..."
1647,I can't go on like this.
1648,I live in the US and have health insurance.
1649,Where do I go for help?
1650,Do I schedule another appointment with my NP and ask him for a referral to someone?
1651,Do I just pick a psychiatrist/psychologist off the list provided by my insurance and contact the therapist directly?
1652,Do I start with my insurance company?
1653,What do I need to do?
1654,"At any rate, I was on some anti-anxiety medication (paxil and later, lorazepam) from the ages between 16 and 23 (I'm 27/m now)."
1655,Originally I began medication because a friend of mine took his life when I was in highschool.
1656,"I didn't want to go back on medication because I was slowly getting off of it, but I thought it was best."
1657,Should I be going back on medication?
1658,"I was thinking of seeing a psychologist, especially because I am very hesitant to use medicine."
1659,Neither do I want to start on some meds.
1660,Do you think getting medication can be a good start?
1661,I don't know do meds for anxiety really work and change you or they are just blocking the symptoms or something like that...
1662,I don't want to be put back on any sort of medication.
1663,I had really slipped when things started to get pretty bad and then took a year off... came back this year and finally was diagnosed and on the way to get my meds sorted out.
1664,I've been through different meds but never quite found the perfect one.
1665,"I've been off meds for a year and a half after a terrible experience with desvenlafaxine, but now I've gone through a major life change and my symptoms are starting to overwhelm me again."
1666,I think it's time to get back to meds for a while.
1667,"Haven't done it since I went off the meds, but it always goes through my head."
1668,"I also have ADHD but have decided to not take meds for that, since they made my anxiety worse."
1669,"I've been seeing a therapist for awhile at a clinic, and she recommended seeing the resident Psychiatrist to get meds, so today I finally went."
1670,I'm not on any meds other than Progesterone only birth control pills and the Ativan I just took when I got home.
1671,"For this instance, its because her father is visiting and he hounds her about her meds and such."
1672,"Fast forward a bit more (after my train breakdown incident and letting go of crappy ADD meds) I recall quite often, at night being in bed with my girlfriend and watching ONCE AGAIN the door."
1673,My medical record was finally reviewed by a psychiatrist which then switched my meds completely.
1674,First time taking this heavy of meds
1675,I should've started weeks ago but I've got a fear of medication (I hate not knowing what reaction I could have with substances as I have an unknown allergy that almost killed me in the past.)
1676,"My main fear of this medication is because my ""allergies"" are now so broad that I know that these pills will set me off, but my doctor has told me just to keep going regardless of what they do to me."
1677,"Has anybody else experienced increased allergies as a result of anxiety, or noticed an improvement with medication?"
1678,"Alright I more I read this subreddit, the more I feel like I might need some real help."
1679,I have to schedule a yearly doc visit anyway and I think I need to talk to them.
1680,Here a rant if you want to know more about my symptoms.
1681,"TL;DR 
Below

**Rant**  


--I am 24(F) and I still have my learner’s permit."
1682,"I live in Central Florida and if you know anything about it, its big, the public transportation sucks, and it’s full of crazy ass drivers."
1683,It’s nice to know that I am not the only one that seems to have this issue.
1684,I feel like it might help to actually spend the money on a professional driving instructor because I will be less inclined to freak the hell out in front of a stranger.
1685,"Still, haven’t been able to actually get up and call one of these places and usually just make up another excuse to why I don’t."
1686,--I had a job interview the other day.
1687,I cried for 3 hours before the interview and I can’t even pin out why.
1688,I actually managed to keep my cool once I got there and I got the job.
1689,Now my new problem is that I lose all ability if someone is watching me and turn in to a clumsy moron but I can usually keep up otherwise.
1690,"Of course, then I can’t help but dwell on the fact that I just messed up something I have done perfectly freaking seconds ago."
1691,--My poor boyfriend.
1692,I’ve broken down and freaked out about our relationship more than once.
1693,At this point I don’t even know what’s justified and what’s not but I am pretty sure I am once again overthinking everything and am in danger of crossing the overly attached girlfriend status which makes my anxiety even worse.
1694,"I shouldn’t worry about whether my boyfriend actually loves me or not, that fact that he puts up with my shit is proof enough."
1695,"**TL;DR**  
I am tired of stressing out my boyfriend and having him drive me everywhere and I hate always feeling like I have to puke, and that my heart is always racing."
1696,I want to be done with freaking out over regular everyday normal human crap.
1697,"I am tired of feeling helpless, sleepless nights, and crying."
1698,Why do I always have to cry?
1699,It’s a never ending circle.
1700,I can’t even enjoy drinking anymore (not that it good for me anyway) as I usually break down emotionally 10x.
1701,"I have never been diagnosed or treated, am I a candidate for medication (what about side effects, possibly with birth control)?"
1702,Are there medications that I should flat out avoid?
1703,I should try non-med therapy?
1704,"I am already getting anxious about talking to the doctor, what do I say?"
1705,I don’t want him to think I am just trying to get a prescription.
1706,Can a “primary care” doctor even do anything or just send me elsewhere?
1707,I will probably not have health insurance by the end of the year (fml) so I want to take action while I can afford it.
1708,Thank you for reading all this crap.
1709,I've finally come to terms with the fact that I need meds...for whatever reason it bothers me greatly to go on meds.
1710,"I've studied psychology (just graduated with a degree in it, actually) and I know anxiety can be the same thing as diabetes; both can be manageable with no medication, but sometimes meds are necessary."
1711,I'm terrified that any medication I go on will make me gain weight.
1712,"After trying to cope with meditation and other methods, I feel as though I would benefit from seeing a psychiatrist and receiving some short lasting medication, and was wondering how medicine has helped anyone in a similar situation to me."
1713,I know the dangers of becoming addicted to benzos etc...I just want to know how medicine has or has not helped any of you.
1714,I sought CBT and took meds for this particular conundrum before but honestly just want someone to talk to that gets it rather than another terrified look and unnecessary apology for my situation.
1715,"* I’d tell my other sister she needs medication for her depression

* I’d wear my diapers proudly and without fear

* I would fix people’s computers and bill them, for the obscene amount of money I deserve

* tell the CEO how much she hurts me when she bullies me

* be alone with my own brain for a day

* Have a conversation with a stranger

[update] In the light of day, some of these seem extra crazy (I should be afraid) and many seem like 'i could do that'."
1716,"Basically I'm schizophrenic, and while my psychiatrist and care worker will give me help and meds for the psychosis, they don't seem to care about the anxiety attacks that I experience daily, and everywhere."
1717,"I guess the point of this is do I need some kind of anti-anxiety medication, temporarily?"
1718,"I try to do all the stuff I'm supposed to do to calm myself and change my thinking (therapy, changing self talk, mindfulness, meditation, medication, exercise, etc.)."
1719,"Since I did that, I went about 3 days where the meds weren't seeming as effective, but that has seemed typical that every two weeks around the same time I'd have a few days like that."
1720,"Now they're effective again but now I'm back to where the effects will fade over night and I feel okay, but I don't feel ""great"" until about an hour after I take the meds."
1721,I know it's a side effect of the medication but it brought back that intense fear from anxiety that I'm dying and no one will know hecause I'm the only one who's awake.
1722,So I'm wondering for those who suffer from similar situations what was your bodies reaction to the treatment/medication.
1723,I honestly have no idea about any anxiety meds or anything...
1724,I have meds but meds are meds (in other words I still feel this anxiety) &amp; I don't have enough ativans to keep popping them over the next 10 days or so.
1725,I'm considering going back on meds.
1726,"A giant part of why I'm anxious about seeing a psychiatrist is I've been misdiagnosed before, and been on the wrong meds."
1727,I went to counseling for two years and on medication for two years as well.
1728,I don't want to go back on medicine.
1729,"First off, im not a doctor or mental professional, im just a regular dude."
1730,I uses to suffer from social anxiety disorder and ADD/ADHD.
1731,My anxiety was caused by ADD problems and getting bored of social situations in general.
1732,I fixed my ADD problems and as a result my anxiety decreased so low that i dont have to suffer anymore.
1733,"I have an anxiety disorder and attention problems, the difference is that i dont suffer anymore."
1734,"Okay so anyway, this might be helpful to people that read a lot about anxiety and their causes and potential treatments or people that are just curious."
1735,I am going to list some thoughts or ideas in list format.
1736,"Number 1: it is COMPLETELY normal to feel anxious, but it is NEVER okay to feel overwhelmed, be aware of that."
1737,Number 2: there are many potential causes for anxiety and dysfunctional behaviors and EVERYONE suffering from an 'anxiety disorder' has a ROOT cause.
1738,"It could be a combination of genetic susceptibility, poor diet, lack of exercise, adrenal fatigue, nutritional deficiencies like (magnesium), very poor sleep, emotional trauma or excessive emotional stress."
1739,"Chances are if you suffer from an anxiety disorder, you NEED to fix all of these areas with TIME."
1740,"Number 3: you will never fix an emotional problem from 8 in the morning to 8 in the night, think LONG TERM."
1741,"Number 4: the reality is, is if ur burned out, chances are you'll need 1 to 2 months to turn to the other side by INCORPORATING positive habits that are good for treating the disorder."
1742,Number 5: a brain fog is a dangerous state to be in because you are being attacked by ur mind and you have no defenses to protect urself from self inflicted emotional harm.
1743,"Number 6: the reality is HORMONES are everything, balance ur hormones, balance ur life."
1744,"Number 7: ELIMINATE ALL refined carbs like white bread, ALL yeast, ALL high fructose corn syrup, ALL simple carbs."
1745,"If you want keep eating any meat or vegetables, but moderate the fatty foods you eat like fried chicken (which is NOT as devilish as the carbs and yeast i mention above."
1746,Simple and refined carbs are PUBLIC ENEMY NO 1.
1747,"Number 8: the first days are very difficult after cutting sugar(carbs), you will feel dead."
1748,"Take about 3 to 7 days to incorporate healthy complex carb eating, protein, and fats."
1749,Number 9: Diet is CRUCIAL for anxiety issues.
1750,"Eat more nuts, vegetable, and fruits."
1751,Number 10: people with ADD/ADHD like me that dont take stimulant medications NEED exercise!
1752,For people with anxiety disorders this is also the case!!
1753,Number 11: sleep is very important!!
1754,"Buy a sleeping mask because the slightest light can inhibit HGH, an important hormone!"
1755,Number 12: Fast!
1756,Fasting for 24 hrs boosts HGH 2000% in men and 1300% in women.
1757,"It is a crucial hormone, especially for people that are susceptible to internal damage like people with anxiety disorders."
1758,"Number 13: give urself some love and buy a multivitamin, magnesium supplement, fish oil supplement, and the chances are that ur digestive system is off because of constantly being in fight or flight so buy probiotic lactobacillus GG from culturelle which is a good brand."
1759,"I drink 1 multi a day, 650mg Mg, 6 fish oil pills (for ADHD), and 20 billion bacteria which equates to 2 pills of probiotic."
1760,Number 14: get sum vitamin D!
1761,Expose urself to the sun daily at ur discrepancy because it is reported that people are happier than people who stay indoors.
1762,"If u dont have a sun, get urself some more pills to get vitamin d into ur system."
1763,Number 15: shower with epsom salt.
1764,It relaxes ur body because ur body absorbs highly the magnesium found in the product.
1765,"Number 16: to fix ur brain, you must fix ALL addictions to become happier."
1766,Addictions highjack the dopaminergic system and decreases pleasure for regular activities like socializing and such.
1767,Number 17: isolation is the key to anxiety.
1768,"U can be alone, but not lonely."
1769,"Happiness can only be found within, but having social interaction is crucial because we are hardwired for being in human contact."
1770,"Even being in another persons presence is enough, dont hide urself inside a room."
1771,Number 18: meditating for 30 minutes for 8 weeks can increase ur hypothalamus.
1772,This is crucial for people with adhd and anxiety disorders because most people with those conditions tend to have smaller than avg.
1773,"this area of the brain is responsible for the important factors of LEARNING, MEMORY, and EMOTION."
1774,Number 19: practice abdominal breathing exercises for at least 10 minutes a day.
1775,"This helps the oxygenation of ur cells, and decreases stress hormones."
1776,Number 20: never put urself in a situation that is overwhelming for u because this reinforces ur anxiety.
1777,Number 21: relax the most u can.
1778,"The more relaxed u are the better, but in work and school those are not the perfect places to be relaxing because ur brain needs to be making complex decisions that are for the most part absent in a relaxed, alpha wave state."
1779,Note: all genius ideas come from an alpha wave state.
1780,"Number 22: in small chunks, expose urself to the smallest things that u are anxious about."
1781,Number 23: relaxing the muscles is crucial for people that are always on high alert.
1782,"An easy way is drugs, but the best way is thru yoga, stretching, and others to relax ur muscles."
1783,"TRUST ME, relax all ur muscle, it is IMPOSSIBLE to feel anxious."
1784,Number 24: many people have laughter or crying deficiencies.
1785,Try laughter yoga with a group or by urself and laugh at the stupidest moments of life.
1786,Number 25: hygiene is important.
1787,"Number 26: fix ur hair, body, and appearance to a cleaner, better looking you."
1788,"Number 27: everyone has root insecurities about themselves, the problem is not having them but suffering from them."
1789,How do u not suffer if u have insecurities?
1790,Self awareness of course!
1791,How do u develop that?
1792,"In general, Positive habits and the original mindfulness meditation!"
1793,Number 28: in the end all the positive habits  form more emotional freedom within urself and that is the key to freeing urself from the belligerence of mental disorders.
1794,"Number 29: dont be blind by success, stay true to u and keep doing what ur doing and keep away from being blinded by others admiration."
1795,"Number 30: not all of these tips will apply to u and as with everything, not everything is for everyone."
1796,Apply what is suitable to u and make ur own personal program.
1797,Hey guys im just tryn to help and i know how debilitating it is living like crap.
1798,I went from being a pile of **** to living like my own prince.
1799,"This program is for LIFE, but you should see 90% improvement within 2 months in ur living conditions."
1800,"There will be times where u just want to throw in the towel, but those are the times that u have to dig deep and keep pushing."
1801,"Inertia is hard to move, but once u have the momentum everything becomes much easier all of the sudden."
1802,"There will be times where u are doing everything right and everything goes south, thats a very bad feeling, but in the end it pays off."
1803,"The worse you feel during ur recovery period, the better because in time u will feel equally, but in the positive direction."
1804,"My recommendations are meditation 30 a day, aerobic exercise 30 a day, supplements listed above, restricted eating habits, sleeping better, better social connections and so on."
1805,Also i recommend at least 1 month off of EVERYTHING to fire the inertia into the right direction.
1806,After that it is much easier to keep going the momentum during school or work related occupations.
1807,"Okay a little about me: 

Went thru worst bouts of social anxiety."
1808,"Now after 2 months worth of recovery time i feel 90% better, if not 95%."
1809,"I have other ideas i didnt mention, but if i did write them id write a novel."
1810,"I love people, and i especially want others to succeed, especially when other people dont understand how diabolical anxiety disorders are."
1811,I want to write a book on anxiety and make a website someday about it to help millions of people suffering from anxiety disorders.
1812,"In the end if nothing works dont be afraid of getting medical help, even if drug therapy is a definite option."
1813,"The reality is that drugs help, but they wont fix ur problems, but they set the stage for u to fix them."
1814,Being on drugs under medical supervision is potentially a very good way to incorporate and shape ur positive lifestyle.
1815,"You can do it without drugs, but remember, you always have AN OPTION to get BETTER."
1816,Love to all
1817,"It's been about a year now on the meds, and my anxiety and obsessive thoughts have been basically null."
1818,"Hey guys, I've never been/lurked in this subreddit before, so sorry if this is the wrong spot to post this but I just needed some advice."
1819,"So my SO is currently on the highest dosage of Cipralex (Idk what dosage that would be, I think she said 20mg?"
1820,"I dont remember), and has been for a year now."
1821,"We've been together since November, and she's opened up to me about it in February."
1822,"We haven't had sex many times, but her sex drive is pretty much non existent, and she has never orgasmed before in her entire life (in HS she felt guilty about it, and the was on AD's so she never got a chance to)."
1823,"Things aren't that great sex wise because her AD prevent her from feeling anything down there (we've tried oral, fingering, sex toys, etc)."
1824,"Now, don't get me wrong, I'm totally supportive of her being on ADs and have never pressured her to change medications or stop taking them, because sex isnt important enough for me to make her stop taking something that makes her feel normal, and good."
1825,"It's just something we talked about together, and she's considered changing medications because nothing else was helping her orgasm."
1826,She has an appointment next week with her doctor so she's going to talk to the doc about switching and even lowering her dosage.
1827,She's nervous of lowering her dosage though because she's scared she'll go back to the place she was in before.
1828,"I asked if she feels ready to lower her dosage and she says she does, but she's scared that if she goes back to being depressed, she'll be tempted to shut everyone out because when you're depressed, even irrational thoughts seem rational (her words)."
1829,"I don't know if this is a thing but, I'm wondering if her worrying about going back to her depressive state, will make her over think things, and actually cause her to start seeing symptoms again."
1830,"I realise it must be so scary to have to take that big step and start lowering your dosage because you're slowly letting go of something you've been relying on to feel normal and happy, so I don't blame her for being a little nervous."
1831,"(IDK if i'm making her sound paranoid, she actually isn't, I think her level of nervous is normal)."
1832,"Anyways, I was wondering if there's anything I should do to make her feel comfortable with this; I want to do anything I can to support her."
1833,I've never been in this situation before so I don't know what the right thing to say or do is.
1834,"I've told her that I will always be there for her to support her, especially if she starts feeling that way, and if I ever sense her shutting people/me out I will help her go back to her counsellor so they can give her the help she needs."
1835,"Also, since she's on a higher dosage of Cipralex, would she have weird effects when changing her medication to something that's a little more libido-friendly?"
1836,"I know you guys aren't doctors, I just want to get an idea of what to expect, and maybe pass on some info to her too."
1837,Thanks guys :)
1838,"So I've posted here before and thankfully have been helped out quite a bit and made an amazing recovery in a short span of 3 months from my anxiety(only took meds a handful of times ) and it was great, for that I will always be thankful to this subreddit, but today and the past three days I've been feeling these symptoms and would like an opinion:
New symptoms not present before:
-Pain in left arm (only began today) and it went away after a few hours, has not returned
-the feeling of something stuck in my throat permanently 
-my limbs go numb really fast when I sleep on them (never used to)
-very constipated(I get enough fiber and drink lots of water)
-my throat feels incredibly dry all the time even after a healthy dose of water throughout the day 
Returning symptoms:
-the feeling of my heart dropping in my chest 
-churning stomach as If I were nervous all the time
-shortness of breath

Last time this happened I had a handful of EKGs done and all looked fine, I'm keeping my meds and aspirin at hand when I sleep in case of emergency but this is driving me insane, I keep having paranoid thoughts of an impending heart attack."
1839,"I'm worried about working tomorrow because I don't want to have to take meds while on the job, or if I will be allowed to at all."
1840,"Only side effects have been some yawning, a little dry mouth but i can still wank and i still feel horny just takes a little longer but it's better as i was wanking like 5 times a day before

so ill hopefully give an update in a month too see where i am and how im going

also starting a nice execrise and diet program on monday to shed that 10kg's i want and get a sixpack for summer yew

feeling good people, id suggest trying medication for those at are afraid it may work for you so don't look for reviews online because if i listened to them i'd say nope wont work and wouldn't be enjoying myself as i am now."
1841,"I'm not sure if the meds are speeding things along, or if I'm just THAT out of shape."
1842,"Since that happened, I figured I would go and see a professional about medication."
1843,"However, I have had this compulsive thought that I have obsessed over for about 3-4 years (I have been taking medication for OCD since kindergarten, same dosage, just fyi) and it is very hard to describe; I just keep thinking about how I don't get how I can move my body, like just all of a sudden I'm moving my body and I don't know how I am doing that, and then that makes me afraid that I am not going to be able to move my body or something and it just keeps on going like that."
1844,Should I try to back off the Xanax and talk to my doctor about getting my OCD medication upped?
1845,"Usual coping strategies:

* yoga 2-3 times per week

* relaxation exercises before bed

* setting small goals for daily progress (like, get dressed upon waking)

* adequate &amp; restful sleep

* taking my supplements daily (not currently on medication other than BC, which lessens my mood swings)

* planned social outings with a couple friends at a time (not spontaneous - I always know who, what, when, and where)

So my overall strategy is to focus on my thesis and get that done, but I've been having anxiety attacks every couple nights as I'm going to bed, and I won't get to sleep until 2 or 3am, which has created this cycle of sleeping in and then not being productive that day."
1846,I have never been officially diagnosed but I tried out a few meds from a doctor with no luck a few years ago and tried a therapist.
1847,I did a therapy and got daily medication (which I still take today).
1848,"I have an ""emergency medication"" for those moments, lorazepam (I think in the US it's compareable with *Ativan* or *Orfidal*) but I can't take that every time I'm feeling striked by a slightly but constant panic-attack."
1849,Anyway starting to feel like maybe zoloft/meds in general are not for me.
1850,"Just a few years ago, after graduating college I had a steady job, great relationships with friends and pretty good relationships with family."
1851,"Although I didn't love my job and I was a bit shy like I have been my whole life, overall I was happy with my life."
1852,I worked out five days a week and lived an active lifestyle.
1853,"And then two years ago I went to the ER for a panic attack (well, like many of you can probably relate to I thought I was having a heart attack and a stroke simultaneously but it was a panic attack)."
1854,"The doctor at the ER gave me a prescription for Ativan, told me to take three a day and like the naive person I was back then I did."
1855,And then just  three weeks later when my prescription ran out because of a holiday I couldn't refill it I went through a weekend of physical and mental hell as I had unwittingly become addicted to benzodiazepines.
1856,"For a long time the fact that the dangers and extreme addictive nature of these drugs was never explained to me made me extremely angry, and there are times when I still get pretty upset about it because if I knew then what I know now I wouldn't have touched that bottle with a ten foot pole, but overall I'm trying to focus on getting better and holding onto that anger is counterproductive as far as that goes."
1857,"Anyway, I'm rambling a bit but almost three years later I've gone from Ativan to Xanax to Klonopin which I've currently been on for the better part of a year."
1858,"I've been prescribed many other medications which had little to no benefit and I've seen several psychologists, social workers and psychiatrists, some better than others but none of whom who could ""fix"" or even really help at all with my declining mental state as the panic, anxiety and depersonalization pretty much took over."
1859,"Since that first trip to the ER I've made seemingly tens more when the panic is too much to take, I've been unable to hold onto a job and lately I've been struggling with agoraphobia to the point of sometimes being uncomfortable leaving the house and extremely uncomfortable in social situations with lots of people (something that I've never experienced."
1860,"I usd to be able to take four hour drives to visit my girlfriend at the time and now driving around the corner has become extremely difficult and driving on highways or in traffic leaves me with full blown panic attacks, whether I'm on klonopin or not."
1861,Most days I just want to stay inside but then that just makes me feel worse because I'm not pursuing my goals of starting a career and a family like many of my friends are doing.
1862,My question to those of you who have been where I'm at or are currently in a similiar situation is: how to you find the strength and determination to power through when your symptoms are horribly unpleasant?
1863,Any legitimate tips or even personal success stories would be welcome.
1864,I'm trying to remember that this will pass but sometimes it's just very easy to get overwhelmed by it all.
1865,Tl;Dr - Anxiety and panic attacks have progressively gotten worse and I find the symptoms so scary and unpleasant that I've started avoiding dealing with them which in the long run just makes them worse.
1866,Looking for tips and/or advice from people who have been or are currently in a situation similiar to mine.
1867,"They prescribed me synthroid, and it put my mind at ease, knowing that finally, these meds will help this awful feeling go away."
1868,I also really don't want to go on any SSRI's or anti-anxiety meds.
1869,Except medication.
1870,"Anyway is that unheard of, reduced anxiety due to taking anti inflamm meds?"
1871,He said that he was on medication now and desperately wanted to reintegrate into society.
1872,"And I really feel legitimately scared - even if he is now on medication and has his illness under control, I still feel that somebody who has committed such a severe crime is a danger to me and to other women."
1873,So I had an appointment with an actual doctor today.
1874,He has recommend I go on medication.
1875,However he recommended I wait and make a decision in a few weeks.
1876,"This is also so he can closely monitor me, since the school health center is closed until the 8th."
1877,The two medications of choice are Lexapro or Celexa.
1878,Was curious what everyone's experiences was with both.
1879,What did you like?What did you not like?
1880,"Hello,

Before I met my girlfriend I had such bad insomnia."
1881,I'd get such little sleep most nights and my life just felt like a blur.
1882,After panic attacks when I was a kid and the stress my parents caused me I'd cry so many days through middle school and high school.
1883,"I never felt as ""alive"" as I wanted, just that everything I did was an automatic response.. And my mind would race always, I'd never have a moment of like relaxation."
1884,My heart always beat so fast and I constantly felt like I was wasting time or I felt nervous.
1885,But when I met my girlfriend.
1886,I could finally be myself.
1887,I slept so soundly.
1888,"I felt alive, I appreciated so much more in life."
1889,I made all the improvements I wanted and moved past my self image problems and anxiety.
1890,I felt so deeply in love and happiness.
1891,I looked forward to every day.
1892,"Now that I'm in college, and we go to different schools..."
1893,"It's all just come back, all of those problems."
1894,"And I feel like a robot sometimes, or in a haze, and I'm just not myself."
1895,I love her immensely and I can't ever lose her.
1896,I want to be a good boyfriend and never mean or an ass but my emotions just make me someone I'm not and I'm trying to get a better hold of them.
1897,"I had tried marijuana awhile before, in high school, without her knowing..."
1898,I thought she'd think I was cool (I was a naive teenager) but she was so heartbroken when she found out.
1899,"After I did it once, I felt really great about my life."
1900,"And not just during the high, after too."
1901,It was such a mind opening experience.
1902,"I realized after getting high a few weeks later, through some introspection that I needed to stop."
1903,I had talks with her about it while I was doing to see if she'd think it would be okay.
1904,"She was sort of negative towards it but I just listened to myself, she had to be okay with it!"
1905,"So, I did it anyway, ""how could she and so many people have such a negative opinion of something so good?""."
1906,"I felt like marijuana clicked with my brain more than most, I was so ecstatic, it felt amazing, unreal."
1907,It was almost a religious experience.
1908,What??
1909,I thought stoners were just like loser skateboarder/video game playing teenagers who did badly in school.
1910,I felt like I had finally reached my potential.
1911,The couch locking mind numbing effects?
1912,None of that.. My mind was alive.
1913,"I later found out this was a ""sativa"" strain, which are very stimulating."
1914,"Wow, I never knew about any of this."
1915,"I always wanted to try marijuana, but I never wanted to do it often."
1916,"I have read so many positive things about it, so I decided to try it."
1917,I knew the risk of addiction was relatively low and it was more of a habitual/dependency thing (which I guess is a lot like addiction).
1918,"But I have good self control, I could go without anything I think."
1919,But now for the one thing I can't go without.
1920,My girlfriend.
1921,"We had never had a single problem, argument, conflict, ANYTHING besides about marijuana."
1922,"She just had very strong opinions against it, and I really made a huge mistake there, hiding something from her."
1923,"There's nothing else I'd hide from her, I love her with all my soul."
1924,"When I went off to college I felt depressed, anxious, almost suicidal."
1925,My grades weren't the best.
1926,"I didn't have many friends, I didn't like what people did on weekends."
1927,"I got stressed out when my girlfriend went out on weekends, and I wasn't being as good to her as what she deserves."
1928,My girlfriend suggested I see the counsellor.
1929,"I did, and I realized I just have to help myself, but that she (the counsellor) would help me accomplish that."
1930,"We made some progress, but after the happy talks I always felt sad a day later."
1931,"After a month of meetings, my counsellor said I don't seem like I need to meet regularly anymore, and that I was welcome to come back whenever."
1932,"Now, I knew people who go on medication for anxiety+derealization/depersonalization+depression but I feel that I hear so much about those medications leaving the taker unfulfilled, with a void in their life."
1933,"That there are side effects of derealization, depression, suicide, emotional numbing."
1934,"I'm very emotional and I don't know if that's always a bad thing, I would only want my anxiety and sadness to change."
1935,People who use hard drugs to cope with problems never turn out well.
1936,And alcohol and tobacco can lead to a lot of mistakes and regrets.
1937,"My girlfriend kind of brought up, ""well if you want to try marijuana again, and be honest about it, that would be okay."""
1938,She is so amazing and understanding.
1939,"I had vowed to never try marijuana again, I loved it but I'd take my girlfriend over it any day."
1940,"I thought maybe her idea could work, and now that I don't have to hide it from her we won't have any problems."
1941,"Well, I tried it again (a different type of it) and it wasn't the same mind blowing experience, but it completely lifted my depression off, and threw away my anxious thoughts."
1942,The problem was she was really upset before and after I did it again.
1943,"And the next few days were great, well.. after the first few hours where she was sort of down about the whole thing."
1944,"I was never a mean person again, our relationship got along very well, we opened up to each other more and have more intimate talks over long distance."
1945,"The next weekend rolls around and I figured ""well she's going out with her friends, I'll see if it's okay with her if I try it again."""
1946,"And it upset her that I brought it up, and we talked for a long time with her being distant, and she said ""it's okay just do it I don't want you to be sad."""
1947,"And over the week she kept telling me ""it's okay, you can do it, it's you not me"" and I know that she's just saying that, but deep down it upsets her."
1948,"And I definitely can't allow myself to continue doing it if it upsets her, I just don't want it to upset her."
1949,"We've been together for a year, and have a better relationship than anyone we know."
1950,We talk about marriage and making it through college together all the time.
1951,She's going to try to transfer to my school next year.
1952,All of our other friends long distance college relationships have failed but ours.
1953,"Now, I just don't want to sound like a stoner or loser."
1954,"I am really on the right path, since I lifted my depression, I rose an F in chemistry to a B+, got A's on my engineering assignments, calculus assignments, English papers."
1955,I worked 14 hours on homework on a Saturday!
1956,And I did pretty much 12 hours of work every 5 days for the next few weeks.
1957,"I made 10$/hr online, I gained almost 10lbs of muscle from working out, I finally lifted more than I did when I played football in high school."
1958,I made new friends.
1959,I had a big appetite for the first time in my life.
1960,This was my big rebound from where I was.
1961,"I rarely had even spent 2 hours on homework in a night of high school, or ever studied for a test, and I was an A student taking AP classes with a high SAT score!"
1962,"I now do a weeks worth of high school homework/studying in a night, if not more."
1963,But I liked it!
1964,My friends who were off at different and sometimes more prestigious colleges than me tell me they party on weekdays and never do homework.
1965,"Their parents are so wealthy, millionaires, and they're expected to do the same with success?"
1966,"No way, the generation of hard working parents has led to lazy and unmotivated children."
1967,"So now I see myself, a once passive good student, now doing better and working way harder than all my friends."
1968,"It feels great, and me and my girlfriend are working so hard in our classes so that we have a great life ahead of us."
1969,I know marijuana isn't this cure-all magic drug.
1970,But it's helped me.
1971,And it still upsets my girlfriend whenever we talk about it or I say I want to do it.
1972,"I tell her every time she's upset I will quit and never do it again, but she doesn't want me to go back to being sad."
1973,"I know in the end that I have to just help myself, but this has helped me do that and whenever I show her the literature on it or explain how much better I've been doing she gets upset."
1974,"Every other moment we're not on the topic, life and our relationship is amazing, perfect, but it's on both of our minds all the time now."
1975,Is there any way I can make her comfortable with this or find some compromise?
1976,Or am I just a druggie and need to drop this little habit and help myself?
1977,"I want to know what to do, because all of my options just seem like they will cause a lot of conflict."
1978,Thank you so much for reading.
1979,I know this doesn't take the place of a therapist or actual counsellor but it would be nice to hear some opinions.
1980,"Here I am, no anxiety, no panic attacks, no medication, just a normal dude."
1981,It's my first time being prescribed any sort of medication so I'm a bit skeptical/worried on what to expect.
1982,Or is it just a fact that meds can only do so much when my head is full of screwed-up thinking that can't even be changed by understanding logic?
1983,I should also mention that I can't see my psych until June 8th and that the meds she suggested I adjust over the phone haven't been working.
1984,Should I seek out medical attention and maybe medication?
1985,"I want to stop, but more than I want to stop taking the medicine, I want the ANXIETY to stop."
1986,"I was first diagnosed and put on medication a little over 10 years ago, but I haven't been medicated for approximately 3 years due to lack of health insurance."
1987,"I wasn't able to fight through it over the past few weeks to have my records sent from old doc to new one, and now I'm worried that the new doc won't trust me when I tell her what meds to put me on (because I already know what works and what doesn't)."
1988,"I've never taken medication for my anxiety before (just therapy for coping mechanisms, it was very helpful overall) but I'm really considering making an appointment for that purpose, because I think my fear of losing this job may just turn into a self-fulfilling prophesy soon."
1989,Hooray for medication!
1990,"(Maybe I'm making up symptoms, what if medicine changes me, etc.)"
1991,I'm diagnosed adhd and take meds for it and my significant other is highly introverted.
1992,"A few years ago I was diagnosed officially with GAD, although I'm no longer on medication as it was too costly to keep going to the doctor's at the time."
1993,I should mention I have ADD and was taking medication for that as well.
1994,"Once DH got a better job and were doing better financially, I decided that I was sick of taking my meds."
1995,"The doctors determined that the diuretics had taken a toll on her kidneys and she could no longer be ""aggressively treated"" for her water retention problem, and the hallucinations were due to her medication poisoning her."
1996,"I have to be on medication for my ADHD before I start college next year, so thats extra money."
1997,I want to know if I should up my meds or try something completely different.
1998,I am considering meds to get me through but I just don't know.
1999,"It got better, when I first got properly diagnosed by a then-new doctor and put on appropriate medication."
2000,Ive been on meds of ADHD since I was in the 3rd grade and have been to therapy once before for masochism and anxiety.
2001,I do suffer from depression and I take meds for it at the moment.
2002,I have been a bit sloppy lately (bad sleep schedule leads to late mornings and outside of my routine taking meds is easy to forget).
2003,I take other medication as well but theres no interaction there.
2004,"Ive also tried benzo's without other meds and diazepam as well , same reaction."
2005,"As of yesterday, back on therapy, and meds (I hate that I'm on them, but we dicussed that they are for short term.)"
2006,Do people who have anxiety issues always seek medication or are there other ways of dealing with it?
2007,A glass of water and medicine.
2008,He upped my dosage of Lexapro from 10mg to 20mg and also prescribed this new medication in the title to take as needed.
2009,"**

Anyone have anything to say about this medication?"
2010,"I'm new to talking online about this and it really isn't helping how I feel, but my boyfriend wants me to try it out and get help."
2011,"I have GAD, social anxiety disorder and PTSD."
2012,I am not on medications because my mom doesn't want me getting hooked on them and I don't have a counsellor to talk to.
2013,The only person I am comfortable talking to is my boyfriend.
2014,I have been diagnosed since halfway through my grade eight year and I am now almost half way through grade ten.
2015,"I wanted to know what you guys do to help yourself with panic attacks, physical pains with anxiety, and anything that any of you occur with your anxiety."
2016,I really need help finding ways to cope.
2017,It would also be helpful if you could give a brief description of your symptoms that led you to medication.
2018,"My dad pretty much told me ""you shouldn't walk out of that office with some sort of medication""."
2019,"If I tell him that a few attacks have arisen due to weed, will that impact an ability to get some sort-of medicine?"
2020,Would revealing that weed has caused some (not all) of my panic attacks impact the possibility for some sort of medication?
2021,For about 5 years now my doctors (I've moved around) have suggested that I take anxiety medication.
2022,I've always refused medication.
2023,I'm very afraid to take medication.
2024,"Please, someone tell me that the meds don't make you numb."
2025,**TL;DR** I'm afraid of what getting on anxiety medication will do to me.
2026,"But recently I've discovered that my dad has anxiety too, and even was prescribed medication (my mom made it seem like it wasn't a huge deal) but after a while quit taking it because he ""didn't want to be propped up on it his whole life""."
2027,"I'm kind of scared to talk to my family or friends about it because they all think I'm a pretty well adjusted, happy person....and I don't want to blind side them with something crazy like this and freak them out......I feel like I need to go to a therapist and maybe get medication or something."
2028,But I don't know if there's any medication to deal with this kind of thing....and I really don't like the idea of medication but I'm not sure what else I can do.
2029,"Truthfully, I was in a much worse place mentally when I was taking that medication."
2030,Reassurance that its okay to give meds a try?
2031,"I don't plan on being on the meds for an extended period, just until I can get into some counseling and get things under control, until I learn to deal with my anxiety."
2032,This morning I woke up at 6:00 on my day off with the physical feeling that I was about to start a panic attack.... and then nothing happened.
2033,The feeling hasn't changed for the last 2 hours.
2034,"My heart is racing, my chest is tight, I feel that sensation of impending doom."
2035,It doesn't get better and the panic attack never starts.
2036,In the past 6 months I had to stop drinking caffeine because it made me feel the same way.
2037,I broke down and took a propranolol after calling my safe person (dad) didn't work.
2038,Now that I've taken it the physical sensations are subsiding but I feel that doom and gloom still.
2039,Does anybody else have experience with this?
2040,Should I talk to my Dr about changing medications?
2041,Is there something else that could be triggering it?
2042,I'm also nervous about medication because I write music and I am afraid of what it will do to that.
2043,I just wanted to point out the irony that adjusting to my anxiety meds has made me over the top anxious.
2044,"I had started taking medication weeks before this and it has completely made my thinking worse, and how I feel about things."
2045,"I panicked every single day and ended up texting her to remind her this isn't me, and it's the medicine that she even wanted me to take to help myself."
2046,"All but one of my friends just say ""be mentally stronger"" or tell me how bad medication is for me."
2047,Or should I try a different medication?
2048,"He doesn't realise it but he's very naturally against mental illness or medicine/tablets such as anti-depressants, it's just kinda of sub-conscious."
2049,"I'm seeing a doctor about it soon, i'm not on any medication currently and whether i need to be i don't know at all."
2050,should i get medication?
2051,I'm thinking now medication might be the next step.
2052,I don't really know if I'm seeking advice on medication or if I just need to vent but I'm not in a good place today.
2053,I don't like having to use medication because I think the cons outweigh the pros.
2054,"I've tried everything so far except medication, I'm sick of wanting to stay home, not spending time with friends, my poor boyfriend basically has to beg for even a kiss because I just feel like shit."
2055,"I stayed at my parents house for 3 days this past weekend and forgot to bring my medication with me, so the last time I took my pill was on Thursday night."
2056,(I'm a 23 year old Female.
2057,I'm not particularly sure what type of anxiety I have but it's mainly based around obligation and decision making.
2058,I currently do not take medicine to control anxiety as I have not had much success with medications.
2059,I do undergo therapy which is quite helpful.)
2060,I was wondering if anyone else had a similar issue with sleeping/ falling asleep?
2061,This has been going on consistently through therapy and various anxiety medications for essentially as long as I can remember.
2062,I have issues falling asleep at night.
2063,"I imagine the behavior at the core of it is having some sort of obligation the next day (school, work, house sitting, &amp;c) that I'm really not looking forward to."
2064,"As a result I can't seem to allow myself to relax because I know that activity will happen right after I wake up, and I feel like I will have to partake in it sooner perception-wise."
2065,"This minor stress fueled behavior turned into an anxiety driven behavior, that has since spread to nights where I do not have obligations the next day."
2066,"Such as right now, I don't work for too days, but I feel stressed about this obligation, and it is effecting my ability to settle down."
2067,"It has essentially become this weird thing that happens every night when I settle down, and it is dark outside, where I'm too anxious about the time in between obligations that I'm ""wasting"" sleeping to allow myself to relax enough to sleep."
2068,The problem is not prominent/non-existent during the day when I sleep or nap regardless of obligation.
2069,"On a similar note, if I know I need to be in bed asleep by a certain time, I have trouble getting to bed as well as falling asleep once I'm there."
2070,"I know I'm doing it, but it's almost a compulsion at this point."
2071,I can't seem to stop myself from stretching the time before bed out as far as possible.
2072,"That anxiety starts creeping up on me and then I feel like the stress is just radiating through my body, and I feel restless."
2073,"I used to find that exercise helps, but my worsening health has made exercise more difficult, and painful, so I've since had to limit what I can do."
2074,"I've been doing this about as long as I can remember, which admittedly is not that far back anymore."
2075,I was wondering if anyone had similar issues?
2076,"How have you personally been able to relax, or lessen this sort of pending doom type of anxiety."
2077,"I've been able to work through the majority of my anxiety through therapy, but this particular problem seems to be lingering."
2078,I was hoping some of my fellow redditors might have some techniques I can explore.
2079,I've just been put (just over two weeks) on the meds but it's the first time I've felt hopeful.
2080,I also plan on maybe getting medication sometime early next year if it continues.
2081,I was curious if anyone has gotten medication for it and if it's helpful.
2082,"At the age of 19 I was then put on Lexapro by my GP, then began seeing a psychiatrist soon after who continued me on the same meds."
2083,"So, long story short, I want to get off of SSRIs and all medication."
2084,I'm not currently on any medication but perhaps I should talk to my doctor about going on some.
2085,A few weeks ago I started taking medication for anxiety/depression.
2086,The first time I sat down to meditate after the medication started to kick in I was amazed…at how *freaking easy* meditation is now.
2087,I feel like my life is not genuine when I am on the medication.
2088,"I talked to my bishop and he said ""The Lord made medication to help us, this doesn't make you a weaker person""

My question and topic is."
2089,Should us who need medication just accept the fact that we need chemical help; or should we find a way to deal with it sans medication?
2090,About to start taking it and I've never been on any meds before.
2091,If needed though I will incorporate actual anxiety meds but im currently optimistic that Passionflower and CBT will help me overcome anxiety.
2092,"**NEEDLESS TO SAY**, DO NOT take with any other anxiety meds without talking to your doctor first."
2093,"She did some simple tests on me to rule out further testing for brain MRI's as I thought I had brain cancer/tumor but this one doctor could feel my worry and concern and instead of prescribing me medication (as all docs before her did), she told me to buy this book that only cost me $3.49 from amazon."
2094,I'm so terrified of being put on medication because I don't want to feel plastic.
2095,"Can you think of anything, outside of meds (a last resort option for me) that I could do to try to resolve this?"
2096,I have come to the personal conclusion that I am a burden to those who care about me.
2097,"I feel as though, due to my anxiety and depression, I have become nothing but a complaining, pessimistic, weight on people's shoulders."
2098,I find myself unable to mentally handle the most basic stressful situations on my own.
2099,I often over reacting and over thinking every little problem that happens in my life.
2100,"I have a hard time accepting compliments, I am quick to judge myself, and I am constantly second guessing myself."
2101,Even now I'm asking myself if I should even be posting this because I feel I'm burdening strangers with my problems.
2102,"I have been medicated, but then I get the thought process of ""I hate that I need medications to be normal."
2103,"I should be able to handle myself without pharmaceutical aid."""
2104,and quit them.
2105,"I feel like I'm, in the most literal sense of the phrase, losing my mind."
2106,"I can't find a way for rational thought process through simple tasks, and I panic, going into anxiety attacks."
2107,"This was happening here and there before, but now I feel like it's happening more and more often."
2108,"I am afraid it will ruin my relationship, my family relationship, and my social life."
2109,I don't want to lose those close to me so I have stopped talking to them about all of this.
2110,"Because of that choice, I now have no one that I can vent to, relate to, or communicate with."
2111,"Is this normal anxiety and depression, or should I be looking for professional help?"
2112,I was just diagnosed with panic disorder and PTSD and started meds (a combo of very low doses of Prozac and Xanax) a few days ago.
2113,"I've also been curious about trying shrooms, but don't know if my anxiety (or new medication) would get in the way of having a good experience."
2114,"Anyway, since I started my medication my anxiety has been at an all time high."
2115,"Anyway, I know the medication isn't fully in my system yet, I just worry about my anxiety being at an all time high since I've started taking it."
2116,TL;DR when do signs and symptoms of anxiety start to fade with combined therapy and medication?
2117,Doctors mentioned medication but I don't want to become reliant on a drug to regulate my mood (I know I smoke weed already but I'm gradually cutting this down).
2118,I've been going to a local clinic to receive medication that charges based on income.
2119,I was being prescribed a benzodiazepine by a doctor at this clinic but this medication has been blacklisted from being prescribed.
2120,I'd like to continue this medication so I'm thinking of visiting a psychiatrist outside of this clinic who will continue my prescription.
2121,"I know that psychiatrists charge per visit and I'm not looking for psychiatric counseling, so I'm wondering how often a psychiatrist expects someone to come in if they're just doing medication management."
2122,"I'm guessing it depends on the psychiatrist, but I'd like to ask if anyone here is seeing a psychiatrist to receive medication and not for psychiatric therapy and if so how often are the follow-ups?"
2123,"(if you want the link just ask) Is there some medication I can take that makes it just go away, and I keep my sex drive?"
2124,"I have a history of GAD and am about 2 months into a new medication, could this be contributing to the symptoms?"
2125,I was depressed for 3 years and took some medication to help me out of it.
2126,I've been seeing a councilor and we've both agreed that medication was the next logical step.
2127,"I didn't eat anything yet, just sipped water and took my meds as usual and something got me to the point of puking."
2128,"The meds didn't work, well they did help with the anxiety, but so far the SSRIs I've been on all make me horribly depressed ... but hey they stop the panic attacks!"
2129,I'm currently on NO medication because my last round of Lexapro wanted to make me kill myself.
2130,"As you can tell already, I have recognized that this is is probably not what she will be doing, but I am still worried nonetheless."
2131,"My mother took my step dad, little brother, and I on a vacation to France."
2132,"We don't see each other very often, so she thought it would be a good way to spend some time with me."
2133,"I knew this, so I decided to give my best go at being away from home and around two people I cannot stand to be around (my younger brother and step dad)."
2134,"I'm super uncomfortable and want to go home very badly, I'm desperately lonely, I've had stress headaches since we've been here, and I hate being away from home."
2135,I told my mother I wanted to go home and im not comfortable.
2136,"She invested so much time into planning our trip, but I did warn her that I did not want to stay longer than a week (she asked if I could stay for three, I only wanted to be here for a week, so we compromised and I am staying for three weeks)."
2137,She began to cry and told me she wants me to be comfortable but also wants to spend time with me.
2138,"As I reviewed our conversation, halfway drunk and halfway through a headache, I began to wonder how she feels not being able to see me and now her work has just made me uncomfortable, the complete opposite of her goal."
2139,"By the time the idea crossed my mind, I began to worry she might take her life knowing that my father will and has been able to take care of my brothers and I."
2140,"She has access to quite a lot of medicines to treat her autoimmune disease, so overdosing wouldn't be too hard of a thing to do."
2141,"Now that I think of all of this, I realize how useless of a person I am knowing that I can go upstairs and wake her to talk about all of this, but I am too scared to do so."
2142,Mainly because I don't want to have to talk to my step father and I'm afraid of the repercussions of waking my mother up at 1 in the morning.
2143,"Perfect, I am a kid complaining about being in Paris."
2144,"TL; DR: I want to go home, told my mom, she got upset because we don't see each other, anxiety n shit, afraid I'm my mother might take her life thinking that her kids don't want to see her"
2145,"I was given a prescription for meds for my short term anxiety, and those have helped me, but I don't want to take them unless I absolutely need them since they aren't the long-term type of meds."
2146,My partner wants me off the meds badly but I don't know if I shouldgo back on something to get some relief.
2147,now its the 3d month and I don't feel that the meds are working.
2148,"I'm not used to taking meds in the morning, so it's not uncommon for me to be sleepy enough in the morning to forget to take my meds before I head to work."
2149,"I don't usually drink any caffeine, but I had one morning last week where I was literally falling asleep at my desk after forgetting to take my meds and so I grabbed a cup of coffee."
2150,"I noticed that my anxiety was actually better than when I was on my meds, but it's kind of a sweet spot; too much or too little and it screws with me."
2151,"I've noticed that the best combination is when I remember to take my meds AND I have about 2 cups of coffee, but the second best is no meds with 2 cups of coffee."
2152,I have recently gone off my meds a month ago after 7 years on them.
2153,"So a two years ago I went to a doctor that was recommended to me and I asked for anxiety meds, I got my prescription and came home and realized he gave me exactly 15 xanax - for a year."
2154,"But he made me feel like a pill seeker when I asked for the meds, it's VERY difficult for me to ask for help, so I lived with it."
2155,Is my body adjusting or should I talk to my psychologist about switching meds?
2156,"I take medicine for it but of course, it doesn't always help."
2157,"Benzos, SNRIs and SSRIs all made me aggressive, violent and angry."
2158,"I am a little afraid to try other medicines, but I want to know, what should I look for as potential alternatives?"
2159,Have any of you guys ever have something similar to this happen to you on any medication?
2160,"I'm worried that if I take the Prozac I might have some nasty side effects and/or experience withdrawal if I try to stop, which is a concern as I really don't want to be on medication more than a year at most."
2161,That way I can also continue to work on it with my therapist and hopefully be off of the meds sooner.
2162,Or any other medication?
2163,What meds would I most likely be given?
2164,"Pregame: Honestly, I probably should have taken small bottles of liquor with me to take the edge of since meds are no longer a thing for me, but instead I pregamed with my crochet (like knitting)."
2165,"I don't know what's worse, the idea of losing him for his own mental health or the idea of admitting that I'm a worthless piece of shit who needs mental help and committing to a lifetime of heavy-duty medication and being a zombie."
2166,I've been in therapy but I always refused medication when it was suggested.
2167,"I was assisting in surgeries, euthanasia, office work, janitor work, grooming, animal care, medication dispensing, and going to multiple unpaid meetings."
2168,I've made countless posts to this site on different sub reddits and I don't even know why I do it!
2169,I have no friends or anybody who can help me and I have no money and I'm just going out of my fucking mind!
2170,I live in the middle of nowhere and I can't even get help from the government I'm so fucked.
2171,I can't win the battle against my obsessive thoughts anymore and I'm just so fucking tired of fighting myself and reassuring myself and I can't sleep anymore just day after fucking day after day and I can't sleep unless it's the weekend.
2172,Every single night is so awful and the pressure to just sleep one fucking hour is so strong and every night more pressure and more pressure and it just never happens!
2173,I have a mortgage and all these bills and I have to be at work all the time and so early 6am in the morning until 6 at night and I'm just so exhausted.
2174,My anxiety is hard enough to cope with when I'm sleeping and eating but after days of no sleep and nausea I can barely eat.
2175,My hands shake constantly and I'm having hallucinations.
2176,The dizziness and everything is so unbearable and I can't even talk about it because nobody fucking cares about me at all.
2177,I basically beg my family for help and they tell me I'm 23 to figure it out on my own I'm not their responsibility any longer.
2178,And I know this is true I just don't know what the fuck to do.
2179,I want to self admit myself to an institution but they are so terrible and I don't have the money to pay for it and I'll lose my job.
2180,I can't afford therapy and I can't afford anything but Anxiety medications from my general dr and they just make it SO MUCH WORSE!
2181,The last anti depressant I tried seriously made me want to actually consider suicide because it was the absolute worst thing I have ever felt in my life.
2182,I'm just so stuck and lost and nobody gives a shit about what happens to me and posting to this website is literally the only thing I have in my life and it's so pathetic.
2183,I know this post is a complete mess and looks so ridiculous but I'm just so exhausted and I haven't slept in almost 4 days and I feel insane.
2184,I just want to sleep so badly.
2185,I've never taken anxiety medication because of this.
2186,"I decided that I don't like feeling so drowsy and out of it all the time, due to the medicine, and wanted to stop taking it."
2187,"My anxiety is at a phenomenal level, one that I have not even experienced ever prior to taking this medicine."
2188,"I believe I'm psychologically addicted to it because once I start experiencing this sheer panic of having a seizure from stopping the medicine, it subsides a second after taking my dose, and I know the medicine doesn't work that fast."
2189,"I told her I wanted to go through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, not be on any long term medication after she tried pushing an SSRI on me, and even after me telling her this, she prescribed this medication ""just to take the edge off while I'm doing the therapy."""
2190,"I am going to be put back on medication soon, and thinking about it terrifies me."
2191,I've never had a good history with pills or any sort of medication.
2192,The rare times I could visit my Dad he would take all the medication and flush it in one go since he doesn't believe in medication.
2193,"My friends all said that it wasn't healthy to mess with my medication and constantly be going on and off, but none of them had any problems (or so I had thought), medication, therapists, so I would get in arguments and have breakdowns."
2194,After faking a happy act for a while I was taken off of the medication when I was barely 12.
2195,"Two months into the school year and I had begun to form very unhealthy eating habits (skipping meals and binging later, restricting), but my Mom thought that the medication was really helping me, when I was really the acting classes I took after school twice a week."
2196,"Every little blob was disfigured in a bright colorful palette that made it burn to open my eyes, I felt like it was some sort of lucid dream, someone had messed with my medication, no I threw away my medication this morning."
2197,But I'm about to be put back on medication soon.
2198,"I no longer use pain medication, sunscreen, commercial toothpaste, or anything weird to ingest/ put on my body."
2199,I was in charge of one of the many hotel rooms and this dog usually gets medication with this meals (in the past some supervisors usually take his dinner and put in the meds) well this dog went swimming earlier so he wasn't allowed to get his dinner until later.
2200,When the time came to feed him I was wondering if my supervisor had given the dog his meds because he didnt get fed yet.
2201,"So I went over to the meds sheet and read it, and I read it wrong."
2202,"I thought the dog had not gotten his meds, so my thought process was:

""Okay he gets meds in his food."""
2203,"He said he already gave the dog the meds without food and came running in the room, he then showed me that I had misread the medication sheet."
2204,Its like my brain completely failed me because even if the dog actually didn't get his meds ITS NOT MY JOB TO GIVE THEM.
2205,"Late November, I finally decided it was time to try out medication."
2206,"But really, to think I may have found the right meds so soon alone makes me joyful."
2207,"A few months ago I switched to a new medication, mirtazapine."
2208,Now on this new medication it's making me feel panicky.
2209,"It seems like I've learned to control that better now - thanks to meds, therapy, and my girlfriend."
2210,"The appointment went great, my doctor prescribed me some meds to try and we headed back home."
2211,"If I had to put a number on my anger and irritability before any meds, I'd say I was a frequent 8/10."
2212,"After starting on meds, an often 6/10, and sometimes 8/10."
2213,"She refuses to try medication and never did the ""homework"" given to her by her therapists (ie."
2214,"Hi guys,

I’m not sure where to post this."
2215,"I’m new here, but I guess I just need to vent/get some advice."
2216,I suffer from social anxiety.
2217,"I'm a female gamer who over the years has isolated myself because I enjoy reading, gaming, etc."
2218,over partying &amp; socializing.
2219,"but deep down, this is because I am afraid to socialize, and deep down, I want to be able to socialize without fretting over who's going to be there/if I'm being awkward, etc."
2220,etc.
2221,I seem to be stuck in this notion that I'm supposed to be doing the things that other people my age are doing: socializing &amp; partying (I'm almost 25).
2222,"I used to be incredibly social/outgoing (probably because of my drug use during that time), but since I've lost a lot of my friends over the years, I've started to withdraw &amp; isolate myself."
2223,this has been going on for a couple of years now.
2224,"however, there are a lot of factors involved because of this... last year I pretty much lost my mind after getting randomly fired from my job, which lead into a deep depression."
2225,"I also detoxed off of suboxone last year (this is my first year without any opiates/opioids in my body since 2008), which has definitely contributed to the emotional &amp; mental changes I've been dealing with."
2226,"I've also impulsively went back to school, got a ""real, adult"" job (however, I don't regret this or going back to school at all), and moved out of my town to my boyfriend's town where he grew up."
2227,so I already know some of the root causes as to why I am afraid to socialize now.
2228,anyway...
2229,"I live with my boyfriend &amp; a roommate, but I always want to stay inside and do my own thing."
2230,"any time some sort of social event comes up, I get incredibly anxious."
2231,I am then confronted with two options: to go or to stay home.
2232,98% of the time I choose the latter.
2233,"I end up challenging my social anxiety about every 3 months, but then realize how boring/miserable I am in the social situation, so I end up just not going out."
2234,but then this leads to depression/more anxiety down the line because I feel like I'm a figment of everyone's imagination.
2235,"some weird hermit who does nothing but stay inside, even on beautiful days."
2236,"I guess I feel the need to, for some reason, prove something to other people, but I don't know why."
2237,I guess I care too much about what others thing about me now.
2238,I'm usually okay with staying home.
2239,"since like I said, I enjoy some time to myself every now &amp; then because there's not much privacy here in the apartment, but then when my boyfriend chooses to go out without me, I end up feeling anxious as well."
2240,I always want the opposite of what I get.
2241,"I want time to myself, but then when he says he's leaving, I want him to stay."
2242,"I want to him stay, but then when he says he's not leaving, I want him to leave."
2243,"I make things incredibly complicated for absolutely no reason &amp; continue to give myself/my boyfriend a hard time, sometimes."
2244,"usually, I just end up judging/beating myself up because of the emotions that arise."
2245,I think it's ridiculous that I feel this way still.
2246,"I've been with my boyfriend for over two years now, and I'm sick of the constant thoughts in my head about what he's doing when he's out, if I'm just crazy, the debates on whether I should stay or go that constantly happen over &amp; over again, back &amp; forth in my head..."
2247,I don't know.
2248,"I don't really know how to stop this when an overwhelming emotion arises, usually because of the situations I just described."
2249,"I am in therapy &amp; on medications, and have recently been reading about Buddhism, since I need something more."
2250,"this has helped, but not during the times when the overwhelming emotions paralyze me/consume me, but I guess that's part of just practicing Buddhism, which is a long road involving lots of patience without any judgments."
2251,"I guess I just needed to vent, or hear someone relate to my struggles, or relating to my struggles, but with a story of how you overcame it."
2252,I can use any advice/tips/whatever you can give me.
2253,"sometimes, I just feel so alone."
2254,"Hello, so I'm going to try to keep this straightforward with main points but I'll answer all questions and provide any additional information that is required."
2255,"My girlfriend of 2 years suffers from severe anxiety, and it has gotten much worse over the last few months."
2256,Here are some major points about her that I notice.
2257,"**1)** She smokes tons of weed, roughly 2 grams a day, BUT we have been able to cut that down significantly over the last week, and we are continuing to get her to stop (though it is extremely hard since she's been smoking weed for many fews now, and always a lot)

**2)** Her eating patterns have gotten MUCH worse, she has always been an extremely picky eater (does not like lots of meat, mostly likes pasta, will not eat any fish, will not go near any ethnic food), she's barely eating now, she says she has no appetite, but she does not struggle with eating disorders or body image problems, she even recognizes she's too thin."
2258,"**3)** She gets tons of nightmares, and she's constantly waking up in the middle of the night, 4-5am, and she says its hard for her to fall back asleep (i'm thinking weed has something to do with this, so hopefully once we cut it out, her sleeping patterns will be better)

**4)** She places SOOOO much stress and pressure on herself of what she needs to accomplish, she is currently a teacher (she just started), as the school year is approaching an end, she has not been supplying at all, she will confirm supply shifts, but cancel them last minute (around 5-6am), which then further ruins her day and she tells herself she is a failure, she's ruining her life, she lost all this money."
2259,"(I helped her spending habits, and encouraged her to get rid of all her debt and start a saving, which she has saved for $5,000 from January to now, but still says it isn't enough, it isn't enough and freaks out."
2260,"**5)** She has tons of chest pains, and says theres this feeling that something is constantly wrong, or something bad is going to happen (but it never does)

**6)** She cuts herself, hits herself, breaks things in her room, abuses drugs, supposedly takes 10 pills of Tylenol but always throws them up after realizing she doesn't want to do that i'm assuming (i've never seen any of this, so i don't know how true it is that she downs 10 pills) BUT I have told her that she cannot be doing this anymore, especially if she loves me, I've always been understanding and patient with her, but with cutting, or saying she's going to commit suicide or taking all these pills, after a few times I've told her i WILL NOT stand for that and that she CANNOT do this, and i was very firm with her about it, and told her many times and she hasn't done it since (THANK GOD)."
2261,"SO what I've tried everything possible, you name it, i'm always patient and understanding, i've given all the support and love, i do get frustrated and mad sometimes, i've tried tough love, i've get motivational stuff, i've tried just being there to hold her and tell her i'm here its okay, i've just listened, i've tried everything, but nothing works."
2262,"MY ONLY concern is that she doesn't get put on all these medications her whole life, i am very much against long term usage, if she needs to take whatever medicines for a few months, i'm okay with it, but i don't want her on anxiety or depression pills her whole life, its not curing the problem, its just masking/numbing it."
2263,"Please help me, my heart is breaking day by day, i'm sick to my stomach, i'm so scared and worried, she used to be a lot happier, now all she does is lay in bed, barely eats, cries all day, and freaks out."
2264,PLEASE help!
2265,Thank you!
2266,"I have an appointment with a psychiatrist for next week, but I don't think any non-medicine things will make a difference."
2267,"I go to therapy, and I take psych meds for my anxiety and other mental illness but I also drink passion flower tea and it helps when my anxiety is so bad that my body just feels ""off""."
2268,"Edit: As well, I'm 22 and no longer taking medication or attending therapy."
2269,"However, after some bouts with meds and some years, I've leveled out about as nicely as I can hope for."
2270,When I first saw a doctor for anxiety I was prescribed Celexa (20mg) and given clonazepam to take as needed until the meds kicked in.
2271,I had issues with weight gain and low libido (like holy crap) so she added Wellbutrin (100mg).
2272,"I stopped taking Wellbutrin when my son was born because I was breastfeeding, and Celexa alone didn't cut it."
2273,I saw a new doctor (my old one disappeared) who prescribed me Effexor (low dose).
2274,She didn't want to put me on an SSRI again because of the sex drive thing.
2275,Huge issue.
2276,But when I told her I was having problems sleeping she took me off Effexor and put me on Trazodone.
2277,Trazodone is kicking my ass.
2278,It doesn't help me sleep and leaves me groggy and lethargic all day.
2279,"I could increase my dose to help with anxiety but...I wake up with a ""hangover"" every morning and have to drag myself out of bed."
2280,"I can deal with this over the summer (I'm a teacher), but when I'm back to getting up at 5am, there's no way."
2281,I'm going back to my doctor soon and want to ask her about some medicine combinations.
2282,Once I go back to work I won't be able to return to the doctor every month to adjust my dosage or the medication I'm on.
2283,My main problems are excessive worry and the physical side effects of anxiety.
2284,TL; DR- The medications I've been prescribed thus far have been limited in effectiveness but have crappy side effects.
2285,About a month and a half ago I went back on my Lexapro and Klonopin after being off of it for a year.
2286,Before going back on my meds my resting heart rate was between 95bpm-105bpm and everyday was an anxiety fulled nightmare.
2287,"Now that I've been on my meds I am able to function and go out and do things, and my resting heart rate is between 75bpm-85bpm."
2288,I was just wondering if it's normal or ok for a persons heart rate to have that much of a change with just medications.
2289,"I've also been having a cup of coffee in the morning to get moving recently, and i was expecting my heart rate to go up higher but it really only goes up to 89bpm."
2290,"Any advice would help, thank you in advance."
2291,I know 5-HTP isn't a 'real' medication like SSRIs but it's my last line before I approach a doctor for them.
2292,"I realized that over the course of several months of being on this medication I began to stop answering my friends text messages, stopped becoming enthusiastic about anything, and my interest in anything was very slight at best."
2293,So this is why Ive decided to stop taking my medication.
2294,"Im nervous to try new medicine, but i really need to get a hold on my anxiety before i go back to college."
2295,"I am a pretty anxious and neurotic person as is, but due to some bad experiences with medication in the past, I've tried to find non-pharmaceutical routes to dealing with my anxiety."
2296,"Now, the psychologist who did my ADD testing simply recommended a stimulant medication (adderall, vyvanse, etc.)."
2297,"I feel like the medication is the only thing that could potentially help my attention defecit, but i don't want to have to go through more panic attacks if i have to."
2298,"To get to the question, can anybody with anxiety here take a stimulant medication without it triggering a panic attack or making your anxiety worse?"
2299,"I have taken a friend's ADD medicine during high school (i know, i know) before my anxiety began, so i know what it feels like."
2300,"It doesn't affect my day to day life like my panic attacks did, so I'm wondering if it's something just associated with my anxiety that I don't need medication for exclusively?"
2301,**I apologize for the wall of text.
2302,"**


I've suffered from anxiety since I was 17, exactly the time I was taking anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications for my mental issues at the time."
2303,"Before taking the medications, I was perfectly fine when it came to anxiety and never, ever suffered from a panic attack."
2304,Last year it was the worst.
2305,I had undiagnosed pneumonia and took an ambulance to the hospital.
2306,"They tried putting an IV in during the incredibly bumpy ambulance ride, so the clear-out-veins-so-they-don't-clog-up fluid went straight into my elbow joint and I went straight into panic-mode and was sobbing."
2307,"At the hospital, they tried to give me a CT scan, but my body was so incredibly tense."
2308,"The moment I tried to relax, cue worst panic attack in my life that lasted for several hours until I was released."
2309,"After that point, I developed a phobia of needles and would get extreme anxiety whenever I had to get my blood drawn or have an IV put in, and I'd get extreme anxiety whenever walking into a hospital whether or not it was for me."
2310,"April came around, and suddenly every single day, I'd have several hour long panic attacks that were worse than I had ever experienced in my life."
2311,"Everything became a fog and I felt so disassociated, like my brain disconnected from everything and I felt weak, and after the fog cleared, the panic attacks began (the fog never returned, but that's how it started)."
2312,I would break down sobbing and was thrown into a deep depression because I was miserable existing in a perpetual panic attack.
2313,"The only breaks I got was sleep, and it was incredibly difficult to get to sleep."
2314,"I ended up cutting out all caffeine and was caffeine free for 6 months straight, though that didn't help whatsoever."
2315,"After a full month of atrocious day-long panic attacks, they finally ceased and would come at random, but rarely."
2316,Then I got pregnant.
2317,"I had a c-section, so they had to poke several needles into my back and inject the numbing stuff."
2318,I was shaking so bad when they were doing that because phobia of needles and I was scared shitless of getting cut open.
2319,"Despite their effort to numb me, I felt everything."
2320,"I told the anesthesiologist that I could feel it, but he acted pretentious and said, ""You shouldn't feel it."
2321,"I put the anesthesia in your back, so you shouldn't feel it."""
2322,and nothing was done about it.
2323,Apparently I ended up blacking out and was screaming like I was dying.
2324,"All in all, it was an atrocious experience I never want to relive, and 6 months later I still get anxiety thinking about it (like I'm reliving the experience in my head in full detail)."
2325,"A few months after the c-section, post-partum depression made me go a bit weird for a while, and I ended up throwing some kind of fit at my mom's and boyfriend's parents' house."
2326,"This weekend I'll be seeing my boyfriend's parents for the second time since this incident, and I am still filled to the brim with guilt and shame, so much that even the thought of them seeing my face makes me want to hyperventilate."
2327,"I felt the same way seeing my mom again after everything, and still feel the same way but I see her much less often."
2328,"Anxiety eats me up on a daily basis, reliving various recent traumas on a daily basis."
2329,"I can't take medication for it and even if I could, I don't want to have to live off of medication for the rest of my life in order to function."
2330,"I have an appointment in November to see a therapist, so hopefully they can help me with all of my issues, but even that is anxiety-inducing."
2331,Any ideas of what I can do to just... relax for once?
2332,Drugs and alcohol are not an option.
2333,I haven't left my apartment for almost the whole month.
2334,I only left to do groceries and pick up prescriptions and medications.
2335,I'm dealing with some heavy self esteem issues (I used to be very confident in myself).
2336,I am expected to go to some parties and to support some friends at a stag 'n' doe.
2337,I don't have a costume.
2338,"I could wear an old one but I don't want to show my body off in a costume from the sex shop, you know?"
2339,I'm afraid to leave my apartment and when I do I think people are looking at me and judging me.
2340,I know there are some people that do.
2341,It comes with my work as a music artist.
2342,Thats why I decided to scrap my album and refuse to go on stage.
2343,"People are judging me, looking at what they see and what they can't see, judging me for not meeting or going higher than their expectations."
2344,I quit.
2345,I can't do it.
2346,Not now at least.
2347,I know this is a dangerous road to go down but I am terrified.
2348,I also have been suffering from major depression with GAD.
2349,But this isn't GAD.
2350,This is much more intense.
2351,It's like the feeling I had right before I swallowed a bunch of pills to make everything stop (I knew it wasn't going to kill me but I was hoping I would be out of it for a few days and numb out).
2352,"I try using some stuff I learned from an ""Emotion Regulation"" group therapy class over summer, but after a certain point it's like I have no more control over my own body and I just watch everything start going out of control."
2353,It's like I'm not in my body when it happens and it's fucked up.
2354,I'm going to start a therapy for chronic suicidal ideation soon if everything goes right.
2355,It will be an intense short term therapy but I need to start somewhere.
2356,I have an assessment for the program on Monday.
2357,But this weekend I'm expected to go out.
2358,I don't want to.
2359,I am terrified.
2360,It doesn't help people will be in costumes.
2361,I am afraid I will get attacked on the street (I have before).
2362,I don't know what I'm asking for here maybe I guess this is more of a vent or to see if anyone else can relate or something but I doubt that.
2363,"I'm just so scared, guys."
2364,:'(
2365,"I'm not sure if my recent spike in general, constant anxiety is due to a increase dose of medication or what."
2366,"I finally decided to accept medication, and I have been on cipralex for about 2 months."
2367,I rejected the idea of medication because I didn't want to believe I needed it to be happy.
2368,"Not just medication, but in anything that offers you some kind of peace."
2369,Do i need to consult and doctor and take meds?
2370,I took a medication named Risperdal for 3 months.
2371,The last time I took the medication was match[march] of 2013.
2372,"I am unmedicated due to my mom not wanting me to have medicine, because of a suicidal almost attempt thing."
2373,"A bit of background, I'm at 20 year old male who's a third year college student, I'm not on any medications and nor do I want to be."
2374,My Ex (20?
2375,female) and I broke up a year ago and I've had a real tough time handling it.
2376,"The first six months were awful I was pretty much a walking wreck, the past six months I've started to regain my footing but it's so difficult going to the same school."
2377,"I've been trying to pick up more productive hobbies to move on, but it's so difficult."
2378,"Every day, I'm always thinking about her and I hate it."
2379,"When I'm walking to my next class no matter what I'm doing, I'm always subconsciously looking for her to pass by or something of the sort."
2380,And if I do see her I have a mini-panic attack.
2381,We haven't talked since we broke up but I still can't get her out of my mind.
2382,It bothers me so much that I can have so much anxiety over one person.
2383,She's been over me since before we even broke up.
2384,"I think Breakeven by The Script sums up how I feel: ""I've got time and shes got freedom""."
2385,"I mean, I've only known her for two years and one year we've been broken up, and I'm still thinking about her all the time I hate it."
2386,"I hate being so clingy, I hate the fact that it takes me so long to get over someone."
2387,I hate that just thinking about passing by her I freak out a little bit.
2388,"I just want peace of mind, I want to be able to stop these thoughts, I've tried everything and I know the conventional wisdom is to just wait, but how long do I have to wait?"
2389,It's been a freaking year and here I still am.
2390,The actual issue is that I want to join some more clubs to help me get out more and the idea of doing that alone makes me super anxious.
2391,The worse part is she is in a majority of these clubs that I want to join and just knowing that she is going to be there while I try to awkwardly join a club makes me want to throw up.
2392,I want to be able to grow but I'm almost paralyzed by this.
2393,"I'm already socially awkward so I would make a fool of myself, but I can handle that."
2394,What I can't handle is having a panic attack in public because she is at one of these club meetings.
2395,"I have to go to these clubs, I have to grow."
2396,"I don't want to just stagnate like I have for the past year, I want to grow."
2397,But my anxiety just makes it so damn hard.
2398,"All I want to do is join a few clubs without having an anxiety attack, why does it have to be so hard :(?"
2399,"Trust me, I am seeking the right kind of support, I've been on dozens of meds and I am still figuring it out."
2400,"Nothing feels okay, I've been seeking different forms of treatment for years and nothing has paid off, not even medicine."
2401,I feel like medicine doesn't help me.
2402,"Here's a little background (not complete, that would be a novel): In highschool I started having bad anxiety about getting sick and throwing up in public and I always had this horrible feeling in my stomach."
2403,I toughed it out for awhile because I thought it was a stomach bug and that it had nothing to do with anxiety since I had never had it before.
2404,After a couple of months I went to the doctor and was put on Lexapro.
2405,"After a very short time, things got a lot better, I gained weight back, was able to eat and didnt have to worry about getting sick in public."
2406,The only side-effects I remember were excessive yawning and sweating.
2407,"Then, I can't remember why but I switched to effexor."
2408,Effexor worked great (only noticed a bit more sweating) and I took that up until about 5 months ago when I decided that I wanted to try living without medication.
2409,I worked with my doctors to taper off of it slowly and still had some withdrawal symptoms but was able to get through the month or so that I experienced them.
2410,More recently: My anxiety is not nearly as bad as before but I still often get that sick feeling when I go out with friends so I had my doctor prescribe me Klonopin at .5 mg to take as needed because I wanted to try everything that I could before going back to taking meds every day.
2411,"I noticed that when I would take a klonopin, that I was actually able to sit down and focus even if I didnt take my adderal and its even better if I take them together."
2412,This is how I found out that my anxiety was also causing problems that I had with focusing and getting things done (Which Ive had for a while).
2413,"My main problems that led me to see my doctor again were 

1.)"
2414,I am always tired mentally no matter the amount of sleep that I get.
2415,2.)
2416,"My ADD medications were not helping me focus anymore, they only helped combat the tired feeling in my head."
2417,"I'm having trouble doing the things that I like to do (produce music and DJ)

3.)"
2418,"The Stomach feeling 



Now to the present: I was prescribed Remeron (Mirtazapine 15mg) yesterday and took it for the first time last night."
2419,I took it at about 8:30-9pm and I was knocked out cold by 10pm.
2420,I wasnt able to get out of bed until about 12:30pm today and even then I went and laid down on the couch because I felt very foggy and zombie like.
2421,"I was scheduled to work at 5pm but ended up calling out because I didn't feel safe to drive, or even work for that matter (I'm a barback so its pretty labor intensive)."
2422,"I'm currently working two jobs and my next scheduled shift isn't until Thursday at 7 pm, but then I'm also scheduled on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday."
2423,"I'm going to try the remeron one more time tonight but if I wake up feeling the same way, I think that I'm going to have to stop taking it completely and go back to either effexor or lexapro because I can not miss anymore work (there isn't anyone else that could cover for me)."
2424,I understand that it can take a while for these side effects to go away but I don't have the time to find out as I'm scheduled to work almost 6 days a week between both of my jobs.
2425,I'm just looking for some advice because I do not know if I will be able to get an appointment with my doctor before I work again.
2426,"I dont know if its okay to stop taking the remeron after two days, if I should just replace it with effexor/lexapro again and try a different route for fixing my focus issues?"
2427,"Sorry this is all over the place, so is my mind right now."
2428,After reading some of the side effects I became really anxious about taking the medicine and am now having second thoughts.
2429,"** The puppy and it's owner have recently been abroad on vacation, and because of a tapeworm called Echinococcus Multilocularis, there's a whole regimen of medication you need to give the dog at a vet's within 5 days before departure - and then when you're abroad (again, at a vet's) if you're gone for more than 5 days - and then *again* within five days after you get home."
2430,"**The owner knows I'm a hypochondriac,** so I usually just ask her about these things (I've had a lot of dog related hypochondria scares), and she'll tell me what the dog has done, what vaccines it has, meds it has taken, and so on - but what if she hasn't followed the tapeworm medicine regimen?"
2431,"I went off my meds (Cymbalta/SSNRI), and I feel good about that decision because I'm meeting the ""demons"" that cause my issues head on, and no more side effects, but I'm beginning to wonder if I'm really strong enough at this point in my life to live without them."
2432,"He is on medication with some improvement, but anxious feelings and attacks persist."
2433,"I was in therapy (cognitive behavioral, no meds) for around a year but haven't been seeing anyone recently."
2434,At the moment it's reasonably managed with medication.
2435,I currently take depression medicine and am going to talk to my Doctor for anxiety medicine.
2436,I'm in pre-medicine so it's a lot of work and competition.
2437,"I was put on Zoloft (100mg I believe) for that, but then I was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and was given medication for that as well."
2438,I told my therapist I didn't want to up my medication (10mg lexapro) until this term is over.
2439,"I politely declined every offer and tried explaining the anxiety was getting worse, and I'd been taking the medication as prescribed."
2440,My medication runs out in almost a week.. and I'm freaking out.
2441,"Just before i jump into my story when i say self medicate i mean i am using the anxiety medications i was prescribed from 1-2 years ago, now."
2442,stuff like xanax and clonazepam (the only things that actually work for me).
2443,"Its been going great and i try not to take it every day, my tolerance has only risen a bit but the side effects aren't great."
2444,My memory hasn't been the best and if something exciting happens the blanket of a benzodiazepine is covering my true emotions.
2445,Why have i decided to finally fight my anxiety head on?
2446,"i got offered a place at university for a course i really want to do and i realised i need to get back into reality before i start, this is my opportunity to start a new life, i've also moved to a new area recently so this is also a big thing for me."
2447,"I have 2 months until the course, 2 months to entirely stop the medication, 2 months to improve myself as a person and 2 months to decrease my anxiety by doing exposure type therapy, good luck to you all with anxiety, i wish you all luck, anxiety is such a motherfucker but the fact that you are seeking help simply by looking on this forum means you are TRYING."
2448,"i'm going to write a book about my story one day, not to talk about myself but to increase awareness of anxiety as a disorder, there are so many misconceptions/not much awareness at the moment, in 50-100 years time people will understand the type of things we go through."
2449,i wish you all luck :)
2450,And I really don't want to take any meds unless absolutely necessary.
2451,And I loved it.
2452,I'm so happy I took the first step and I encourage others to do so as well.
2453,"He didn't prescribe me medication but encouraged me try some tricks to help with my anxieties.If I get prescribed, what medications work for you guys?"
2454,Thanks a ton.
2455,"i currently don't have health insurance so meds/therapy are out of the picture, and i would much rather use techniques and natural methods to help my situation."
2456,I started aggressively trying to treat my anxiety/depression with the help of some medications.
2457,I have tried 2 so far with no results.
2458,I have tried Escitalopram (generic Cipralex) and Venlafaxine (generic Effexor Xr) with no change.
2459,Has this happened to anyone else?
2460,What has helped you?
2461,I've been off my meds for a few weeks because I haven't been able to get an appointment with my doctor and I haven't seen my therapist in months.
2462,"I get too worried about taking medication the first time to try it in private, and don't really have anywhere I need to go right now."
2463,"I'd love to go back on meds, but I'm terrified they'll make me gain weight again after months of very difficult work of trying to get the weight off for the wedding."
2464,"It seems like any medication for panic attacks takes awhile to kick in, and by that point the panic attack is over."
2465,I'm a 20 year old male currently in my second year of college.
2466,I've been on 20 mg's of citalopram for a little over six weeks and recently switched to 40 mgs (this is my second day on 40).
2467,"I have had periods of time where my anxiety seems to be gone, but lately for the past three days it has gotten rough again."
2468,I am considering switching medications and I am wondering if anyone thinks that I am making too early of a decision.
2469,I also was prescribed a few Ativan as needed and I've take three mg's in the past month.
2470,"I took one last night, and I am considering taking another tonight because it's been a rough day."
2471,"I know the risk of abuse, and I am wondering if it's ok to take it a second day in a row, and even a third if I need to."
2472,"I am mindful of addiction and don't want to create problems for myself, but anxiety makes me so uncomfortable and Ativan gives me immediate relief."
2473,I am meeting my psych.
2474,friday to and i'm not sure if a change in ssri is needed.
2475,"It just goes to show that sometimes hard work, a good support system, a therapist, and medication (looking at you Xanax &amp; Wellbutrin) can get you through even the darkest of days."
2476,"So far we've gone over medication discussion, healthy eating, relaxation."
2477,"I've read a lot about how people don't get relief without medication, and it worries me that I won't ever get better."
2478,I took my meds and am now sitting in bed.
2479,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder is one of the most common psychological ailments, affecting 3.1% of the population nationwide."
2480,"This condition is characterized by irrational feelings of overwhelming worry and fear, often accompanied by physical symptoms such as gastrointestinal discomfort, trembling, sweating, and shortness of breath."
2481,"Treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Northport generally includes prescription medications, often in combination with psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy."
2482,"Anxiety disorders are often treated with SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medications, such as Zoloft or Prozac."
2483,"However, benzodiazepines are also frequently prescribed in Northport as treatment for generalized anxiety disorder."
2484,"Benzodiazepines are often effective in providing short-term relief from anxiety symptoms; however, they do carry some risk for dependency and addiction, which physicians must take into account when prescribing these medications in Northport."
2485,"Benzodiazepines as Treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Benzodiazepine medications are commonly prescribed in Northport as part of treatment for generalized anxiety disorder."
2486,"In fact, four common benzodiazepines--- alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan) --- are among the top 100 most prescribed medications."
2487,"Benzodiazepines work by enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid), which lends the drugs their sleep-inducing and anxiety-reducing effects."
2488,The most commonly used benzodiazepine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder is alprazolam (Xanax).
2489,"Although benzodiazepines are often efficacious for managing anxiety symptoms in Northport, they are not without risk."
2490,"According to current estimates, as many as 23% of people who take prescription benzodiazepines may be dependent on them."
2491,The risk of dependency on benzodiazepines is most strongly associated with long-term use.
2492,"The Dangers of Benzodiazepine Dependence

Benzodiazepines tend to be federally scheduled due to risk of misuse."
2493,"Although it is not unheard of for people in Northport to seek out benzodiazepines like Xanax illicitly for recreational purposes, many people who become dependent on these drugs were originally prescribed them for therapeutic purposes--- often as treatment for generalized anxiety disorder."
2494,"Although not everyone who takes a medicine like alprazolam is necessarily going to become dependent on it, physicians in Northport generally take these risks into account when prescribing them."
2495,Most physicians feel that benzodiazepines are suitable only for short-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.
2496,Part of the reason that dependency to benzodiazepines can arise is that a person will develop a tolerance to the substances over time.
2497,"Although tolerance to the sleep-inducing effects of benzodiazepines develops quickly, it takes longer for a tolerance to their anxiety-reducing effects to arise."
2498,"Tolerance to benzodiazepines is associated with changes that occur in the number and sensitivity of GABA receptors, along with effects on other neurotransmitter symptoms and changes in genetic transcription and coding that arise as a result of long-term benzodiazepine use."
2499,"When a person becomes physically dependent on a benzodiazepine, they cannot necessarily just stop taking the drug, because if they do, withdrawal symptoms may occur."
2500,"Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Syndrome

If a person who is taking benzodiazepines for long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder develops a physical dependency, abrupt discontinuation of the drug can result in a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome."
2501,An estimated 15-44% of long-term benzodiazepines users will experience withdrawal symptoms if they stop taking the drug.
2502,"Withdrawal symptoms vary in severity, but in extreme cases they can include life-threatening effects like seizures."
2503,"Symptoms of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may include:

•	Increased anxiety and panic attacks

•	Agitation and restlessness

•	Muscle aches

•	Dizziness

•	Dry mouth

•	Hot and cold flashes

•	Headache

•	Hypertension

•	Diarrhea

•	Insomnia

•	Impaired concentration

•	Increased urinary frequency

•	Paranoia

•	Sweating

•	Increased heart rate

•	Tinnitus

•	Visual disturbances

•	Confusion

•	Delusions

•	Hallucinations

•	Irritability


Long-term benzodiazepine use affects GABA receptors in the brain, and may even cause changes in genetic processes."
2504,"This results in the development of a tolerance, and even of physical dependence on the substances."
2505,"Although benzodiazepines such as Xanax are relatively safe for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms, they are not suitable for long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder."
2506,"Better treatment options for anxiety in Northport include safer drugs that do not result in dependency, such as SSRIs; psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavior therapy; and neurofeedback therapy, an exciting treatment modality recently available in Northport that uses EEG biofeedback to identify and change brainwave dysregulation that underlies brain-based disorders such as generalized anxiety disorders."
2507,"I get as much sleep as I can (lost my sleep meds, a couple nights of hell)."
2508,Tonight I felt suicidal for the first time in a long time....
2509,I'm just sick of my life being ruined by anxiety.
2510,I'm not saying I'll do anything about it but I'm just trying to illustrate how desperate I feel.
2511,"So here goes, I'm very intelligent, yet in many ways I'm ignorant because I completely neglected school as a child."
2512,I gave up on school in 3rd grade because I was bored and because of anxiety and other social problems.
2513,I also dropped out of 7th grade.
2514,"I've had one girlfriend, which lasted for 10 years."
2515,My anxiety definitely caused a lot of problems in that relationship.
2516,I was very unfair to her because of it.
2517,I've barely worked most of my life.
2518,I worked as a computer programmer for 2 years and lost that to anxiety.
2519,"I now live with my mother on government assistance, which will probably run out eventually."
2520,I go to low quality counseling.
2521,"I've tried probably 20 different medications, most of which have fucked me up more."
2522,"I used to want to be a philosopher, or physicist."
2523,But now I've downgraded to nutritionist or computer programmer.
2524,I can't seem to attract women because I have such bad anxiety and also because I'm intelligent and have the social skills of a 7th grader.
2525,"Meditation is the only relief I really get from anxiety, because I ALWAYS have it, it just goes between a 4 and a 10 on a 1-10 scale."
2526,"But I can't seem to get myself to do it because I always feel like I have to get stuff done even though I really never get anything done because I have such bad anxiety about everything, even anxiety."
2527,"I've made serious efforts to combat my anxiety, but it just isn't working for me."
2528,I can't help but think maybe I wasn't meant to exist.
2529,I'm 31.... and I'm miserable.
2530,"And even if I get medication, there's the potential of going through a fucking medical laundry list trying to find something that works."
2531,I have pretty bad anxiety.
2532,"I'm a normal guy but everyone knows me as the shy, awkward, kind of funny guy."
2533,I just started taking medications.
2534,One zoloft pill a day.
2535,"Lately, I don't like the way I act."
2536,I act a certain way around people because I'm really shy and it really frustrates me but I feel so anxious in situations I never do what I think I should.
2537,"I pretty much get frustrated by my anxiety, due to my anxiety."
2538,"Because I get frustrated, when I think about things  get anxious and it is a vicious cycle."
2539,I'm only like half a person when I am anxious because I am not doing what I want to do or feel all my time.
2540,I can't express myself 100% due to my anxiety.
2541,"And as I've said, it has really frustrated me and made me depressed."
2542,"But, after being high I started to realize what thoughts were bad thoughts."
2543,"I would think a thought but before I could over think it or analyze that thought which would make me feel bad, my body was just able to recognize that as a feeling of anxiety and shot it down."
2544,I pretty much couldn't feel anxiety and the feeling I had while I was high was me 100% without anxiety.
2545,I pretty much just cured my anxiety.
2546,"Literally, my body is recognizing my anxiety lately and not letting it affect me."
2547,I think that this could be because of the medication and maybe it literally one day just kicked in.
2548,I've been taking it for pretty much a month.
2549,When I am sober I still feel the same way about anxiety and what is bad.
2550,"**EDIT:For example, I just wanted to clarify that for the past few days I was sober and still my brain was recognizing and managing my anxiety."
2551,"I don't want people to judge me and think that I am high right now, so I got anxious."
2552,I didn't want to edit the page because people would see that I edited it.
2553,So then I just felt anxious and didn't want to do it.
2554,But my brain just then made me feel like that was stupid and I got past that initial anxiety attack and did things.
2555,I feel like my anxiety cripples me and have been depressed about it but I now understand what thoughts are bad and I understand my brain now.
2556,"Like I don't even acknowledge the thoughts anymore, I'm literally not acknowledging the anxiety in my brain."
2557,I know Reddit hates this word but I think I'm euphoric.
2558,So this is an edit explaining my thought process and how I got over it.
2559,"**

""Me a week ago would never have edited this."""
2560,This is a really powerful sentence to me.
2561,Everything in my head just clicked.
2562,Does that make sense?
2563,Or am I crazy?
2564,I typically give in to my anxiety and get frustrated and depressed about myself because I know I gave in to my anxiety but could never really put those feelings into thoughts in my head that counters out the anxiety.
2565,"I used to try to meditate, where you are supposed to not acknowledge bad thoughts."
2566,"With my anxiety, I couldn't do it."
2567,"Because of my medication, not I can."
2568,I literally control my thoughts now.
2569,"My whole life, I couldn't fathom how to control my feelings and with this medication I finally can."
2570,I feel like the chemicals in my brain that send out my anxiety are not really even being produced anymore.
2571,I get past that certain panic attack with everything I do.
2572,I've only seen life full of anxiety and I guess maybe I had REALLY bad anxiety and now the medication is making me normal and who I am.
2573,Wow.
2574,Can anyone relate?
2575,Is my medication just kicking in and is this a great success story?
2576,Or does this not make sense?
2577,Maybe I just smoke too much weed?
2578,"Please, help me out here."
2579,I appreciate it a lot.
2580,"tldr, I can now control my anxiety."
2581,I have been having to rely on my medication.
2582,"The medication is working, but it's a short term effect.."
2583,"Is there any medication that works in the long term that you take, that you think I should ask my doctor about?"
2584,"Lately, I've been feeling terrible."
2585,I've been single for my entire 22 years on this planet and I hate to see people in happy relationships.
2586,I feel trapped in my head and deeply depressed because I don't seem to have control over anything in my life.
2587,"I'm supposed to be graduating college, but I have to go back for half a year because I had to withdraw from some classes."
2588,I had to withdraw from classes because I just stopped caring about school and myself.
2589,"I'm supposed to be taking an MCAT in a month, but I'm postponing it indefinitely because I can't bring myself to study and I'm certainly not ready."
2590,I'm an obese mess because I can't keep myself motivated enough to even try to go to the gym.
2591,I eat one meal a day and its usually crap which is destroying my body.
2592,Nothing makes me happy regardless of what I try and I don't know what to do.
2593,"I see a therapist weekly but I feel like I get nowhere without medications, and even then, I don't notice any progress."
2594,I just don't know what to do with myself anymore.
2595,"I have Health Anxiety, so of course I googled up the medicine, even though I've taken it before, in fact, earlier this year."
2596,How can I calm down and take my meds?
2597,I also started meds (Pristiq) just yesterday.
2598,Thankfully with the help of medication I was able to get it under control.
2599,I've reached a stage where I'm extremely dependent on the medication to even get tired at night.
2600,So the question I have is this: Has anyone encountered medication for anxiety which doesn't have effects on your sleepiness?
2601,I'm already on a low dose of depression medication is it better to ask my doctor for a acute anxiety medicine like Xanax or try other coping methods for the attacks?
2602,However I got my diet under control and got a started on some meds.
2603,My anxiety is recognized by my primary care physician and I'm on medication.
2604,It has existed before and after my medication.
2605,I'm off meds now and stopped seeing the therapist I saw for 4 years.
2606,6 years ago I woke up one morning mid panic attack.
2607,It was the first one I'd ever had.
2608,"This continued, almost constantly for 6 months."
2609,I was in a literal constant state of panic.
2610,I called the EMTs several times a week to come check on me and would park in the ER parking lot just to feel safe.
2611,"Every time I went in I was embarrassed because of course, nothing was wrong with me, I was just having a panic attack."
2612,Eventually a psychiatrist diagnosed me with GAD and put me on Seroquel.
2613,Her reasoning was that Seroquel is a sedative.
2614,I took it at night and this way when I woke up I would still be somewhat sedated and would not be able to panic.
2615,That worked *okay* for a while.
2616,A year later a new psychiatrist decided to switch me to Lamictal to avoid some of the negative side effects of Seroquel.
2617,"I didn't question her at the time, but soon learned that was a huge mistake."
2618,The Lamictal worked well for the anxiety but I soon lost my memory nearly completely.
2619,"I couldn't remember what I'd eaten for breakfast, what conversations I just had, where I'd been, and I had to keep meticulous notes of everything I did so that I could function the next day."
2620,It was like I had amnesia.
2621,"I went in for a yearly physical and was diagnosed with a pretty bad Vit D deficiency and a ""slightly under active"" thyroid."
2622,I began a D supplement and thyroid meds.
2623,Within a week I felt great and stopped the Lamictal with no issues.
2624,I felt great physically for the next 5 years with minimal GAD relapses.
2625,"I was happy, healthy, calm, and productive."
2626,"I would occasionally experience health anxiety, but nothing like now."
2627,"I would have a symptom, google it, and convince myself something was wrong."
2628,"Sometimes I was right, but it was always minor issues that resolved themselves quickly."
2629,I was doing fine.
2630,"I knew that the months of panic years before had scarred me, made me unable to trust my body, and created some sense of physical helplessness, but it was manageable."
2631,One year ago I woke up and CRASHED physically.
2632,I had a million symptoms and it was unbearable.
2633,I had to stop taking classes and working.
2634,"This time, something was really wrong."
2635,My anxiety spun out of control and I spent all of my savings and much of my partner's on doctors and tests.
2636,All of which showed nothing.
2637,The lack of a diagnosis was maddening.
2638,I became obsessed and spent ALL of my time researching.
2639,My stress level was like nothing I had ever experienced.
2640,"I was completely convinced I was dying, and not knowing why was making me crazy."
2641,"FINALLY things began to come together, slowly."
2642,"I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's, then needed more thyroid meds, then adrenal fatigue, then Epstein Barr Virus, and that's likely not the end of it."
2643,This is after nearly a year.
2644,"All of these conditions are likely the result of extreme stress, both anxiety and lifestyle related."
2645,So now here I am.
2646,I'm actually sick.
2647,I'm trying to balance hormones which is maddening in and of itself.
2648,Every week I have a new symptom.
2649,"Some can be explained by my illnesses, some can't."
2650,I am in a constant state of panic over my health.
2651,It has completely taken over my life.
2652,"One of the most difficult parts for me is that if I hadn't been like this, and done my own research, sought out specific doctors, ordered my own tests, I would still be undiagnosed, untreated, and much, much sicker."
2653,The illnesses have reinforced my obsession with my health and now I can't stop.
2654,I've learned that I can't trust doctors and I MUST obsess over it to get anywhere.
2655,I feel like I have to find the root cause of every single thing I feel or things will spiral like they did originally.
2656,Today is my birthday.
2657,I'm out of town in a hotel in an attempt to celebrate but I've already had a breakdown over my health.
2658,"I woke up today with a new symptom, seemingly unrelated to the others."
2659,I simply can not emotionally handle illness of any kind anymore.
2660,The stress makes me sicker and makes many other symptoms worse.
2661,I can't get out of these thought patterns.
2662,I can't stop thinking about it.
2663,I'm paralyzed with anxiety and fear.
2664,"I have NEVER been a suicidal person, but lately it crosses my mind as a way to escape."
2665,"I of course would never to that, but it's terrifying that I'm in a place where that feels like relief compared to my reality."
2666,I'm in therapy but my therapist doesn't seem to be of much help with this.
2667,"She told me to take my klonapin, but because of my issues, I HATE medications and will avoid them until there is no other option."
2668,How do you cope with long-term anxiety?
2669,How do you get over health anxiety?
2670,There are no relevant groups in my area and none of the psychologists specialize in it.
2671,I just picked up my medication and I've never had it before.
2672,I know never to mix the two but with my problem I want this medication to help as soon as possible
2673,"I have been irritable, unreasonable and weepy for about 3 weeks now (I was on the medication for 9 weeks before I quit)."
2674,"Anyways, medication sounds like it could be a good idea."
2675,I am not currently on any meds due to only recently having started with my health professional and I have been given relaxation techniques but I find myself worried over my work and my job and providing for my wife and baby.
2676,"I thought I would share my experience with my medication in the hopes that it may help someone, or at the very least resonate with people."
2677,"Obviously medication isn't for everyone, but it definitely saved my life."
2678,Hate being dependent on medicine to keep me rational.
2679,Back on meds but not Paxil.
2680,Came off meds.
2681,I'm back on meds.
2682,She is on medication for it.
2683,"Anyway I post again asking for any assistance, I've had it recomended to me to try to come off of paxatine to try new medication, but paxatine is well known as a heavy side effect drug to come off of, I've lowered my dose from 40mg to 30mg and am alredy feeling like hell."
2684,I bought some generic Tylenol Cold Multi-Symptom Daytime and Nighttime cold medicine.
2685,"I started having chain panic attacks shortly after my first dose, and they lasted for hours until the medicine finally wore off."
2686,"It didn't take me too long to catch on that the meds must have caused it, so I looked up the ingredients."
2687,"Some side effects are worth researching, and I'll be sure to check out the ingredients in my replacement cold medicine prior to purchasing for sure."
2688,It's completely infeasible for me to meet with a doctor to get any kind of meds.
2689,Later this month I will be going to see my old psychologist and looking at medication for the first time in four years.
2690,The people at the place I go to have told my mom that medicine is an option that can be discussed later.
2691,Can medicine help me?
2692,"And no meds, no way of getting them."
2693,I waned off both the meds and therapy only to find myself back drowning in it as soon as college started.
2694,"I got back on the meds and I've been completely fine, until last week."
2695,"Hey everyone,

As per my doctor's recommendation I'm slowly weaning off my medication that I've been on for +/- 10 years (Paxil 40mg), to be put on another medication, and I was wondering what kind of things to expect (physical sensations, moods, etc)?"
2696,I hope the medicine helps soon.
2697,She has gone to see psychologists and psychiatrists and she is currently on a few different forms of medication.
2698,Hi people.
2699,"Male, 20 y/o, no psychiatric diagnoses/medications."
2700,"My SO has surgery in a week, a simple septoplastic procedure on her nose because one nostril is closed and she can't breathe through it."
2701,"It's about one hour long, nothing extremely dangerous, but I'm so so concerned about the anesthesia that I can't function normally."
2702,"I fear that she will have long-term consequences because of it, and I can't even hear the word surgery or anesthesia without becoming instantly detached from the real world and closing into mine own and becoming instantly depressed."
2703,"I know it will be only an hour long, but I can't get my mind off the thoughts that what if she will have consequences because of it."
2704,"I'm a nurse, so I know what she will get and what will the effects be."
2705,"Even though she will be okay in a day or two, I'm living in fear and anxiety."
2706,"I can't do it anymore, I have constant watery eyes and dark thoughts about this."
2707,"Please, help me, before I freak out because of this."
2708,"But please, I beg you, don't mention any of the words I stated that I can't hear/read."
2709,"It's a weird proposal, but I'd be very grateful if you could respect it."
2710,Thank you again.
2711,"She told them she takes klonopin and paxil, which are, if you don't know, anti-anxiety and anti-depressant meds."
2712,"She's been on some form of anxiety medication (she won't tell me what it is) for about a week, and I like to think it's getting better."
2713,I told my boss I was on prescribed medicine before I took the test.
2714,"To be honest, I am quite scared of taking a medication that is going to hide or change my emotions."
2715,"Also, I don’t want to become dependent on this medication every single day (for the rest of my life) to have a happy life."
2716,I am prepared to stop so that I can get used to my new medicine and so that in four weeks my doctor can make a clear evaluation.
2717,Should I have to worry about smoking while on my medication?
2718,"I know that serotonin syndrome is a risk in combining these meds, but doc says it is very minimal and I would be slowly increasing the amount of Elavil I'm taking daily until it was at an ideal level for me."
2719,"With therapy and medication, I've come to realize that those kinds of thoughts were caused by the anxiety, and were not an actual reflection of reality."
2720,I was feeling sick and having panic attacks over calling in.
2721,I get paranoid that they won't believe me and I'll get fired.
2722,"2 weeks ago I had pneumonia, and had a doctors note."
2723,I ended up missing 4 days.
2724,"Well the last two days I was getting extreme cramps from endometriosis, so I called in and took painkillers and passed out."
2725,Today I went in to go back to work even though I was still feeling sick.
2726,"They fired me when I walked in today because im too ""unreliable"" Total call ins in the last 6 months: 6."
2727,"4 from pneumonia, and 2 from my cramps."
2728,I had doctors notes though.
2729,I was ordered to stay home.
2730,"The manager kept comparing me to the other employees.. ""well Kris has an IUD and cramps and still comes and I have vertigo so you can come to work!!"""
2731,I can't seem to keep any jobs...
2732,I always get fired over the stupidest reasons.
2733,Walmart fired me for missing a week when my dad died- right before turning in my fmla paperwork.
2734,"I was fired from a hotel after a manager grabbed my sleeved arms, rolled them up exposing my cuts at the time and said ""if you are serious you would do it down the road and not across the street"" causing me to flip and attempt suicide at work and get fired."
2735,My last job I was fired for trying to report the owner to the health department because he was too lazy to clean the meat slicer.
2736,I was just diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and told my job I was having a hard time with medications.
2737,I have been constantly feeling like shit but still went to work and busted my ass.
2738,Its such bullshit I then get fired for being so sick I can't leave my apartment without having my fiance carry me.
2739,edit: well i messed up the title/tag thing.
2740,Sorry :(
2741,I knew at the time he had anxiety problems and was taking medication from it.
2742,"He told me a bit about is problems, but since he was on meds, symptoms were never really an issue."
2743,About a month ago he told me that he felt really confident and that he decided that he was happy enough that he didn't need his meds anymore.
2744,I'm destructive to those around me; when i'm off my meds i just cant control.
2745,I know that since he is only recently coming off his meds (been coming off for about 8 weeks now) he may be suffering from withdraw.
2746,I'm taking meds for depression an anxiety and that seems to be going ok.
2747,"The doctor put me on Citalopram for a month, just to test out if it'll help me with my anxiety and stress."
2748,Needless to say I loved it and it has greatly improved how I feel.
2749,"Problem is, when I was given a 3 month dose, I went to a different place for my medicine for convenience."
2750,The pills are entirely different and I feel that they are completely ineffective.
2751,"I've been taking them for over a week now and can feel myself draining back down, getting irritable and stress eating again, I'm back to sleeping 13 hours a day and I feel all my energy is gone again."
2752,I still had a couple of pills left over from my first month and on the days I take those I feel great but I'm down to 2 of those.
2753,At this point I'm unsure of what to do.
2754,"I don't know if its the fact that the pills are packaged differently and look different that's screwing with me or if its the pills themselves, and then how do I fix this?"
2755,Would it be alright to call the doctor and explain what happened?
2756,I don't see the doctor again for 3 months and I cant imagine feeling this horrible for another 3 months of my life.
2757,Anyone have this sort of problem with generic medicines?
2758,What did you do to fix this?
2759,"Hello, people."
2760,"I'm a 30 y/o biology postdoc (woman), with a 10 y/o history of GAD and panic disorder (under treatment with .75 mg Xanax/2 die and 100 mg Venlafaxine HCl/die, no psychotherapy) and a past diagnosis of major depression (treated at the time with fluoxetine and psychotherapy)."
2761,"I have a very unfortunate job, both high-pressure and low-pay, which I love very much but also is my main trigger."
2762,"I've always had sleep-related issues (difficulty maintaining sleep, 7/8 wakings/night), but I've never taken specific medications besides melatonin."
2763,"Lately, though, I have developed a new symptom, that's basically rendering me non-functional during the day: nightmares."
2764,"The episodes are now occurring basically every night and are *very* vivid, not to mention lingering in the wakeful state."
2765,The dreams are almost all work related and reflect my well-known insecurities (i.e.
2766,": humiliation in the workplace, failure in reaching my goals and deadlines, public exposure of personal failings, etc)."
2767,The problem is that these dreams have me waking up feeling already physically and mentally exhausted and incapable of falling back into sleep.
2768,"I am constantly tired, sleepy and on edge."
2769,My eyes hurt and I'm starting to become avoidant again.
2770,"On top of that, remembering and ruminating on these dreams during the day has triggered a wave of panic attacks like I've never experienced before (almost daily episodes)."
2771,"I can't take sick days and the thought of going to work after the nightmares kills me, especially if they happen in the morning."
2772,"I can't stand the thought of facing the people I've dreamt about, because of the lingering hurt and betrayal I still feel."
2773,You can just imagine how unproductive I've become.
2774,"So, all in all, I am experiencing a new low in my symptoms, even if my anxiety has always been generally very high, constant and poorly manageable."
2775,I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in two weeks to adjust the therapy to fit the rise in the basal levels of anxiety and the increase in the panic episodes.
2776,"In particular, I would like to switch from Xanax to another drug, since it seems I reached the tolerance limit (it's not effective at all anymore for long-term management and I'm starting to feel withdrawal symptoms if I take my drops just a couple of hours later than usual)."
2777,"I also suspect that the nightmares could be a withdrawal symptom from Xanax itself, since they mostly happen in the morning, when the evening dose has weened off."
2778,Has this ever happened to anyone?
2779,"TL;DR: new low in anxiety levels, started having nightly incapacitating nightmares, need to switch from Xanax because I suspect it's the cause."
2780,What do?
2781,"My apologies up front, this is long."
2782,Please tell me if this isn't the appropriate place for this.
2783,"My Mum (65) is one of my (36F) best friends and I love her very much, but she's also driving me up the wall."
2784,"I honestly don't know how to address this with her without upsetting her and/or making it all worse, so I'm hoping you can advise me."
2785,"Mum has always been very capable, travelling around the country to teach design and embroidery and quilting techniques, and is generally a fantastic artist."
2786,"A few years ago, she started having random heart palpitations and dizzy spells, sometimes panic attacks, often when driving."
2787,"She saw her doctor and had tests, but nothing physical showed up."
2788,"She started to dread travelling but continued to do it, because she had made commitments."
2789,I live two hours away from her.
2790,I work and have two kids so it's not always easy for me to travel to visit her.
2791,But her increasing anxiety with travelling has made it difficult for her to come to us.
2792,I'm frequently hearing about how much she misses us and how fast the kids are growing.
2793,"Meanwhile, Mum's sister has been diagnosed with depression and has been on therapy and medications."
2794,"Mum's relationship with her sister is complicated, mostly due to their mother being a manipulative cow who intentionally tries to make them fight (I've been reading Raised by Narcissists and think it might fit her behaviour)."
2795,My theory is that both Aunt's depression and Mum's anxiety are a result of their mother manipulating them their entire lives.
2796,"(Sorry, I'm indulging in a lot of amateur psychology here but it fits, in my mind.)"
2797,"About six months ago, Mum was driving up to visit her mother (about six hours away), got an hour up the road, had heart palpitations and a panic attack, turned around and went home."
2798,She's essentially stopped driving since then.
2799,"She will pop up to the shops or go somewhere local, but driving to my place or to visit her Mum is out of the question."
2800,"She either catches the train or gets Dad to drive her, but the whole thing is a BIG DEAL."
2801,"Recently, she's having the attacks at home too."
2802,"She used to be okay in her own space, but that's clearly no longer the case."
2803,It's just getting worse.
2804,"She keeps trying to explain it away by saying it's the antibiotics she's on or something else, but it doesn't make any sense."
2805,"She's not sleeping property, often waking at 3am or 4am and not being able to get back to sleep, so she's tired all the time, which makes her even more reluctant to go anywhere."
2806,But here's the problem - she will not see a therapist about it.
2807,"Her sister suggested it to her a while ago because it has helped her with her depression, but because Mum is not on the best terms with her sister at the moment, she rejected the idea."
2808,"When I suggested therapy, I was told I was being disloyal for agreeing with my Aunt."
2809,I've tried a few times since then and get shut down each time.
2810,"So we're in this situation now where she wants to visit me and the kids, but each time she does it's a big deal."
2811,"The most recent issue arose when she made a huge deal of coming to visit us on Christmas morning, despite the fact we were all coming to her on Boxing Day."
2812,"She has bronchitis and should have cancelled, but didn't because it was so important to her to see us."
2813,It didn't occur to me to cancel because she said she wasn't contagious and I trusted her judgement.
2814,And now me and both my kids (including my five month old) have bronchitis.
2815,It was absolutely not malicious on her part but she's letting her anxiety control her so much that she is making bad decisions.
2816,And I'm left not being able to trust her judgement anymore.
2817,I just don't know what to do.
2818,"She's getting worse, she's becoming incapable of dealing with her life, and I just want her to be her old capable self, or at least learn some coping techniques or find some medication which could help."
2819,"There's a selfish element to this too - I expect her to live for decades to come while my Dad isn't terribly healthy, so I'm afraid that at a certain point I'm going to be primarily responsible for helping her."
2820,I love her very much and I don't want to start resenting her.
2821,She will have all the support I have to give if she would just get some help!
2822,I have no idea how to approach this now.
2823,I've written a few letters to her about it but not sent them.
2824,I'm hoping you lovely people can make a suggestion.
2825,Did your family approach you?
2826,How would you do it?
2827,I'm almost frustrated enough to make ultimatums but I really can't see that actually helping.
2828,How can I help her?
2829,She keeps telling herself she's coping but she just isn't.
2830,"Edit: oh yeah, don't read my post history."
2831,I was really mad about this a few nights ago and posted about this to /r/breakingmum.
2832,"The language was a little ... saltier, lol."
2833,"I realize that I should speak with a psychiatrist --and trust me, I will not take medication without the assistance of a trained professional-- but I was wondering about my fellow Redditors experiences with Lexapro..."
2834,"I've never taken any meds since then, other than birth control."
2835,"So recently I was taking some medication and while on the medication I was experiencing eye twitches(standard side effect of the medication) and the occasional muscle twitch in my arm, doctor said that was caused by tiredness."
2836,I don't feel like I need therapy or meds on a general basis as I am still functional.
2837,"I have been on meds since November, but I am still feeling suicidal."
2838,"I have been agoraphobic with panic disorder for 23 years (agoraphobic on and off, the last 6 years on) and although I do have a doctor for meds for anxiety, I have not had therapy in 7 years."
2839,I'm 24 and haven't taken medication before for any of my issues.
2840,"I wasn't doing great, but I was a bit better when I was on medication, seeing my doctor &amp; a therapist."
2841,all this happened when i started medication and therapy.
2842,I can't tell if I'm just worry way to much about things or if I should call the doctor and get some medication.
2843,"I have an appointment this Friday to discuss the medication with my GP, but I'm curious if this is normal or not?"
2844,And I've been getting headaches and intense dreams after finishing up the meds.
2845,Hi everyone.
2846,I haven't really posted since my [Rant] two months ago.
2847,But things have improved greatly for me since then.
2848,Today I posted to my old blog for the first time since last April.
2849,I had dropped it like a hot potato because it had become a minor stressor.
2850,Today I posted and told everyone about my anxiety and subsequent breakdown last summer.
2851,I feels like a weight is gone from my shoulders.
2852,"I thought I'd copy and paste the text here, in the hopes that someone might be inspired or even just feel better."
2853,Please note that I will not take offense if you don't want to read the following wall o' text.
2854,Sometimes a wall of text is just too irritating to read.
2855,If anyone wants to see the blog post in situ (there are kitty pictures at the end) you can find it here: [blog post](http://minikatslittlethoughts.blogspot.com/2013/01/breakdown-and-resolutions.html).
2856,"For those who would rather just read the **wall of text** without leaving Reddit, here it is: 


&gt;It's taken me a long time to be able to even think about writing this post."
2857,Life for me has changed drastically since last April and I've had to make several changes along the way in order to progress.
2858,"Before I go into any details, I would like to state a few things."
2859,&gt;* This will be the one and only post about this topic.
2860,"The journey is difficult and private, but I felt I should explain my absence to my blog-friends."
2861,"A few of you have emailed me privately and gotten the run down already, so this will be old news along with new news."
2862,* This will be the only post that's made on a non-Sunday this year.
2863,More on that is a bit.
2864,"* For the animal lovers here, Pollux and Artie are still doing well."
2865,They've been joined by a sweet little calico named Pixel.
2866,I'll get to her further down.
2867,"******

&gt;Many of you know that I live with a few physical medical conditions."
2868,"They make my life a little harder in some ways, and easier in others."
2869,I take them in stride.
2870,However I've never really talked about living with anxiety disorders.
2871,It's not something I enjoying talking about randomly and honestly for a long time they were under control.
2872,I live with GAD [Generalized Anxiety Disorder] and a mild (if one can call it that) form of PTSD [Post-traumatic stress disorder].
2873,"Without going into too many personal details, I will say that I was abused as a child."
2874,The resulting anxiety was made worse by being on the lower rung of the pecking order in school and being bullied constantly.
2875,&gt;Years of therapy when I was younger made all the difference in the world for me.
2876,Back then the medications for anxiety were in their infancy and not covered by insurance.
2877,They also had some interesting complications for individuals going through puberty.
2878,And back then it was decided I didn't need them.
2879,I wasn't as stressed and therapy alone taught me wonderful ways to combat my fears and actually live every day.
2880,&gt;(Now of course the medication available for mental illness are a godsend.
2881,"They can help take away the brunt of the pain and anguish, leaving therapy and personal determination to deal with the rest."
2882,"I will state that not everyone with a mental illness has access to either therapy or medications, which I believe is a crying shame."
2883,But that's not what this post is about.)
2884,&gt;Anxiety is a funny thing.
2885,It can creep up on you and sinuously wind deeper and deeper into your heart and mind.
2886,"It can be so subtle, the changes are unnoticeable even to those closest to you."
2887,It can also hit you like a freight train loaded with bricks.
2888,"The panic, the chest pains, the sudden fear in seeing that your world is going to absolute hell around you."
2889,"The horrifying dreams in which you relived your abuses and cannot take control of the dream, no matter what you try."
2890,"It can be a mix of the two, creating an emotional roller coaster of fear."
2891,&gt;Stress plays a huge part in controlled anxiety getting out of control.
2892,"And so I found myself loosing control of the beast, existing in a fog of fear and doubt, and having more and more external stresses heaped upon me."
2893,"More stress than someone without anxiety issues would want to handle: Friends severely ill, some passing away; my father's health declining; worrying about my mother's health as she takes on more of a parental role to her husband; money troubles from all the past veterinary bills; missing my lost critters more and more every day; FH's stress levels from working too hard for too long without a break; needing to find the time to finish projects, including the Panda Nursery and completely overhaul the Guild's webpage."
2894,All this and more.
2895,"&gt;As time went on, even the little every-day things became major stressors."
2896,"Getting the laundry washed, dried, AND put away before the shirts wrinkled."
2897,"Remembering to get Pollux's medications refilled on time, not to mention getting him to not vomit up said medications."
2898,Artie's energy level and desire to play making him into more of a bully than a companion to Pollux.
2899,Physically going to the grocery stores and dealing with the crowds of people.
2900,"Picking up a needle to stitch when the trash needed going out, but it was pouring down rain and I'd left my raincoat in FH's car."
2901,"Trying to get the workroom organized so I could use it because I'd seen a neat how-to on another blog and wanted to play, but I was needed down south for several days."
2902,&gt;In July I had a nervous breakdown.
2903,&gt;It was all just too much.
2904,And I couldn't handle it all on my own.
2905,I also knew I couldn't make FH carry the weight alone.
2906,"He's my partner, not my doctor."
2907,And I wanted my life back.
2908,Simply existing through a day wasn't enough.
2909,I wanted to live.
2910,&gt;So I talked to our doctor and was given a short-term medication.
2911,"It's highly addictive and not meant to be taken for more than a few months straight or as a ""rescue"" during times of intense anxiety."
2912,But it bought me time and gave me relief enough to do some research into other medications.
2913,And to find a secular therapist in this area who specializes in my type of illness and who works with our insurance.
2914,"**As an aside, I won't be mentioning the specific medications, as every person's body chemistry is different."
2915,What works for me may not work for someone else.
2916,"&gt;We took a vacation in August to Copper Harbor, Michigan."
2917,"An actual vacation, the first in seven years, which was both good and bad for me."
2918,Good because I could relax seeing FH relax and because life's about living.
2919,"Bad because I was worried about Pollux and Artie, and the house, and my parents, and because we were camping."
2920,There was dirt.
2921,Lots of dirt.
2922,My dislike of dirt being anywhere near my bed was a difficult aspect of the trip.
2923,However the scenery helped to make up for it.
2924,"That and the location was so remote, FH would have to drive up a mountain to call into work."
2925,"Needless to say, that only happened once so he could tell them there wasn't cell signal."
2926,"He relaxed a lot, which helped me relax."
2927,Also our best friend was with us.
2928,"There were walks along beaches, toasted marshmallows sandwiched between chocolate mint cookies, and blueberry cobbler in the dutchy."
2929,Also it let FH go and do things with someone when I just wanted to sit under a tree and read.
2930,"But we had some wonderful adventures on the trip, including getting pictures of Lambeau Field on our way up."
2931,"Happily our route took us right through Green Bay, WI."
2932,"&gt;When came home, fate had a surprise for me."
2933,"We'd been talking about getting another kitten to keep Artie company (and relieve pressure on Pollux) for a few weeks prior, but knew we should wait until after we got home from Michigan."
2934,"Besides, the pet sitter didn't need to deal with a kitten who wasn't sure of it's new environment on top of dealing with Artie who hates strangers and Pollux who hates being  medicated."
2935,"A couple of weeks after we came home, I received a text message from a friend."
2936,Her daughter had found a kitten trying to get warm under the hood of a car.
2937,A calico whose markings reminded my friend of Confetti's.
2938,"After she sent me a picture, FH knew the deal was made."
2939,I drove 100 miles the next morning to get her and have her tested for FIV and leukemia.
2940,The tests were negative and I brought her home.
2941,She didn't have a name until later that night when we came up with Pixel.
2942,She's been an important ray of sunlight and hope for me since then.
2943,&gt;Shortly thereafter we (our doctor and I) started playing with new medications.
2944,Firstly I had to wean off of the short-term drug.
2945,"The got interesting with nightmares, bursts of anxiety, and just not feeling well."
2946,The first long-term medication we tried actually made me depressed as a side effect.
2947,"I didn't notice quite what was happening, because the anxiety wasn't there, and that's what we wanted."
2948,However I wasn't making anything.
2949,My doctor knew there was a problem when she walked into the exam room and I was playing solitaire on my phone instead of stitching.
2950,We switched to another medicine that night and suddenly I felt like myself again.
2951,It was like flipping a switch.
2952,"I could go to bed when FH did and get up before noon, I wanted to work on projects again, and the anxiety was more of a faded echo in the back of my head."
2953,That was at the beginning of December.
2954,&gt;It's important to remember that anxiety doesn't just affect you either.
2955,It's something that everyone you love and who loves you has to deal with.
2956,Dearest FH knew about my past before we even started dating.
2957,"He dealt with the fears, the night terrors, the few and far between days when I just couldn't stand the thought of being alone."
2958,Now he's dealing with them more often.
2959,Happily for both of us I am getting better.
2960,He's watched me become the person I was all over again and be happy again.
2961,&gt;I've had to make several changes in the way I do things.
2962,"I've had to remember how to say, ""No, I can't do ____ right now."""
2963,I've had to make conscious efforts to use the almost forgotten techniques I learned in therapy all those years ago to calm myself down when the world starts to close in on me.
2964,"Things I used to do all the time, but over time got out of the habit of doing because I didn't have time."
2965,"And honestly, I'd pushed the past out of my head because I didn't want it to own me."
2966,That's part of where I went wrong for myself.
2967,"What I needed to do was grasp it with both hands, dig my nails into it, and own it instead."
2968,It doesn't need to define me for me to own it either.
2969,I just can't let myself forget that controlling it means owning it.
2970,&gt;I know I will have good days and bad days.
2971,Everyone does.
2972,It's just that my bad days can be worse than the average person's in some ways.
2973,The goals here is to make the bad days fewer and farther between and to not let the bad control me.
2974,"******

&gt;This post isn't just about all the ups and downs."
2975,It's also about my goals for this year.
2976,"They are as follows:

* Keep getting better."
2977,Notice there is no timetable here.
2978,"It will happen as it happens, no sooner."
2979,But every day I'll be working toward a positive direction.
2980,"* Once a week I will finish some type of creative project, big or small it matters not."
2981,"It can be a single miniature, a roombox, a section of a dollhouse, a cross stitch, a quilt, playing with a new technique... you get the idea."
2982,"It doesn't matter what it is, what matters is a completed project and with it, a feeling of gratification."
2983,"IF I happen to finish more than one project in a week, good for me."
2984,But that doesn't mean the counter isn't reset on Sunday.
2985,I will have to finish another one the following week.
2986,It's time for a little tough love on myself.
2987,I'm ready for it.
2988,* Every Sunday this year I will blog about the above mentioned project(s) that was finished during the week.
2989,I will only be posting on Sundays as to limit the amount of pressure on myself to take pictures and write.
2990,"I'm hoping that by next year I'll be able to post more often, but for now once a week will be enough."
2991,There will also be the occasional photo of my feline helpers of course.
2992,One cannot work without snoop-ervision.
2993,&gt;I just want to thank people for reading this wall of text.
2994,It hasn't been easy to write.
2995,"Tomorrow I'll be starting my weekly Sunday post with a some gorgeous things I've finished this first week of January."""
2996,I just had an anxiety dream about work.
2997,I just feel like I need to share it in order to make myself feel better and this seemed like a good place to do it.
2998,Also if anyone has any tips on how to reduce your stress after waking from an anxiety dream that would be awesome.
2999,"I work in a group home for people with intellectual disabilities and when giving meds we have a 2 hour window to do so (so if it's an 8pm med then you have from 7 until 9), if it's outside the window you get a med error."
3000,Basically in the dream I had waited until the last minute to give meds so I had 15 minutes to do the meds for the four individuals.
3001,For whatever reason as I was frantically searching for all the supplies a random group of people showed up and were just standing around not helping me at all.
3002,At one point I was yelling at them to turn the lights on so I could read the medications and pop them in the med cup.
3003,No one did a thing.
3004,So after I got up and turned the lights on and went back to doing meds I started to hyperventilate in my dream.
3005,"Basically I began to have an anxiety attack in the middle of my dream, not in real life, just my dream."
3006,And that's what triggered me to wake up.
3007,"This was probably one of my more unpleasant dreams, definitely worse than most of my nightmares."
3008,"Then, in the fall of 2013, I started trying out different meds, to see if I could find one that worked better for me."
3009,"So how this relates to meds: Leaving the hospital, the doctors wanted me on no narcotics."
3010,"This is pretty rough considering I had loads of broken bones -2 burst vertebrae, 2 broken vertebrae, 4 broken ribs, cracked manubrium, broken ulna and radius- and am now off opiate pain meds."
3011,**UPDATE:** I ought to add that BuSpar isn't my first medication.
3012,"Ive been doing well with them lately, ive noticed that once I have tappered off my meds (Paxil and Xanex) that the severity of the panic attacks have gone down."
3013,"I really want to try anxiety meds again, but I know I did not trust myself with them 3 years ago."
3014,"I'm on medicine for my anxiety, effexor XR, and it's working pretty well for me."
3015,"I have tried therapy, medication etc."
3016,As my education is being effected now I decided to go on medication and using beta blockers is probably a place to start.
3017,"everyday from there out till today id wake up and have crappy thoughts and feel crap, feel sick in the stomach and vomit and go to the toilet all the time ""Number 2"" on Saturday and Sunday i would fell amazing and normal so i always looked forward to it, however i did not seek help because i thought what i experienced everyday was normal as it runs in my family and my dad and his dad has it, other symptoms i get is freezing feet, always tired, horrible memory, horrible concentration, and always think something bad iss going to happen eg, house burn down :Z.

anyhow i am now 19 and seeing a therapist and started taking Paroxatine 14 days ago i have yet to see any improvement but i know medication takes time 6 weeks at least."
3018,"i have come to terms that my anxiety will not go away i am just hoping that the medication at least aids in the severity of it, and the therapy gives me techniques on how to deal with it which therapy is all about."
3019,So I am pretty new to reddit and I decided to look up this subreddit and one of the greatest ways for me to deal with my anxiety is to tell everyone about it.
3020,"So you can read this if you like, and I do have some questions."
3021,"So my mother suffers from anxiety, one of my grandma's is bipolar, and my other grandma was depressed when she was alive."
3022,"Mental illness runs in my family, so when I began to show signs of anxiety is was not a big deal since I was used to my mother."
3023,"My dad is a very rational person, and growing up I was able to handle my anxiety using the part of my brain that I feel I got from him."
3024,"I don't worry about tests or social settings, what I get severe anxiety about is relationships with SOs and friends/family."
3025,"I remember my first real panic attack was freshman year when I thought my cousin was cheating on her boyfriend, who had become a part of our family."
3026,I couldn't eat or sleep until I confronted her and found out the truth.
3027,"Two years later, in my junior year, I began my first serious relationship with an older guy."
3028,"It was a long distance relationship, so it got real serious real fast."
3029,He was my first love and we worshiped each other.
3030,"We never argued and we talked about getting married, which was ridiculous but we were so caught up in our love that it felt normal."
3031,"Plus he had his own problems which I know now, but that is besides the point."
3032,"Anyways one day, I just started questioning my feelings for him."
3033,"As far as I can remember, nothing triggered it."
3034,"I think it was because I was emotionally unstable during the times we werent together, and something must of just been triggered in my brain."
3035,"I asked myself if I really loved him, or if he really was the one."
3036,"For a week, I vomited every night and cried."
3037,I couldn't eat or sleep.
3038,Finally my mom took me to the doctor and I got prescribed with zolaft because that is what my mom takes.
3039,"Eventually the pills allowed me to deal with everyday life, but the anxiety would still come back every so often."
3040,The guy ended up not being able to deal with and turned insecure and mean.
3041,"So I ended it with him, and was doing very good for awhile."
3042,"When I got into my senior year, I began dating a new guy."
3043,This relationship was a real test for my anxiety because his friends were constantly trash talking me behind my back and he was in some ways a pushover.
3044,"I had panic attacks, but I was still able to deal with every day life, and I attribute that to my medication."
3045,"I didn't vomit, and I was able to sleep and eat."
3046,I constantly questioned his feelings for me and eventually I began questioning my feelings for him.
3047,"However, this time around I was able to recognize that these feelings were irrational and they were not how I truly felt."
3048,"Luckily, this guy was able to handle it for the most part, but his inability to stand up for me drove me nuts."
3049,"Unrelated to our relationship, on Valentines day I was working and I started questioning the point of my life if I wake up feeling like this everyday (the anxiety)."
3050,I had an emotional breakdown at work because I was seriously considering ending my life.
3051,I called my best friend who deals with anxiety and she told me to tell my work.
3052,Luckily my work really took care of me and I called my mom to come pick me up because I was in no state to drive home.
3053,She was in a panic because I was vague on the phone but when I told her my thoughts it even worried her more (remember she has anxiety).
3054,I went to see my doctor and I had realized that I had had a negative reaction to the zolaft after a year of being on it.
3055,"I knew that those feelings were not me, because I am a very positive person."
3056,Since then I have been on effexor and I feel similar to how I felt when my zolaft was working.
3057,I know I should see a therapist and I am working on doing that.
3058,The week between the two medications was crazy.
3059,"My anxiety was very high, but I had this unlimited amount of energy."
3060,"I could sleep, but I didn't have to."
3061,I was able to get so much more work done with school and I just felt productive.
3062,Right now I am in college and feel like I procrastinate and don't get anything done.
3063,I want to get off my medication because I feel like I could do better in school.
3064,"However, I cannot handle relationships with my anxiety."
3065,"I eventually broke up with my boyfriend, and I had another one recently who broke up with me and I think it was because of my anxiety."
3066,I want to get off of my medication but I don't think I can every be in a romantic relationship without it.
3067,"I constantly question my own feelings and their feelings for me, and you guys will know how easy it is for our minds to spiral out of control."
3068,"My two questions are: 
Have you dealt with this inability to handle relationships due to your anxiety?"
3069,"and
Do you think it is smart to get off my medication if it is clearly helping me deal with everyday life?"
3070,I'm a 21 year old woman who has never been diagnosed with anxiety.
3071,"However, I think I probably have it."
3072,I get stressed about very small things *very* easily.
3073,"For example, simply thinking about the act of reading another chapter of my textbook when I'm taking a difficult college course will make my chest feel tight."
3074,"It's a weird feeling... it doesn't hurt, really, but it feels very uncomfortable."
3075,"Additionally, talking to 4+ people at a time or doing anything new makes me feel lightheaded and shaky."
3076,The shakiness is the worst part of all this for me.
3077,I'm a nursing student starting in three weeks (woo!
3078,"), but I'm so very scared of trying to do *anything* practical like learning catheter insertion because my hands shake so much when I'm nervous."
3079,It's more frustrating than anything because I'm scared to death that I'm going to fail nursing school; we only get TWO CHANCES to do things right during skills evaluation.
3080,What if my shaky hands mess me up?
3081,Talk about scary.
3082,"To get to the point (sorry about all that, it's just new to me to stop beating myself up over the way I am): I want to see a doctor."
3083,"I'm going to have health insurance again very soon, and I want to fix this, at least for nursing school."
3084,"The only problem is that I simply do not have time for therapy or any quality, long-term treatment."
3085,"With an insanely demanding nursing program, helping my aging grandmother out, housework, and sleeping, I just don't have any more time to devote."
3086,I'm wondering if medication could be the best option for now.
3087,I just don't want to visit a doctor and tell them I just want meds because I don't have time for therapy... That seems a little sketchy.
3088,"I don't know if it seems sketchy to doctors or not, but hey, I'm from a bad neighborhood."
3089,I guess I just assume the worst where drugs are involved.
3090,How do I approach the topic with my physician?
3091,I'm pretty new to this.
3092,"For those of you taking medications, could you share your experiences?"
3093,How much does it help?
3094,Are there any side effects you really don't like?
3095,"How long does it take to ""work""?"
3096,Any information you would be willing to share with me would be awesome.
3097,"**TL;DR I need to ""fix"" my anxiety, but I don't have the time/money for therapy."
3098,How can I talk to my doctor about taking medication without seeming like a potential drug abuser?
3099,**
3100,"It's been treated on and off since I was 12 or so, first just the symptoms-migraines, dizzy spells, etc., but I was finally diagnosed and got appropriate meds around age 30."
3101,My SO is super supportive and was pretty much responsible for my finally getting the right doctors and meds.
3102,Should I get my meds adjusted or changed?
3103,"I told my friend about this though and she was making a big deal out of it asking how do I know that it's from the anxiety and meds, it could be something serious and I need to talk to my doctor because even if it is a side effect, it's a serious side effect."
3104,"I'm pretty sure it's maybe more apparent because of the meds and as my ""issues"" have gotten more serious, I've become a ton more anxious."
3105,"And if so, what medicine do you think would work for me (if the Concerta is part of the issue)?"
3106,So I'll try to keep this short.
3107,"A short background on me, I have always had a level of anxiety, but only in college did it rear up really bad and become debilitating."
3108,"I entered therapy about a year and some change ago, it's helping a little but I'm still honestly really struggling."
3109,Tried benzos for a short period and they weren't really effective (tried xanax and valium) due to the gnarly side effects.
3110,"I exercise regularly and try to eat as best as I can (my main symptoms are lack of appetite, GI symptoms and vomiting)."
3111,"So essentially, I'm going back to school tomorrow at a new college, and I've been struggling all week anticipating it."
3112,"I'm kind of dealing with it OK, as long as I keep my head down and ride out the panic attacks alone."
3113,"I can't be around others right now, as it increases my anxiety."
3114,My social anxiety really destroyed my social life--I haven't been able to make any new friends since I started therapy because I'm pretty unreliable (I need lots of time alone to cope).
3115,"The friends I do have are long-term friends and know about my issue so don't expect a lot from me, and I give them what I can, which is basically hanging out once every couple of weeks, for a few hours."
3116,"The trouble is, when I can get myself to go out and be comfortable and relax (for example, class) I appear really social and normal, and lots of people want to be friends with me."
3117,"But as soon as they ask me to hang out another time (""hey, what are you doing this Friday?"
3118,Want to go on a hike?
3119,"""), I panic and run."
3120,"It's a big, big issue."
3121,Even texts strike fear into my whole being.
3122,The problem I'm having that caused me to write this post is that distant acquaintances (potential new friends) have been contacting me this week just by chance.
3123,"They are asking me to participate in projects (I'm an artist), hang out with them, chat, etc."
3124,All things that I'm not really ready to do right now.
3125,"I WANT to eventually make new friends, because I'm struggling with loneliness, but since I have spent SO MUCH time alone, simple things like going for coffee or going on a walk with someone else are extremely challenging and stressful."
3126,"I definitely want to attack this thing soon, but at this moment I'm way too overloaded trying to adjust back into school."
3127,So my questions for the community.
3128,"How do I fend off these people politely, without having to reveal that I have a crippling anxiety disorder?"
3129,What's your go-to?
3130,"I'm usually pretty honest and try not to be rude, but I'm also really ashamed that I have anxiety this bad and that I'm so unstable."
3131,"I'm also wondering about your guys' medication stories--BuSpar, ADs."
3132,"I've been at therapy for a long time now and I'm considering changing therapists since I'm not really getting great results (in fact, I feel like my anxiety got WORSE after I entered therapy)."
3133,"I'd love to do it without medications, but I feel like I might be in too deep and too afraid of too much to be able to re-integrate into a social life without crashing and burning."
3134,My day-to-day life kind of revolves around my anxiety.
3135,Did medication help you?
3136,How?
3137,I'd like to hear your stories.
3138,Thank you for reading this.
3139,"Thanks for taking the time to read this :)

A little background, I've dealt with anxiety/panic attacks since I was 10 years old, I've learned how to manage it on my own without any medications about a year or so ago, still present but have the skills to calm."
3140,Although not perfect.
3141,I have a few questions on what I've been dealing with - and examples of how it affects day to day.
3142,I know eating disorders are serious topics and I understand the severity of what I deal with is no where in comparison but if someone could shed light on this I'd appreciate it.
3143,I used to be a very slender girl and extremely athletic.
3144,I first remember developing food issues when I was in middle school.
3145,I would be mortified if anyone other than family or very close friends saw me eating.
3146,When I was with people I would eat very small portions and act like I was full when still hungry.
3147,"There were several instances in high school - when my close friends and I got food together, mid bite if we saw people we knew, I would give them the food and tell them to say it was theirs or I would literally toss it in a bush or hide it as quickly as I could."
3148,"It affects me to the point that I cannot eat in front of anyone unless they are someone I've known for awhile, Its hard to explain this to new people as a 27 year old woman."
3149,"I have never been on a dinner date due to this, I've been asked recently to go on a date and I cannot even bring myself to it."
3150,I have issues with the way I see food.
3151,It has taken me 6 months in previous relationships to even go out to dinner - I avoid it and make excuses (I'm at the age where I think people think that's weird now- dinner dates are normal) but everytime I'm in a restaurant I get panic attacks.
3152,The only thing I can consume with anyone I don't feel comfortable with is water.
3153,"I'm struggling even more because after high school - I stopped working out and developed a drinking issue (3 years sober now), I was binge eating terrible foods and I gained a large amount of weight."
3154,I'm about 50lbs overweight and this just increases my food issues in public.
3155,"My feelings/thought process when it comes to food: If you eat you are weak(The logic, I know) Food is gross, you look fat when eating, you look desperate, you need to control yourself, you are needy."
3156,"Now since I've gained weight more thoughts are in my head - Look at this fat cow eating, she doesnt need anymore, look at her eating a salad bc she's fat or she shouldnt be eating that."
3157,"Its just getting worse, I'm not sure if this is an eating disorder or just a poor relationship with food (or if they run together)."
3158,Can someone shed some light or offer some help and ways to beat this?
3159,I've had chronic anxiety since I was around 6 or 7.
3160,Last summer it got to the point where I was completely unable to drive because I was having multiple panic attacks a day.
3161,I finally broke down and decided to try medication for my anxiety.
3162,I was put on lexapro and it was one of the worst experiences of my life.
3163,"I stopped feeling all together, I just didn't care about anything at all."
3164,"I stopped going to school, I stopped communicating with other people, I just wasn't interested in life whatsoever."
3165,"I stopped taking lexapro and over the next few months I went back to feeling like my normal, anxious self."
3166,"Now I can drive around when I need to, I'm making it to my classes and I'm doing pretty well."
3167,My family and therapist are still really worried for me though.
3168,"My mom in particular keeps telling me how worried she is about me, and how she wishes I was on medication so she could feel better."
3169,"They're all convinced that lexapro wasn't for me, and I need to keep trying different medications, but being on lexapro was such a frightening experience I don't think I can ever go on medication again."
3170,Can anyone here relate?
3171,What have your experiences with medication been like?
3172,I was on 37.5mg of Effexor for 8 days and now I've been on 75mg for almost 2 weeks but really don't feel a difference.
3173,"I read that you're supposed to feel like you have more energy and a better appetite in the beginning, both of which I have yet to experience."
3174,I know it's probably too early to tell but I just hate wasting time on medications when I feel like such crap :(
3175,"I have taken Kavinace and it done wonders last year for me, for a herbal medicine alternative."
3176,I have lived with moderate anxiety and depression my whole life.
3177,I have seen multiple university therapists and a psychologist from a private practice to try and control my symptoms.
3178,I have been prescribed multiple anxiety medications as well but have yet to get past my problem.
3179,I got into a decent college because I worked my butt off as an athlete in high school and got multiple scholarship offers.
3180,Even though I would be considered a success in this area I can't help but think I could have performed better without the extreme nervousness that came along with competition.
3181,I never performed well in school although everyone I meet considers me smart and expects me to become successful.
3182,My intelligence encouraged me to enter an engineering program and I did well for the first few years.
3183,Sometime in the middle of college the anxiety took hold and it went from moderate to more extreme.
3184,My grades started to slip and now I am in the position that I might fail out of school with only 1 semester left.
3185,This would be the greatest disappointment in my life and I don't know how I would be able to handle it.
3186,Does anybody have any experience with appealing a university decision on the medical grounds of anxiety?
3187,My counselor told me that she would not recommend a doctor's note if I can help it because in many circles professors would not recognize anxiety as a legitimate medical problem.
3188,She says it is likely that some of my professors would consider it some kind of excuse or a weakness that makes me unfit for a career as an engineer.
3189,I have been as successful as I know how up to this point and I have never been more scared of life than I am right now.
3190,I am going to finish this semester strong but if things don't work out where do I go from here?
3191,tl;dr  Anxiety may cause me to fail out of school and I wonder if anyone has any experience appealing a university decision on the grounds of anxiety.
3192,If I fail out of school how will I find the strength to move forward?
3193,EDIT: Things aren't looking so good.
3194,It looks like the most likely situation is failing out.
3195,I have exhausted all avenues I know to use.
3196,The next step would be an appeal.
3197,My attention never improved with the medication.
3198,I chose to stop taking the medication after a few months.
3199,"I started 20 mg Viibryd 1 month ago today, after over 10 years of unsuccessful treatment, over 7 different medications, and almost no hope remaining in my soul."
3200,"What follows is the turning around of my life, in the order in which I noticed:

* 1) My first thought in the morning was no longer death and panic."
3201,"* 2) My performance at work suddenly, and dramatically skyrocketed
* 3) I noticed the beauty in nature again
* 4) My husband and I stopped fighting, and started laughing more
* 5) I wanted to spend every minute playing, singing, and talking to my 2.5 year old son
* 6) I got back in touch with friends whom I haven't spoken to in months
* 7) I actually wanted to eat *salad* =O and EXERCISE?!"
3202,* 8) I started cleaning my house.
3203,* 9) I stopped having nightmares... which is a big deal for me.
3204,* 10) I realized that the moments in which I felt joy and happiness no longer dissolved into panic and guilt within seconds.
3205,"In short, I came to the sudden and dramatic understanding that I actually feel *happy*; and I realized I hadn't felt truly happy in a painfully long and miserable time."
3206,"Viibryd is a new anti-depressant on the market, its simple and basic; serotonin only, which means no horrible withdrawal, and few if any side effects."
3207,"I can have orgasms, I don't get shaky, no dizziness, no insomnia."
3208,"I hardly noticed any side effects at all, just some mild nausea the first week."
3209,"It works by focusing on a specific receptor, and secondly, it mimics serotonin (if anyone has a better understanding of how it works, please jump in!)"
3210,"Insurance info: Because its new, most insurance companies require a prior authorization from your doctor, which basically means the pharmacy faxes them a form to sign, and then it will be approved; simple!"
3211,"My sister is a Physician Assistant, and she recommended it to me."
3212,"She told me that she has prescribed it to about 25 patients with 'untreatable' depression, and has only had ONE person stop taking it (who was an alcoholic and complained of nausea)."
3213,"I understand your pain, I have been chronically anxious for 15 years, and off/on suicidal off for 5. and I also suffer from autoimmune disease which leaves me in severe pain and fatigue most days."
3214,"My biggest desire in life used to be to stay in bed, and to never, ever get up again."
3215,"I thought it would be wonderful to just lay in bed, cozy and comfy, wrapped in blankets, forever."
3216,My first thoughts in the morning were utter despair.
3217,"The world ending, cancer, death, hunger, murder, rape."
3218,"Now, my biggest desire in life is to simply contribute, love, and live."
3219,"Thus, my gift to you."
3220,Do it!
3221,Do it NOW.
3222,(Edit: some formatting changes)
3223,"I am open to taking medication, but a little nervous about the idea as well."
3224,I took those meds for about an entire month out of fear of getting more anxious.
3225,"Experiencing new weird stuff, almost like paranoïa, and figure I should write this stuff to wait for my meds to kick in rather then building up more anxiety by letting my brain go free."
3226,I asked my doctor for medication for social anxiety and he prescribed me paxil.
3227,I really hated the idea of taking medication that would numb my emotions.
3228,I also hated the stigma around such medication.
3229,Should I look for a better medication?
3230,"All in all, I ended up getting started on 10mg of lexapro, even though i'm strongly against medication personally, she assured me that it would help."
3231,"Gotta get through the first couple weeks, today is day one and the medicine is sort of making me a bit tired."
3232,Does anyone have any experience with this medication?
3233,I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was pretty young and my parents opted to keep me off medication.
3234,"My whole life I've been confronted with overwhelming social anxiety, and it usually leads to me having hardcore depression and hating myself."
3235,"I'm 25 now and I can't take this any longer, I *have* to get help."
3236,"I'm very nervous to get help though, my ex-gf passed away from being on too many prescriptions, and my family is very ""organic everything"" and ""nobody needs medications, you just got to be more disciplined"" and shit."
3237,"Anyways, I'm not even sure if I'm depressed (I don't think I am, but I get severe depressive attacks) or bipolar (more likely, since I seem a bit manic when I'm not depressed), but I **definitely** have issues with anxiety, and it's my number one problem, so that's why I'm posting here."
3238,"Depression aside, bipolar aside, other symptoms aside, what medications are you taking /r/anxiety, and does it help?"
3239,Does it affect your sex life?
3240,I used to take Zoloft but I didn't like that it made me take forever to come...
3241,"I'm on several meds that should help and getting therapy, but I'm getting no relief."
3242,I had anxiety all my life but am on medication now so im a lot better.
3243,"I don't particularly want to get on medication (I was previously with some terrible side effects), but I can't even get an initial consult with the mental health center until November."
3244,"I'm on meds now and haven't had an attack since starting them, until this."
3245,I make good money but not quite enough to pay for health insurance separate from my own (Of which she isn't covered) so taking her to a doctor and getting her some medication seems to be out of the realm of possibility.
3246,I tried to look for over the counter anxiety medication and apparently it doesn't exist.
3247,Been on anti anxiety/depression meds for the last 8 years.
3248,Tried so many different therapies combined with different meds but nothing ever seemed to work.
3249,"I had been struggling with stress, social anxiety and depression for a while before this, and it got to a point where I was actually thinking of talking to my parents about it and seeing if I could find some meds that might help me."
3250,"I know there are some people who actually do have serious problems such as severe anxiety and depression, and some of those people do need medication to help, but I think a huge number of people diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and a number of other problems don't need to be on meds, and if they can just take the time and effort to better their lives, they can do it."
3251,It's been a while since I've posted (or needed to) because my meds have been absolutely amazing (aside from some memory loss).
3252,"Hi, I've been on reddit for 7 month and finally made an account."
3253,At the age of 13 i was diagnosed with several anxiety problems.
3254,They all came from playing soccer and never affected me in school or socially.
3255,"At the start of my 15 birthday i started taking medication for my anxiety, as it was getting worse and forming panic attacks, starting home phobias and social disturbances ."
3256,"I experiences some tragic injuries in my soccer career that gave my a lot of depression, yet i would always get back up."
3257,At the age of 16 i got my license and finally got the girl of my dreams.
3258,I was in amazing shape and i believe i quitting medication or slowly got off it myself (sorry cant remember) it seemed everything was working out and i grew out of it.
3259,"By my 17 birthday my girlfriend broke up with me to go to college, it devastated me, because we where the bestest of friends doing everything together and she helped my over come so many of my fears and phobia, some without even knowing it."
3260,"After that i receive letters and calls to play academy, pro, or college soccer."
3261,"I broke my leg, my worst injury ever, some doctors saying career ending injury."
3262,"I recovered and became what i though was my best ability ever, i ended up quitting club soccer and didn't play high school ball because of anxiety."
3263,"Disappointed my parents, coaches, and lots of people who looked up to me in not playing in the next level, mainly because i had so much anxiety (especially traveling anxiety; riding the bus, car trips), i began seeing a therapist but i was too immature to follow through with everything, and soon quit going."
3264,I attend community  college and beginning of my 2nd semester of freshman year i cold turkey my medication and felt great and exercised and went to school clubs and what not.
3265,Now the anxiety is back and hitting me several times a day.
3266,"I scheduled myself to see the same therapist and plan to follow through on everything she says, yet i don't know if i should go back medication."
3267,The whole reason i quit medication was because it was making me sick.
3268,I have tried several medications and combinations over the 3 years (18 now).
3269,Basically what I'm asking is for alternatives to help me with anxiety.
3270,Should i go back to medications?
3271,What medications would not have the most side effects?
3272,I don't mind waiting for it to kick in.
3273,Thank you for any help.
3274,I basicly feel like the forever alone guy.
3275,"I'm on meds, but I generally rarely take benzos."
3276,I was told I should see a doctor about anti-anxiety medication.
3277,"Last year, I stopped taking my anxiety medication."
3278,I decided to get on medication and have been on Prozac for about 6 weeks.
3279,"I am going out for a bachelorette party tonight and want to have a couple drinks, because I feel like my anxiety is pretty well managed by medication."
3280,Have you gone on medication and been able to control your anxiety the next day?
3281,My doctor has put me on some meds that don't seem to be doing anything but give me pain &amp; headaches.
3282,"My sleep patterns are all screwed up because of my medication (I almost think I may also have chronic fatigue syndrome as well, I sleep for at least 16 hours a day, but still feel exhausted and really anxious when I'm awake)."
3283,I feel more relaxed being off medication than on it as I worry about medication side effects.
3284,"I stopped taking a medication that I had been taking for a while, and as a result my job performance has weakened significantly in the last few months (don't feel like going into details on that for now)."
3285,TL:DR ENT says Eustachian Tubes (previous doctor said I probably have ETD) are pretty finicky and don't respond to medicine/there's really no treatment.
3286,"That had never happened to me before, so now my only reliable medicine is either not working or making shit worse."
3287,"So, naturally taking new meds sucks for me, especially when im reading about bad experiences people have had."
3288,I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD inattentive type this summer.
3289,I haven't had the chance to start on any medications or therapy since I've been visiting my dad in another part of the country all summer.
3290,"I'm heading off to my freshman year of college in a matter of weeks and as the semester creeps closer, it's becoming increasingly harder for me to avoid worrying about it."
3291,"Reddit usually offers a perfect distraction, but the worrying won't subside tonight."
3292,I'm just wondering if there are any tips you guys could offer me to just get me to sleep tonight.
3293,Thank you!
3294,I finally started seeking help by getting on medication and seeing a psychologist.
3295,My Dad regulates it through meditation and using a workbook and my sister uses medication.
3296,"I've been thinking about trying meds again, but I have no idea what to try."
3297,"I've been thinking about meds again, but I am really not fond of SSRIs."
3298,"tl;dr: Tried meds and therapy, but I'm ready to try again."
3299,"Also, i find that within the first few hours of taking the medicine, i feel kind of spacy and tight chested, kindof like the beginnings of a panic attack."
3300,"The first session with him wasn't bad but he revealed to me that he is against treating anxiety with medication (while, admittedly, meds were what I was hoping for) and insisted that if we went through some of the more troubling memories from my childhood, it would fix everything."
3301,Has anyone else tried this ayurvedic plant medicine?
3302,"New meds, more therapy, move back home with parents because I can't be trusted to be alone."
3303,"About a month ago, I was put on 75 mg of Effexor for generalized and social anxiety, as well as minor depression, and it's proven to not be the medicine for me."
3304,"I've started the process of weaning myself off it and will probably look into cognitive behavioural therapy as an alternative to medication in general, but I understand coming off the drug can be rather difficult."
3305,Been dealing with GAD/depression for most of my life.
3306,I've had bouts of therapy and medications throughout my teens and early 20's.
3307,"When I started grad school last year, my anxiety got worse extremely fast."
3308,I've been slow to make friends and feel isolated most of the time because of my anxiety with just about everything.
3309,"This semester just started and there have been a few people that seem happy to see me and I was personally invited to go to this Grad Student meet and greet/party at someone's house, but I'm starting to psyche my self out of going...I don't want to have an anxiety attack and then need to leave and make everyone have a terrible opinion of me."
3310,I would also have to go alone and that makes it super hard for me.
3311,I tend to go to more things if I have a friend or buddy.
3312,"And Lastly, the person who is hosting the party asked to collaborate with me on a project last semester and I said I would do it and then never got back to him...we haven't really talked since...so it just makes me all the more anxious about the whole thing."
3313,Right now I'm on lexapro and searching for a therapist.
3314,"The battle continues...

Any advice/support/suggestions?"
3315,Does anyone think that not going will be detrimental to my social life?
3316,"Note: When my anxiety medication wears off, I now GET anxiety immediately."
3317,After that I decided I didn't want to depend on the medication any more and started working with a Psychologist on my anxiety.
3318,I started it 14 days ago and I felt like it is the right medication to help me quit lorazepam completely.
3319,I was having horrible anxiety for quite some time and I went to the urgent care doctor today because I just seriously could not handle it anymore.
3320,The lack of sleep and my headaches were justs too much to deal with.
3321,I'm reluctant to be on any medications because I used to be addicted to drugs.
3322,"I have since learned to handle myself, it was just a major issue with me as to why I didn't want to start."
3323,"They prescribed me xanax, .25, and I took one and for the past couple hours, I have been waking up once an hour and everytime I go to close my eyes again it's like I'm already dreaming again."
3324,It's pretty weird.
3325,I took Xanax a year ago and never experienced that.
3326,What's weird is I'm on the lowest dose.has this happened to anyone before?
3327,I really am afraid I will not get it.
3328,"Let me explain how bad my anxiety is, and has been."
3329,"I have difficulty opening up to anyone, including myself."
3330,"Every job I've ever had causes me to become more anxious, and neglect my health and hygiene even more."
3331,I also always eventually break down and feel like I'm going to destroy the property of the work environment or even imagine killing someone.
3332,"Then I quit my job instead of doing that, and I'm devastated for months about it, sometimes a year or more."
3333,Because my whole life I've tried to be functional and my whole life I haven't been.
3334,At one point I went 10000% neurotic and was questioning every body movement and breath I took.
3335,"Now I have psychosomatic disorders that cause my breathe to be strained and back to be tight, almost constantly."
3336,I tell my doctors and they send me to the counselor.
3337,I tell my counselor and they send me to the doctor.
3338,I can barely even keep up with paper work or shower consistently.
3339,And then they get upset at me for not turning in paper work.
3340,"I try every single day to calm myself, I meditate sometimes."
3341,I try to relax and shrug things off.
3342,But I'm still not functional yet.
3343,I even get anxiety about going to the counselor.
3344,I've tried so many medications in my life it's ridiculous.
3345,"Some do help anxiety, but then they make me pretty suicidal."
3346,I'm so frustrated.
3347,This world just doesn't do mentally ill people justice.
3348,"They don't want to deal with the reality, and so they have completely unrealistic expectations of them."
3349,I sometimes just wish I was never born.
3350,Maybe I'm not meant to survive.
3351,"My intelligence also, really just does me no good."
3352,It makes me look more functional than I am.
3353,"I made it to my first therapy session today, and the doctor said I should go on medication considering how long I've had panic disorder (almost 10 years now)."
3354,This medication has ruined my life.
3355,"I've started CBT, and I'm trying new meds to help deal with it."
3356,"So, I've struggled with anxiety and depression for years now."
3357,Nothing new.
3358,In the past year and a half though I've made great progress.
3359,"I moved to a new city, had a lot of good and bad experiences, dealt with crippling relapses, started exercising (cycling mostly) regularly, signed up for college in the fall, and overall for the last 4 months I've been a lot better at handling my episodes in ways I don't seriously spiral."
3360,"I still have an incredibly hard time interacting with people though, and I see this often in my work."
3361,My first job is a delivery cyclist.
3362,I love it.
3363,I get to exercise for a living listening to my own music.
3364,"I still have to interact with people, but I can handle that."
3365,"""Hi, how're you?"
3366,Here's your sandwich.
3367,"Have a nice day!""."
3368,Short spurts.
3369,"My second job is at a fast casual restaurant though, and it's sucking the life out of me."
3370,"To begin with, I applied for a prep position and interviewed stressing how much I want to work with food."
3371,"Nope, didn't happen."
3372,Cashier/salad maker/bakery attendant is what I got.
3373,"I was hoping after working there for a couple months I could make a strong case for being moved to pastry or food prep, but we got some new managers in and everyone's been affected."
3374,"They've cut mine (and many people's) hours, hired a slew of new faces, been scheduling me in conflict with my other job, and changing the schedule a day before without notice."
3375,Besides that in general they're hard people to work with.
3376,Last Sunday we had a line to the door for about 2.5 hours.
3377,"It was crazy busy, the stress kept piling up."
3378,All those people and all that noise got to me.
3379,"I had a mini panic attack, which I kept from being a full blown thing (for me, that means I was still able to breathe and speak), but the damage had been done."
3380,I couldn't deal with people.
3381,I wanted to explode.
3382,I felt like a cornered animal and wanted to lash out in rage.
3383,I'm pretty sure I gave death glares to all the customers.
3384,"For me it was fight, not flight, all the way."
3385,I kept making mistakes.
3386,My manager kicked me off register.
3387,"Later I went back when things calmed down and a coworker joked ""Oh God, you're back on""."
3388,"She was joking, but it felt like I was stabbed and she twisted the knife."
3389,"After work one of my managers called me in to say some customers had complained I had no emotion when taking their order, and I do that - emotionally shut down when I'm under stress."
3390,Yesterday morning was the worst however.
3391,I realized I lost my work hat.
3392,This is the third time that has happened in 2 months.
3393,That was it.
3394,I wanted to cry.
3395,I felt ashamed and useless and incompetent.
3396,"I called in saying I had a family emergency, but they told me when I come back I'll need paperwork to prove it."
3397,"I'm done, but I need to bow out as gracefully as possible."
3398,"I've never quit a job without notice before, but I'm thinking of going in in a few days, returning my uniform, and tell them ""I'm sorry, but I can't work here."
3399,"I know this is unprofessional without notice, but I'm going to go home for a while,"" then spend the rest of August visiting my Mother and sis before the semester starts."
3400,"I don't want to get back on medications, but I need a breather and to find work that doesn't have me possibly having panic attacks."
3401,I've tried a few different types of medication but they all seemed to make me feel worse.
3402,"I'm thinking about seeing a GP and asking for a different kind of medication, I heard Lyrica and Gabapentin are quite effective for anxiety."
3403,"My parents won't let me see a psychiatrist anymore (not like I have time anyways, I am at school from 7 AM to 5 PM, and until 11 PM I am doing homework), and they are deadset on not allowing me to take medicine."
3404,I find myself doing really well on my new medicine of Lexapro.
3405,"It was just awful, but I got medication and by the time I was 13 I was totally anxiety free."
3406,I stopped taking my medication back when I was 18 and from then on it wasn't an issue.
3407,"So I'm 20 years old male, used to have normal life, I was very social and confident guy until one day, when I had a panic attack (that happened 3 months ago) ."
3408,Since then I'm worrying about anything and my anxiety not seeming to stop.
3409,"I don't have panic attacks, but I feel anxious most of the time, every morning I wake up due to anxiety, I have problems falling asleep due to anxiety and what is worst and pisses me off the most,that anxiety made me a lot less social,than I normally am, I can't be myself anymore."
3410,I can say that it is pretty annoying and much worse than depression in my opinion.
3411,"So, I have suggestions to start taking Xanax to ""deal"" with my anxiety, but I'm strongly against all kind of medications,because I heard many stories that antidepressants and anti-anxiety pills can help you temporary to ease up the symptoms,but it fuck you up in the long run."
3412,So I'm REALLY skeptical about this.
3413,I want a natural way to get out of this.
3414,"I already changed my lifestyle: I workout 5-6 days a week,taking cold showers every morning (heard it reduces stress) , started to eat healthy food, sucessfully cutted alcohol,tobacco and caffeine permanently."
3415,Also doing meditation daily and it even sometimes help for short period of time.
3416,"So, I'm really desperate to overcome this horrible ilness in NATURAL way."
3417,"If anyone has experienced GAD in their lifes before and have tips/advices overcoming it, please write down it here, I will be more than grateful."
3418,I thought I had my medication in a good place until recently.
3419,There's not a direct medication that can be prescribed for everyone.
3420,What meds plug that mental hole for you?
3421,"Celexa and Seroquel, are my current meds..."
3422,"I don't know what's wrong with me, I always take a good 8 hour sleep everyday so that's out of the things that would make me feel sleepy, and I don't take any meds except for Vitamin C supplements."
3423,Maybe it's time to get some meds but I don' t like taking medication.
3424,I feel like every night I have nightmares.
3425,I don't sleep well.
3426,I've tried meditation and several kinds of sleeping medications.
3427,"i've tried a lot of antidepressants, and was on ativan for a single month."
3428,Ativan worked so great but my doctor will not prescribe it for me again and I'm crushed.
3429,"Last time I went to the doctor, she gave me a sleeping med (hydroxyzine) and it didn't do much for me."
3430,"She then sent me to same-day counseling and it was the most stressful nightmarish situation i've been in a long time, and I think it traumatized me a little because I haven't been back to the doctor."
3431,"She scheduled a follow-up visit a few days out, but I cancelled it because of schedule conflict and I haven't made another appointment."
3432,That was four weeks ago.
3433,It is very tough because being at the doctor sends me at least close to a panic attack (I cry violently every time.
3434,I'm crying while typing this) and the therapist was one of the worst experiences I've had in a long time very full on panic attack).
3435,"She's a GP doctor and I know i need to see a psychiatrist, but it's very difficult to get in with one."
3436,"I know the waiting list right now is 2 months out, and I can't bring myself to make an appointment (I cry on the phone too."
3437,You can't make an appointment online).
3438,I feel really stuck and I don't know what to do.
3439,Please help...
3440,Hi.
3441,I'm new to reddit.
3442,"My husband is on here night and day, so I figured I'd give it a try for some advice."
3443,"I've had pretty bad anxiety since I was about 14, I'm 24 now."
3444,"I have been through several traumatic experiences in my life (child molestation, abortion, sexual assault, near death experience, and family probs) that I've all probably just brushed under a rug looking back on it."
3445,Now I think these things are creeping out of my subconscious and affecting my everyday life in the form of anxiety.
3446,"I've tried multiple medications (Lexapro, Celexa, Cymbalta, Abilify, Zoloft, Xanax), and most of them haven't done much for me except relieve my insomnia."
3447,"It's becoming so bad now that I breakdown at least twice a week, I have panic attacks, I can't function when I'm at work because I'm just worried about everything, and on top of it all my marriage is a disaster."
3448,I even did therapy for 2 years (recently) and I'm right back in the same fucking boat.
3449,I have no idea what to do and I really am tired of hurting everyone around me because I can't calm the fuck down.
3450,Any advice???
3451,TLDR: I've been through a lot of trauma I haven't dealt with even in 2 years of therapy and a shit ton of medication.
3452,"My anxiety is getting progressively worse, interfering with my daily life and my marriage."
3453,Help!!
3454,!
3455,I've had benzos in my medicine drawer for 5 years.
3456,I don't fit the profile of someone who abuses meds.
3457,"Open to other effective meds, of course."
3458,My medication doctor hasn't filled my anti anxiety medication so I've been off it for 3 days.
3459,Anyone else decide to stop using medication?
3460,"I am seeing a therapist a couple times a month, and I am not taking meds (I don't want to be on them)."
3461,Currently I'm on no meds besides the methadone and my depersonilization is always present.
3462,I've been seeing a therapist for half a year and I do not take medication (I have lorazepam and beta-blockers but I never use them).
3463,"I am not a 12 year old, I am a 30 year old who was just diagnosed with GAD and have been working through it with a variety of methods, therapy, medicine, breathing exercises and stuff like that."
3464,Ever since I have been having recent massive panic attacks and got diagnosed and on meds I have not had an epiphany like this.
3465,"I know that the meds and the therapy have helped me in these weeks, and helped me realize that I have had this problem for a long time, but I just want to say ""fuck you anxiety, seriously, fuck you."
3466,"I've tried ginger root, drinking flat 7up, antinausea meds, and antacids."
3467,"I don't feel like I noticed the ""night and day"" difference that some people describe when I started taking it, my anxiety and depression symptoms aren't as debilitating as they used to be, but I don't know if I should attribute that to the medication or just lifestyle changes, and I don't want to experiment with stopping it because the withdrawal symptoms make me feel like crap."
3468,"Hello all,
So I've been seeing a therapist and counselor and taking meds and whatnot for a few years."
3469,"While all this is going on, My mother is in a rehab center to try to become independent enough to come home as she has tardive dyskenasia from her meds she was on, but after visiting with her after viewing an apartment, it became clear that she wouldn't be able to come home and I will have to turn it over to Adult Protective Services to have them assume guardianship and have her put in a Nursing home (something she always dreaded because she used to work in one)."
3470,"21/F, student."
3471,"I always feel ""blank,"" as if I'm too tired to exert energy."
3472,Tired.
3473,Always tired.
3474,"And when I ""try"" to do something with my time, my head starts to hurt and my eyes grow heavy."
3475,My eyes water.
3476,I get irritable.
3477,A cloud of exhaustion and negativity consumes me.
3478,I took myself off Lexapro a couple months ago - I didn't really feel that it was helping me.
3479,"Coming off of the Lexapro as well as Prednisone (I was believed to have a respiratory infection of some kind at that point, which wasn't the case, but I digress) made me gain about 10 pounds."
3480,"I have a history of eating issues, was bulimic in grade school."
3481,This weight gain has really had an effect on me.
3482,I don't feel as strong and I don't feel that I look nice in any of my clothes anymore.
3483,But my lack of energy and anxiety about going to the gym has rendered me useless.
3484,Feeling fat and useless really makes me feel awful about myself to a new degree.
3485,"Not doing anything about this just makes me feel lazy, and feeling lazy makes me feel even worse about myself."
3486,And just the act of feeling bad about myself makes me feel like a child.
3487,"Like I should know better and that I have a world before me to explore, but I'm so self-absorbed that I just need to sit and dwell on this nonsense."
3488,"It's a vicious, negative cycle."
3489,I took myself off a lot of medications actually.
3490,I was also on Adderall and Clonazepam.
3491,I feel like I'm not being concise.
3492,I'm getting tired just writing this...
3493,"I go to class and do my work, I pull decent grades."
3494,Another issue I guess I should mention is my lack of passion in my field.
3495,"I used to live for my major, but the fire seems to be gone."
3496,Not completely extinguished or I may have quit by now.
3497,I don't hate going to class.
3498,"I hate waking up because I'm not the best sleeper - meaning, if I have to sleep alone (if my boyfriend does not stay with me) it takes me hours to fall asleep."
3499,I feel scared and unsafe at night.
3500,I have a terrible track record when it comes to friendships.
3501,"The last falling-out I had was about two years ago, and it really messed me up."
3502,Truly.
3503,I don't know how to properly tell my story.
3504,I don't know how to motivate myself to live life.
3505,"I'm skating through life, constantly judging myself, and apparently falsely hoping that motivation will just appear."
3506,I figured submitting a post here would be a step toward something.
3507,Please feel free to ask me any questions.
3508,"I wish I could be clearer in this post, but as it seems, I don't know what I want in life so how can I even begin to fathom what'd I'd want from a text post?"
3509,hah
3510,I just recently moved to Atlanta and pre-move my anxiety was managed and I was off of medication.
3511,"On top of that, I got a lecture from a dentist of all people this week about anti-anxiety medication and about how useless therapy is because, ""people can solve their own problems."""
3512,"They've tried everything to help me, therapists, ADHD medication (even though I feel  I don't have it)."
3513,"*boring wall'o'text, not necessary*


So it's really late here, so sorry for any spelling errors."
3514,My anxiety has been really bad ever since summer/beginning high school.
3515,"I hung out with the wrong people around mid summer, and smoked a lot."
3516,"I was also an ass to a lot of people, lied to my parents and generally ruined my friends trust in me, but I just wanted to fit in with the cool people."
3517,"By the end of summer, many of the kids went to different high schools and some even moved out of the city, or they were a grade below me and still in middle school."
3518,"So I went to school the first day, walked through the doors, looked around at all the unfamiliar faces and felt like they were all looking back."
3519,"Popular girl I use to know calls me over in front of her friends and I awkwardly stand there looking at the floor red faced before the first bell rang, I wandered around looking where to go, clinging to anyone who looked at me, like a lost puppy."
3520,"And you know what?,Those were the good days, without the ""ninering""(teasing the newer kids)."
3521,"I actually had friends, and if I went a period without them I was terrified, but I also felt like I was being clingy."
3522,As of now I'm a dropout who can barely attend an alternative school.
3523,"Now to the question, I've already been to therapy and it didn't really help that much because she had to leave after the first few months and the minuscule dosage of ativan barely helped."
3524,Anxiety attacks are random but mostly related to school and strangers my age.
3525,"*necessary stuff*


There is a huge stigma attached to meds in my my household, my mom personally knew a man taking antidepressants who killed himself, and my dad had a terrible father who also abused many substances, so he believes that anything that alters the way you thing is bad and it took tons of convincing to try a barely helpful amount of ativan

I was wondering what the best course of action is."
3526,I'm a boy in canada if that helps.
3527,Should we go to the family doctor?
3528,Seek another therapist?
3529,Any specific medications that are all natural?
3530,"Is medication needed, or even an option?"
3531,"I really need help here guys, sorry again if I made errors."
3532,Goodnight
3533,"He also really wanted me to get off the meds as well, so I decided to stop."
3534,I had a breakdown at work so I am in therapy along with on a medicine regime to try and control my OCD and anxiety.
3535,Stuff I tried: Taking meds in the evening instead of morning didn't really change a thing.
3536,"Hi, I have anxiety and been on medicine for 8 months, am coming off them now and I feel like my chest is so tight, am kind of lonely..my family in another country and my friends I feel like they don't really know what am talking about when it comes to anxiety and depression."
3537,I'm not on medication.
3538,"Maybe its the change to my anxiety meds, but I do not feel the need to post on a social website about this anymore, but my family sees it as this huge insult."
3539,"I'm a 21 year old female who used to struggle with depression, but never anything I'd call anxiety."
3540,"I have been having a good couple years now, and am under no *real* stress."
3541,I am a student with decent grades and I got promoted at my job this summer and everything is okay right now.
3542,"However, for seemingly no reason, I started getting very scared of death/the topic of death... it started invading my thoughts all the time and not a day goes by where I don't think about it multiple times."
3543,"I started crying a lot at random times, and after the crying thing had been happening for a few weeks, I got a real, real bad panic attack."
3544,"Like I thought I was dying (I knew I wasn't, but I couldn't breathe and was shaking violently)."
3545,"It has snowballed into other topics and my brain will twist any thing in any way so that I freak out about it...


Then I started freaking out once or twice a day."
3546,I have to stop what I'm doing an isolate myself.
3547,It's getting hard to just... live...
3548,I don't understand why this happened so suddenly to me... ?
3549,"It's really hard for me to swallow the fact that I have really bad anxiety, in the grand scheme of things, what seems like overnight and I have NO experience or any idea on how to deal with it."
3550,Now I found this subreddit and do feel a tiny bit better... but why is this happening to me?
3551,":\ Maybe I just don't understand 'it,' but is it hormones?"
3552,How my brain's wired?
3553,What?
3554,Can I ever return to being 'normal' and not anxious?
3555,edit: I feel like I should add some things.
3556,I have no other apparent health issues.
3557,I do not take birth control or any medications.
3558,"I was an every day weed smoker for a year, and two years before that I was smoking a few times a week."
3559,"I quit smoking, coincidentally, a little over six months ago in April."
3560,"I know in the first two months I felt **very** 'angry' and opinionated all the time, but I'm wondering if quitting smoking has made me into a super anxious person."
3561,I'm going to talk the a psychiatrist soon to talk about medication I might take.
3562,Just wanted to ask if anyone knows any medication that doesn't make you feel weird?
3563,I've been to a doctor and have gotten some anxiety meds along with depression meds.
3564,I've been on and off meds and working through therapy.
3565,Currently I am on adhd medication and my doctor has given me the option of starting Prozac or doing .5mg of klonopin in the morning and night.
3566,So I was super stoked today to actually start being able to get help from a psychiatrist through a program here in West Texas.
3567,Now I'm feeling like a crazy person and way less than worthless since walking out allow me to walk you through somewhat of a narrative of how this went.
3568,"""You over analysis everything and that is your problem."
3569,You do this so much that you have a cognitive disorder because of it.
3570,You probably won't even accept my help because you are so stuck in your ways.
3571,"Oh, and you exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia because you project what you feel about yourself onto your girlfriend and make up her mind for her."""
3572,So I won't accept your help because I've been to a school counselor and a couple of SSRI's didn't work so because I over analyse everything I'll think whatever you say is bullshit and you got all that from 5 minutes of talking?
3573,He also assumed I wouldn't consider an anti-psychotic down the road for my anxiety since it may be possible I don't respond well to SSRI's to which I responded yes I would because you don't know me and I've taken abnormal psychology so I know it is a treatment option.
3574,"Every time I tried to question his plans he would say I was ""over analyzing again""."
3575,So his plan is Abilify and Wellbutrin cool I'll try it but can I do some CBT to help with these thoughts since I over analyse everything?
3576,"""No, there you go again you aren't even ready for CBT because you still want to think about it but positively this time you just need to stop thinking"" WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK IS THAT SHIT!"
3577,How does that make any sense?
3578,"So to recap I'm supposed to take these two medicines and I ""might feel better by Easter"" in the mean time I'm supposed to just stop thinking anytime I feel anxious and breathe, not take the klonopin I got from my school doctor that I took maybe three times a week tops, and then he might do therapy."
3579,"So guys am I exhibiting ""symptoms of schizophrenia"" as he would say or can I fucking say this dude is kind of an asshole without ""projecting"" or whatever the fuck he says?"
3580,If I was so unreceptive and stuck in my analyzing ways why would I even go?
3581,Why is what I wanted in the first place (A new SSRI and CBT) so close to what he said anyway if I'm so far off in his eyes?
3582,"Also, why would he say I wouldn't feel any better till next year if SSRI's reach their peak effectiveness anywhere from two weeks to a month?"
3583,"He told me I have an effective disorder, cognitive disorder (since I analyse everything), and something else I didn't catch."
3584,Last I checked over analysis and everything was the fucking DSM-V definition of an anxiety disorder.
3585,He started running with schizophrenic symptoms because I project how I feel about me on my significant other and seemed peeved when I told him I didn't hear voices or see things.
3586,He got on that in the first place because I said one person in my extended family has it and he sees her as a patient too.
3587,I'm also not doing this to prove him right and not do his treatment because I am going to try the pills I just wanted to rant and see what others think because I think he's a bit of a douche.
3588,"Oh, he also said I would get diabetes for sure not if when) because it's in my family history and I'm overweight even though I explained I gained weight from the old pills (Prozac) and didn't eat sweets."
3589,"Hi, 
This is my first post here."
3590,I've struggled with anxiety for 3 years now.
3591,I started on lexapro and switched to various other medications.
3592,I started college last year and decided that I would be fine without medication.
3593,(It makes me feel like a zombie) That was probably a bad idea.
3594,I only knew my boyfriend at college and then I broke up with him 2 months after starting.
3595,"I then had no friends, and no one to talk to."
3596,"Four months into college, I met another guy."
3597,"He is now my best friend, and I hang out in his room a lot with his roommate and other guys on his floor."
3598,Being with people really calms down my anxiety and depression.
3599,"So, I use them as my medication."
3600,"However, I know they are probably sick of me always being there."
3601,"I don't know what to do, if I'm alone, I feel an intense knot in my stomach and I feel like throwing up."
3602,I haven't been eating well this entire year.
3603,I've lost 15 lbs.
3604,"Also, this summer I'm taking summer classes and will be living here by myself in my apartment."
3605,I'm scared to death to do that.
3606,I guess I'm just sharing my story to see if anyone else felt like that?
3607,Tl;dr: anxiety and depression when alone.
3608,His is worse then mine (at least at this stage of my life) since without his meds he can't be in  a crowd of people without losing it.
3609,"I should go and talk to someone about medication, but at the same time I'm a stubborn ass."
3610,It s amazing how fast the panic settled when we told him he could get medicine to help him.
3611,"I was told I should go on anxiety medication temporarily to learn how to regulate my anxiety since it would be unlikely I'd be able to do it myself in my current situation, but psychiatrists in this area are always booked, and I have no idea when I'll be able to get an appointment."
3612,"One of the major hurdles convincing them to go that they are worried that if they seek therapy, the therapist might force them on medication."
3613,"Asides the medication side effects, they are afraid that might it affect their employment record."
3614,"There have been so many problems I've racked up over the years, every time I try to deconstruct it for a professional, the more I feel like getting help is further and further away."
3615,"I'll list the things relevant to this post;

Emotionally abusive ex who introduced me to a cult version of Christianity that his family was into, who also were emotionally abusive."
3616,His mother is a gp who practices homeopathy.
3617,"She manipulated me into leaving my gp &amp; urologist (I have an incurable chronic illness) and told me her method was the only way and my original doctors were ignorant - then got me to lie about my condition so she could prescribe me medications not relevant to my illness and got angry when I asked questions or said it wasn't working, saying that it was my fault."
3618,"All of this ended catastrophically as my ex tried to force me into 'giving up control to god' (which meant him) which lead me to essentially abusing myself, forcing myself to 'submit to god'."
3619,Then he essentially broke up with me because I wasn't doing it right.
3620,After that I realized what had happened.
3621,"Because of how complicated and humiliating all of this was, I still blame myself."
3622,"I don't talk about it to anyone, even though I couple of my friends were first hand observers of this madness."
3623,"I feel on the verge of panic anytime anything remotely related to that incident is brought up, my reaction is always to run."
3624,In the last year I've attempted to see (through a gp referral) both a psychologist and a psychiatrist.
3625,I tried to bring it up slowly with the psychologist but she got really aggressive at the smallest things and I got really scared and couldn't go back - but I also blamed it on myself (for over reacting) so I felt like I had to force myself to do something I was uncomfortable with (huge trigger).
3626,"The part of me that would usually stick it out or speak up about it doesn't function anymore, because it feels like I'm forcing myself to submit again."
3627,I'm avoid seeing doctors now because I feel like I'm going crazy for being afraid of getting help.
3628,I wish I could just explain to them that I was traumatized by a doctor and ask them to please not trigger me but I feel so ashamed of the whole situation.
3629,It's been 3 years and I still have to sleep with my light on.
3630,"I've started to see a therapist recently and she's come to the conclusion that I most likely have GAD, and is going to refer me to a psychiatrist to possibly get me prescribed some medication while we start therapy."
3631,I tried getting off the meds a few weeks ago and had such bad panic/anxiety that I started taking them again.
3632,Do I try and talk to a dr about being on meds that are safe while pregnant?
3633,"It took me so long to find one that works, and to be honest, I don't want to take meds while pregnant."
3634,"I've tried many meds to control it over the years, along with counseling, but I continue to spiral downward."
3635,What medication worked best for you that had minimal side effects?
3636,"I'm not looking for suggestions of therapy or medication, though that has been a real consideration recently, because I know most of the medication has horrible side effects I'd like to stay away from."
3637,"I truly couldn't get any schoolwork done then, because without the medication my anxiety was too unbearable to even make it to the doors of my classroom."
3638,"My sophomore year of college, I got so drunk (wouldn't take meds when I knew I would be drinking) that I fell off a balcony, broke my neck, which now has two rods in the back of it and a metal plate in the front."
3639,"Any medicine, teas, powders?"
3640,"This helps usually, but lately it has been hard for me to follow through with the techniques, so my psychologist suggested I get a prescription for a mild medication that'll relax me a bit so I can do my breathing techniques, etc."
3641,"Hey everyone, I recently have been suffering alot from depersonalize during alot of my daily aspects, I feel almost detached or on 'autopilot' so to speak."
3642,I recently spoke to my therapist about this and asked for some help to deal with this and she suggested the possibility of medication to help me cope.
3643,My only problem is that i'm really hoping to avoid the use of any sort of medication if possible to help overcome this.
3644,"My questions are:

1.Depersonalization-wise, does anyone know any good strategies to help cope with depersonalization without the use of medication?"
3645,or ways to help combat/beat it?
3646,2.
3647,What type of medication are most normally used to help with depersonalization?
3648,and what type of things do the medications normally do to help fight the feeling of depersonalization?
3649,3.
3650,"To anyone who's currently using medication to help fight depersonalization, do you think it's effective?"
3651,or would you suggest  something else?
3652,"It's really been eating away at me, my anxiety coupled with all of this is making it hard for me to sleep, i'd love any feedback you guys could give me."
3653,Thank you
3654,Normally I force a panic attack just to stop the feelings (off meds) but today..
3655,"i've been coping well(ish) with my anxiety, i see a therapist and take medication but it just feels unbearable right now."
3656,I'm in therapy and have been taking medication but it's not helping.
3657,I want to be able to control my anxiety without meds.
3658,I really want medication because nothing else has helped and I have tried everything!
3659,My doctor won't give me medication for this.
3660,"Fiddled with meds at first until they got the right combo, 10mg Lexapro daily, added 150 mg daily of Wellbutrin to help combat sexual side effects."
3661,"Over the last 4 or 5 months, however, I feel like the meds have been having *more* of an effect."
3662,"After doing some reading, talking with my wife, my therapist, etc, I think I'm ready to taper off the meds."
3663,"In the past, when I've gotten out of the habit of taking my meds for a couple weeks, I've had a few symptoms of withdrawl (brain zaps, teeth grinding, etc)."
3664,"So please, if you'd be willing, share your experience coming off meds?"
3665,"I went to visit my doctor again and he recommended that I stay on the medication (also on the same dosage - 10mg) and that it will get better, but it already has been 2 weeks and I'm not sure if I'm willing to commit."
3666,Or should I ask to switch meds?
3667,I don't like taking meds if i don't have to so i'm curious if this happens to anyone else; if so how have you dealt with it ?
3668,Here I am one week after stopping taking my meds feeling like crap.
3669,Is it possible that the meds are still in my system and I'm going through withdrawal?
3670,I have no idea if the way I'm feeling is because the meds or if it's unrelated.
3671,The reason I'm posting here is because it feels like how I used to feel when I would either miss a dose of my meds or because I quickly tapered for medical testing.
3672,Has anyone dealt with something similar coming off of meds?
3673,"I feel like a shell of the former person I used
To be and it's depressing me and getting worse :(

EDIT: I should mention that last month I had really bad sleeping problems/anxiety and took various meds to help me."
3674,"Some background information: I have general anxiety and ADHD, which I both take medicine for."
3675,**A little background**: I’m a 20 year old male who has been having panic attacks and anxiety since I was 16.
3676,I recently have had more severe panic attacks so I’ve gone to both a therapist and a couple different psychiatrists.
3677,The most recent psych I saw wants me to start lexapro.
3678,I take xanax for panic when I have it bad.
3679,**My reluctance**: I suppose it’s more a matter of philosophy and principle.
3680,I have doubts and questions surrounding a medication that changes the chemistry in your brain.
3681,"I mean, I know how meds are supposed to work, but then sometimes it is discovered how they actually work."
3682,There is a fear that changing the chemistry in my brain (tangent — I believe what you do and all the sums that make up who you are in your brain and it can be rewired by your actions.
3683,It may be an broad example but I think there is a lot left to learn about the brain) and changing who I am.
3684,"My principle is impractical, I know it is."
3685,I know that the medication may help.
3686,I know I can never know if it may help or impact me unless I try.
3687,"I mean there is side effects too, but I try not to think about those because it makes me more anxious and weary; I am trying to be more rational regarding my anxiety, I know side effects are different for everyone."
3688,"So I’m in therapy for about 3 weeks and now and I feel it’s helping, but there is still days where my panic is crippling."
3689,"Yeah, I know that is how recovery works, you have good days in a stretch then you have another bad day, this process continues until the amount of good days you have goes on for a while."
3690,I am hoping to not recognize and not be fearful of my own anxiety soon.
3691,But I have only got to three 45 minute therapy sessions (once a week) and even though I’m feeling better there is a creeping thought that my anxiety will come back and impede me.
3692,"I am looking to get a job and I’m not in school currently, I’m lucky enough to be supported by my parents."
3693,Obviously I want to be independent.
3694,When I was in school I would skip classes because my panic was so bad and that had been the way I coped with it since high school.
3695,I would sit alone and write and listen to music just to help the panic pass.
3696,"I have a fear that once I try to do the things that will make me feel better, the things I need to do, that I will have panic everyday like I used to."
3697,"Just thinking about this, I don’t even want to try something for fear of failing (because of my panic)."
3698,I don’t want to have panic attacks everyday but I do want a job and a future and to be able to say that anxiety doesn’t control my life.
3699,**What was the point of this post?
3700,** Just asking others’ thoughts because I feel like I’ve shared this sentiment with others but not really gotten to talk to anyone who really knows my concerns and how my anxiety feels.
3701,"I am trying to look at it and ask “what would be worse, taking medication and facing your anxiety and going against an idea you’ve held as a principle for a long time, or not being able to continue and live your life because of your anxiety?”."
3702,More and more the answer to that question has been that meds may help so I should at least TRY.
3703,Blah blah it sounds melodramatic but going to 3 different professionals and being told 3 different medications will help me does not inspire confidence.
3704,"Everyone has their own opinions, even mental health professionals."
3705,"I don't know if I should see a primary care physician (which I don't currently have) to try and get medication, or start therapy with a psychologist or psychiatrist."
3706,"I have depression and anxiety

I was feeling so anxious I wanted to throw up

Took anxiety meds and felt like shit for about 30 min

Now it kicked in and now I just feel really sad instead of anxious

Fuck

Fuck

Fuck

What is wrong with me

I hate mental illness

Makes me so sad"
3707,"I have never been on any medication for anxiety

I've also been to a ""therapist"" type person who taught me some techniques on how to deal with the anxiety (E.g breathing and relaxation techniques) and they helped cure it for a short period of time but now they are only just about getting me by."
3708,"I can't seem to get rid of it
I've tried herbal remedies, chamomile tea, acupressure etc but I still feel sick everyday
I'm also currently on SSRI medication (citalopram) and receiving counselling sessions from university (on my third one currently)
Also, I've always had trouble socialising and now I think I've realised that I don't have a personality really."
3709,I have always had anxiety about the medications I am prescribed for being sick etc.
3710,I recently went to the doctor for a soar throat and was prescribed Z-Pack.
3711,After stupidly going on Google and researching the medicine I found that there was a report that says it can cause sudden cardiovascular death.
3712,I haven't taken the medicine yet but I already have anxiety over it and I feel as though I will have an anxiety attack if I take it.
3713,Should I take the Medicine anyway?
3714,I looked into it and CBT years ago because I had no money to afford therapy and I wanted to fix this problem without taking medication.
3715,"Tried some meds, didn't work, and I got worse and worse."
3716,"Finally got on the right medicine, life is going so much better."
3717,"So, I'm off those meds and I begin having panic episodes."
3718,They had been wanting to put me on depression meds but I had been fighting it.
3719,I started on a new medication.
3720,"**TODAY:** About 1.5 or 2 years later now, the medication is working great, no side effects, and the majority of my symptoms have gone away now."
3721,I work in the creative field and I think one of those go-to arguments was that meds may affect your creativity and such.
3722,"Truthfully, for me, it didn't affect me but positively once I found the medication that worked for me."
3723,"I basically went to my school counsellor, who told me there's 'take as needed' medication for anxiety (which I wanted, my anxiety was never that bad), I went to my doctor, he told me it's too addictive and gave me Effexor XR which I took gladly because like I said, my anxiety was topical; I'd feel anxious before presenting, or before meeting someone new."
3724,"It was never an issue I suffered everyday with, and because my anxiety wasn't that bad, I was brave to start this new medication."
3725,i do not want to take medicine.
3726,I have memory problems and I'm on anxiety and clinical depression medicine aswell.
3727,"But I just wanted to make a post saying that for the last 4 or 5 days I've felt pretty much like the old me, the pre-medication, pre-seizure me."
3728,TLDR: Starting to feel like me again after struggling with my diagnosis and medication.
3729,I have considered all other things that involve someone with a phD prescribing me meds that I can't pronounce and talking to a councellor but first I would like to gain some perspective on my situation.
3730,"After suffering from severe social anxiety for my whole life and taking meds for 9 years, I decided to start seeing a psychologist 2 months ago."
3731,Is there any way the medicine could hurt my anxiety even more?
3732,You know the person who cares so much about their job they will literally put their HRT medication at work?
3733,Anyway me and my doctor decided to try a medication swap as I just wasn't functioning.
3734,Talking to a psychologist or taking medication and all are not really options for me.
3735,"(no meds because doctors suck so hard) I'm not afraid of flying, I'm just worried that with this increased anxiety things that didn't bother me are suddenly going to make me have an anxiety attack."
3736,This is the first time I have taken a medication for it longer than a month.
3737,"I don't feel like the medication was helping (especially considering the amount of anxiety I still feel about getting refills despite being medicated), but the withdrawal is unbearable."
3738,"So I'm on a few meds, saphris (anti physcotic) tegretol  (mood stabilizer) and Zoloft I have been on this mixture for over a year now and it seems to be working but I have no sex drive at all I was wondering if anyone else experiences this or I'm just totally crazy and on my own (commence anxiety about posting this nowwww)"
3739,"I was recently diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks and was given a prescription for an as-needed medication, 'ativan' to use during panic attacks."
3740,"I was wondering though, if anyone else has experience with a similar medication who might be willing to share strategies they have for only using the medicine when they need it so they can avoid getting addicted."
3741,And nobody is willing to rearrange my meds because I'm only 24 and it would set me up for a life of disaster.
3742,Side note: I'm not allowed any anti anxiety medication because I'm on blood thinners related to the traumatic event.
3743,"My Councillor tells me I need to consider ""Mild"" anxiety medication."
3744,"I was offended because my initial response was 'that's a bandaid not a solution' then she told me 'well you better consider it because I don't see a reason for us to talk anymore so it's your only option'

TLDR; My Councillor said I'm not doing CBT, go on Anxiety meds."
3745,"My question is, has anyone else been skeptical about ""Mild"" anxiety meds, given it a try and it actually made a difference??"
3746,"23f victim of anxiety disorder

Anxiety is worse than any physical pain I could ever recall."
3747,It hurts you deeply and so misunderstood!
3748,We're called crazy... because no one understands.
3749,Mind is constantly racing and your life IS your phobia.
3750,Screw deep breathing!
3751,I just wanted to be fixed!
3752,"It started when i was 16, I took a medication that I happened to later find out I was allergic to."
3753,It was a Sunday so I had to go to a health clinic because all the doctors offices were closed.
3754,My heart was racing (144 resting heart rate) and I was on the verge of passing out.
3755,PASSING OUT... FAINTING... that was NOW my phobia.
3756,I live in the south east united states so it gets really hot here.
3757,Heat scared me... low blood sugar scared me... bridges scared me because I couldn't pull over if I were to faint.
3758,(Or so I thought) I checked out from school every single day... until finally they sent me to the school shrink and I realized I had an anxiety problem.
3759,I did crazy things like not getting in a car unless it was already turned on with air conditioning for a few minutes and I had to have an ice pack with me.
3760,Always carried bananas and crackers in my backpack at school just incase I happen to get low blood sugar.
3761,After about 3 months they started medicating me.
3762,Lexipro...Buspar (both anxiety medications) stomach medication (due to the anxiety I was producing too much stomach acid) I was in HELL...
3763,I wanted to die.
3764,This was no way to live...
3765,I surely couldn't live like this forever.
3766,I couldn't drive... leave my house... hang out with friends.
3767,I was too scared... worst part is no one understood.
3768,Fast forward to 3 therepists and 4 medications later I met someone who saved my life.
3769,She was a Cognitive Behavioral therepist... after 2 years of my life wasted to my phobia she fixed me.
3770,She forced me to face my fears.
3771,That's all I had to do.. face my fears!
3772,Cognitive behavioral therepy saved my life...
3773,I am now 23 years old and on no medications for anxiety.
3774,Passing out is not even a thought that crosses my mind.
3775,"Here's a few tips she gave me: 

* carry your ice pack around to hot places... you'll use it until you realize you won't need it anymore."
3776,(Use your crutch to help you get out.
3777,Slowly pull yourself apart from it at your own pace.)
3778,*DEEP BREATHING..deep breathing always made me feel worse... like I couldn't breathe.
3779,So I started to count.. 1..2...3..4..5... in....5..4...3..2..1 out.
3780,I was in control.
3781,*crossing the bridge was the hardest thing for me.
3782,I had to do it because I live in a small town where you HAVE to cross a 3 mile bridge to get to anything worth while.
3783,I would call my mom everyday to and from work or school.
3784,Making her talk the whole way.
3785,Then...
3786,I only needed her half way... then a quarter... then not at all.
3787,(Again using a crutch to help you...
3788,I used it until I didn't need to anymore.)
3789,*always carrying a small snack... turned into just carrying a dollar or 2 to go the vending machine just incase I was feeling a little low and hungry.
3790,Anyway I know this isnt much but I wanted to give some people a little hope.
3791,Seeing other people go through something that controls their life...its anything but fair.
3792,Its a long road but it will get better... this isn't the end.
3793,:)
3794,"Upon taking the medication, I experienced a high."
3795,I almost fainted when I was writing my exam (reason for taking expired allergy medication).
3796,"I got used to been an aspie and kind of thought of it as a privilege, but know matter how many psychologists i saw and medication i took i still could not get to school."
3797,"So, some background."
3798,F/24.
3799,My mom passed away in 2011 from brain cancer.
3800,"Well 6 months after that I started getting anxiety, I hadn't had it before that."
3801,Every time I would leave the house I would black out for a second and get really confused.
3802,"Then I felt weird, like I couldn't grasp what anything was or who I was."
3803,After awhile I eventually felt better.
3804,I moved and got a job.
3805,"I was fine at work, I rarely ever got anxious."
3806,But I recently moved again in January and I lost my job because I didn't have transportation to get to work.
3807,"Anyways, last month my boyfriend and I were out running errands and I blacked out again and started freaking out really bad."
3808,It took me like 20 minutes to calm down.
3809,It was worse than the first time it happened.
3810,"A few weeks later I decided I wanted to get out of the house again, so I had my aunt and uncle pick me up."
3811,"Again, the same thing happened."
3812,My aunt and uncle ignored me while this happened.
3813,It went on for 45 minutes until I finally just had them take me home.
3814,It was terrible.
3815,I've never felt so out of control.
3816,I haven't left the house since then.
3817,I'm really afraid of this happening again.
3818,I don't know how to leave the house without this happening again.
3819,"Also, I've never been to the doctor for this and I'm not on any medications."
3820,I also have depression but never saw anyone for it.
3821,I've just kind of dealt with it.
3822,I don't have medical insurance.
3823,I don't know what to do.
3824,"I don't know what triggered it a month ago, it happened out of the blue."
3825,I was leaving the house regularly and I wasn't stressed or anything.
3826,Even when this happened the first time it seemed like it happened out of the blue.
3827,Has anyone had any similar experiences or have any advice?
3828,"I've just started taking this medication and had high hopes for it, but this dizziness is very unpleasant."
3829,"I guess what I'm hoping for is some glimmer of light, a reason to believe that I could get rid of this somehow, preferably without meds."
3830,I just downed some sleep meds.
3831,I really just need to get things off my chest.
3832,"Generalized anxiety is getting the better of me in more ways than one, I feel like an emotional wrecking ball and I've suffered with it for many years :( I'm a student at University, and it seems when exam season comes round my anxiety spikes."
3833,"I worry so much and it just seems that as each day that goes by i'm picking up more and more issues to carry around on my shoulders, although they're probably not that big to some people."
3834,"I'm having troubles with getting work in on time for University, I can't go on a night out and have a few drinks with friends without my anxiety spiking the next day and panic attacks, caffeine is out of the question to help with having no energy all of the time because it turns me into a big ball of anxiety."
3835,"I'm also managing my own business on the side which is unbearably stressful sometimes but I need the money, I can't walk down a street without thinking about what every single person I walk past is thinking about me and I have no-one to talk to who will understand why I let these little things get to me properly who will understand fully."
3836,"Then there's the bigger things which really get to me, like i'm my partners only support and family in his life which is stressful but he makes me very happy, and alleviates a lot of my anxiety most of the time, although he doesn't understand it."
3837,"I also feel like a god awful cheating person because I gave a family friend a friendly kiss on the cheek goodbye one night months ago (I know, you don't need to tell me how stupid that is, it didn't even faze me until I over thought it the next day and now I carry this about with me each day)."
3838,"I also do a lot of stuff home for my mother to help her with her anxiety and depression, for example in trying to get the house in order and support her and my siblings as much as possible."
3839,I have tried some medications which just heightened by depression and anxiety.
3840,I'm also useless at remembering to take them every day.
3841,"I've tried therapy to but I can only get 6 week sessions for free, and I accomplished nothing throughout it over than short term relief of having someone to rant to, but I don't feel like this was the therapists fault."
3842,These feelings fade every once in a while but anxiety and negative thinking always comes to bite me at the worst of times.
3843,I regularly have suicidal and hopeless thoughts.
3844,"My friends are great and nice people, but not the kind of people I expect to understand this and I would just feel like an emotional burden talking to them, so I just pretend I'm happy around them instead."
3845,"I know no-one can magically make my anxiety disappear, but just writing my thoughts up here and ranting has made me feel better to be honest :)."
3846,"Sometimes I worry about so much at once that thoughts just feel so disorganized, maybe some people here might relate to a bit of what I'm saying."
3847,I find it so hard to rationalize and deal with stress I just wish this would go away.
3848,"I suffer with backaches, headaches, and burning in my stomach I get so stressed."
3849,I'm sorry if this just sounds like i'm rambling and doesn't make sense I just wrote it up as I thought it.
3850,Hopefully I won't feel like this anymore one day!
3851,So I repeated the same thing medication.
3852,"I am a 30/m with social anxiety which seems to manifest mainly as ""performance"" anxiety - activities where I am expected to be good at something and the focus is partially or all on me."
3853,"These examples might seem silly to people with other types of anxiety but here are some: 

* Playing frisbee with friends (I had so much anxiety once that I sent a frisbee into a completely different yard - definitely didn't help)
* Playing beer pong (I'll start to tremble and miss the table completely)
* Karaoke
* Introducing myself in a group

After a few beers my fear is lowered and I can perform somewhat better in these situations."
3854,I wanted to see if anyone has similar experiences and has found a way to cope - either through medication or some other method.
3855,"I am currently on Mirtazipine and Buproprion which mostly help with my depression, but my anxiety isn't helped much."
3856,**tl;dr I get nervous when performing in social settings and want to find possible medications or methods to get over it.
3857,**
3858,"Using a new alt-account since my ex knows of my previous account, and to avoid giving her any satisfaction, I don't wish for her to see it directly from me."
3859,"This past year has been very taxing, Many up's and downs."
3860,It's been a full year now since I've moved.
3861,She broke up with me after 7 long years in a relationship to date someone she met via Tinder.
3862,"That's neither here, nor there."
3863,This past week my job has been extremely difficult.
3864,Both mentally and physically.
3865,I've been trying my best to prove myself and my self-worth to this company in hope to be promoted into a better suited position for me.
3866,Little things have been racking up.
3867,"I've been taking things more personally than I normally do from work, so I can ""move up"" the corporate ladder."
3868,A major shit-show of a project rolled into work.
3869,You know what I'm talking about.
3870,"One of those ""WE NEED THIS DONE YESTERDAY"" kind of projects, with little to no planning on their end."
3871,"Normally, this wouldn't be such a big deal since other co-workers can and usually jump in to help the situation."
3872,"But like I said, I'm really trying to ""showoff"" and they are busy with their own projects at hand."
3873,"On top of this, it feels as if my current girlfriend has been drifting apart from me."
3874,"Normally I would move on, but I feel something special with her."
3875,Something different.
3876,"without divulging into much, I tried to kiss her this morning before I left for work."
3877,She doesn't even look at me.
3878,"Feelings of shame, guilt, and insecurities as if I have done something wrong immediately come to my mind."
3879,It's an issue I've dealt with my entire life (and I'm currently seeking therapy for).
3880,I grow anxious that she's going to break up with me.
3881,"I would do it myself, to avoid being hurt anymore, but I like her."
3882,A lot.
3883,Border-line falling in love with her.
3884,"Recently I've started testosterone therapy as well, I've noticed that it did help immensely for several months, now it feels as if I'm slipping back into my depression and anxiety."
3885,I can't go back to that.
3886,It was a terrible time in my life.
3887,contemplating suicide and irrational thoughts.
3888,"I fear that I may slip back into that depressive state, that constant feeling of anxiety and ""unknown."""
3889,"That feeling of ""chest pressure"" lurking over me."
3890,I don't wish to go back to drugs.
3891,I was taking several anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications for years.
3892,I managed to stop roughly 4 months ago.
3893,I really don't wish to move back onto them....
3894,Thanks gals &amp; guys.
3895,"I know that my rambling probably don't make sense, but this helps me decompress."
3896,Anxiety medicine is the only thing that makes me sleep but turns me in an angry zombie for 24hrs.
3897,Problem is this medication is making me extremely tired.
3898,Or maybe see if they changed medication (like Celexa) and had a lesser side effect.
3899,Having to tell people that I have anxiety and panic attacks is one thing... telling them that I have to take schizophrenia medication is another.
3900,I know it would be well controlled with the medication but with all the medication I do take it makes it harmful to have children..
3901,I've never been for medication.
3902,"I was diagnosed with clinical depression in high school, which, combined with several family related issues, caused me to fail out and generally be in a daze until a couple of years ago when my meds started working and I was able to get (mostly) back on track."
3903,"Now, in my second year of college, I'm off my depression meds and having anxiety issues remembering what happened to me in high school, and it's gotten so bad that I can barely attend classes."
3904,"Should I just keep it to myself, even if I going back on medication?"
3905,"(Quick info: F, 21, stressed about school and being around others + their expectations, no medication now but previously on Wellbutrin and Ritalin)"
3906,"I do not want to take any medicine for this though, because I hear that those can be addictive and do not work long term."
3907,"But anyway, I'm on meds this time so hopefully it won't end up like that again."
3908,It's like the anxiety is getting too strong for the meds to handle.
3909,So I have a severe form of anxiety of all kinds.
3910,Social included.
3911,"Stemming from this, I have become a hypochondriac."
3912,Yay.
3913,Anyways..
3914,"I have to take a 1g dose of azithromycin for an infection but because of my hypochondrism, I think that by taking it I will get all the crappy side effects including a deadly heart arrhythmia."
3915,What makes it worse is I feel like I have an un diagnosed heart condition.
3916,Doesn't help I can't stand feeling my pulse or hearing it while trying to sleep.
3917,"I haven't taken anything including Tylenol since January because I have bad acid reflux from all the stress

I guess my questions are: how do you guys get over anxiety to taking medications and also have any of you taking the one day dose and what side effects did you have?"
3918,Side note: I'm allergic to cillins (amox and pen) so that doesn't help either worrying if I may be allergic to this as well.
3919,Pro tip: don't read medicine side-effect pamphlets
3920,"This goes for any other type of product (toothpaste, pop, lotion, medicine, etc.)"
3921,"I am scared of medication as I don't quite believe pharmaceutical companies have the best interest for us, but our money."
3922,"I started medication 3 weeks ago and I'm working on it slowly with my therapist, but money's getting tight."
3923,My sister woke me up early this morning looking for meds because she had vomiting and diarrhea.
3924,"I totally feel apart 
at work the other day and my boss suggested I take the summer off to reevaluate my medication and whatnot."
3925,I had a panic attack/anxiety almost two weeks ago and very foolishly quit going to work.
3926,I don't know what went wrong with me or why I did it.
3927,I can usually talk myself out of my nervous state and carry on like it's nothing but for some reason lately I have been over come.
3928,I moved across the country in January to be with my bf.
3929,"I live with him,his sister, and her husband."
3930,My bf is all I have here.
3931,Every time I start looking at jobs to start applying for a new one my heart starts racing and I get that panicky feeling like i'm going to pass out.
3932,I then just start thinking about how stupid it was of me to quit my job and how hard it's going to be for me to get another one.
3933,My bf has been supporting financially me since I moved here and I can't stop worrying that he is going to get tired of it and me and kick me to the curb or tell me to go ahead and move back home.
3934,I'm starting to feel panicked just writing this.
3935,To top all of this off I have been having stomach pain for the last 2 months.
3936,I am on 2 medications but it is not getting better and i'm starting to wonder if it has to do with my mental state.
3937,Has anyone else dealt with this?
3938,I want to ask for help but i'm embarrassed/ashamed.
3939,My bfs sister has psychotic break a few weeks ago and I don't want anyone to know what's going on inside me because i'm afraid they'll think i'm faking or just out for attention.
3940,I just want to feel like a normal person and stop constantly feeling ashamed for being me.
3941,Sorry for all the text.
3942,I went back on my anxiety medication (nortriptyline 50 mg at night) and was in counseling for a while.
3943,"I saw my doctor today who told me that she would tell the people at the mental health services place to get me in pronto, and she prescribed me a medicine to take before driving."
3944,I would like a medicine to take before driving to calm my nerves but not something that could possibly lower my blood pressure to dangerous levels (I have anxiety about having heart problems.)
3945,all i have in terms of medication is a 25mg dose of hydroxizine  (which i usually only use part of).
3946,"I also read over the counter cough meds can cause simmilar affects, oddly enough dylsem causes the same thing to happen when I take it."
3947,"I used to want to study medicine, but I can't anymore because I am too terrified of being around sick people."
3948,I keep saying that I don't need this medication and that I should just go to a spiritual retreat or something but I do think that I have been downplaying the extent of my issues to myself.
3949,Last November I decided to stop taking my meds.
3950,"I didn't want to be on medicine forever, I thought I could handle it through proper exercise and meditation."
3951,I was trying so hard not to be on meds.
3952,I really do have an imbalance that can't be handled without meds.
3953,Tldr: tried not taking meds and failed miserably...
3954,I already took my dosage of antidepressant/antianxiety meds but I think I'm having a minor mental break/panic attack all of the sudden and I can't stop shaking.
3955,I've been on 3 different types of medication in my life and nothing has worked.
3956,"Now that the doctors have given anti-anxiety medication, she has been able to start eating more but she is still struggling with anxiety attacks."
3957,"I'm constantly thinking about me not being me, like depersonalisation/derealisation, that I will go insane, and If I will leave this untreated with meds , my brian chemistry will change forever and I wouldn't be able to feel again me."
3958,"For example: I have now finished my exams with marks over 90% , I'm in the last year of medicine school."
3959,I don't want psychotherapy or meds.
3960,Please share your experiences as well on getting off your meds.
3961,I don't want to take medicine.
3962,"Can you start reacting to the medicine differently later on, or if it works for you will it tend to keep on working?"
3963,"If this is going to be a long lasting side effect, I'd almost rather deal with learning to control my anxiety without medication."
3964,"Tried several meds, currently on Prozac."
3965,No meds have seemed to help.
3966,"I've never taken medication for anxiety before, but I'd certainly consider it as this pain is already starting to drive me crazy."
3967,So unless I find a job real soon I’ll be in a world of pain once I run out of Cipralex and the withdrawal from my medication kicks in.
3968,I decided to write it here because the other mental health professionals that I've spoken with where I live only seem to focus on increasing the dosage of my medication when finding some sort of regular income would actually be more helpful.
3969,"Around 2007 I got these really scary panic-attacks that resulted in me getting SSRI medication, which worked for me."
3970,"I tried to get myself of them too early though so I ended up getting back on another medication(Mirtazapin, since I had trouble sleeping due to anxiety)."
3971,"Because honestly, before my OCD episode this year, I had never considered myself to need meds and looked down on people who were on them."
3972,"Some info, we're both in our early 20's, she's in therapy but not on medication."
3973,Finding myself taking the Clonazepam that just sits in the medicine cabinet most of the year.
3974,"First time posting here, so let me give some back story on my current situation."
3975,"I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety, and mild ADD by several doctors throughout my life."
3976,"I've tried several different medications, and they do help, but I'd prefer to be off of them because of the lack of enthusiasm I experience for things like creativity and sex."
3977,"I started seeing a new therapist again a couple months ago, which was going well, but I can't ever get a session scheduled with her anymore."
3978,Her appointments are always booked up when I'm available to go.
3979,"It's frustrating, I don't know why her office even accepted me as a new patient, especially since I didn't ask for her specifically, just anyone who was accepting patients and took my insurance."
3980,"Kind of burnt out on it because of that, and since I've managed to tackle one or two big issues since then on my own (like reaching out to an ex-religion support group, and confronting my sister on a difficult subject) I've decided to stop trying to schedule appointments with her."
3981,"I've started self-treatment with herbal supplements like St. John's Wart, B complex vitamins, and nicotine in the form of electronic cigarettes."
3982,"Since I've started using e-cigs I've noticed some positive effects, less nausea, driving to work is easier, I'm able to calm down quicker."
3983,"It's also become something to pour myself into, I tend to get obsessed with things that I discover I like."
3984,"I spend hours researching, reading, online shopping, and ultimately dropping quite a bit of money."
3985,"My hobbies typically don't last long, once I find a new thing to obsess over, I switch all focus to that thing."
3986,Right now it's e-cigs.
3987,"I discovered there's a convention next month for e-cig enthusiasts, with lots of vendors and things like raffles."
3988,"It sounds fun in theory, but last time I went to a convention (anime con) by myself I wound up sitting in the corner of the lobby having a panic attack."
3989,I do not know anyone who'd be interested in going with me.
3990,It's kind of a weird thing to be interested in if you're not an ex-smoker.
3991,I already feel like an outsider for that reason.
3992,"I'm not using them to quit smoking, I'm using them because I can't leave the house sometimes."
3993,"I want to go, but I don't know if I can make myself."
3994,My heart rate is going up just thinking about it.
3995,Finer than before meds.
3996,"Pain, uselessness, reliving fights... Can't stop obsessing but I don't want to say out loud the thoughts I'm having, or what happened with my family...and I don't want to take Zoloft anymore but I don't want to test meds until something else works."
3997,5 years of no libido plus I gained almost 60 lbs on meds.
3998,"I know I need help, honestly to the point where I think I need meds."
3999,My dad told me to try to write a list of things that stop me from getting out and functioning and doing important things like going to the doctor and going through the one by one.
4000,But the thought of making that list maeks me anxious so Ihaven't done it yet.
4001,Is there any other tips or anyone else there who has agoraphobia and trouble leaving there house?
4002,I'd love to hear from someone else as I can feel quite alone wich should be no surprise.
4003,Edit: Thanks for your replies.
4004,I have the full story of my life right here.
4005,Warning WALL OF TEXT!
4006,Just wanted to give some background.
4007,it's not very organized though but it's one of hte first time I was able to do this without getting upset recalling all the details.
4008,I was actually trying to get help but the help here is really shitty.
4009,I have PTSD because my parents sent me to the psychiatric ward and I got stuck in an abusive group home.
4010,Shit sucks.
4011,Thanks.
4012,"For me it's not so much the idea of leaving the house, it's just I'm afraid of going out because I'm afraid of anxiety attacks."
4013,What's worse is that I have severe allergies brought on by a chronic sinus infection which feeds into my allergies.
4014,"Even worse is that I'm (high functioning) autistic/aspergers so I have sensory integration problems, that I am using deep pressure input to prevent meltdowns, but it still feeds into agoraphobia."
4015,For example my front yard is not private.
4016,If things aren't private I just get uncomfortable.
4017,I have to shut all the doors in my house for this reason because it feels uncomfortable if door are left ajar.
4018,I always have my back to a wall and I can't sit infront of a door.
4019,My Doctor's office is cramped and has fluorescent lights and my glasses are too thick and I'm too blind to wear sunglasses so it all feeds into my agoraphobia.
4020,Unfortunately when I was about 15 (23 now) my anxiety problems climaxed because I was overprescribed medications.
4021,I had a nervous breakdown because I was hallucinating and got sent to psychiatric wards where I became traumatized.
4022,"In saying that I do physically leave my house once a week because of garbage day and I am trying to stick my head out the door or just chill on my porch more but the noise (Sensory problems, hypersensitive) and the fact my property just fucking sucks and it is not private makes me uncomfortable for non-agoraphobic reasons."
4023,When I was living at my parents house I was a lot more comfortable outside.
4024,2 years ago or longer I was getting help from someone at a home care agency to help me get out of the house more.
4025,We were driving at least 3 times a week and going to a coffee shop a few times a week and also doing a lot of errands.
4026,Unfortunately since I was working with a BMS who was less than adequate to say the least I felt like I was forced to live with the workers because she treated me like a low functioning autistic person who could not make decisions or my own or a child.
4027,"She was the one who got me sent to a traumatic group home where I was literally almost killed and traumatized for 7 months and she didn't understand that I just wanted to relax and get used to my new apartment and living on my own before I started adding to it with school, hobbies and shit."
4028,She was truly really shitty at her job.
4029,The BMS quit and I still stuck with the home care workers but there was no plan in place.
4030,The BMS' job was to have a plan so I end up becoming independent and not agoraphobic.
4031,So what happened was that my independence actually lessoned because before that point I wanted to do things by myself and I was getting out by myself.
4032,"I ended up with only 1 home care worker because out of 4 of them two were grossly undertrained, the most trained and senior worker was burnt out from drugs and permanently fried from when he was younger and would sleep on my couch everyday."
4033,The last worker I worked with really well but we didn't really accomplish everything besides going out every day.
4034,Which was nice but I relied on her too much and my independence vanished.
4035,I was also walking almost literally every day or every second day.
4036,hen my home care worker left.
4037,The sinus infection has been here for 2 years and my allergies have gone wild and prevents me from going outside.
4038,"It feeds into agoraphobia because if I don't get allergies, which I'm not exagerrating I get everytime I go outside anyways, I'm afraid of it so even in winter I am afraid of going out for allergy reasons."
4039,It sucks because I predicted this would happen with the home care worker and she didn't give me any time before she quit and it just really screwed me over.
4040,Around that time my therapist left even though I was telling her as much information as I am in this post about being agoraphobic.
4041,"I told her I thought I had PTSD from the group homes and psychiatric hospitals and assault and attempted rapes and what not, but she wouldn't listen and we argued about it."
4042,Then she quit.
4043,Chronic sinus infection happened and I became bedridden.
4044,My allergies have been absolutely haywire.
4045,I stopped walking everyday.
4046,I got fat which added to my sensory integration problems.
4047,(I'm sensitive to touch so it's really difficult to get used to different clothes and I need new clothes cause I'm a gained like 50 pounds.)
4048,I stopped going out of the house and everything fed into my agoraphobiaAround this time was when my therapist quit.
4049,I realized my family doctors were shitty doctors and had to find anew one by the change was too hard to deal with so I haven't seen him much.
4050,My home care worker quit working with me because she wanted a better job.
4051,It's been like this for at least 2 years now.
4052,Had a friend but he moved to Europe.
4053,I have a new family doctor now but I haven't been able to see him.
4054,I'm talking to my family at least a couple times a week and my friend on the phone literally everyday.
4055,He helps me out if I ever have flashbacks or meltdowns and I'm able to talk about anxiety and stuff with my parents.
4056,"My parents help me get groceries since I don't go out now, but I understand so much about myself to know it's not going to help my anxiety."
4057,But at the same time talking to htem everyday is going to help me when I start going out to get groceries by myself and the doctor.
4058,"So it's a start, but it feels like its' so slow since I'm so fucking sick all the time."
4059,I have a lot of health problems and I feel like I'm going ot die a lot.
4060,I gave up when every other form of medicine kept leading to either hair loss or weight gain.
4061,"But this thing has really helped me out, written by a Harvard MD with scientific results; it blends eastern philosophy (meditation, breathing techniques) with western medicine."
4062,I am on so many fucking meds and the only one that does anything lasts for two hours and is highly addictive.
4063,I quit my meds.
4064,I dont want ot have to be on meds for the rest of my life.
4065,I am currently overseas in a country where English is the official language that no one actually speaks.
4066,In Africa.
4067,"I speak the local language pretty well, but not all that well."
4068,3 months ago I had a bad thing happen to me.
4069,I began having anxiety issues shortly thereafter.
4070,"I went to a ""doctor's assistant"" last week (she can prescribe medicines but she is not a doctor) who did not speak English."
4071,"She prescribed .5 mg alprazolam for me and said something along the lines of, ""Take one; if that does not help enough, take another one, and maybe then some more."""
4072,"The indications on the bottle are not even in a language I know--I think this is Swahili, which I do not speak."
4073,I need to get this shit under control because I have work to do and my situation is dangerous.
4074,I need to have my wits about me.
4075,I need to take enough of this medicine to stifle the anxiety response.
4076,"I need to _not_ OD on this because the nearest ER is...I can't even describe that problem, and you wouldn't believe me if I tried."
4077,"How many milligrams of alprazolam is it safe for a female, 5'3"", 125 lbs, to take?"
4078,"I am taking an anti-malarial--chloroquine, I just take it once a week."
4079,"The chloroquine gives me nightmares, so that's another reason I kind of want to make the xanax start working for me."
4080,I have been trying to read more about chloroquine side effects and it looks like anxiety can be a side effect.
4081,But I don't even know if I can safely go off chloroquine and onto something else.
4082,"I am also supposed to get the yellow fever vaccine next week, since there is an outbreak here and I did not get it before I left the US."
4083,I would like to hear your experiences with medications.
4084,"People who are suffering from different kinds of anxiety and depression, which medication was the most effective for you."
4085,Both prescription drugs and natural herb capsules are welcomed.
4086,"I've taken antidepressents/antianxiety medication for fifteen years, and I've taken Pristiq since it became available."
4087,"Now, for two days, I've taken it, but it doesn't feel like I've taken it; I get that weird ""you haven't taken your medicine in some time"" feeling: cloudy head, balance issues, so on and so forth."
4088,"Anyone have any idea of how to get back to that good point while i was taking escitalopram, or can perhaps suggest a new medication?"
4089,"I've tried all sorts of medication (Zoloft, Abilify, Effexor, Prozac, Viibryd, then back to Zoloft with Xanex and Clonazepam added to those)."
4090,"This is the original: http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2h9b8o/meds_stories_about_zoloft/ 
If it doesnt work go to my profile I don't have alot of posts you'll easily see which i meant."
4091,"When I first started medication and was feeling the lowest I'd ever fest you guys would talk me through it, when I felt like my head was going to blow up, again, you guys were here for me."
4092,Does medication help paranoia?
4093,"Ultimately, I am scared, as always, that I will regress and not make progress with my anxiety, that the meds will stop working or I will get worse with each anxious episode I have - and I am also terrified that my anxiety is going to drive away the person I love, the person I am engaged to marry."
4094,I'm not on medication and to be honest my life is pretty good right now even with every now and then there are super stressful times like exams and stuff.
4095,I'm afraid to take medication because of the side effects and get the impression they don't really work.
4096,"I'm currently on (new) medication, Mirtazapine, although this was happening before I started on that."
4097,"Finally got a hold of the doctors and everything and they've started me on Pristiq, took my first tablet about an hour ago, really nervous about this new medicine, but hoping it's gonna help a lot."
4098,"If I feel worse I'll see a doc, but I feel like if I can endure a flu with anxiety, with nothing more than over the counter meds, that when I finally wake up feeling better I'm going to feel some major relief from an anxiety standpoint."
4099,"Of course one should consult a doctor, consider medication, therapy, etc etc."
4100,"But so far, out of everything I've tried (including some prescription meds with horrible side effects and withdrawal symptoms) this has left me feeling the most positive and like it's actually helping, and figured I'd pass it on in case anyone else had been looking for something new, or wasn't sure about trying meditation."
4101,"I started it on Feb 3rd and have been feeling more anxious, which she told me might happen while the meds regulate."
4102,Anybody else have any experience with this medicine for anxiety and how did it work??
4103,I've never been on medicine before so I'm just trying to have as much knowledge as I can.
4104,"I did stop at an emergicare to get some headache meds, but forgot to ask for a note (which I don't actually need for my bosses/work, just an afterthought as a way to ""prove"" that I was actually ""sick"")."
4105,"If it is medication, I want help."
4106,"But I'm afraid that if I were to be prescribed medication, it might change me in ways I'd regret."
4107,"To those of you who are taking medication for anxiety, how has it helped you?"
4108,I took extra meds and worked through all of my breathing exercises but nothing helped.
4109,I'm undergoing treatment for GAD and am taking medication but I'm not sure if it'll help too much.
4110,I also was recently diagnosed with clinical depression and am not on any form of medication.
4111,My life is unusually stressful right now and will be for several more months -- now is just the wrong time to take this medication away from me.
4112,had uti  was treated with medicine and got 100% better.
4113,"Got same feeling, went to doctor, tested negative for uti but put on medicine."
4114,"So I was on Zoloft 25mg off and on for a couple years, never really made me feel any better."
4115,"Over the last few months I've had a lot of anxiety issues, first about my job, and then about the insomnia that anxiety caused."
4116,"I was able to get it under control via a mixture of medications (Ativan and Ambien) and exercise, but been having problems again recently."
4117,"After speaking to my doctor, and asking for a strong anti-anxiety drug, they switched me over to Lexapro."
4118,"I took half my Zoloft pill for a week, and then started taking 10mg Lexapro about a week and-a-half ago (the plan to go to 20gm after a month)."
4119,"Since then my anxiety hasn't felt any better, and I've still been having sleeping problem (ie, I sleep 6-7 hours a night, but have to take my sleeping meds, which I don't like taking) and my anxiety has been really bad."
4120,"Is this normal, should I be concerned?"
4121,"I'm tempted to keep on the Lexapro for a few more days, to see what happens, but I feel like complete hell."
4122,"(On meds for it now)
- how the body works - foot bone connected to the leg bone.. yeah that'll pretty much do it."
4123,I don't want to me on meds for the rest of my life for it.
4124,"I tried to go to the local pharmacy an hour ago to pick up my meds, and I seemed okay talking to people as they passed by, saying hi and smiling even though I was in a ton of pain and super depressed."
4125,"My parents think talking to a counselor might help, the truth is I wouldn't mind some anti-anxiety meds."
4126,"That aside, I am taking medicine and that's working extremely well until something happens and just fucks me up completely."
4127,Having a mild but drawn out anxiety attack is incredibly stressful.
4128,Somebody tell my system to stop freaking out.
4129,"Feels like somebody dosed me, with my heart skipping around and running at twice it's normal speed and adrenaline pumping through my system."
4130,"But it's not fun, it's not a high."
4131,"Instead of getting that last push or bit of energy from it from a short burst of adrenaline, it's actually quite draining because it's constant."
4132,"In case you were wondering, this is a small part of what having an Anxiety Disorder is like...and it's a lot more common than people know."
4133,This doesn't include the full blown attacks or having next to no control over what triggers it or being able to handle it once it does.
4134,"It can also feed/amplify any ADHD problems you may have, making it incredibly hard to focus."
4135,Imagine how that can effect your school or work.
4136,"Or if you have triggers from social situations (not my problem but I know those who do), or from flying, etc."
4137,Imagine how that can constrict and impair your life.
4138,"Most medications they suggest for this tend to make you into high functioning zombies in my experience  so to avoid that if you can, all you can do is learn your triggers and practice coping mechanisms - like chamomile tea or meditation for me."
4139,"If you're really lucky, that works; or if you're really poor, that has to be enough."
4140,I want to try going off my meds to determine whether it's a matter of chemical imbalances vs. external factors.
4141,I am on meds and the depression is at bay for now.
4142,I'm currently taking 30 milligrams of Citalopram once daily and I was wondering if taking vitamins or anything else would interfere with my meds?
4143,The meds aren't making much of a difference and I want to try something natural to help.
4144,"I find I'm still able to sleep relatively well if I take sleeping medication,  I'll usually wake up with little to no anxiety but as the day goes on it slowly creeps in."
4145,"I did not know where to post this, but I guess it's somewhat related."
4146,First of all let say that I am not okay.
4147,I haven't been 'okay' since I graduated high school and I was suddenly hit with anxiety out of the blue which later came depression.
4148,This caused me to take anxiety medications and later drop out of college due to low grades.
4149,I am still living with my parents and this is when shit gets worse.
4150,My parents think that I can function even though I told them that my head hasn't been in the right place and wants me to go back to school and such.
4151,Thing is my anxiety is so bad I can't even hang out with my friends anymore and my vision and thinking is just not the same.
4152,I have been using my parents house as a safe haven hoping it will eventually go away but it has not and now they are giving me all this shit that I do nothing and even putting all their crap on me (they're the reason I had mental problems in my youth growing up).
4153,Now they pretty much want me out and gets in a full rage anger on every little thing on me and I seriously just want to get out but I can't due to my limitations.
4154,I seem very normal but in the inside I'm dying in every situation.
4155,I want to join the military so I can escape them but I read that the military will not even accept people with anxiety and depression.
4156,"I want to change my life so bad and be able to live, I'm trying so hard to cope but it's amazingly difficult."
4157,I feel like I'm trapped and now I'm being kicked in the ribs whilst trapped in this real life hell I am in.
4158,"Please I need advice, I do not want to go back to taking anxiety medication.. it was the worst thing ever and have been off of it for half a year now while being on it for one and a half."
4159,"I am now 21 years old, I have no credit and I have no job, and my parents want me gone."
4160,I can't go back to school or join the army.
4161,"Never in a million years would I have thought to end up like this is life, this is total rock bottom for me."
4162,"Yet my mind somehow is calm because I think I lost the ability to feel proper emotions due to unbalanced brain chemicals, anxiety, or whatever."
4163,"But I know deep inside that my life is in complete denial right now and that is what's really killing me, it's like my mind and body want me to remain a deadbeat."
4164,WTF.
4165,"I know I can keep it in check without medication, but I just want a few tips on how to keep in under control."
4166,"I've made it to 30 with no meds, but this week some shit happened that kind of pushed the anxiety up a level and it's interfering with my ability to be productive and hide this issue."
4167,I'm not on any medication for it and I'm not exactly sure what type it is because I just started therapy.
4168,So I have been on lexapro 10mgs now for about 5 weeks now.
4169,The first 2 weeks I had anxiety because I am really sensitive to these medications.
4170,I have never had anxiety before taking these medications.
4171,"I went about 3 weeks feeling pretty good, but I just started having pretty bad anxiety to the point where I had to sit on the floor crying and hyperventilating.."
4172,"I am just wondering maybe I should lower my dose because now that the medication is at its full effect, maybe it is just too much."
4173,"I've been taking meds for about 3 months, and for the last month I've almost felt like myself again."
4174,Hi there!
4175,I'm new here.
4176,"Let me see... female, almost 19, driving cars/being a passenger in cars, no medications."
4177,"The university has a councilor, but I don't go back until September; this is an issue that affect me most during the summer employment season."
4178,"---

As a bit of background, the vast majority of my family suffers from extreme road rage."
4179,"It wasn't causing ""problems"" for me until I went on a road trip with relatives in the Arizona mountains... to make a long story short, the driver was very offended by my nervousness and his speeding nearly sent us off the switchbacks."
4180,"Before then, I would always pretend to drive the car when I was with my mom..."
4181,"I'd look out for other drivers, pretend to press pedals, and so on."
4182,"However, what I'm experiencing now is far more severe, and I'm starting to realize how much it's been affecting me."
4183,"At best, I find myself holding onto things while I'm a passenger; if the driver is calm and I'm distracted, I might just keep something in my hand."
4184,"However, if something goes ""wrong"" on the road (something as simple as a sharp turn) or if I even know to the driver to be capable of rage, I experience palpitations, tension, dizziness, and severe paranoia."
4185,"I find myself holding my breath a lot, clutch on to door handles, and try to slam on imaginary brake pedals without realizing it."
4186,"I've also screamed at cars behind us for honking; I don't mean to, but it just comes out."
4187,"After the trip, I find myself feeling completely drained and almost stunned..."
4188,I usually have to sit somewhere quiet or lie down after.
4189,"The symptoms often get worse because, again, the drivers causing this are offended by me not trusting them."
4190,"I've been told that I'm making it hard for them to drive or distracting them, which makes me more afraid... it's just a cycle."
4191,"I've tried everything I could, but even when I freeze up and hold still, the driver notices the tension."
4192,"I know there's a pattern, but the unfortunate thing is that symptoms carry over to when I'm alone, or when the driver is someone else."
4193,"The problem here is that I can't bring myself to attempt driving, and it's getting worse."
4194,"I've started to panic on quiet roads when it used to be just highways, and I get anxious even thinking about being at the wheel.The major incident happened when I was 15, so I've been able to put off driving until now... but this issue is making it hard to find jobs."
4195,I get anxious thinking about signing up for the written test (learner's permit) and the thought of driving at all causes chest pain.
4196,"I've tried looking at dashcam videos of calm driving, but I have to close the video every time."
4197,It's just too much.
4198,"Well, this post has been way too long."
4199,"I'll cut it here, but anyways... how do you start recovering from something like this?"
4200,Driving is holding me back from a lot of jobs and opportunities...
4201,I don't think I can hold off on this much longer.
4202,It just keeps getting worse.
4203,And will need to take meds most likely for the rest of my life.
4204,Even if it is taking thyroid meds daily.
4205,"I'm used to random muscular pains (Lupus) and took some meds, and the pain went away quickly."
4206,Hopefully my anxiety meds actually work tonight when I’m hanging out with my friends.
4207,I have been on meds for the past 6 years (on and off before that) and have been seeing different people at my local NHS community health team for a few years where I have received councelling and CBT.
4208,I have also recently had my meds changed after being on the same ones for 2 years.
4209,"I'm running out of medication, so I call to see what's going on, and the pharmacy has placed it on hold for an interesting reason... because of ""how expensive it is""."
4210,"So now the medication that I NEED, and they were supposed to have, they haven't refilled."
4211,This is the exact same medication that I have gotten from this exact pharmacy for almost a decade now.
4212,Yet they didn't think me renewing and refilling my prescription was an indication that I actually wanted my medication.
4213,Its gotten to the point where I've been prescribed Zofran (vomiting/nausea medication given to pregnant women) for whenever these attacks happen.
4214,So I've been somewhat anxiety-free for the past few months.
4215,I can do everything I've wanted and more.
4216,"But just this past few days, and especially today, anxiety came back even more worse."
4217,"Today, as I was about to take a bath, I felt a sudden headache and terror enveloping me."
4218,I paid no heed to it as a I was having a headache every now and then and that I was usually out of it when I relax.
4219,"But when I turned on the shower and as the water hit the top of my head, I found myself hyperventilating."
4220,I turned off the shower and stopped for a while.
4221,"Then I turned it on again, and there I go again, breathing quickly automatically."
4222,I tried searching this on the net (I couldn't stop) and I learned about the Mammalian Diving Reflex.
4223,"However, as I read through it, it said that it only happens if you are in contact with very cold water, like 0 degrees."
4224,"My shower wasn't even that cold to begin with, it was just the right amount of coldness."
4225,"I'm now considering visiting my doctor again this coming Tuesday, but as a sufferer from anxiety, I needed reassurance."
4226,What could this be?
4227,Is this another sign of anxiety or something worse?
4228,"Also, to note, I never finished my medications."
4229,I stopped the moment I felt better and never bothered tapering.
4230,Perhaps that might affect me in some way or another?
4231,I’m seriously considering taking some kind of meds though if there is something that can suppress my extreme involuntary adrenal response.
4232,**Background:** I have GAD and panic disorder.
4233,I'm a bit weary of antidepressants (what my psychiatrist first described).
4234,I just want to stay away from those.
4235,"I'd prefer to take something NPR/as needed, just because that feels safer to me."
4236,No long-term commitment.
4237,"I voiced those concerns to my psychiatrist, and she said really the only thing along those lines would be Vistaril or Atarax."
4238,**So now:** I've been taking Vistaril.
4239,"And it *kind of* helps, but I feel like I need something stronger and faster-acting (it starts working an hour and a half after I need it to)."
4240,It's just not ideal in a panic situation.
4241,I kind of get the feeling she's against benzos.
4242,"But if they'd help, I want to give them a shot."
4243,"Should I just talk it over with her, or do primary care docs prescribe those?"
4244,"What are the chances that if I just explained the situation and asked, a primary doc would prescribe?"
4245,"I'm not a drug seeker (I promise) and I don't look it, but I'd feel a little weird just straight out asking."
4246,"**TL;DR** I have panic problems, the medications I've tried aren't great, and I want to give benzos a shot."
4247,I just don't want to look like a drug seeker.
4248,And I'm overthinking everything.
4249,So how do I talk to my doc (and which doc)?
4250,Advice would be great.
4251,:)
4252,Hey guys n gals.
4253,I have been struggling with anxiety for a really long time and the battle that I'm currently fighting has been going on for over a year.
4254,In the past I have taken Paxil and Celexa.
4255,"The Celexa didn't work well with new and made me extremely anxious, nauseaus, irritable and sensitive to light."
4256,I was literally shaking in the corner.
4257,"This time around I have a prescription for Zoloft (which I haven't tried, but has worked for some family members) and I am trying to convince myself that I do need it,  it is safe to take abs that the side effects will not be the same as Celexa."
4258,Any good stories you have about medications and your experiences getting through the adjustment period would be really nice to hear.
4259,"Hello r/anxiety,
Im a 18 year old male from germany and got diagnosed with social phobia and depression 4 years ago."
4260,"My therapist suggested to go on antidepressants a few days ago.. but since i barely see any positive storys about meds, i'm kind of worried."
4261,"I saw some incredibly scary horror documentations about antidepressants(especially zoloft) causing school schootings, suicides, zombie shit and stuff."
4262,I never took any kind of medication in my life and my doctors appointment is already in 11 days.
4263,Does anyone have any positive or even life changing storys about antidepressants or any kind of anxiety medications?
4264,I would really love to hear them!
4265,":)
Sorry for my lack of english, i know it sucks :/"
4266,"During these 3 months I have been in intensive outpatient therapy, hospitalized, and finally put on medication."
4267,For some reasion this popped up in my head and I swore off medication and luckily for me the anxiety/panic attacks stopped as well.
4268,"I want to be able to go back to school but I don't want to go back without medication to help me, I don't want to go through all that again and honestly I don't think I would be able to."
4269,I've had anxiety and disassociation my entire life.
4270,I've tried like 20+ medications.
4271,I've gone to counselor after counselor.
4272,"The counselors always end up getting irritated, confrontational and rude, mainly because I intellectualize EVERYTHING, and have answers for everything (I don't think I'm always right, I just always have a description for things)."
4273,The last two called me lazy.
4274,"I've spent the last 12 years in a room with bottles of my urine (which I could not even smell), my area of house is trashed beyond belief."
4275,I feel helpless and controlled by very obsessive behavior.
4276,I have a somatic disorder that tortures me when I do things that cause heightened anxiety.
4277,"I have no outward signs of anxiety, but internally I am constantly anxious and pretty much always spaced out."
4278,"The truth is, I don't know how to express or fully feel my anxiety anymore."
4279,I'm applying for social security and will probably get turned down.
4280,I feel like I have issues that no one knows how to help.
4281,I sure as hell don't.
4282,I've been so negative my entire life that even though I try to talk some sense into myself and meditate it barely sinks in.
4283,I'm not really interested in therapy or medication at this point.
4284,He has been diagnosed and prescribed meds but I have not.
4285,"I went to my boyfriend's, he helped calm me down, gave me one of his meds and I fell asleep until the next morning."
4286,I just want to know if there is any type of medication you fellow redditor's have found that really helps that is non-narcotic?
4287,"Hi,
I'm an adult female in my 20s and Ive had moderate to severe anxiety my entire life."
4288,Many of my earliest memories and behaviors center around my anxiety problems.
4289,"I've been in therapy on and off since I was seven and have tried several medications, all of which have either had no effect or have made me worse."
4290,In some ways my anxiety is worse than it used to be and in other ways it is better.
4291,"I no longer have nearly constant, severe panic attacks."
4292,Now I only have one every so often.
4293,"On the other hand, These days I have an almost constant state of high anxiety that rarely lets up."
4294,My anxiety has always manifested very physically (eg.
4295,"Headaches, upset stomach, dizziness, heart palpitations)."
4296,The anxious thoughts are one thing but the physical element is having a majorly negative impact on my life.
4297,I also have developed new anxieties where others have disappeared.
4298,"For example I used to be terrified to drive, but gradually I got over it."
4299,"However, now Im developing a borderline phobia of eating in public."
4300,"The more I think about it the worse it seems to get, but I can't stop thinking about it."
4301,It also has a major impact on my sleep.
4302,I sleep terribly but sleeping pills give me panic attacks.
4303,I also have an almost constant feeling of dread.
4304,"Another fairly new thing for me is derealization, which I think bothers me the most."
4305,I feel like I'm in a fish tank.
4306,None of my recent therapists have been very worried about this but t scares the hell out of me.
4307,"I've gotten to where I'm better at tolerating the symptoms, but tolerating them is all I'm doing."
4308,I'm not controlling them.
4309,I'm terrified im going to end up becoming a shut in because of this.
4310,Like I said I've taken many different medications but none of them help.
4311,The last one I was on caused such severe side effects that I developed a fear of pretty much all medicine and my last therapist agreed that the anxiety the act of taking medicine caused wasn't worth the possible benefits at that given time.
4312,I've also bounced around to a lot of therapists but none of them have ever done anything to help me.
4313,"My current one is ok but she never does much for me in the way of active help, she just listens to me talk and nods along for the most part."
4314,I've developed fears of things I didn't even know we're possible to fear.
4315,I get anxiety from everything now.
4316,"Food, alcohol, medication, social situations...name it."
4317,I feel like I'm on a slippery slope of some kind.
4318,This had all leveled out for a while but I feel like it's increasing again.
4319,Is this just my lot in life?
4320,"Is it possible that some people just can't be ""fixed"" in any way?"
4321,My quality of life is ok.
4322,"I'm not miserable, I'm just frustrated and I feel like it could be so much better."
4323,Part of me also worries that I'm causing all my own problems by continuing to worry.
4324,Another part worries that there is something terribly wrong with me physically and none of this is really anxiety at all.
4325,"Would it be worth sucking it up and trying another medication (this would be the 5th for anxiety and the 9th overall) 

Also is it possible this is somehing more than general anxiety?"
4326,I was previously diagnosed with adhd and bipolar 2 but both of these diagnoses were later declared to be wrong by other therapists.
4327,Sorry this was so long I didn't mean to go on such a rant.
4328,Thanks
4329,"All three disorders are pretty mild,  but since I had success with medication before, I'm ready to get on it again."
4330,What medication would be good?
4331,"I have been to five different therapists, and I have been on medication."
4332,"Going on one medication, waiting for it to work, and being disappointed when it doesn't."
4333,"Or going on a medication that makes you so sick that, on top of your severe anxiety and depression, you're confined to your bed and house all day."
4334,But I've had my fair share of taking medicine I can't swallow.
4335,"I am currently on medication and seeing a therapist, but what comes next has been my way of coping since my disorders first took over my life."
4336,First job interview after starting on medication.
4337,"This is the hardest thing I've ever done, it seems so much easier fighting along without meds."
4338,I've struggled with anxiety/OCD thoughts for a couple years and recently attempted to take medication (zoloft) for it prescribed by my doctor but after 3 days I was convinced and paranoid that the medication was making it worse or would make it worse if I kept taking it and I would fully lose control.
4339,"Last night, I forgot to take my Zoloft medication before going to bed (it's a habit formed from trying to sleep through a lot of side effects when I first started nearly 2 months ago)."
4340,"I always get offered medication, but I never think it's a convenient time to start trying to change my anxiety."
4341,I've definitely improved myself through therapy and medication but there's a long road ahead.
4342,I am currently fighting against my agoraphobia (without meds because they're too spooky for me).
4343,"I describe what happened as well as I could, he tells me it was likely a grand mal seizure, and that it's a side effect (though rare) of my anti-anxiety meds (Zoloft)."
4344,I should have known better than to mix alcohol with my meds.
4345,I assumed I was safe since I took my meds in the morning (xanax and lamictal) but I did take my Celexa at night because I didn't want to have a drink and forget.
4346,I am also worried about them putting me on new meds when the ones I have been taking have worked.
4347,Also I am supposed to be leaving for Disney World on Thursday and I really don't want to be trying out new meds while I am stuck in a camper for 5 days with my in-laws.
4348,So I'm living alone.
4349,Moved halfway across the country from my family and friends when my anxiety and depression became full blown.
4350,Was put on Cipralex and Seroquel for sleep.
4351,A god damn anti-psychotic.
4352,What the fuck.
4353,"If that's not bad enough, I've gained a tolerance to Seroquel now, and am effectively stuck with it now; trying to stop it brings on horrible withdrawal."
4354,Stopped Cipralex and switched to Celexa due to cost.
4355,Agoraphobia slowly getting worse and worse.
4356,"I take Ritalin for ADD and have scaled back its use because I feel that as a stimulant, it's likely to exasperate my anxiety."
4357,But I need it to get anything done.
4358,Inattentive ADD is a real bitch.
4359,I can't stay focused on one thing long enough to get something meaningful accomplished.
4360,"I'm not hyperactive so from the outside, I just look like a real disorganized person."
4361,I don't look like someone with ADHD because I'm not hyper.
4362,"I can't excuse myself because of my illness because unless you knew me really well, you wouldn't think I had it."
4363,Had a job.
4364,Lost it.
4365,Sent me into a deeper depression.
4366,Don't like leaving the house at all.
4367,I only go out to buy food for my pets and come straight home.
4368,"I don't cook at home so I try to buy foods I can easily eat or make at home, sandwhiches etc....."
4369,I was sent to a shrink (One I had seen before) and he put me on Effexor.
4370,It's still too early to tell if it's having any effect.
4371,I was also given Clonazapam by my doctor for my daytime anxiety.
4372,It seems to take the edge off and doesn't make me feel stoned like Ativan or Xanax.
4373,"Since starting Effexor, I have had some very disturbing dreams."
4374,But the end result remains.
4375,I stay at home and avoid the supermarket.
4376,I don't like crowds and even my hobby of driving is no longer exciting to me anymore.
4377,Going for a walk around the block is an idea that makes me extremely uncomfortable.
4378,I sit in bed all day.
4379,There's nothing for me to do.
4380,I just lie here listening to music and lurking reddit.
4381,I rarely play any games.
4382,"I used to play RuneScape, but a lot of the fun is gone now because I have a bunch of 99s and I don't really feel like playing it anymore."
4383,It's the same shit repeated several hundred thousand times until you finish one skill.
4384,Then repeat with another skill.
4385,I wish I had an interest in it again just so I had something to do instead of browsing reddit all day.
4386,My shrink says I need to get a job.
4387,"I'm an intelligent and logical person; growing up, I was the subject of a study on gifted children with high IQs."
4388,"It makes sense, I suppose."
4389,"I've read that people with ADHD inattentive subtype, are more likely to be highly intelligent."
4390,He says that this intelligence is key to getting employed and he thinks that a job will give me reason to live.
4391,I am terrified of screwing up on the job.
4392,"I try my best, but somehow, I always find a way to fuck things up."
4393,The only job I have any confidence doing is cashiering.
4394,"To me, it's hard to fuck up."
4395,But I don't have the confidence to even to apply.
4396,Even then... What a waste.
4397,I should have gone on to university and made something of myself.
4398,I don't mean to put down cashiers; I think it's a job somebody has to do.
4399,But to accept such a job would be accepting that I have failed in life.
4400,"In fact, since I am unemployed and am not even a cashier, I've done worse than fail."
4401,I used to be afraid of medication.
4402,"I wouldn't take a painkiller for when I smashed my thumb, and I refused to take asprin for headaches."
4403,"Once I got started with the Ritalin, I said ""fuck it"" and took anything the doctor thought was a good idea."
4404,"I maybe a smart person, but I've made some bad choices."
4405,"In any case, I have an illness and the only cure is more pills (cowbell?)."
4406,I imagine I'd be a wreck without these medications.
4407,"I'm on so many pills, I've forgotten what my baseline is anymore."
4408,I wonder if all these changes to my neurochemistry has made me a different person.
4409,Medication isn't cheap and I'm not on disability.
4410,I don't know how much more of this dizzying downfall I can take before I lose it all.
4411,"My car, my home, my sanity.... have I lost it already?"
4412,"I'm not suicidal, thankfully."
4413,"I would be, but I am gravely afraid of death."
4414,"Without this fear, I would have killed myself months ago."
4415,When will I feel normal?
4416,What is normal?
4417,I've even taken seizure medicine.
4418,"It's not really direct pain, it's almost like a very irritating pressure that pain medication cannot help, like my mind is tying itself in knots."
4419,"Would medicine effect someone who is anxious about illness, disease, cancer, etc."
4420,"My fiance is a bit annoyed with the meds, 
But he is here supporting me."
4421,"Without that total hopelessness I felt, I could make better decisions regarding my anxiety treatment and Im finally talking to people about it and getting back on medication."
4422,"Three days ago I started taking 1mg of Intuniv at night, as my psychiatrist told me to do so."
4423,"I do not have ADD/ADHD, what Intuniv is designed to manage."
4424,"It's not a stimulant, like many other ADD/ADHD medications are."
4425,"I've exhausted many other, more common, options but the only thing that alleviates my anxiety was 1-2 mg of Ativan, and even then I was building a tolerance to it."
4426,"Since starting Intuniv, I've had some adverse side-effects."
4427,"My doctor warned me about some sleepiness and low blood pressure for up to four or five days, but this seems worse."
4428,"I took it at bedtime Thursday, and Friday I cancelled all plans and slept."
4429,I had no energy.
4430,"Saturday more of the same exhaustion, but I began to feel dizzy if I stood up too quickly."
4431,"Today, Sunday, I am still feeling extremely tired, very nauseated, and incredibly dizzy unless I am lying still."
4432,Anyone else taking Intuniv for anxiety?
4433,Should I be worried that my symptoms keep worsening/ multiplying?
4434,"Also note that THC is the cannabinoid that makes you feel ""high"", so if you find a very low-THC, high-CBD strain, it will be much more of a medication than recreation."
4435,"I hope this doesn't qualify as a ""quick fix"", but I believe it's in the same tier as acute panic attack medication, if not better, with fewer negative side effects."
4436,"My problem is I'm very wary of medication changes, I worry about side effects etc."
4437,Is there a good tried and tested medication that I might ask about next time I visit the doc?
4438,"I went to a free clinic because I can't afford to go anywhere else and they told me it could take 4-6 weeks before I can get an appointment to even discuss medication, let alone actually get any."
4439,"First time posting here, aside from commenting on the odd occasion."
4440,"It wasn't too long ago that I was unable to leave my house for over 5 years (this was about 6 years ago), and now today I'm still kinda staggered at the changes I have been able to make (largely in part of a supportive partner), and without the aid of medications."
4441,I moved across the country with pretty much no plan.
4442,"I finished University, I did do online correspondence, but it was cheaper, and worked better for my schedule."
4443,"I've landed dream jobs, twice!"
4444,"Once during school, and once after I finished, and in my field."
4445,"And today, I attended my first Executive meeting as the Vice President of an Arts &amp; Crafts Club that I am very much interested in as I find my knitting/spinning/dyeing to be extremely therapeutic."
4446,"While I still have horrible episodes, sometimes  cry before work because I am so overwhelmed with feelings of excitement and am unable to process it, (but I still go!"
4447,"), and while I still don't drive, and I get scared to go grocery shopping."
4448,I'm making strides.
4449,And I think that in itself is worth acknowledging.
4450,"I just want everyone to know, that no matter how bad it may seem, it CAN get better."
4451,It takes a lot of work.
4452,It's exhausting.
4453,It's awful sometimes.
4454,But it's so rewarding to wake up and realise...
4455,I have a life again.
4456,"Thanks to everyone here for their fantastic advice, and articles."
4457,"I look forward to reading more, and sharing with everyone else."
4458,I'm hesitant because I have no health insurance (and never previously prescribed medication because of that).
4459,"I've been on medication for as long as I can remember, and am currently on a waiting list to see a psychologist (I'm already seeing a psychiatrist) after my former therapist of a year saw that I wasn't improving and suggested I see someone higher up."
4460,"It's been three days since and I still have chest pains and mini attacks with shaking and hyperventilating despite medication, all the meds really do is sedate me to the point of where my brain is mush."
4461,Can anyone help is there any maybe other medication you recommend I went to the hospital and they claim this is anxiety disorder but they didn't keep me in the mental health ward what is going on with me I just want my life back.
4462,"She wants to avoid medication, but it keeps getting worse."
4463,hello!
4464,i am a 20 female with general anxiety disorder.
4465,"i've had anxiety disorder since high school, but my parents generally ignored it."
4466,"after i was diagnosed, they stopped sending me to the therapist and hoped that pretending it didn't exist would make it go away."
4467,obviously it didn't.
4468,"i'm a sophomore in college now, living on my own."
4469,i decided (finally) to do something about it and went to the doctor and was prescribed some meds.
4470,they seemed to help--i didn't have a single anxiety attack while on them.
4471,"however, the prescription was only for a month, at which point i was supposed to go back and renew it and what not."
4472,now comes my dilemma.
4473,i planned to go back.
4474,i honestly thought i would.
4475,"but i got busy, didn't make the time, and it just never happened."
4476,"i've been off of them now for over a month, i've had four or five anxiety attacks, and i'm trying to find a new outlet."
4477,"i don't know whether or not to go back on the medication, honestly, the fact that it changes your brain chemistry kind of freaks me out."
4478,i also get reinforcement from my bf to the same end: that antidepressants/anti-anxiety medications mess with your natural brain chemistry and it's probably better to find a different outlet.
4479,what do you guys think?
4480,have any of you found a different way to deal with your anxiety other than medication?
4481,any advice would be helpful.
4482,TL/DR: college student with GAD looking for advice on medication versus other outlets.
4483,I think it might be time to see a therapist and maybe get on some meds or something.
4484,"I have a fairly high tolerance to medication, if that matters."
4485,"Long time reader, first time posting."
4486,"After trying many options, my doctor has recommended I try some medication to help with my anxiety/depression."
4487,"Counselling, forums and using a mirena to regulate my hormones (23/f) has helped minimise my panic attacks, which has been good."
4488,I've been avoiding medications up till now and I'm looking for anyone who is willing to give their experience on taking loxalate 10mg.
4489,"From what I've read this is a low dose/minimal side effect option, which is what I requested."
4490,But I'm nervous so I'm going to start out taking half tablets.
4491,"I have absolute faith in my doctor and his recommendations, I'm just looking for some ""real life"" experiences."
4492,Sorry for the ramble.
4493,Thanks.
4494,"I'm going to docs appointments and will take the meds, but as far as a plan."
4495,I am impatient and restless and I hate the way some of my meds make me feel.
4496,On Monday I'm going to see a psychologist about getting some sort of medication to deal with anxiety.
4497,I'm worried about taking medication.
4498,I've lived with anxiety and depression for 15 years without any sort of medication.
4499,"I know this is insane, there are other examples of me doing crazy things, and i'm on medication now for mood swings that i thought would maybe help me with this but it's not really helping and as much as  i've tried to change i'm still afraid that they do things behind my back when i'm not there, so  i try to be at home every night and i try to be around either him or her twenty four seven, and it's hard to do."
4500,Just meds on their own do not work.
4501,"I was just sort of feeling so comfortable in my ability to control my anxiety that I got too cocky and just let the meds do everything, and I expected them to do everything."
4502,"I'd like medication for my anxiety, I tried Xanax, but I have the paradoxical disinhibition effect when I take benzodiazepines."
4503,Does anybody else know of a good anxiolytic/anti-psychotic medication that could treat my anxiety but let me stay awake?
4504,"The meds I've tried haven't helped much, and I've been rather resistant to therapy."
4505,I've prayed to god every night hoping I can get help because I sure don't want to take any SSRI's or meds.
4506,I don't want to have to be on medication to feel normal damnit.
4507,Tried many different meds throughout my life with various degrees of success.
4508,I'm on meds.
4509,I don't think my shrink can give me any more medication.
4510,My dad takes medicine for it.
4511,"So I'm still thinking that I have a side effect from a medication I took earlier this month, and the panic and worry it's caused me has me waking up freaking out three times a night."
4512,I attempted intercourse with my bf while about four days into the meds and it just didn't feel electric or amazing like it always tends to.
4513,She also said highly unlikely the meds had a thing to do with it.
4514,I started getting panic attacks about a year ago but only got them rarely up until a few months ago.
4515,It's now daily that I have to fight them off and I'll sometimes blackout if they're really bad.
4516,I've never taken any medication for it before but my doctor put me on lexapro and buspirone about a month ago and it's done absolutely nothing.
4517,I feel like it's only gotten worse and it's just exhausting at this point.
4518,My girlfriend has a prescription for Xanax 1mg and she'll give me some if I get a really bad attack but even those I'll need at least 3 for them to calm me down at all.
4519,I feel like I need a strong benzo like Xanax to help me but I know how hard it is to get a prescription and I'm afraid if I ask my doctor he'll think I'm just trying to get pills.
4520,Or maybe there's other medications I don't know of besides benzos that have helped you guys?
4521,I just want something to fix this...
4522,It's to the point where I'm afraid to leave my house.
4523,Any responses are appreciated.
4524,"I read a lot of tips on talking to people in your family, but no one in my family really understands mental disorders and a good number of them don't believe in medication."
4525,I find it hard to find somewhere to go and I don't really know what I can be doing beyond therapy and medication.
4526,My mom called the psychiatrist and she said to have me stop taking the medication until she can talk to me again.
4527,"Now, I've been very afraid to take medication for anything for quite some time now, which is why I think it may have been in my head."
4528,I can't imagine I was taking the medication long enough for it to have any effect on me...
4529,"I'm breastfeeding my 6 month old, so the thought of taking medication stresses me out."
4530,I just thought I should start talking about this.
4531,"Basically I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, biopolar disorder (unspecified), and other such things but I do not take any medications for them anymore."
4532,I stopped due to the fact that they always caused random problems in my body.
4533,I couldn't deal with the huge anxiety they caused me.
4534,I feel I've always been a hypochondriac and it doesn't help that google is right there when any little ache or pain shows up.
4535,"Like tonight, I was paranoid (am still) the burning in my left chest near my heart is a heart attack."
4536,"I just worked out pretty decently and I am in no way ""at risk"" for a heart attack, but of course I continue to convince myself that it COULD be one, even healthy people have them!"
4537,Started to monitor my vitals... my blood pressure is slightly elevated.
4538,Of course.
4539,I'm probably fine...
4540,This all happens before my anxiety and whatnot had been diagnosed.
4541,Also my psychiatrist office closed down.
4542,No therapy now.
4543,Yay.
4544,My hands look like crap because I'm losing weight as of lately.
4545,I'm not skinny but I'm not too fat (Yes terrible terrible body image.
4546,I used to be almost morbidly obese but I've lost almost all the weight and sit at a very healthy bmi) but my hands!
4547,they are disgusting baby claw hands.
4548,"Based on my hands alone people say i'm going to ""float away"" and I always have pain in my stupidly small wrists now."
4549,I'm afraid I'll break my wrist doing something average.
4550,"Anyway... mostly I didn't mean to ramble.. but its almost 3am and I fucked up my relationship again with my ""hypochondriac"" fears."
4551,"I've recently started the medication shuffle and right now I'm on 112.5 mg effexor and 100 mg zoloft nightly, with the effexor scheduled to go up and the zoloft down at my next psych appointment."
4552,I don't want to take medication again because I don't want to feel like I have to rely on them to be okay.
4553,And what else can help me aside from medication and CBT?
4554,"I was just having a look through this subreddit, and I may be completely wrong, but just having a look through the posts it seems like a really large proportion of posters are taking medication for their anxiety and aren't really mentioning seeing psychologists."
4555,"And I've seen some suggestions to newcomers include medication, but not seeing a psychologist."
4556,I know thus far they are most certainly stress related (work and stuff like that as I work at a call center) and wanted to know if I should be trying to find medication for it or what have you.
4557,(even things that aren't medically related or on a medication level)
4558,Hello!
4559,Has anyone here switched medications from Paxil to something else?
4560,At the moment I'm weaning off of Paxil to get onto a new medication.
4561,I've gone from 30mg to 10mg in 2 weeks.
4562,"My appetite is coming and going, when I'm not hungry I'm nauseous."
4563,"I'm light headed, and my head aches."
4564,I'm CRAZY exhausted..
4565,Despite all the sleep I've been getting.
4566,My brain feels weird...
4567,Focusing is hard (even though I'm medicated in that area too).
4568,Will withdrawal symptoms continue until I'm on my new medication?
4569,What would you do to curb the effects of weaning off of Paxil?
4570,"I used to be on medication as a child, but I stopped taking the drugs of my own free will and have been un-medicated for 10+ years."
4571,"Should I keep trying to fight my way out of this without meds until I'm either cured or completely ruined, or should I try whatever the doctor prescribes me one more time?"
4572,"What are your experiences with anxiety treatments, whether it was through meds or more 'natural' approaches?"
4573,"Is it worth it to try another type of meds, or do my past experiences prove that they're not for me?"
4574,"Over the past couple years i've come to suspect that what I thought was a mild life long depression, really could be Generalized anxiety disorder."
4575,"I find myself often overcome with negative thoughts about my relationship, my future, my apparence, and my interaction with other people."
4576,"When I was in forth grade I was diagnosed and treated for OCD, after I became obsessed with the fear of my mom dying."
4577,"I couldn't leave her site for almost a year, just barley got away with passing 4th grade because of it."
4578,"Soon After I was treated, the OCD symptoms completely went away."
4579,My biggest fear is that someday Ill be triggered by something that will cause an extreme obsessive  thought like that to manifest again.
4580,"After my symptoms went away, my family never mentioned it again."
4581,It was something that I hardly thought about.
4582,"In high school I did a lot of worrying and stressing about my life, but it didn't really become something that drastically effected me till about my sophomore year of college."
4583,When I was about 20 I completely became withdrawn and depressed.
4584,"I pretty much stopped leaving my apartment, and ended up being put on academic suspension for a semester because of my grades."
4585,After that I started to see a psychiatrist who put me on adderall.
4586,Adderall ended up really helping me for a while.
4587,"In my semester off from college I worked a lot and saved money, and when I came back to school, things really turned around for me."
4588,"Even though mentally I didn't feel perfect, I was able to accomplish a lot, and I was generally happier then before."
4589,"After about a year on it, I decided to stop going to my psychiatrist because of money and somewhat because of my parents worry about me becoming dependent on it."
4590,Ever since I've always wondered if things would be better for me if I were back on it.
4591,"Sometimes I buy a few here and there from friends, and I feel really great for a week."
4592,I'm at a very challenging time for me right now.
4593,"I'm about to graduate from college, and I am in the process of applying to grad schools, getting my portfolio together (i'm a designer/copywriter), and applying for internships."
4594,"I don't feel like Ive been emotionally stable enough to accomplish any of this right now, and they've been piling up and weighing on me more then anything ever has."
4595,I could go to the psychiatrist tomorrow and get adderall.
4596,"I know it has worked for me in the past, but i'm convinced that my real problems are anxiety."
4597,"Or I could try to be treated for my anxiety, and risk wasting precious time that I don't have right now figuring out what medications work for me, etc."
4598,"Reddit, what should I do?"
4599,"I'm leaning toward going back on adderall till the end of the semester and bring up my anxiety problems in the summer, when Ill have time to experiment."
4600,"I'd really appreciate peoples opinions, just found this subreddit, but it seems like a really great resource."
4601,"I think I'm finally on the right dose of my meds, and my meditation practice is beginning to help!"
4602,"Hello people…
Recently I took the drastic decision to stop taking my medicines by my own."
4603,"The reasons I did it was the confidence I felt to do, obvious."
4604,"I took many medicines together during the last years… Like litium, quetiapine and paxil… Among others."
4605,"Therefore, one day I felt confident and so gave it up."
4606,I read about the problems with abstinence and I think I am dealing with all symptoms.
4607,"I am angry, quiet, wakeful and the worst one: dizzy."
4608,Dizzy is bad.
4609,I had vomits too two days ago.
4610,I read all these symptoms will last around 2 until 6 weeks at least.
4611,"My problem is: Everybody tells me I should have talk to my doctor before quit, because the process is slow."
4612,But she (my doctor) does not pick up my phones and kind don’t give a shit for my condition.
4613,"Well, so here I go:
1 – Can I survive abstinence without take even a little pill?"
4614,Without doing the process slowly?
4615,2 – Should I do slowly?
4616,"Guys I really want to get away from these medicines, I’ve been taking pills for depression for so long, I got fat and kind dumb."
4617,Now I feel so well.
4618,"More smart, awaken… I don’t know if you can understand what I mean."
4619,I know depression is a disease like others and need to keep in treatment and maybe I will never will be like other people BUT medicines no more for me.
4620,I can handle it.
4621,I was wondering if there is anyone who has had seizures in the past and take meds for anxiety.
4622,I have heard that many anxiety meds do not mix well with someone who has a history of seizures.
4623,"* I have mild asthma
By way of medicine
* I was on doxycycline/moxycycline for acne for 2-3 years and just stopped it."
4624,But my acne makes me feel worse than any medicine ever could.....
4625,"So continuing on with the anxiety bit, my doctor told me that I have anxiety (without even assessing me or ANYTHING) and she'll have me see a psychiatrist and if it goes on for a longer time I'll be attending therapy and receiving medicine."
4626,"My psychiatrist hasn't brought up medicine yet, how do I bring it up?"
4627,Hey Reddit!
4628,I have been taking medication for ADHD for the past 8 years but I have found that *compared to those I have reached out to in person and you great people on the internet;* I am taking a dose that I am suspecting is NOT normal.
4629,For the last couple of months I have not been able to go to my physician as I lost my insurance.
4630,Not taking the medication has caused me to sleep like 18 hours a day but I am at a point now (6 MONTHS) later where I can sleep for 9 hours and feel 'just' tired.
4631,I remedy that by drinking a pot of coffee in the morning just to be functional.
4632,"I just need to know if anyone else went through this withdrawl, this is just such a HUGEEE withdrawal."
4633,"My medication regimen for ADHD is as follows:
****

ADHD (Combined Type)
-------------------------------
- Vyvanse 30ct [70mg] - 1/day 
- Vyvanse 30ct [50mg] - 1/day
- Adderall XR (Generic-BARR) - 60ct [30mg] - 2/day 
- Adderall IR (Generic-BARR) - 60ct [10mg] - 2/day
- Dextroamphetamine IR (Generic) - 60ct [10mg] - 2/day

**Note:**
I am also taking medication for 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder' &amp; 'Panic Disorder' but I'm speculating that the aforementioned conditions are exacerbated by the ridiculous  amount of stimulant medication I am prescribed."
4634,These doses by themselves are not in/of themselves anything that deviates from what most would consider the norm regarding benzodiazepines.
4635,"Before my insurance ran out I took in addition to these meds:
****
Major Depressive Disorder
----------------------------
- Lexapro - 30ct [20mg] - 1/day

****

Residual High BP &amp; mild tachycardia [From ADHD Stimulant medications] 
--------------------------------
- Propranolol LA (Brand)- 30ct [60mg] 1/day OR
- Tenormin (Brand) - 60ct [20mg] 2/day

****

Generalized Anxiety Disorder &amp; Panic Disorder *[See Footnote]
---------------------------------
- Klonopin (Generic-Clonazepam) - 90ct [10mg] 3/day
- Ativan (Generic-Lorazepam) - 60 ct [0.5mg] AS needed for PD
- Xanax (Generic-Alprazolam) - 10 ct ONLY - **AS NEEDED for immediate panic attack."
4636,"Note:
**Panic attacks are very far and few inbetween but since I have not been on the mediation I feel more physical side effects of anxiety as if my system is going through some kind of shock."
4637,I know self diagnosing is a dangerous game to play but I would go as far as honestly saying that I am developing strong agoraphobic tendencies.
4638,I have been trying to leave my condominium for some time for job interviews and the like but have not been able to get out of my head.
4639,I'm nodding off but I hope some kind soul lets me know I'll be ok.
4640,"The lack of medications is killing me, I've tried a change in diet, exercise and such..Thanks in anticipation of some love."
4641,"TL;DR - No insurance anymore, system is going into literal shock from lack of medication."
4642,"Panic, Depression, Major anxiety, Extreme apathy &amp; lethargy, REDIC amt of sleep."
4643,Wot do?
4644,"And also I'm too scared to go on prescription meds, I always feel like they are going to fuck me up even more."
4645,"Some background:
I have a history of OCD and Anxiety that I have been on and off of meds for, but for the last year or so I have been OK handling things without meds."
4646,"They tweaked my meds (upped my beta blocker, metaprolol, from 25 to 50, and added in daily baby aspirin), gave me a holter monitor, and sent me on my way."
4647,"Will he subject me to a bevy of tests, write it off as anxiety and offer medication, I just don't know..."
4648,"However, she has anxiety issues too; I know this since she said she was on anxiety meds on our first meeting."
4649,"Please, I don't want therapy or medication."
4650,"As a guy, I can't talk to anyone about this and when I mention this elsewhere they say I should seek therapy and medication."
4651,"I get a bit lightheaded and really drowsy while taking this medication, but the thought of getting vertigo again (I had my one and hopefully only episode this past october and it really fucked me up, both physically and on a mental level) makes me want to literally die to avoid it."
4652,I was on medicine around 14 or 15 and it would help my anxiety but worsen my depression so I just stopped taking it.
4653,I don't want to go back on medicine what can I do?
4654,"I am pretty good with mental health, I have an anxiety myself, but my girlfriend has anxiety and depression, she recently had her anti-depressant meds doubles, since then she has been terrified about going to work, she can't get up in the mornings, even getting out of bed seems scary."
4655,"I don't find him too understanding nor helpful other than prescribing medication; all he says, ""Well, just try to push your negative thoughts away and try your best and you'll be fine."""
4656,"Now I'm not one to normally take medication, so this really freaks me out, especially because after googling the drug one of the possible side effects are heart palpitations (which could mean there's a death possibility), others are dizziness, and swelling of the throat."
4657,"10 months ago i went to see my doctor about my anxiety after struggling with it for a long time, he ended up referring me to see a psychiatrist, who gave me several different diagnoses (i don't know if this is normal or not) but she said that i had GAD/panic disorder, and suspected that i had mild OCD, but my dad didn't want me to start any medication despite her recommendation of Zoloft."
4658,"I know you guys can't really give me medical advice, but i just don't know if i should wait it out, with the hope it gets better after a month or two, or if i should go back and really push for medication."
4659,Constantly on medication.
4660,"I stopped taking the medicine after some research, and now after a week I am still getting the bad attacks."
4661,Did the medicine permanently fuck me up?
4662,"A few years ago, I came across a medication called [Tramadol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol)."
4663,CC obviously isn't for me...or could it be if I had the right medication and state of mind?
4664,"Im not against medication for it, but I generally try to use that as a last restort."
4665,"Also, the first thing she pushed was medication."
4666,I have an appointment with a psychiatrist BEFORE my next appointment with this new therapist and she absolutely thinks I should take meds without knowing ANYTHING about me.
4667,"I don't want to take meds because of her advice, and she doesn't seem to care about what they might do to me."
4668,This is an update on how my medication is working for me.
4669,Backstory: I'm resistant to Benzodiazepine medication (xanax etc.)
4670,"Anyway I haven't noticed anything 'major' the changes I talked about are very minimal at best but, finally seeing relief somewhat really is making me feel hopeful for this medication."
4671,"I know however how meds and alcohol don't mix well, but I was wondering: if I don't take my 5 mg Escitalopram on that particular morning, would there be no problem with me drinking alcohol later in the day?"
4672,The doctor weaned me off my meds about a year and a half ago.
4673,"I now live in a new city, and I don't really want to go back on medication."
4674,But I don't want to end up being on medication.
4675,"Any people on medication reading this, how has it changed you as a person?"
4676,"However, none have ever felt like I needed medication."
4677,"After a while on meds and doing therapy I thought I was ok with my anxiety problems, but I'm not."
4678,But I very recently increased the amount of meds and I never did this before.
4679,I get an anxiety medicine mailed to me on a bi-monthly basis.
4680,"Today, however, my mother, extremely upset, told me the order of my medicine that I was supposed to get several days ago had been messed up and that I wouldn't have it for at least another week."
4681,"I'm saving that for the day I graduate (thank God I forgot to take my pill when I got up this morning), but I'm still going to have to get through today, tomorrow, and graduation (plus, probably, another week or so) with no medicine."
4682,Exciting news - extra virgin coconut oil shown to be as effective as anti-depressent medication on mice during a forced swim test.
4683,I am a 21 year old female who has had anxiety for almost 10 years now.
4684,"It has gradually been getting worse over the years for various reasons and right now its very debilitating due to high amounts of stress due to school, me pushing myself out into the social world and other personal situations."
4685,"My (new) family doctor (since I've moved away for school) has given me three prescriptions:

* 1."
4686,Inderal 20mg (Proponolol) for my chest pains.
4687,* 2.
4688,Prozac 20mg (Fluxoetine) for my depression.
4689,* 3.
4690,Xanax 0.25mg (Alprazolam) for my anxiety.
4691,"I mean, I understand why she gave me these things, but it just seems excessive to me."
4692,"I've had these pills since July and I haven't started them yet because I was skeptical on being on three different medications with very, very prudent side-effects if I was to cut them off."
4693,I have been on medication before within the past two years.
4694,"I was on Effexor, which worked but I didn't like the side effects if I hadn't taken them at the *exact* hour I was supposed to."
4695,I tried Paxil as well (about four years ago now) but never followed through on it.
4696,"I've been fighting the fact of being on medication, but within the past month and a half and as a result of a few ""episodes"" and breakdowns I've had, I really can't do this on my own and I *need* to be on something if I want to live a normal life."
4697,I am just looking on what other people's thoughts are on these medications and what I should potentially do.
4698,"I wanted to just take the Xanax, and most likely the Prozac... but I am lost."
4699,"My mom thinks that medication is the only answer, I think its a waste of time, I stay on them mostly to keep her from worrying too much."
4700,In addition to my frequent urination symptoms ( that have gotten better thanks to meds) I seem to cum too easily when masturbating by hand ( TMI sorry!)
4701,"My meds make me irritable, crazy and irrational which try to help my anxiety."
4702,I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression in November and had started on medication.
4703,I was prescribed some anti-anxiety medication which works 50% of the time.
4704,"I have failed classes due to lack of effort, even on adhd medication I just hate to persevere through even moderate difficulty tasks."
4705,"I was put on medication months ago to help with the anxiety, but found I kept forgetting to take it regularly."
4706,"So, yesterday I started taking my medication again, starting with a small dosage, intending to work my way up again (these were the original instructions given by my doctor)."
4707,"ADHD meds have not been working for me and I'm starting to wonder if treating anxiety first, which was a surprise diagnosis for me but actually makes a lot of sense, is the way to go."
4708,I've been thinking about getting off my meds because I feel like I'm not truly an 'anxious' person anymore.
4709,I have not yet taken any medicine to relieve the symptoms because they aren't that debilitating.
4710,"I've been on Effexor and Strattera for a while now, and they are a great help to me, but I still often wonder if there's just some medical deficiency or other issue I have and am masking with the medications instead of getting to the source of the problem and dealing with that."
4711,"So, what things can and should someone get tested for that will yield reasonably concrete results?"
4712,"Off the top of my head, I would say: Thyroid, Vitamin D, maybe Magnesium?"
4713,Can we compile a list?
4714,I am taking my medicine and you know what?
4715,"Okay, so first I want to give a little background on my life with anxiety."
4716,"I am a 22 year old woman now, and my anxiety started when I was about 14/15."
4717,"I was in high school and was in incredibly rigorous college courses, as well as being involved in many extra curricular activities."
4718,Anxiety and depression run in my family and I had already dealt with depression for years.
4719,"My first full-on panic attack was at my synchronized swimming pageant, where I collapsed prior to a routine that was particularly difficult (holding your breathe for extended of periods of times is very intimidating when you already are hyperventilating)."
4720,"Anyway after this incident, I was put on zoloft and xanax."
4721,This began a five year battle with what I consider addiction.
4722,"I also developed an addiction to narcotic pain pills, which i think was mainly due to that 'invincible' feeling that opiates give you."
4723,"I went on a school trip to India in the summer or 2009, and because of all the drugs I was on, I didn't have any anxiety at all, I had the time of my life."
4724,"When I got back however, my addiction worsened even further (a lot of this was due to my mom becoming disabled and becoming an opiate addict and just not the mother I'd had before)."
4725,"Anyway, this ended up changing the entire path I had planned for myself after high school."
4726,"I graduated with incredible academic achievements, the absolute top of my class, a dream student, but in reality I missed something like a hundred days of school my senior year due to anxiety, and was taking something like 16 xanax a day, 2 temazapan at night, as well as something like 60 mg of oxycodone a day, on top of zoloft, buspar, etc.. (this is a very conservative estimate to be honest, I was a total mess)."
4727,"I ended up losing over 40 pounds and spent most days in bed, but most people didn't realize anything was even wrong, and told me how good I looked because I was so thin."
4728,"I had plans to go to college, and was being courted by the most elite universities in the United States, but obviously I was in no condition to go live on my own and keep up in such a challenging academic environment."
4729,My doctors didn't know what to do so they just kept giving me more meds.
4730,"I hated myself, I hated my life, my friends were at school living the life I had dreamed of, and I was sleeping and crying and drugging my life away."
4731,"I couldn't stand it anymore and wanted to move forward, so I enrolled at a very very good college that was also close to home, hoping I could do this."
4732,"Well, the constant cycle of doping to do school, running out of medications early, suffering withdrawals, missing class due to withdrawal, and then the anxiety of making up so much work got to me a little over half way through the semester."
4733,I just broke.
4734,"I stayed in bed for a week in my dorm room, not eating, not talking to anyone, not showering- it was the darkest week of my life."
4735,"Eventually I told my boyfriend, he helped me move my stuff out and tell my parents what had been going on ( i had been lying to them and pretending I was going to class like everything was normal)."
4736,When I got home I was even worse with my addiction because I was so ashamed and felt so weak and worthless.
4737,It was terrible.
4738,"For about a year I did nothing with my days, though I did step up my counseling a TON, and was seeing many different types of anxiety specialists, as well as a spiritual healer who helped the most."
4739,"I finally decided in Fall 2012, with the help of my family (my sister especially, she has GAD as well), that the drugs I'd been on for years were the reason I had ruined my life the past few years."
4740,I decided to wean a bit off the opiates and barbiturates and then went cold turkey.
4741,"It was, by far, the hardest thing I've ever done."
4742,I wouldn't wish opiate and barbiturate withdrawals on my worse enemies.
4743,(Marijuana helped SO much though.)
4744,"I had been doing A LOT of these drugs, so the withdrawal lasted several months."
4745,But i knew I had to do this to get my life back.
4746,By March 2013 I was the happiest I had been in a long time.
4747,"I felt so alive and so calm, and invincible because I had survived the withdrawal."
4748,"I turned 21 in April and I got my social life back, made new friends, got a new part time job, I was thriving."
4749,I have been thriving (and totally pill free!).
4750,"Then, all of the sudden, a few months ago, I started getting severe panic attacks again."
4751,It started driving 2 hours on interstates to visit my grandmother.
4752,"I've never liked driving, but in the past I was on so much xanax, I hardly ever had panic attacks while doing so."
4753,"This was terrible, I was shaking and sweating for two hours straight and I really don't know how I survived it."
4754,"Worse yet, when I got there, I knew I had no option but to drive myself back."
4755,"I don't know how I did that either, but it helped knowing every minute I was getting closer to home."
4756,"Since then, my driving anxiety has snowballed."
4757,"At first I just avoided interstates, then just faster roads, and now I freak out just driving to work."
4758,"It's just the fear of having a severe panic attack while driving, I am not afraid of crashing or dying, I am just afraid that I can't do this."
4759,"I remind myself I am doing it, but I just hate it."
4760,This rebound of anxiety has now ballooned that I doubt my abilities to do anything without suffering panic attacks.
4761,I even have had attacks at work (and my work is the chillest place in the world) and at the grocery store.
4762,I have a trip planned to take the Amtrak to visit my sister in a month and a half and I'm terrified I won't be able to do it.
4763,I'm terrified I'll have a panic attack on the train.
4764,I'm even more afraid of the 6 hour layover in Union Station in Chicago.
4765,What will I do if I freak out??
4766,"I'll be stuck in Chicago, far from home, completely alone, with no one to comfort me or to make sure I get on the train."
4767,"It's all I can think about, even though I know that's the worst thing I can do."
4768,"To try to help myself, I scheduled an appt with a doctor who does biofeedback, as well as an appt with a doctor to prescribe me a small amount of xanax for the trip (which I had promised myself I would never take again, but what else can I do?)."
4769,"I have been doing yoga everyday, which makes me feel calm for the time being, but I'm still so scared."
4770,Sorry I really just needed to get this off my chest.
4771,I've been feeling positively insane lately.
4772,"If anyone has any advice, or words of comfort, they'd' be greatly appreciated."
4773,"I know I have it a lot better than I used to, I have a job, a social life, etc."
4774,"and am working towards going back to school, etc."
4775,but I'm so afraid my anxiety is just going to take away everything I've worked towards.
4776,"TL;DR-
I've struggled with anxiety for 7+ years, and had dependence problems for the first 5 of them."
4777,"I stopped all medications almost two years ago, but recently my anxiety has reasserted itself into my life."
4778,I  am worried about my ability to cope with this and am afraid I will lose everything I have gained the past two years.
4779,"I need comfort and advice that (my favorite anxiety quotes) ""everything will be alright"" and ""this too shall pass."""
4780,I genuinely went into medicine hoping for a better life for myself and hopefully a chance to make a difference in other peoples' lives too.
4781,I feel like my anxiety is progressively getting worse but I am not sure if it is from chronic marijuana use or if my medicine isn't right for me or what.
4782,We have known each other since we were about 12.
4783,"After a few years of being friends, everything came together and we started dating."
4784,"I was her first kiss, I took her virginity and the only guy she's ever really dated."
4785,It really went perfectly.
4786,We were THE power couple.
4787,We kicked ass.
4788,We were a perfect team.
4789,"About two years ago, we both had incidents with infidelity, but we got through it and things have been alright."
4790,"She just graduated from university, but since her senior year, the anxiety that she has always had at an underlying level has skyrocketed."
4791,"She has become fairly germophobic, paranoid of highly irrational things(I.e."
4792,"accidentally leaving her oven on which will burn down her apartment after checking on it numerous times, or getting pregnant when she is on birth control and I'm using a condom)."
4793,"She is often late places because she has to check the door locks repeatedly, or run around snapping photos of unplugged outlets on her phone so that she can look at the later."
4794,"She is snippy and on edge if you talk to her about it, and always says ""DONT give me a lecture."
4795,"I dont need it"" 

She is constantly saying that she thinks I hate her, and she just knows I'm going to wake up one day and dump her."
4796,"We have sex maybe once a month, and that's usually when we're drunk."
4797,"If we try sober, she's too nervous and afraid of disappointing me."
4798,She's just stiff and awkward and uncomfortable.
4799,"Not just in the sack, but always around me."
4800,Its getting progressively worse and worse.
4801,"She feels that she NEEDS to babysit me, and try and control my diet and free time or I won't be healthy, or do well enough in school to get a good job and support our family."
4802,We got in a screaming match last night because I ate a cupcake.
4803,She has near daily panic attacks.
4804,"We have been through a lot, and I really really love this woman."
4805,"I want to spend the rest of my life with her, but I can't spend the rest of my life with her demons too."
4806,I know I would just be committing myself to a life of unhappiness.
4807,"My biggest problem, however, is that she is so uncommitted to trying to get help."
4808,She knows that this illness is crippling her life.
4809,She admits it.
4810,"Regardless, she sees her psychologist maybe once every other month, and is extremely resistant to trying new medications her doctor and psychiatrist wants to put her on."
4811,"I'm afraid that I can't be in this relationship anymore, no matter how much I love her."
4812,Its getting to the point where she is ruining my happiness.
4813,"I feel like if she just got aggressive about getting help this could be saved, but I guess I can't force her to do anything."
4814,Advice?
4815,"Tl;dr: Gf of six years has had anxiety forever, but in the last year it has increased tenfold."
4816,"Making a healthy relationship impossible, and pushing me to consider leaving her."
4817,My anxiety has been under control thanks to medication but seeing diseases and other disorders makes me feel in some way like I have them too.
4818,"When I got into middle school, I was finally given medication, and that has helped a lot, and for a very long time I had no issues."
4819,"You see, I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, and being on medication for that has worked wonders for me, however it does increase my anxiety."
4820,I don't wanna compromise my sex drive just for a medication :(
4821,My biggest fear is the medication people take for Anxiety.
4822,I don't take any medication and I hope I never have to.
4823,I'm not on medication because my anxiety isn't eating me from inside and I actually feel okay most of the time.
4824,"I got a relapse and so they decided to change my meds to Zoloft 

I don't have the dizziness, migraines, and exhaustion a ymore, but I feel tense and also zone out for most if the day."
4825,Should I change my meds??
4826,"Hey everyone,
Just thought I'd come onto this subreddit to offer my time and experiences with taking Lexapro to those of you who might be contemplating going the medication route or therapy route or whatever might be bothering you."
4827,Is there some of other type of medication that could help with anxiety and mood?
4828,I'm not good at telling people when I need help but I am afraid of going through another medicine change... My therapist says I would do better on Abilify but I've heard bad things about it... Should I expect the issues to go away?
4829,"I don't know if I should see a doctor for some meds, or if I should stick with school, or take sometime off to work things out."
4830,"2) Watch Comedy TV Shows - make yourself laugh, as everyone knows laughing is the best medicine."
4831,"Im on medication for it, on sertraline."
4832,I'd like to know whether you guys think Zoloft will work or psychological treatment (which I would prefer to meds).
4833,"I have gone a long way of battling my anxiety and that is completely on my own, without any medication or doctors."
4834,Do you suggest any other medication?
4835,I'm currently not taking any medication.
4836,It worked fine for 2.5 years[unless I forgot to take my meds].
4837,"Can the symptoms of anxiety (Dizziness, foggyness, tunnel vision, nausea, depersonalization, headache, etc) Go away WITHOUT medication?"
4838,Ok I have been suffering from SA ever since I can remember and recently decided to try meds for it.
4839,I'm wandering if I should ride it out or switch meds.
4840,Is there a medicine that can actually help me?
4841,": I've heard anxiety meds usually make you gain weight--but if it makes me feel better, and helps me relax and not sleep so much anymore (I sleep to avoid the day and avoid feeling anxious), couldn't it actually help me to get up and lose weight?"
4842,After a couple of months of severe anxiety I was able to manage it with medication and some counseling.
4843,"I realize with my rational mind that it is probably because I weaned myself off my meds two months ago, but with my anxiety riddled mind I feel positive that I'm going to feel this bad for the rest of my life."
4844,"Also, even when I was on my medication and managing my anxiety I never felt as good as I did before all this started."
4845,"I'll be going to my family doctor to discuss my problem and hopefully get a referral to a psychiatrist in order to begin some form of therapy, perhaps medication (though, preferably not, but I guess we'll see), and whatever else."
4846,"I tried medication (which kind of helped, but not really - crappy side effects, and never really solved the problem, and of course you have to keep amping up the doses to get the same effect over time)."
4847,"Basically I'm afraid to take meds and would like to know how you feel...

Is it working?"
4848,I'm not on any other medication and haven't had a drink since yesterday.
4849,I suffer from anxiety and OCD but have not been on any medication for a few years now.
4850,"I've strongly been against taking meds for my anixety, in part because therapy always helped."
4851,I got meds the other day and adjusting to the lexipro has me nauseated and even more panicked for a good 45 minutes.
4852,It was like there was zero withdrawl from the medicine and I was shocked.
4853,I hate wasting money and time on medication I could go without.
4854,"She suffers from GAD too, but is still on her medication and is fine most of the time, besides money problems of course."
4855,"She knows I have GAD and has tried her best to support me, but I've been doing so well without my medicine, she just assumes I'm sick and tries to make me feel better."
4856,I don't want to get back on medicine because life without medicine AND GAD is ideal.
4857,Does medication help the what ifs and the feeling small?
4858,Does medication take away the choking feeling?
4859,Background: Yes I am on meds 40mg of Celexa and it helps a lot like 75-80% cured but still get anxiety attacks once in a while.
4860,"I am pretty good with mental health, I have an anxiety myself, but my girlfriend has anxiety and depression, she recently had her anti-depressant meds doubles, since then she has been terrified about going to work, she can't get up in the mornings, even getting out of bed seems scary."
4861,"After examining my med history, he asked if any of the meds helped the panic, I said no, and he asked ""then why are you still taking these?"""
4862,"New doc gave me some different prescriptions (I'm on high benzos, Klonopin, so we started with the benzos first) and told me to start the new meds right away, and that we would be going a new direction."
4863,"After I told him, and I quote ""fuck the new doctor, this is between you and me"" he finally stopped going off about it and we got down to talking about my treatment, directions, and meds."
4864,"He seemed to scramble and gave me a list of meds, telling me that ""we can try anything"" since my current meds aren't working."
4865,"After giving me a list, I was tasked with picking a new med or meds."
4866,For a long time I had stomach issues associated with anxiety that kept me pretty much out of commission.
4867,After almost two years of this I finally found something that helped and I'm hoping this will help some of you too so you don't have to go through the years of crappy stuff I went through.
4868,"I've tried to include ""tl;dr""'s for each section to sum it up if you don't want a long read :)

SHORT BACKGROUND/SYMPTOMS For a few years I would have extreme anxiety and panic attacks almost any time I had to leave the house."
4869,When I did end up going out it usually ended in me throwing up.
4870,I would get so nauseous that I couldn't eat most days and ended up losing around 30 lbs.
4871,"I also experienced racing heart, panic, flushed face, guilt, anxiety, etc."
4872,during these episodes.
4873,"**tl;dr** Symptoms of my anxiety were racing heart, flushed, panic, anxiety, nausea, and eventually throwing up."
4874,I started by going to traditional family practitioners.
4875,"I was prescribed anxiety/depression medicine and it didn't help, got tested for gluten intolerance and allergies and that didn't help, went to a therapist and that didn't help."
4876,"I was so frustrated that I started looking into alternative medicine (acupuncture, etc."
4877,"), and that didn't help."
4878,There was no change in my mental or physical condition.
4879,They looked for ulcers and other stomach things through scans but didn't find much.
4880,"**tl;dr** normal treatments for anxiety didn't work

WHAT FIXED IT (I am not attempting to diagnose anyone, but more just hoping this may be able to help someone else as well."
4881,It may be something you want to consider asking your doctor about if you have not looked into it yet and are experiencing similar things.)
4882,I went to a stomach doctor (Gastroenterologist).
4883,He prescribed the scans to make sure I didn't have ulcers or cancer.
4884,Then he suggested my stomach was producing too much acid.
4885,"Here are the symptoms in extreme cases (which mine was) according to the doctor:

* Nausea/Vomiting (he said this symptom was higher in women because for some reason their acid tends to stay in the stomach more so than men's, whose acid is more likely to cause heartburn."
4886,"Men and women can both exhibit this symptom, however if you are not experiencing nausea but do experience the rest of the symptoms you may still want to look into it since not everyone will experience it.)"
4887,"* fast-paced heartbeat
* flushed/hot sensation
* disrupted digestion/intestinal issues
* Heartburn
* sore throat (caused by heartburn)
* unusual bowel movements
* loss of appetite

These symptoms (according to my doctor) could be triggered by or even actually trigger stress and anxiety."
4888,A lot of the symptoms are actually the same as a panic attack so if you already have panic attacks it can make them more severe.
4889,Anyways he put me on Kapidex (also known as Dexilant).
4890,"It is a prescription and is different from other heartburn prescriptions (I couldn't tell you exactly how, but it has some things in it that others don't)."
4891,Long story short I was on it for about six months and I haven't had any of the debilitating symptoms I used to experience since I took it.
4892,I still have anxiety sometimes but it no longer interferes with my life and I find it MUCH easier and faster to move on and overcome my feelings of anxiety.
4893,"No more nausea/vomiting, heart racing has decreased a lot, frequency of attacks has gone down, eating and digestion is back to normal, and basically my life is back to normal."
4894,I decided to post this hoping it would help anyone who is experiencing these symptoms along with their anxiety because it has pretty much turned my life around.
4895,I can leave the house without throwing up or getting anxious about whether I will throw up or have a panic attack.
4896,"I know how frustrating anxiety can be so stay strong :)

**tl;dr** If you have symptoms listed above associated with your anxiety, you may want to check with a Gastroenterologist and ask about dexilant."
4897,Also important to note is that I had tried heartburn medicines before but they weren't the same kind and they didn't helped.
4898,**note** This is a repost.
4899,I originally posted a couple months ago under a weird title and I don't think many people read it because the title was weird.
4900,I'm posting it again because sense then I have seen a lot of people here that describe almost this same problem so I'm hoping it will help people who see it.
4901,Feel free to PM me or ask me any questions here :)
4902,"I am a 27 year old male who owns his own place and has a decent job, I am able to push through a lot of the day to day stuff thanks to meds, but recently, my family has really been up my ass about visiting them."
4903,I've read numerous times on here that taking the first step is always the hardest.
4904,"I haven't been to school for an entire semester, but since being called a fuck up is just bringing me down, I want to start proving them wrong."
4905,"However, even the thought of going back is choking me up."
4906,"I've gathered most of the reasons why I'm scared, at least now: being alone, not making friends, being the new kid, all eyes on me when i introduce myself, not knowing what to say, those first impressions, eating at lunch, breathing in class (yes *breathing*), and overall being judged and laughed at."
4907,It's tough and I'm trying to work through every problem at a time mentally.
4908,"And personally I've found medications just mess up my mindset even more, seeing as though drugs got me into this mess in the first place."
4909,So no drugs.
4910,Any tips or ideas to help would help a ton :)
4911,I'm on my third medication for anxiety.
4912,The first two were zombie meds.
4913,and shouldn't I be on another medication aswell as the one I am currently on if this is happening?
4914,"I should mention that I've never taken allergy meds and have never been diagnosed with allergies but with my sinuses always being so  bad, I'm thinking I have some type of allergy."
4915,"hi, I'm 21 years old and I've had anxiety/panic attacks for years but it finally got bad enough to where I can barely do anything and I'm having incredibly intense panic attacks multiple times a day."
4916,"My therapist just re-diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia and Depression."
4917,My doctor has tried a slue of different SSRI's and nothing has worked.
4918,I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem and if you have any suggestions of medications that have worked?
4919,Edit : I am on meds.
4920,"I am worried I will become dependent on the meds (I feel I am already dependent of Prozac to feel good)

Thanks for taking the time, if you did read."
4921,"Went to my doc to change meds, on the way there, drove past the guy who molested me for 5 years."
4922,I've been considering getting on medication for my anxiety for a long time and I read so many things that say its good or bad and what not.
4923,"Just thought it would be interesting to put together a poll maybe a few of the questions could be..

- Are you on medication?"
4924,"(Y/N)    
- What kind of medication?"
4925,- How long have you been on medication?
4926,"(Scale 1-10)    
- Do you regret getting on medication at all?"
4927,Yesterday I saw my psychiatrist and he has suggested I change my meds (for anxiety and depression).
4928,"I'm not really concerned as I knew this would happen, but I do have an intense day of work tomorrow (informed my boss I was changing meds and may be a bit off colour this week, although I did not tell her the nature of the meds."
4929,My doctor has told me I have been developing some symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety as a result of a recent fibromyalgia diagnosis.
4930,"I have a few questions about the current treatment options, and while I recognize none of you are doctors, I feel that your insight into the various treatment methods is something I should consider while looking at my options."
4931,"**For those of you that are taking medication...**

A."
4932,How effective would you say it's been at treating your anxiety and/or depression?
4933,B. I've read that most mood medications have a negative impact on sex-drive/performance and can cause serious weight gain - have you found this to be the case for you?
4934,"**For those of you that are foregoing medication...**

C. What method(s) are you utilizing (various forms of talk therapy, meditation, etc."
4935,"), and are you seeing any benefit from it?"
4936,"**For all of you...**

D. Did you experience chronic pain and/or fatigue along with your anxiety and/or depression?"
4937,"If so, do you find that treating one helps the other?"
4938,"E. Overall, how effective do you feel the currently available methods of treatment have been at improving your quality of life?"
4939,I don't want to be put on anxiety meds until I rule this out.
4940,I have never been on anxiety medication.
4941,Without medication?
4942,"Normally, when getting off a medication, I would feel proud, like I were finally cured of the disease, but as many of you know, this is not a disease you can cure."
4943,I have been to three different Dr's in regards to this and two of them prescribed different anti anxiety/anti depressant meds.
4944,"He prescribed medication to begin work on shifting me back towards a normal sleep routine but last night, it totally failed."
4945,"So I stopped and explained the situation with my doctor and my medication to which she just said, ""Well, that's not good."""
4946,"What are some other anti anxiety meds, and should I worry about addiction?"
4947,Hey guys I'm on a shit ton of medication ranging from lexapro to klonopin to lamictal and I've always gotten really sweaty under my armpits even with antiperspirant while putting on clothes out of some insecurity or anxiousness.
4948,"Hello, I suspect I've had anxiety since high school."
4949,I graduated 2 years ago (I'm 20).
4950,I believe I've had depression since October 2008.
4951,Over the summer of that year I moved away from my hometown and all of my friends and I haven't been the same since.
4952,"Of course I am a different person because I went through puberty and becoming an adult in Georgia, but I knew/know something isn't right."
4953,I believe my anxiety goes hand in hand with this.
4954,Since April I feel my anxiety has gotten out of control.
4955,"I often almost cry at work, I can't speak to people in ""leader/powerful"" positions (bosses, professionals, interviewers, teachers etc.)"
4956,without choking up after a few words.
4957,"I took a semester off of school (probably because of depression, but also the thought that I'm wasting my time and money at college because I don't know what I want to do with my life is a crushing weight I can't get rid of."
4958,I'm afraid I'll never figure anything out.)
4959,"My (suspected) conditions were causing serious strain on my relationship, but ultimately my feelings of fear (afraid my SO didn't love me anymore/wanted something better) have been more or less confirmed."
4960,"We broke up this morning, I guess."
4961,I don't know the status of our relationship with one another right now.
4962,I tried making an appointment with a psychiatrist in my insurance network but was told I needed a referral.
4963,My mother has gone to a family doctor for her anxiety and never saw a psychiatrist or pursued any other help outside of being on Lexopro.
4964,I don't know the nature of her anxiety as we don't talk much.
4965,What can I expect at this general visit?
4966,Will I be offered a prescription right off the bat?
4967,Will I be interviewed to see if I really need a psychiatrist?
4968,I feel as though I have lots of deep issues with myself that need fixing/therapy beyond taking medications.
4969,I've never been on any mental health medicines before so I'm not even sure what to expect if I do get put on something.
4970,So when my friend (from a Southern European country) told me that she suffered from severe anxiety and got dismissed by her doctor and put on the wrong medication and had a terrible time finding a job out of school I actually doubted her (although I didn't say that) because reddit has convinced me that living literally anywhere else in the Western world would get rid of my anxiety completely.
4971,I'm not sure if that was the medicine getting me into a pattern or if that's just the nature of my miserable life.
4972,"Well ""suffer"" its a bit not well put because I alternate now taking meds."
4973,"Yesterday somehow I waked up, ate yogurt and took the meds I guess half of a 2,5 mg tablet  the ones that melt in mouth."
4974,"I know it has 6-8 hours half life time or more not sure , my doc said 9 to 12 hours .How you guys manage with this medicine ?"
4975,There years later after medication and therapy I tried to go back and finish only to have a miscarriage in the bathrooms there and start the attacks all over again.
4976,My entire family went away on vacation at the end of July.
4977,"I was responsible for the house and all that comes with it (mail, flowers, pool, etc), three extremely high-maintenance dogs, two lizards, my girlfriend, and then worst of all by far, myself."
4978,"Under daily circumstances I'm really not good for anything, mostly incapacitated."
4979,"Declared ""totally and permanently disabled"" by the state."
4980,"Thankfully permanent just means for more than 60 months or something like that, because while I do think that I'll never get better, I would hate for it to be officially recognized as such to make matters worse for me."
4981,"For the week that they were away, I should have been a disaster."
4982,"I take 10mg of Valium twice a day and have been on some form of daily benzo on a daily ""therapeutic"" basis since late 2009."
4983,"I probably first became and realized I was addicted in December 2009, though that's another problem entirely."
4984,"Point mostly being that switching to Valium (in 2011 or 2012, I forget) was finally the benzo that sort of lasted long enough to keep me from having such extreme panic attacks for so long that I was basically in the ER every week, mostly during the summer as far as I can recall (my brain is absolute goo, as you could imagine, from being on these poisonous pills)."
4985,"I've also been going through tolerance withdrawals for a very great majority of this time, mostly in the form of greatly increased anxiety (compared to the original reason for being prescribed benzos) and the very, very horrifying side effect (presumably, though it could stem from something else) of a whole slew of simple yet painfully (physically and mentally) severe vocal tics."
4986,I am also severely agoraphobic.
4987,"In extreme cases I won't leave the house at all for months at a time, not even just to attempt it."
4988,"In best case scenarios, I can drive within a few miles of my house, if and only if my girlfriend or brother (though my brother just moved two hours away so he's not a regular option anymore) are with me and if I took my pill recently enough AND am actually feeling calming effects of it as opposed to feeling like I've taken nothing."
4989,"The most time I can usually survive outside the house is an hour or two at best before I really start to feel weak and faint and like I need to get home into bed, lying on my side in my sort of ""comfort"" position."
4990,"It's probably weird, just the same as I need to always have a water bottle with me at all times, but if it helps, it helps (so long as it isn't something destructive)."
4991,"During the time my family was away, my brother came home to visit from dental school and stayed for a long weekend and we got out at least for a little bit probably 4 or so of the 7 days that the rest of my family was gone."
4992,That is a HUGE deal for me.
4993,"On one of the days, we even made it ""all the way"" to Target, which requires taking our local highway to get to and normally I can't do that."
4994,But I guess I was feeling well enough from succeeding at getting out at all that I was just calm enough to go with it and ride it out.
4995,"It was uncomfortable, and as dinner time came and I felt myself getting really hungry and sort of shaky, I was rushing to get moving, but I STILL wasn't as bad as I've been feeling now."
4996,"Which, naturally, brings me to the now."
4997,My family got back from vacation on Tuesday.
4998,"I felt fine on that day, assuming you understand that in this case fine just means par for the course, not actually fine."
4999,"But anyway, I think I was relatively okay through Wednesday until a bit later in the day."
5000,I remember suddenly feeling very disassociated while lying in bed and basically having to jump up and start shaking my head and things to try to snap out of it.
5001,"I felt like I couldn't breathe, the whole works, but then I think I came down relatively quickly."
5002,"My girlfriend came over for a bit after that, and for the rest of the night until she had to leave I was well enough, my tics were pretty bad but otherwise I was keeping it together."
5003,"But then I woke up yesterday and I knew then that something was really, really wrong."
5004,"Much more so than normal, anyway."
5005,"My entire body feels like it's plugged into an extremely high voltage generator and it's being pumped through me at all times, not even in waves so much as just a constant stream of electricity."
5006,I can feel it in my chest.
5007,"The fluttery heart feeling coupled with the nerves and jitters of having drank a pot of coffee (I don't drink caffeine, I'm almost 4 years sober from alcohol, I don't smoke weed or anything like that, figured I'd put that out there) but when feeling my pulse my heart wasn't even actually beating faster than normal."
5008,It's a terribly strange sensation to FEEL like your heart is racing when it really isn't.
5009,"It's sort of like you're in the passenger seat of a really, really fast car and the driver has floored it and you're pushed back up against the seat and feeling that adrenaline rush, and then they slow the car down but you still feel like you're moving at 100mph and you haven't even noticed that the car has slowed."
5010,"On top of that, I feel sort of like I'm really sick without actually being sick."
5011,Picture feeling all congested and snotty with your lungs feeling all tight and itchy.
5012,"I'm very, very allergic to my dogs, and that could surely have something to do with it."
5013,But that's where one of my tics comes into play and really kills me.
5014,The very first of my tics that I ever developed was a repeated snorting to try to clear my nose.
5015,"Sometimes there isn't anything in my nose, sometimes it's really, really stuffed."
5016,"When it gets out of hand, it'll often go on for so long that I'll start tasting blood in my post-nasal drip from doing it so much."
5017,That definitely happened yesterday.
5018,"Most people would say (in relation to that tic), ""why don't you plug your nose?"""
5019,And I do.
5020,I bought two different nose plugs for swimming that I'll put on to stop myself from being able to sniffle or snort.
5021,And sometimes that worked really well for me.
5022,WORKED being the key word.
5023,"You see, my brain likes to sabotage me."
5024,"I guess all our brains are really the same in that sense, or else we really wouldn't be mentally ill."
5025,"When I plugged my nose, another tic that I had to a much lesser degree suddenly became my most prominent, painful, embarrassing, possibly dangerous, and without a doubt most anxiety-fueling tic."
5026,"This one is a repeated sort of ""huh"" sound that sends my entire upper body into an almost jolt."
5027,"In the process I'm forcing air out of my lungs over and over and it really, really worries me that this may be permanently damaging."
5028,"Worse yet, there is absolutely no way to stop this tic."
5029,I can't plug my lungs up.
5030,"If I close my mouth, I still do it through my nose."
5031,"And I can't plug both up, and holding my breath not only doesn't help but will just lead to me fainting."
5032,"So last night everything finally all culminated in the mother of all panic attacks, the likes of which I haven't seen since the days before I was on valium, when I was taking little slivers of xanax and klonopin every hour or two just to try to have some amount of it in my system at all times (to no avail)."
5033,"I won't bore you with all of the classic panic attack symptoms, but the part I will bore you with is that during these attacks, my tics both greatly increase in severity AND fuel the attack in a terribly vicious cycle which ultimately keeps the attacks going on and on and on and on, indefinitely."
5034,"I paced around my house, dripping with sweat."
5035,"I disassociated hardcore, I felt like this was all happening in one giant nightmare that I wasn't in any control of but had to feel all of the horrible physical and emotional consequences of it."
5036,"I was shaking, I couldn't breathe (I have legitimate breathing problems on top of the ones that get worse with anxiety), I couldn't talk."
5037,I was drowning myself in bottled water and rubbing it on my forehead trying to cool down.
5038,I couldn't find any comfortable position to lie in.
5039,"Every sensation that usually feels one way felt completely different (like getting winded running up and down the stairs, instead of it just feeling like needing to catch my breath, I had all these crazy sensations in my chest and lungs that I couldn't stop thinking about)."
5040,I don't know what to do.
5041,I don't really have anyone to talk to.
5042,I've been to every therapist who accepted my insurance or who I could temporarily afford to pay out of pocket.
5043,I've been to the two available psychiatrists in the area.
5044,"I've been on pretty much all the medications, none of which have ever helped me at all aside from the occasional and temporary relief I get from Valium, which obviously comes at a massive price."
5045,"I've even tried to quit the benzos before using a long-term taper plan, but I ultimately ended up rushing it and failing at around 5.5mg, and the doctor I had found had only agreed to help me one time as a personal family favor (my father is a DMD and they know each other and myself and both brothers have all known and gone to this doctor since we were little kids) and cut me off when I didn't succeed in one attempt."
5046,"If you've made it this far, congratulations."
5047,I'm sorry for going on and on for so long.
5048,"Typing this (combined with responding to my girlfriend's texts while also trying to get in contact with the manager of my local GameStop about some issue I may be having) has managed to chew up like an hour of the day, which otherwise would have been spent giving attention to this panic attack."
5049,I take my pill in about a half hour and can only hope that tonight isn't a repeat performance of last night.
5050,"Only time will tell, and I'm sure if something goes down I'll be back in this threat to type up some more."
5051,"If I get no responses and nobody even reads this (and I don't blame you) then it was, if nothing else, at least cathartic and I couldn't stress enough the value of that."
5052,"To my fellow sufferers out there, be well."
5053,Feel free to write in this thread along with me.
5054,"Maybe we can beat this thing, maybe we can't, but we're far stronger together."
5055,I honestly do not wish to continue this medication because it does nothing to keep my thoughts from spiraling out of control.
5056,"My worry is, will medication make studying harder?"
5057,Should I ask for CBT and decline meds?
5058,What's your experience with medication been?
5059,"First time posting here, hello, and apologies if this is a little long winded!"
5060,"A little background; I am a 21 year old male, and have been experiencing anxiety for just over a year, which generally comes with a number of body sensations, some of the main ones that affect me are tight muscles and tenderness in the chest, churning stomach, tingling in my feet, and heart palpitations."
5061,In general the anxiety comes in what I would describe as waves.
5062,"So every few weeks it might be fairly low and I am able to cope with it, and at other times it is very high and I end up getting little sleep and feel aches all over my body and feel sore and uncomfortable throughout the day."
5063,"My anxiety has always been worse in the evenings, when I am hungover (which has led me to drink less alcohol and makes me feel like I cant enjoy a drink with my friends like I used to), or when I try to do something where my body is still/relaxed (watching a movie, university lectures)."
5064,I went and spoke to my doctor about this today and talked about medications that might work for me.
5065,"I have a fair bit of trouble sleeping when my anxiety is high, which has affected my ability to attend university on time, which led to me missing days and generally brought down my attendance."
5066,"So we discussed this, and I mentioned benzodiazepines, which are said to have skeletal muscle relaxant properties, but are highly addictive, and he told me that he doesn't like to prescribe them in amounts of over three pills, as they can become addictive very quickly."
5067,"So he begun talking about antidepressants, which in itself the word 'antidepressant' seems bad/negative to me as I don't feel that I am depressed, and aren't too keen on taking pills every day to keep myself feeling normal."
5068,"But I said this and he said a lot of people find they help, so I thought it might be worth a try."
5069,He prescribed me 28 10mg tablets to take once a day for the next 4 weeks.
5070,I mentioned my appointment to my housemate as she suffers from anxiety and she told me her doctor advised her to stay away from antidepressants as the risk of your mood dropping substantially when you stop taking them can be quite high.
5071,"I wanted to know if anyone here has experience with antidepressants, and if they helped for them or if they had any negative side effects of withdrawal symptoms?"
5072,Do the benefits outweigh the risks?
5073,I forgot my meds this morning too and I'm sure that's not helping.
5074,"I'm not sure if I should wait for my Depakote to take ""more affect"" and then see, or if I should just try some other medication."
5075,"**BIPOLAR RELATED:**

* I haven't had a single episode since I started my medication, so that's already a good start."
5076,"* I *want* the medicine to work, badly, so I'm afraid of that clouding my judgement."
5077,"Well, my meds are in at Costco...but I have no way to get there."
5078,"Hi Everyone,

OK, I have a very specific problem and I'm not sure if anyone here might have any experience which can help me."
5079,I suffer from anxiety and depression and have been managing it well for the last 10 years using various medications.
5080,"I'm 31 and my husband and I would like a baby, so since January, I've been trying (with the help of my doctor) to get off my medication."
5081,It's been a huge struggle with 3 complete failures so far.
5082,"Through some alternative therapy, I feel like I'm really close to getting off my medication finally, but now I have another problem ... my job."
5083,"I'm a software engineer, and I work primarily from home which is fantastic."
5084,"But occasionally, I may be asked to do a client presentation."
5085,"With a ton of practice, a xanax or two, and my regular medication, this isn't a problem."
5086,"It's incredibly stressful, but I can power through and am actually (much to my dismay) really good at them."
5087,So... they keep fucking asking me to do them.
5088,Today is the first day without my Abilify at all.
5089,"I plan to hang here for a week, then start lowering the dosage on my Pristiq (which I anticipate won't be as hard) then once I'm off that, attempt to get pregnant."
5090,Herein lies my problem.
5091,"I have no idea how long it takes to get pregnant, but in meantime, I'm like a sitting duck here with no meds."
5092,"I don't doubt my ability to perform my regular job, but I strongly doubt my ability to give a coherent presentation in front of people."
5093,So what do I do?
5094,"Should I be upfront with my manager (who I expect would be understanding, but god, that's not a conversation I want to have)?"
5095,No one at work knows I have these issues and I think I'm perceived as a capable (though probably a bit quiet) employee.
5096,"Once I'm pregnant, I feel this is a more appropriate concession to ask for (to be allowed to skip the client presentations) but in the meantime, I'm not sure it's OK, so if they do ask me, I either say no (for some reason that I can't even begin to come up with) or go back up on my meds and do it, but lose the 6 months of progress I've made toward getting off these meds."
5097,It's just stressing me out so much.
5098,Anyone have any advice here?
5099,Thanks!
5100,Does anyone have suggestions on natural methods of dealing with anxiety?
5101,"I had too many side effects from SSRIs- specifically, it DEMOLISHED my sex drive."
5102,(I know there are other medications that aren't so bad- like wellbutrin- but I'm breastfeeding my son and none of them are known to be safe.)
5103,My doctor recommended Cerenity Orthmolecular: (http://www.pureformulas.com/cerenity-90-capsules-by-ortho-molecular-products.html#sthash.fbafdFQx.dpbs) Has anyone tried this (or any other supplements)?
5104,"Also, suggestions for coping strategies/lifestyle changes that have worked for you would be appreciated."
5105,"Honestly, I'm a huge mess, and I've never really learned how to cope when feeling anxious- which makes me a SUPER fun person to be around."
5106,"I do CBT exercises, take medication, and have been through extensive therapy so that I may live a very quiet, shut-in life while being financially dependent on my partner, as I am not emotionally fit to work."
5107,"Thanks to assholes who don't listen to their doctors and take their meds correctly &amp; the use of antibiotics in animal farming, one day there's gonna be some ridiculous super-illness like the Black Plague that wipes out a good portion of humanity."
5108,The only anti-anxiety meds to help are benzos.. but those motherfuckers scare me.
5109,"Well, I really dont know how/where to start."
5110,"I have PTSD, Depression, and General Anxiety and have been through major therapy to deal with those issues."
5111,"I have felt pretty alright for awhile, but in the last couple months I feel like I am falling again."
5112,"I cant seem to focus, I cant seem to find happiness in things I used to, have been having flashbacks, and have haf generally raised anxiety."
5113,"I learned through my therapy, that developing positive thought patterns is a major thing you must do to fight the toxic thoughts."
5114,I am trying my best to change my thoughts yet I am still not finding what I feel is balance.
5115,"I have also be using mediation as well, and seems to help for a short period (2-3 hours roughly)  


I unfortunately cannot go to my doctor as I was laid off in December, and my new jobs insurance doesnt kick in until July 1st."
5116,"I took myself off my medications around October of last year (buspar, zoloft, xanax) and was actually was the turning point for me."
5117,"During my time on the medication I felt VERY suicidal, and at timea I very well considered it."
5118,I guess really what I am wanting to know is if the effects of PTSD/Anxiety/and Depression ones I will have to deal with/face for the rest of my life?
5119,"If so, how do you deal with it?"
5120,"I am struggling right now, and I am sure someone out there has been in my position, and I would love to hear how you dealt with it."
5121,Thanks in advance
5122,So the first class begins and I am on edge despite the propranolol I took (this is basically a heart medication which tries to reduce the adrenalin dump we experience during stressful situations).
5123,I've had bad experiences with psych meds in the past and I'm terrified to start taking benzos (my mom was addicted to ativan until she died).
5124,"I've been on many meds for all of these afflictions except the anxiety, and nothing seemed to work, so at this point I'm not taking any."
5125,I'll have to make the decision to go on meds.
5126,"In the beginning, I felt great, but now with a sudden move I am starting to feel extremely anxious and helpless, and I don't feel my medication is doing a suitable job."
5127,"I'd like to put off going up a dosage in my meds if I can help it, which is where you come in."
5128,"I've been to the doctor and they prescribed me with Buspar, but I have yet to take it because I feel like meds aren't the answer."
5129,"Maybe it's weird, but - I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for several years now, and I've gotten better at handling them, without meds or therapy, just me and time."
5130,I'm on no medication except for birth control.
5131,I'm sure my anxiety from lack of meds isn't helping this either.
5132,I'm getting lots of palpitations... WAY more than I did without medication.
5133,I'm looking to do this without taking any meds if possible.
5134,"He then asked me if I was on medication, and said ""So if you're on medication, why are you having panic attacks?"""
5135,"Plus, I think if I go for help with my anxiety, they will be skeptical about giving me medication for it (even though I really think it would make a difference to me) because they would probably find out that there's every possibility I would abuse it for overdosing purposes."
5136,"But everyone was getting their a-level results today, and I just feel complete and utterly pathetic because I haven't done anything with my life for the last three years, apart from monumentally mess my health up to the point I'm on medication for my stomach and heart (and antidepressants)."
5137,"I've been on medication for about 3 weeks now, and I'll be able to see a counselor in 2 months (when the health insurance from my new job will begin)."
5138,So far all they've done is give him anti-psychotic medicine and they do group sessions were they state their mood and goals.
5139,"She also prescribed me some meds, one of which I took already: Propranolol."
5140,"I still feel nervous and scared, because I don't really want to take meds, but I HAVE to get through this quarter."
5141,"TL;DR- Huge panic attack, went to Doctor, got some meds, super tired and still nervous."
5142,"Don't swallow, but suck, because it tastes **rank**, and idea of ""medicine"" can help panic sufferers think you're *stopping a heart attack*."
5143,I am due to see a psychiatrist for medication in a few days after talking about it (medication) with my therapist.
5144,"After 4 hellish weeks of lots of medication, practice, and terrible, stuttering speeches.. And improvement!.."
5145,btw if it helps I am on no medication.
5146,Is 85 to old for medication?
5147,I've never had a medical history with any of this type of stuff and I'm really worried that my doctor is going to think I'm faking or something.
5148,"I'm usually really bright and cheery, smart, someone who seems like they are on top of their game."
5149,Im just worried that my doctor is going to have the same reaction my counselor at school had.
5150,"I hate feeling like I am changing in front of people and I hate having to explain ""when this started"" or anything like that."
5151,My feet and legs are cramping up this second.
5152,I hate talking about my feelings more than anything and I know I'm expected to do that in an hour or something and I'm stressing out about it.
5153,By far my biggest source of anxiety is school and I don't want him thinking that I'm just trying to get out of school or anything.
5154,I want fixed but I cannot go to school anymore.
5155,"I have 22 absences and all my teachers hate me and think that I am just being a lazy piece of shit senior, and I know it comes of that way, I just don't want the doctor thinking that."
5156,What the fuck I am supposed to say?
5157,Please help me?

5159,the past month i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and my medicine is not regulated at all so I'm still having super bad panic attacks.
5160,"My life is not without its ups and downs, I have an anxious disposition and experience bouts of depression, have been in therapy a few times during tough life experiences, but overall I've managed to get through life smoothly and without medication or serious issues."
5161,My therapist told me it was a good idea to try the Xanax now so I could get some rest and also maybe get used to the idea of medicine.
5162,"So now i'm here, hearing all these bad things about Xanax, having had a bad experience with it before, without knowing if it was just the panic attack or if it was the small amount of medicine affecting me."
5163,"I'm 90% sure it was just the anxiety of taking medicine making me have the bad reaction, and the medicine dosage was just so low that it didn't calm me down."
5164,"I see a therapist and take some SSRIs, but I spent my last therapy session crying my eyes out because i was so scared, and the medication doesn't really help when I'm this on edge."
5165,My meds dont make me happy anymore.
5166,"I have arranged a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy session that I am taking next week, and have been prescribed Citalopram as medication to help with my anxiety."
5167,"I had stowed away some medicine, but used it sparingly because I didn't want to run out."
5168,But I'm curious how this or similar medication has effected your day to day physical symptoms?
5169,"And you stopped taking your allergy meds, so your inner ears are all gunked up."
5170,"Also moving forward as we visit a counseling center/continue medication, is there anything I can do other than just be there?"
5171,I started seeing a new therapist a few weeks ago and she said we can try medication if I want but that she would like to give me tools to try to conquer panic on my own without medication.
5172,"I agree with that in theory but as time goes by I feel like I really want medication...really the thing that has worked for me well before is Xanax but I feel like if I ask for it I sound like a drug-seeker or something, or that I'm giving up on trying to help myself on my own with deep breathing or relaxation."
5173,"I got the call this evening that my blood work was much the same this time (to be expected so I'm on cholesterol medicine now), but she also said "" when that levels out your EKG will be better."""
5174,"I'm asking this question because, well i take xanax for my anxiety and i wanted to see what other medications that are out there that can help, because i do not like xanax too much."
5175,I have an oxygen machine that I turned on and I took my blood pressure medication also to help calm me down.
5176,"She started asking if things were cool, why am I being moody, eventually leading to a one sided conversation that I might be bipolar and probably need to speak to someone or get meds and that she had meds for a while etcetc."
5177,"Details: 19 y/o Male, GAD for 12 years."
5178,"When I was first diagnosed, I was put on tons of meds, we changed them every few weeks."
5179,"In middle school, I was on 4 mg of Klonopin daily, plus numerous other strong medications."
5180,"Since then, I have weened my way down to just 20 mg of Prozac daily, no other meds... And I recently went off that."
5181,"I hadn't had an anxiety attack in over a year, probably two years actually."
5182,"I was so happy to be off the meds, to be me finally, to know that I and I alone can manage my anxiety."
5183,But I can't.
5184,This last week has been the worst week since I was in elementary school.
5185,I can't get any work done.
5186,"I'm overeating, feeling sick, overeating..."
5187,"I'm anti-social, I don't want to talk to anyone, not even my closest friends."
5188,I nearly have breakdowns in class.
5189,**I don't feel like myself.
5190,"**

I find this feeling ironic, given the fact that now that I'm not on any medication, I *am* myself."
5191,And it's shitty.
5192,I was a really happy person when I was on Prozac.
5193,"It makes me sad that I can't be happy on my own, it makes me depressed that I can't manage my anxiety without help from medication."
5194,I have to go back on the medication.
5195,I don't have the energy or the time to try and work things out without it.
5196,"But **I'm having a hard time not viewing it as a step back, especially now that I'm also going back to therapy."
5197,"I know logically that going back on the meds is the next step in me feeling better, but I can't help but feel that I've lost this battle with anxiety."
5198,"I was so happy and healthy for a long time that I thought I could do this, I thought I could finally say that it's me and only me battling this disorder**."
5199,But David can't slay this Goliath.
5200,"I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and recently started seeing a psychiatrist to get my meds in order."
5201,"After about an hour I started having chest pains, and became worried that I took my meds wrong or something - which I didn't because I took the vyvanse earlier that morning and the Zoloft in the afternoon (this was before I was prescribed lorazepam)."
5202,"At the hospital, they did some more test and x-rays; the doctor said I was fine; they gave me some anxiety medication and released me."
5203,Only medication I am on is birth control pills.
5204,I got my wisdom teeth taken out 1 1/2 weeks ago (and then got dry sockets!
5205,"), so I've been taking Percocet most days since then."
5206,I wish it couldn't lead to tolerance and dependance because **it's so wonderful to actually be happy and worry free.
5207,"**

After getting broken up with 2 months ago I pretty much hit rock bottom emotionally."
5208,I have social anxiety and general anxiety so having my heart wrenched out was just the cherry on top of the shit sundae.
5209,I'm actually doing really well with my social anxiety; I got a job and I'm wanting to learn to drive which is something I *never* thought I'd do.
5210,I'm even trying to take some classes at the local college pretty much so I can be around people and socialize because I'm in a rural area.
5211,Getting all my paperwork and immunizations for that is a load of anxiety too though :/.
5212,"Back to my point, I'm so incredibly sad most of the time."
5213,I've tried 5 different medications for anxiety although I haven't been back to the doctor since I got dumped.
5214,And none of them worked for me (at least without awful side effects).
5215,"I do have some Ativan that I take occasionally but it's more for when I get *really* anxious, not an every day thing."
5216,It just sucks that this medicine that actually works and makes me feel like a normal person is a pretty heavy duty narcotic.
5217,Anyone else have a similar situation or advice?
5218,(I'm also xposting this to r/depression in case it's more appropriate there)
5219,I suffer from anxiety induced IBS(d).
5220,"Whenever I go to work, go on a date or meet some friends, I have to visit the bathroom a bunch of times before I leave."
5221,"Once the date starts or the meetup group starts, I'm 100% normal but before then it's a different story."
5222,If I were to stay at my house for a week and just do normal errands around town the IBS(d) would be nonexistent.
5223,I have been seeing a therapist and was put on Remeron(7.5mg-&gt;and now taking 60mg) without any side effects.
5224,The 15mg put me to sleep but I am having no side effects from taking the 60mg.
5225,"No over eating, no weight gain, I'm just a nicer person overall."
5226,I am seeing my doctor on Thurs and was curious if anyone knows of any alternative medicines I should try.
5227,I was on Celexa for two days and could not deal with the sexual and nausea side effects.
5228,Now I can't afford to see anyone or continue medication but I really need it.
5229,"No one in my family is on board with the medication as it is, and it just makes me feel more different..."
5230,"I've struggled with OCD and anxiety for roughly 4 years now and it's been pretty manageable without meds but I feel like it's turned awful, now and I'm lost and freaking out."
5231,What sort of anxiety medications would I use for sexual performance anxiety?
5232,I have been diagnosed with GAD and I get so nervous whenever I have sex.
5233,"It doesn't happen every time, but almost every time."
5234,"Leading up to sex and during, my heart starts pounding and I can't get and erection."
5235,Sometimes I can get erection but it's not hard and I lose it.
5236,I've tried viagra but it only helps about 2/3 of the time.
5237,When all this happens it sets me in even more panic.
5238,I feel like a failure and feel bad for my girlfriend and then have visions that she will break up with me.
5239,We have been together three years and she is understanding at times but also gets frustrated and angry other times.
5240,I agreed to and started therapy a few weeks ago.
5241,"CBT has been helping a little bit with some other anxiety (work,social ex) but the with sex it is always automatic."
5242,I don't want to start medications because I hear that it will mess with sex drive and that la the problem I'm trying to prevent in the first place!
5243,"I've tried Wellbutrin before, but my anxiety increased a 100 fold and I had to get off of it."
5244,We have been dating for three years and I still haven't been able to beat this.
5245,It seems to be worse when I am stressed out do to work.
5246,But even times when I don't feel stress out it I still have issues.
5247,What sorts of this have others do to overcome this sort of thing?
5248,"Hey all,

So I feel like I have really made a big effort to overcome my social anxiety recently by joining public speaking groups and attending networking events."
5249,"However, I just can't seem to put a full stop to this anxiety returning."
5250,"As such, I was going to make an appointment with a doctor to consider medications."
5251,"I was wondering if you could provide advice on this, is there a particular medication that has worked for you?"
5252,Did you use a medication in conjunction with any other type of therapy?
5253,What has led to your lasting results?
5254,"Lastly, there is no big danger of becoming addicted to medication or having any other major adverse effects from usage right?"
5255,"I just want to be the calm, cool and collected person that I wish to be (and which I am in certain situations)."
5256,If i can't be that person then I know I can never achieve true happiness.
5257,"For most people this is the natural state of things, but to me this is a life mission."
5258,Thank you.
5259,Hey guys i've been suffering heavy anxiety over the last 6 months and i've finally decided to try medication since therapy didnt seem to really work.
5260,I was just wondering if i should continue this medication or ask my doctor to siwtch so something else or it may be the caffeine that triggered it again.
5261,Took meds.
5262,But for as long as I can remember ...I've felt constantly tired and just overall sluggish so I've been kind of wondering if this could be the paxil as it is the only anxiety medication I've taken.
5263,"I'm also tired all the time, but I'm not sure if I can chalk that all up to the medication."
5264,"I am terrified of letting this relationship become ruined because of something I can't control, but I'm in the middle of a move and looking for a new job and I can't risk weening off this medication/changing and having a panic attack every day of work."
5265,Do I sound like someone who would benefit from a medication change?
5266,"Hi r/anxiety,

Something I've struggled with for a while is taking medications."
5267,"I'm not allergic to any, but I'm often afraid I will be or that they will have some other adverse effect on me."
5268,"I'm currently on necessary antibiotics for a UTI, and have had two panic attacks in the last two days."
5269,I feel dehydrated and exhausted(I haven't been sleeping enough; finals week).
5270,"I get freaked out about taking stuff like advil, though; when I had my wisdom teeth pulled I went off it way too soon and just suffered with pain."
5271,Do any of you have suggestions for ways I could calm myself down when taking medications?
5272,Thank you.
5273,"Tomorrow I have a consultation for meds, then therapy, then an appointment with my doctor to prescribe the actual medications."
5274,I asked a while ago for medication when my anxiety got really bad.
5275,"I was put on a list to see a psychiatrists a while ago, but the list was long."
5276,"I still would go to therapy, and it has helped me to feel better temporarily and during some panic attacks."
5277,But I've gotten worse since I started.
5278,Last week was the hardest week of my life.
5279,Everyday my anxiety got so bad that I needed talk to someone.
5280,My friends and family are thankfully so supportive and they helped me immensely.
5281,Without them I would not have made it through the week without something really bad happening.
5282,That terrifies me.
5283,I'm scared of myself when I'm alone.
5284,I hate being stuck in my mind alone.
5285,But I'm also terrified of medication.
5286,I know it will probably help.
5287,But I'm scared of how I might feel while on it.
5288,I'm hopeful but at the same time can't seem to accept it.
5289,I just want to feel better
5290,"I used to have really bad GAD, the feeling of someone tightly gripping your heart ALL the time... i'm better now that  have medication, but now i really don't feel like anything anymore, i go to the gym, play the guitar, have a girlfriend, a good family and all that."
5291,"I would have no social life if not for the internet and I couldn't leave the house if not for brief moments of clarity afforded by smoking marijuana, being drunk or when on my medication, clonazepam."
5292,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for years, and I am not on any meds, fwiw."
5293,Since then I have been worried that my meds are working as good.
5294,I know the meds aren't going to completely take away anxiety.
5295,"Since I was 13 my social anxiety has gotten increasingly worse, which seems to have lead to depression."
5296,I finally decided that it's time to seek help because I do not want to live the rest of my life in this slump that has been the past 6 years.
5297,"I fear speaking out around anyone, even my friends and I have no motivation to do anything which is affecting my goal of graduating college."
5298,"I have heard of many strange side effect from anti-depressant and anti-anxiety drugs, but I would really appreciate any firsthand experiences."
5299,"Basically, I want to know if it's possible for me to actually be able to go out and have a good time with friends and have some kind of motivation in my life as a result of medication, because everything I read online seems to only tell me the negatives of these medications."
5300,"As a side note, the main reason I have decided to finally seek help was because of an experience I had with MDMA last week."
5301,"I realize that, naturally, no one will be as happy as they are when they take MDMA, but I also realized that I never used to be how I am now: a quiet, boring person."
5302,"Honestly it was a life changing experience, as cheesy as that sounds, and it made me realize that being depressed all the time was not normal, especially when all of my friends are out having fun, dancing, and meeting new people."
5303,She diagnosed me with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder which I am now taking meds for.
5304,I do have bills and expenses to pay for but I'm still living at home due to my condition and I'm currently on medication and seeing a counsellor which helps a bit.
5305,"I've got some pretty severe social anxiety that I'm currently on medication for, as well as likely GAD according to my doctor."
5306,Without relying on medication?
5307,Never been on any medication.
5308,"I went on medication and started therapy, and things got a lot better."
5309,I just want to be off the medication and normal again.
5310,"I know it's stupid to dwell on the dates but it's just particularly hard for me this year for whatever reason.mAlso coming up is the day I started taking meds and the day I ended up in hospital, and I guess I'll have a whole new set in the summer too after last summer."
5311,"Basically, I have life-long issues with anxiety and depression - I began seeing a doctor and taking medication two years ago this month."
5312,AFter almost getting off and changing meds im back on a full mill of 25mg of atenolol.
5313,"I'm 19, nearing 20 and have been considering getting medication for the past few years."
5314,Hi everyone.
5315,I'm an 18 y/o female and for the past year I've been dealing with severe anxiety.
5316,"I constantly worry about everything-- school, my job, my relationship, and just getting daily tasks done."
5317,I have a tendency of making problems that aren't even there in the first place.
5318,"I second guess myself and I always critically over-analyze things that are said by my boyfriend, friends, or family."
5319,"I've tried to tell myself it's all in my head, but lately I've just been getting worse and worse."
5320,Over the last few months I've really felt the physical toll of my anxiety.
5321,"I get chest pains, I have trouble sleeping completely through the night, I have cramps and stomach problems all the time and my body just aches sometimes (I especially get headaches, probably due more to sudden crying than anything)."
5322,I sometimes feel like I can't function at all.
5323,I've developed a severe fear of being alone for too long or not having anything to do.
5324,"If I don't have plans lined up within a day or two, I start to feel severely anxious."
5325,I randomly cry and I can't help it.
5326,My heart races and sometimes I feel like I can't breathe.
5327,"I have a lot of people that care about me, but sometimes I just feel so alone."
5328,"When people don't answer my calls or texts, I immediately jump to a negative conclusion."
5329,"I've always had a habit of biting and picking at  my nails, but it's gotten worse."
5330,"Sometimes I do it so bad that I make myself bleed or my cuticles get infected, and I don't always realize I'm doing it."
5331,Lately it seems like I've been having at least one panic attack every week.
5332,"I'm writing this because I had one tonight, and I just feel so tired of fighting this."
5333,My primary doctor referred me to a psychiatrist and I called the other day to give them all my information.
5334,"The receptionist said a therapist would call me back within 1-2 business days and set me up with an appointment, which could be in about a week to a week and a half."
5335,I don't feel like I can wait that long anymore.
5336,I need help now.
5337,I can't keep feeling this way.
5338,It's putting stress on my relationship.
5339,"My boyfriend is very sweet and patient with me, he tries to understand but I just know it's really hard for him."
5340,"I'm always asking him to be with me and as much as I know he enjoys time with me, he likes being alone sometimes too."
5341,He says that sometimes my anxiety scares him because he's afraid of what will happen to me if one day he can't be there.
5342,I don't know what to do anymore.
5343,My primary doctor is open tomorrow.. should I call in the morning and try to make an appointment to talk with my doctor and tell her that I just couldn't wait for a therapist?
5344,I'm scared it's only going to get worse from here.
5345,I feel hopeless right now.
5346,"Any comments, help, opinions, support, etc."
5347,are very appreciated.
5348,EDIT: I'm not currently on any medications.
5349,"If anyone has been through something similar, or just knows about the medication, will this continue if I switch meds?"
5350,I don't know why Im having these thoughts I just know I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and I don't take meds for it.
5351,Does anyone else on similar SSRI medication use the Pill and if so have there been any complications for you?
5352,Hello all.
5353,I have been suffering from GAD since I was a young child.
5354,In my thirties now.
5355,My severe reactions are to doctor/dentist's offices.
5356,"I have been diagnosed with neuro-cardiogenic syncope (basically, fainting.)"
5357,"The adrenaline in my head sky rockets, causing an eventual drop in blood pressure as my ""system reboots"" and I faint."
5358,I even went and had the tilt table tests performed.
5359,"In that, they showed me the tilt table and I fainted."
5360,"Other than the acute symptoms, I definitely have a constant anxious vibe running through me."
5361,"Have been turning to alcohol on Sunday nights to ""prepare"" myself for the coming week even though I have a relatively stress free job and in general."
5362,"In my early twenties, I was under the care of a psychiatrist briefly and she prescribed some fast acting medications such a valium."
5363,"And, she prescribed effexor, which I didn't care MUCH for."
5364,TMI: it made me impotent.
5365,"It did seem to take away many of my issues; however, my family at the time said that it took away a lot of my personality."
5366,I am currently working with a psychiatrist and I would like to try a long term medication.
5367,"I assume because this is 10 years later, their might be some better medications with less side-effects."
5368,"TL:DR As far as long term anxiety medication, what do people recommend."
5369,What has worked well for you.
5370,What didn't you like?
5371,"He said that, especially in comparison to medicine, the field is still in the dark ages and that a lot of this is based on trial and error."
5372,I've ended up going to urgent care or doctor visits a few times in the past couple years because of a 100 degree fever and total body aches and they tell me my white blood cells are normal and that its just stress/anxiety and give me painmeds and muscle relaxers.
5373,"I can’t help but think about a therapist sitting there listening to me and thinking “SNOOOOOOORE” while I blather on, and medicine is last resort for me, so I really want to start with some good reading."
5374,"How long should I expect for a diagnosis to result in some form of treatment or medication (a lot of what I'm experiencing causes me harm on a daily basis – not to say that there's a huge rush for getting help as I'm not at risk for self-harm whatsoever, but obviously I would like to start moving in a positive direction as soon as possible)."
5375,"I have a mild panic disorder and have made real progress in the past few years with therapy and meds, but I did have another panic attack last night after fighting with family."
5376,"I do not abuse any substances, and take my medication on time, 98% of the time."
5377,"(Previous ones have been unwilling to hand out medication, but I truly do need it)."
5378,What anti-anxiety medication (long-term) are people put on usually?
5379,At 25 I decided to stop taking the meds for fear that I had been on them for too long &amp; that I needed to live life without medicinal crutches.
5380,I'm not on any medication.
5381,"I can't get professional help since my parents would kick me out if I tried, they are very much against psychiatrists and medication for psychological issues."
5382,"So to start off I am 21 years old, male, I take medication for ADHD (Ritalin, 36 mg) and I live in the United states."
5383,"Finally I got medication and therapy, and they seemed to help, but it's like a xenomorph: constantly evolving and finding better ways to kill me."
5384,I hate that I can't tell if my medicine works or doesn't.
5385,"The pain medicine makes me want to puke, no idea how people get addicted to those, haha."
5386,"I'm comforted by the successes I've had already, and I do take medication but it's hard not to get into a spiral of anxiety, especially because I pay all my own bills."
5387,So I haven't been taking my meds for about two weeks.
5388,Guess I'm going to just tuck this half a pill away somewhere and in 6 months when I can (hopefully) stop taking these meds I can take it as my last dose (presuming I'll be weaned off them and go back to half-pills before quitting?).
5389,"SOMEONE WHO CAN, PLEASE HELP."
5390,I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
5391,"Okay so it's REALLY hard for me to focus or speak coherently right now, but let me give you some background."
5392,(Timeline!).
5393,YEah I know I'm not supposed to self diagnose but I have one week until I see a psychiatrist to get this fixed.
5394,"I've been in and out of a hospital for a month, so I HAVE been treated, just not well."
5395,Therapist is an asshole.
5396,"**Time**|**Event**|**Treatment**|**Diagnosis**
:---|:---|:---|:---
Late last year|Became lightly depressed, slowly gets worse."
5397,Can't sleep because my mind races at night.
5398,"Get ambien, become dependent.|None for a while|Self: Dysthymic disorder?"
5399,"Jan/feb|Came out of the closet, became anxious around family (fighting)|Started avoiding family, depression worsened|Self: May have triggered my General Anxiety Disorder, more on that later
March|Skip school alot, can't deal with pressure|None, no consequence|Self: Perhaps my depression is worsening?"
5400,"April|Major Depression begins, friend is suicidal and nobody helped him but me, made me hate my friends and isolate myself.|Went to General doctor (Yeah I agree it's a BAD idea) for anxiety."
5401,Get perscribed Ativan.
5402,"It's practically a tranquilizer|Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GP)
Late april, day before sui attempt|Give up on my mom who is constantly yelling."
5403,Tell her I'll kill her.|None|IDK what was going on.
5404,"I guess I just sort of 'gave up'
Next Day|Spontaneously leave school and jump in front of a car (???"
5405,"), Seeing how I felt useless and how my friends were crappy (couldn't treat my friend's suicidalness).|Get put in ER for a few hours by family, but I just had a scratch.|None by hosp, but they recommended a stay at Hospital #1, a (supposedly nice) mental crisis place."
5406,Next 6 days|Stay at Hosp #1.
5407,"I thought the stay was okay, but they put me on Celexa which DEFINITELY made me manic within one day, my mind started racing even more."
5408,Became extraverted (totally abnormal for me).
5409,"They would make me take anti-anxiety pills every-day so it wasn't as bad, I was really tranquil and didn't know I could get severely manic without it|Celexa for SSRI, Xanax and Vistaril for anxiety (Former is stronger, both tranquilize me).|Psychiatrist at hosp: Major Depression and General Anxiety Disorder."
5410,"Upon release|Continue to be manic and have a disrupted personality with disinhibition, became incredibly extraverted and falsely euphoric."
5411,"Must have meds to feel that way, feel depressed upon waking up."
5412,"Cannot focus well.|I get a few minor anxiety breakdowns, using either anti-anxiety tranquilizes me."
5413,"Became much more manic, but not completely, without the anxiety meds to tranquilize me.|Self: At this point I become oddly extraverted and manic, my mind starts racing more."
5414,I might be slightly hypermanic.
5415,"5 days after release|Anxiety attack at school for no reason (Really, no reason)."
5416,"Shook uncontrollably, mind started racing, couldn't really do anything."
5417,"Sent home, mom ignores issue.|Xanax all the things, went to sleep after dentist appt that day.|WTF caused it?!?!"
5418,Next Morning|Mom refuses antidepressant unless I go to school.
5419,At this point I feel suicidal.
5420,"Didn't want to do that, so I tried to get both medications from mom with a knife (to make her know I seriously need it) (!!"
5421,!This is not how I normally behave!!!
5422,I was crazy!!!).
5423,"Cops take me to hospital #2.|They pulled guns on me which made me panic.|I HAVE NO IDEA, THIS IS NOT ME."
5424,2 Days|Stay at hosp #2 until transfer.
5425,"Due to paperwork they don't get me medication until the end of my stay, where I have a panic attack (Just the stress of being there, it's a shitty place and I don't have a private room) and start shaking uncontrollably until I bit my lips and bled."
5426,"They locked me in a room for 2 hours in response to that, made me fucking hate hospitals."
5427,"After the panic attack they transfer me to hospital #1|No meds until panic attack.|I didn't even see a psychologist, fucking useless hospital."
5428,"First 2 days at H. #1|Hospital 1's staff conflicted with me alot, wouldn't let me into my treatment info and wouldn't let me sign consent forms for medication."
5429,"So, in return, I stayed up for 2 days straight and fucking HATED it.|They just moved me to a DIFFERENT antidepressant that does the same thing (Celexa-&gt;Zoloft) and put me on the same class of antidepressants."
5430,"Because, you know, I totally didn't relapse.|None... Ugh."
5431,Didn't get much treatment from the hospital then.
5432,"Rest of stay (2 days)|I go back on Zoloft and anxiety medication, but I decide to reject the anxiety meds."
5433,I was very high strung but I didn't cause any problems.
5434,"Zoloft DID stop me from being quite as anxious, but it did make me manic again."
5435,"This was the first time I realized I may be manic, my weekend doctor observed this in me but didn't know if I was bipolar or it was the meds."
5436,"When I visited the normal doctor I was written off and discharged for my stability (crisis response, not treatment, is how this place works).|Same med types, but Zoloft instead of Celexa."
5437,"I reject the anxiety meds, but couldn't get Xanax for as-needed upon release.|Still Maj. Dep and General Anxiety, but I may be bipolar."
5438,"Today, morning|Serious suicidal ideations in the morning (first time since hospital stay #1), then take meds and become hypermanic and close to inconherent, a serious basketcase."
5439,"Visit my old therapist, who hasn't been that great with handling my issues (I want to get a new one)."
5440,"He was of no help whatsoever, literally, no help.|Tried to move up my psychiatry appointment after the hospital stay to find the problem."
5441,"Can't, I have to wait a week.|We talked about a personality disorder...
After|Went to my psych teacher (best friend/role model) and tried to get his help, but was rambling/shaking/inconherent/fast paced and poorly structured/high strung/anxious."
5442,"He identified a hypermanic reaction (In retrospect that is TOTALLY what happened) and tried to get me to visit a psychiatrist and leave the school, but fortunately didn't hospitalize me."
5443,"Waiting for him to e-mail me with anything that can help, but by the way he treated me I don't think he trusts my judgement right now."
5444,"Hasn't responded in 5 hours|I have to wait, but he mentioned to the nurse that I wouldn't make it until then."
5445,"I don't know what to take from that|At this point I know I'm hypermanic, it all makes sense, how I feel, and in retrospect I may have had minor manic episodes."
5446,"Yes, I did read the links in the sidebar about antidepressants making bipolar people manic w/o antipsychotics and I think that happened."
5447,"So, I know I'm not supposed to get help from the internet, but literally I don't know what's going on and for a week I'm going to have to live with this and I am absolutely going CRAZY."
5448,"I took a mania quiz (http://psychcentral.com/cgi-bin/mania.cgi) and apparently I scored a 62, above a severe manic episode."
5449,"It's not like what I recall in psych class, it's just that I'm incredibly anxious, high strung, stressed, personalize everything, ramble, shake my hands, can't trust anyone, and CAN'T CALM DOWN."
5450,Mom threw out my old xanax and is angry at me about what's happening.
5451,I don't know what's going on.
5452,"PLEASE, if you can help me, I can e-mail, skype, gchat, WHATEVER, I just need someone to help me UNDERSTAND WHY I'M CRAZY."
5453,"Background info: Girl, teenager, started like anxiety meds 2 years ago."
5454,"Alright, I've been on strong anxiety medication for a few months and apparantly can only be on it for 6 months max."
5455,I want to know if this is related to the fact that I'm on the anxiety meds and if coming off them would help.
5456,The fact that one of the doctors a couple years ago gave me a prescription jock itch medication (I didn't mention that it could be skin irritation) that didn't work makes me worry he messed up as well and I actually have angina or heart disease.
5457,Two years ago I started seeing a doctor and taking medication because I just couldnt function without my boyfriend taking care of me.
5458,Should I ask my doctor to go off medication?
5459,Is your life better or worse since you stopped medication?
5460,"On May 2013 i jumped on 50mg zoloft, im very against meds but i couldn't handle anymore i was on the verge of suicide."
5461,"2 weeks after the meds started to take place and finally i could go back to collage and start working out again(had a panic attack in the gym) and the anxiety calmed a little on me but the panics attack ofcourse hit everyday, i tried meditating and taking long walks but it didn't make any big improvements."
5462,Semb 2013 decided to withdrawal zoloft and go without taking any meds.
5463,"9 Months later im meds free,smoke free and im living a healthy life."
5464,"I'm sure the propranolol is contributing to a bit of my dizziness since it is used to treat high blood pressure and mine is relatively average, but I've been dizzy and clumsy like this from my anxiety long before being put on meds."
5465,"I'm the first to admit that I have a problem with anxiety and physical symptoms related to it, no doubt about it, but I don't want to go to a doctor for it because I strongly believe that my mental state shouldn't be controlled by relying on medication."
5466,"Maybe if it gets to the point of needing to I will, but I've only heard bad or neutral experiences from meds and I don't want to become dependent on them to function like a normal person."
5467,"I feel like a fool in front of my parents for causing this scene, even though my mom, aunt, and grandmother all take anti- anxiety and anti depression medication including xanax."
5468,"I've been through a handful a meds, and thankfully,  Celexa was the one that worked best for my biochemist."
5469,I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the right sub but I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I am currently on medication for them.
5470,"I am 
&gt;currently not on medication for it because the attacks are very 
&gt;infrequent and most of the time i can deal with them myself."
5471,"Anyone have the same fear of new medicine, have been through a switch or have taken Prozac?"
5472,I'm so sick of these meds not working for me.
5473,I usually have to vomit if the nausea is really bad because it is the only thing besides my dwindling supply of Zofran (anti-nausea medication) that makes it better.
5474,Before posting this I searched this sub reddit and the web about pros and cons about this medication.
5475,When I described my problems I've been having he said that some people have good days and bad days and they need a band aid medicine for that (I'm assuming like Xanax or something).
5476,I have also never taken any kind of anxiety medicine before except for over the counter st john's wort which has never really worked.
5477,"I've been taking medication for my anxiety for a while now, and it has made a difference."
5478,"So my question is, is this something that I just have to work through, or should I be getting some different medicine to help alleviate some of it?"
5479,Are there other ways to treat anxiety without prescription medication?
5480,(other than prescription meds)
5481,I don't want to take meds I want to deal with it myself because I know I can.
5482,"I told my doctor that I've sensitive to medication, so he prescribed 10 mg Prozac (generic) and .25 mg of Xanax (generic) when needed."
5483,This is my first time taking any type of medication.
5484,She advocated that I take medication with my therapy at first but I was stubborn and refused.
5485,"I don't know much about his credentials, but I can tell he is a special man: he is in his eighties and still very dedicated to his art (he called it an art, specifically, which impressed me since I have always felt that way about medicine in general)."
5486,I’ve thought about seeing a psychologist but I don’t feel like talking about things (not like I can do that anyways…) or taking meds will help.
5487,I can't decide if I want to try medication.
5488,I could eat better and exercise... or I could resort to medication.
5489,I'm really iffy with taking prescribed medication like Prozac or Lexapro when it comes to anxiety issues I'm having.
5490,Any tips or meds that have worked for you.
5491,"I don't like taking medication because I'm a firm believer that it actually doesn't help, it just helps me sleep sometimes."
5492,I've been on SSRIs and the like but being on medication made me even more anxious because I knew how bad the withdrawals were.
5493,"I'm worried, because my anxiety has actually been better and I'm hoping this isn't a sign that my meds are failing or something."
5494,"My meds, my doctor, my therapist...nothing is helping."
5495,My doctor wasn't much help; just prescribed more meds.
5496,"So I've been off my medication for almost 12 months, have been attack free for 18 months and tonight out of the blue I just had an attack."
5497,"However, I'm not sure if this is due to the medication."
5498,"She's also one of those people who doesn't believe in me ever taking medication, and has bought 'vitamins' for me my entire life to help with the depression and anxiety."
5499,I have taken medicine but nobody ever sees a difference because it is all internal.
5500,"I am currently prescribed effexor and buspar, but I want to start taking some vitamins and nutrients that will also aid the medication for a good mental health."
5501,I have an appointment in a month to discuss meds with my doctor and im extremely anxious about that.
5502,"I'm 22, female, with social anxiety, and I've never been on meds before."
5503,I'm also worried about types of medication.
5504,"I really want to be on beta blockers or something similar because I've heard they help with the physical symptoms, but I also really want to be able to drink on whatever meds I have to take."
5505,"It's just that it's what I do with my friends, and I don't want to give that up or to have to tell them that I can't drink any more because I'm on meds."
5506,"I already went to the doctor a couple times, got medication, but a pharamacist who is a friend aswell told me to not take it, he said it was way too strong for me (I am 19)."
5507,She recommended I take some meds and see how they work.
5508,But when I tried to discuss meds I was kind of blown off.
5509,"Now this kind of annoyed me, I've been battling these issues for years and my doctor won't even consider medication."
5510,"Regardless, it's got me thinking about meds again."
5511,The last thing I need is to take a medication that makes it worse.
5512,"I know every med acts differently on different people, but are there meds that don't cause these issues?"
5513,"I was given medication in April but only used it a handful of times, no pun intended."
5514,"I left my medication where it's been for the past couple years, in my nightstand."
5515,"I'd viewed medication for anxiety as a crutch, or a sign of mental weakness."
5516,"I don't believe it's necessary for everyone, but at the same time, taking medication when you feel you need it isn't necessarily a bad thing."
5517,"The reason I said anxiety meds weren't for me is because I know once I can be relaxed in situations that make me uneasy, I won't be scared of them anymore, therefore controlling my anxiety."
5518,"This is the first time I've ever taken any medicine for my anxiety, which I've had for about 2 years now (it's been worsening this summer)."
5519,Have any of you taken this medicine before?
5520,"This is my first time taking medicine, I'm nervous."
5521,I had my doctor prescribe me anti anxiety meds to take when I feel an attack coming on.
5522,"She prescribed me Celexa 20mg a day, only because I asked for medicine due to starting a new job on Monday and was worried about having a panic attack, but also told me about a book and website that she recommended over the medication."
5523,"If I didn't start this medication, I would have probably fell apart by now."
5524,"It has taken therapy, medication and a lot of willpower on my behalf to make even the smallest changes in my communicative and cognitive behavioral habits."
5525,"I was diagnosed with OCD and Dermatillomania at 16 and I'm 22 now, and my process was much smoother than his; I got help with medicine and therapy right away and I have an extremely supportive family, while his is supportive but misinformed and closed."
5526,"I hate taking meds, I've been on them since i was 15 and am just so tired of it."
5527,I suffer from Social Anxiety and I'm on medication for my social anxiety however this is a completely new feeling of anxiety for me i have been feeling anxious all the time and it may stop for a few hours but then at night or when im alone or just thinking about the future or the past my anxiety returns.
5528,"My doctor diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder, and Panic Disorder, and told me to take some meds/ do counseling."
5529,I'm not taking the meds/ I am doing counseling and it's helping a bit.
5530,"Currently on no meds (cut out klonopin in October after 6 years of use treating something else), live in USA."
5531,"Hello all,

Due to his being my first (throwaway) post and the recommendation in the sidebar, I will make the point to say I am a 21y/o male living in Ontario, taking 150mg Wellbutrin XL a day."
5532,Official diagnosis is social anxiety.
5533,"As I'm sure many others here do, I have spent a great deal of time thinking about when my anxiety really began."
5534,When I was in my childhood I had plenty of strange physical ailments that either went unexplained or ignored until I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder at age 20.
5535,"These include some nervous ticks, very excessive blinking, getting ""jumpy"" when someone made a sudden move close to me, severe acne and extreme constipation."
5536,"For the last one, I even had a colonoscopy performed on me and took various medications/laxatives, but doctors couldn't give me a diagnosis."
5537,"Even worse, in my first year of university I managed to get into my first semi-relationship with a girl."
5538,Being ridiculously inexperienced I panicked when I was losing my virginity and couldn't maintain my erection.
5539,For the next few months the girl and I tried but I simply couldn't get my mind off it.
5540,It was extremely tough as I could be partly aroused but when I went for penetration it would just... go away.
5541,"I went back to the doctor, who prescribed me Cialis and I managed to keep it up long enough two nights."
5542,However I think the emotional baggage of being with someone who needed Cialis was just too much for her so she broke it off.
5543,"So my thoughts as of late have turned to this question; were these symptoms caused by anxiety, or did they help create it?"
5544,"It occurred to me long ago that perhaps constant bloating and nervous ticks made me withdraw myself from social situations, which turned into anxiety."
5545,"But I could just as easily make the argument that I had undiagnosed anxiety, and the doctors were simply attacking the problem from the wrong direction entirely."
5546,"It's sort of a ""which came first, the chicken or the egg"" question."
5547,Just wanted to get the opinions/anecdotes of people in the same situation as me.
5548,Thanks.
5549,I'm looking for some kind of natural medicine that has either a similar effect or a lesser effect of the kind of benzo that you'd take for panic.
5550,"And on top of that, the meds I've been using for the last 8 years?"
5551,"I'm on medication, 50mg of Quetiapine x2 a day, 160mg XR Propranolol, Mirtazepine at night, then some IBS meds as well."
5552,I'm happy to share my previous medication if people are interested.
5553,I have been doing better and want to continue taking the medicine.
5554,Stop telling me I don't need my medication.
5555,"Have you thought of harming yourself daily because the idea of leaving your house and dealing with a job, something that apparently everyone else in the world can deal with without psych meds, therapy and tears, is too much to deal with at least 3 times a week?"
5556,Finally I'd just like to add that from tomorrow I will be starting on some meds.
5557,"I just couldn't imagine after the horror of exams and finishing my first year of law, taking on an internship without medication."
5558,Hello I have just been given medication for my anxiety and the medication has been giving pretty bad side effects while in at work.
5559,I have been told that if my doctor prescribes me medication that's not over the counter then technically I've been diagnosed and must write a note or give me a copy of the notes the doctor has made about me.
5560,Can otc cold meds make derealization worse?
5561,"I'm also hopefully going on medication soon, as my counselor sent some documentation to my Doctor."
5562,She told me that it's medicine and no different than taking a blood pressure pill daily to lower your bp.
5563,He is in therapy and takes medication somewhat regularly.
5564,He added Lamictal to my meds.
5565,"In average situations, I'm typically fine."
5566,"However, things that should be kind of stressful, cause me to either vomit or be nauseous and unable to sleep for days at a time."
5567,"I'm a 24 year old woman, who takes no medications."
5568,"**Examples**:

* Yesterday I was offered a job that I didn't want because the pay was too low."
5569,I knew I had to at least email a response declining the offer.
5570,"I was so nervous about responding, I contemplated taking the job just so I wouldn't have to email them."
5571,"I have only eaten a single granola bar since yesterday afternoon (almost exactly 24 hours ago), when I was offered the job."
5572,"I emailed them my response, and now I feel physically ill.

* When I was younger, I sometimes threw up before performances or sporting events because I was nervous."
5573,"Even though I loved the things I participated in while I did so, beforehand I wanted to cry."
5574,* I started a new job a few months ago.
5575,"During the first week I lost 8 pounds from lack of eating and stress (I'm a 5'9"" female, weighing 140lbs)."
5576,I believe I averaged sleeping between 3-4 hours a night.
5577,* (General) Making phone calls is like being asked to repeatedly stab myself in the eyes.
5578,I want nothing to do with them.
5579,I will sometimes not return phone calls from amazing friends who I love and enjoy talking to in person.
5580,I will sometimes not return phone calls regarding career opportunities.
5581,"When I pick up my phone, I literally have to give myself a pep-talk, and ignore the tightening in my chest, to actually make an important call."
5582,"Sometimes I have to create a reward system, for example: If I call so-and-so, I will eat brownies and ice cream."
5583,"Since I'm giving you my worst, I want to note that I'm not an anxiety ridden mess in all situations."
5584,I can go out with friends or family and have a wonderful time.
5585,I can give public speeches and read out loud with no problems.
5586,"I have coached youth sports (ages 7-17), and get no anxiety whatsoever when dealing with players, parents, or other coaches."
5587,"When I express to others that I get very anxious quite often, they are very surprised."
5588,"Is all of this normal, and I'm just overreacting?"
5589,Is there anything I can do to make things seem less catastrophic to myself?
5590,"**Edit**: 
I guess the purpose of my post is to see if you guys have any tips for me."
5591,"For example, green tea and honey help calm my nerves and curb my nausea."
5592,"Despite my past experience, I waved it off as jitters to the adjustment and tried to forget it since I am on a medicine that worked very well for me."
5593,"It could be a video that will just make you giggle a tiny bit, laughter truly is the best medicine."
5594,"The medication never really helped at all, so these are things I experience at least weekly anyway."
5595,The only difference between on and off the medication is that it is happening all day instead of briefly maybe once or twice a week.
5596,I have been slowly tapering off from Klonopin for about 2 months and feel horrible.
5597,"I've got a mix of easily triggered anxiety, depression and even rationalizing why people commit suicide."
5598,"Throw in some shaking, slow thinking and confusion as well."
5599,I'm a total mess.
5600,My question is this.
5601,Is this withdrawal symptoms or am I just a flawed human being headed to a horrible end.
5602,Are my symptoms the result of a chemical imbalance that is permanent or outside circumstances such as a special needs child and bad marriage?
5603,"Some background

After just ""getting by"" with medications I started to do some research and found that the medications can actually cause the anxiety I was feeling."
5604,"So I decided to confront my anxiety and defeat it OR make life changes (divorce, easier job etc) to get healthy."
5605,I am even willing to let go of luxuries and lead a simpler life.
5606,I am 41(M) yr old male.
5607,I have been taking benzos and anti depressants for about 15 years and it has just about ruined my marriage.
5608,My wife and I are just roommates but we are currently staying for the kids and to avoid the total life upheaval.
5609,We both had affairs which really fucked up things more.
5610,My son has all kinds of mental issues and has been diagnosed on the autistic spectrum.
5611,He is very challenging with heavy disturbing meltdowns.
5612,My job is very stressful.
5613,Sales engineer with crappy company.
5614,Every presentation is one mistake away from being fired.
5615,Yet I have succeeded in almost 4 years here.
5616,Despite this I manage to hold a $150k+ job and raise my 3 kids.
5617,To anybody who does reply know that I am extremely thankful for your help and your thoughts and I am also here to help others who struggle with this condition
5618,"I have never been on medication before, so I think I'll stick to one a day and go from there."
5619,"They said I can't just stop taking the medication without calling my doctor first, but I need this right now for the shit that's going on in my life."
5620,"I was on medication and tranquilizers till my mom begged me to get off of them at 15 and a half, back then I had anxiety with the slightest things."
5621,And what is the point of socialised medicine if it comes to a stop when our outdated monarch has a birthday?
5622,"TLDR; This is going to be too long, so I’ll just say that I am in need of a suggestion for a medication that will reduce my anxiety, increase my focus, and not make me sick or act weird."
5623,and I'm getting the thyroid medication adjusted.
5624,"So bottom line: I'm really scared to take this medication, but I think it would help me in the long run."
5625,The new MD (I just seen her two weeks ago) changed my entire meds around.
5626,"I feel like the medication isn't working, but I'm afraid to come off it."
5627,"I tend to lead a more holistic lifestyle and don't use chemicals in my house and limit my intake of them in my diet, so ingesting these meds, well, to be honest, I think is going to lead to cancer."
5628,I don't plan on stopping the medication without consulting my dr.
5629,I've come off these meds once before and it took me 6 months.
5630,"Anyhow, I feel the meds are killing my marriage and I don't know what to do."
5631,Have any of you had any luck with coming off medication and using more natural remedies?
5632,I've been on prozac for 20 days now and haven't seen much improvement but I know it takes time for some medication to start fully working.
5633,I never take my medication on an empty stomach or eat grapefruit.
5634,"I only took the meds one more night, and called it quits."
5635,"4 days ago I tried taking medication for my problems (citalopram), and I barely made it through a day."
5636,"So I can't take medication, meditation doesn't help, and the therapy doesn't seem to stick with me."
5637,"I have SEVERE anxeity disorder(to the point im thinking of applying for disability)...my husband is going to help me make a weighted blanket and a small tent (dont ask, small spaces help make me feel secure)...we dont have money to pay for a bunch of meds(im already on 4) and I really need some cheap things to help me deal with my attacks....does anyone have any little tricks or tools that are DIY that helps?"
5638,I need meds.
5639,"I'm worried that if I get a prescription for medication, I'll just be seen as a nut job who needs help to live."
5640,"My therapist suggested seeking medication, something I was deathly afraid of."
5641,It was then that I vowed to get medication.
5642,"E told me she would stay with me, as long as I got medication to help my anxiety/anger."
5643,"They refused to give me a medication consult, stating that because I was getting out, they wouldn't be able to monitor the effects properly."
5644,The earliest they could see me for a medication consult was the end of October.
5645,Then I had a break; I got an appointment with a PCM for tomorrow afternoon for a medication consult.
5646,I am quite apprehensive regarding medication since I was on it once and it did nothing and only had bad side effects.
5647,I have heard some horror stories going off this medication from those who were on much higher doses.
5648,"I'll try to keep this brief, but here goes nothing!"
5649,About 9 months ago I smoked weed and had a full blown panic attack.
5650,"I worried about the weed itself, my brain, felt like my brain was melting out of my head leaving me dead inside and permanently damaged, ruined."
5651,My parents put a lot of stock in my future and in my and my sister's intelligence.
5652,Throughout the next few months I couldn't stop thinking about it.
5653,Obsessing over it literally every waking moment.
5654,"Every time I've been exposed to gasoline, petty drug experimentation, the time I got too drunk and passed out, playing the ""pass out"" game as a kid, sniffing a marker when I thought it was a good smelling one and it turned out to be a plain ol' fume-y one -- everything."
5655,"I would obsess and analyze everything, I couldn't read or write without analyzing myself and wondering if I was operating at my full potential, if my brain is functioning correctly, all of that."
5656,This went on for a while.
5657,"I confided in friends and family, was open about it all and went to therapy."
5658,No use really.
5659,"Therapist wasn't the best so I found a new one, still nothing although I feel hopeful (still my current therapist.)"
5660,"I'm prescribed several medications, none of which ever seem to work."
5661,A while later and the relentless anxiety and frequent anxiety attacks are a worse as they've been for nearly 6 months.
5662,"Fed up, I read some advice online and talk to my uncle who's always struggled with this and take the advice I'm given -- ""do things the old you would enjoy."""
5663,"I get an internship on a film set, work a couple freelance film/video jobs as it's something I've always wanted to do and been lucky enough to have ""broken in"" to the industry."
5664,I feel marginally better.
5665,Today I took a ride in my friend's old cadillac convertible.
5666,It was fun at the time and I've since gotten home and broken down.
5667,"The car smelled like gas and some friends joked something along the lines of ""we're probably all getting brain damage right now!"""
5668,"I can't stop googling carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms, contemplating living the rest of my life with brain damage, analyzing everything I've been through, EVERYTHING just as it's been for almost a year now."
5669,I'm supposed to leave tomorrow for another project and I don't know if I can do it.
5670,"Rationally I know I don't have brain damage, it was a fucking convertible for christ sake -- but I can't stop thinking about it."
5671,"I took a nap, dreamt about it."
5672,Woke up and it was the first thing on my mind.
5673,"I guess that wasn't particularly brief... anyway, the point of all of this is I feel alone here."
5674,"I was wondering if anyone else has similar fears or never ending, obsessive thoughts that are this specific."
5675,"I've sort of receded into myself as well, and feel as though I am looking through a glass pane all the time - my vision is worse and my fingers and toes always tingle."
5676,I have frequent headaches and additionally I feel mentally slow.
5677,"These are all symptoms of brain damage, which I've spent way too much of my life googling lately."
5678,"Thanks for reading anyway, I hope this doesn't come off as too whiny or self righteous or anything."
5679,Any replies would be very comforting
5680,For the most part its pretty contained and I'm not on any medication at the moment.
5681,I'm not sure how much the medication is really helping.
5682,I feel like the medication is to blame for that.
5683,So I went the better part of two years with practically no caffeine.
5684,my moods were more stable but I had no motivation.
5685,With out my anxiety I just have depression.
5686,I don't try and achieve my goals I just go to work (most of the time anyway) and go home and sleep.
5687,This week I started drinking caffeine again.
5688,I'm very anxious but I'm achieving things.
5689,I've started back at school(it's been more then a year since I left) and had to host at my home.
5690,I'm excited but the nervousness and anxiety is present as well.
5691,I have goals and plans.
5692,And I made a new friend.
5693,Right now I feel like my lack of motivation is what's ruining my future.
5694,Reintroducing caffeine is helping to combat that.
5695,But I know eventually the anxiety may become too much.
5696,"I've been on Many medications (Zoloft, buspar, lexapro, Xanax, klonopin, welbutrine and some other I can't think of right now) and all they do is calm me down and let me exist."
5697,Lack of motivation is my biggest problem with depression right now and none of these have helped me treat this problem.
5698,I'm not currently on medication.
5699,Anyone's have any thoughts?
5700,"I do smoke marijuana as a medication, and have been for the last 6 months or so."
5701,"I worry now that I'll have issues with my insurance, or have difficulty obtaining medicine in the future that I legitimately need because I was labeled as a drug seeker."
5702,"I'm 21, and I graduated high school in 2013."
5703,"I have suffered from terrible anxiety since I was in 1st Grade, I remember I basically lived in the nurses office."
5704,"I stayed home and commuted to community college for two years, with lots of downs."
5705,"I got out of a nasty relationship, high school sweetheart right before graduation, was depressed for months as she just lead me on over and over again."
5706,"My first semester of college, my grades significantly dropped to the level of academic probation."
5707,"I started to get panic attacks around this time, for over a year I tried different medications."
5708,"I finally brought my grades up completely, GPA up completely this sophomore year of community college after my ex (not the highschool one but one I met my first semester of college, dated for over a year) left me on very bad terms of what she did and I needed to work on myself and trust issues."
5709,If you see my recent post in /r/anxiety my parents don't believe in anxiety issues and they stress everyone out(brothers) so this has caused my anxiety to escalate over the years I've concluded.
5710,So I finally applied and got into a very good college 2 hours from home!
5711,I'm so ready to start something new :)
5712,Face to face is just too much for me to handle while I'm off my meds.
5713,I just can't handle it and don't want to be reliant on medication that makes me slow and stupid.
5714,"My meds are useless, journaling doesnt help, excersize does nothing for me, I'm falling apart and I just don't know what to do."
5715,Seeing a psychiatrist and getting on meds (Zoloft and Klonopin) has been the one MOST EFFECTIVE move in feeling better and being a productive member of society.
5716,Yet I feel generally good being on my meds.
5717,I don't want to go back on meds.
5718,I had a problem with illegal drugs during my first time at university and being on legal meds would bring back some bad memories.
5719,I really don't want to go on medication or anything and am wondering if someone that has gone through the same thing has any advice to better myself.
5720,"But then again, all of this could be psychosomatic and linked to my newfound anxiety and dramatic medicine changes as of late."
5721,"This is the first time in my entire life I've ever been on medication, and it's hard to imagine daily life without it now."
5722,"Sometimes I forgot to take my meds with me, sometimes I would be out entirely and, forgetting to make a Dr.'s appointment in time, would have to wait a few days before replenishing the stock."
5723,"I have a social anxiety and ,despite being on anxiety medication, I will randomly go beet red while talking to people."
5724,"My psychologist wants to put me on meds, but I've seen anti-anxiety meds do some pretty bad stuff to people."
5725,How has everyone coped with being on meds at work?
5726,I am just wondering whether I will be ok taking meds and working at the same time.
5727,"Since then, my doc put me on some strong anti-anxiety meds, and it seems most of my secondary symptoms have disappeared."
5728,"I was diagnosed with GAD my freshman year of college (~4 years ago), and since then I have been on 4 different medications."
5729,I've noticed that my ability to focus and excel in academics has dramatically decreased and I was wondering if anyone else has any tips on how to feel more motivated and start getting shit done.
5730,My doctor says that my studies are causing a portion of the anxiety and that I'm peripheralizing it to avoid it.
5731,"And by doing this, I *feel* like I'm getting things done, but when it comes time to use what I think that I've learned I draw a blank."
5732,"I read somewhere that magnesium supplements are supposed to help with focus, but is it even common to have such a lack of motivation with GAD?"
5733,I'm still mustering up the courage to see a therapist (my first experience was not great).
5734,Any help would be phenomenal.
5735,Thank you.
5736,I have had a few friends give me some anxiety meds when things have been really bad.
5737,"Should I be generic when discussing meds and say something like I've taken this before, and it didn't work but this other one did?"
5738,"Before I get blasted, yes I know the dangers in taking other people's medicine, but the risk outweighed the benefits."
5739,"And yes I was taking expired meds, but again, risk vs benefit."
5740,I was constantly in a state of anxiety and had constant panic attacks to the point that I got a therapist and began medication.
5741,I'm never too sure if the anxiety went away because I ended and completely cut off the relationship or if it was the medication.
5742,"I've tried medication, but the first pill they gave me (mirtazapine) possibly made my symptoms worse, and i was puking every morning."
5743,I haven't been able to get myself to stick with any medication since.
5744,After considering everything he suggested I might have General Anxiety Disorder but said medication wouldn't be his recommendation at this time.
5745,I dont want to see a doctor because i dont want to be prescribed meds.
5746,"I will start my medication tomorrow (10mg, 30 count, once a day), and am curious if I am able to have a beer or two while on the medication."
5747,"Now I am no asking if I can down my pill with a beer, but if I take my medication in the morning, can a have a few beers at the brewery in the evening?"
5748,Or is this one of those drugs that must be taken everyday for the the medication to continue working?
5749,"I'm having anxiety over a medical situation where my current doctor wants me to go on some serious meds for Crohn's (a biologic) and I'm not sure they're the right choice, but he is insistent."
5750,He won't give me any other options and he's making it seem like I need to do something RIGHT NOW even though I know it shouldn't be as urgent as all that.
5751,I'm terrified of biologics so I'm getting anxiety from both sides on this.
5752,I called up another doctor today to make an appt for a second opinion because I'm tired of feeling strong armed by my current doctor.
5753,"However, I am worried that by delaying this strong treatment I might be putting myself at risk for further damage (just a few weeks but still - this doctor has me freaking out.)"
5754,I am also anxious that the office won't approve any further prescriptions while I get the second opinion.
5755,It's just all freaking me out.
5756,On top of that I haven't been to a dentist or eye doctor for a long while because of the anxiety I feel picking out a doctor (I don't want to pick the wrong one and feel stuck like I do now) and even making the phone call is difficult.
5757,:T I have put off finding a dentist or eye doctor for over two years.
5758,"Medical stuff gives me heavy anxiety because I don't want to mess up or find out something isn't covered by my insurance, and on top of that I don't want to make the wrong decision about what medicines to take."
5759,I finished up the last year of college with no counseling or meds.
5760,It has seemed to get even worse lately since I got on these meds.
5761,"Men there's more to it but it sucks ,hopefully I here back from hem tomorrow cause I only got 30 days of meds left"
5762,"It's 2:30am (really 3:30am GRRR time change), and I took my meds on time (anti-thyroid pill, beta blocker, xanax, ambien, plus an antibiotic for abscessed tooth), went to bed."
5763,When this medication after 6 or so months failed to do anything I was put on Effexor.
5764,"Now I should note that I did not have a family doctor at this time, I was perscribed these meds from a clinnic physcian, and eventually I stopped taking the effexor and only took the klonopin when needed."
5765,"I've been taking lexapro for around 4 months now, it has been the most effective medication i've taken for my anxiety but the worst side effect is anorgasmia, decreased sex drive and just a general disconnection with my sexuality."
5766,So ever since my doctor and I changed my meds (lowered my level of lithium and increased my abilify) my anxiety has gone through the roof.
5767,What is frustrating is that we can't just change the meds back because the reason we had to change them was a tremor related to the lithium so I feel kind of stuck.
5768,This time I'm willing to try medication.
5769,More or less I didn't want to become a zombie like some people said happened once people were put on meds.
5770,"But now that I see that my depression isn't going anywhere but instead manifesting itself into other horrors, maybe medication is the right route to take."
5771,Hey folks.
5772,I have physical anxiety.
5773,"For the past few months it had been almost non-existent, but it's back in force again after a panic attack I had last week."
5774,"My body is out of equilibrium, which has caused a lot of episodes of panic, as well as extreme fatigue, brain fog, wanting to cry my eyes out, etc."
5775,"I've overcome this once before, though, without medications."
5776,"In fact, I was prescribed Hydroxyzine today, took 5 mg and felt even more brain fog and nervousness."
5777,"I snapped out of it, but the symptoms are still lingering."
5778,"I feel compelled to share what helped me get through this last time, because this time I was too quick to jump to meds."
5779,-- Try to help solve someone else's problem: The worst times of anxiety are when you feel like you can't escape your own head.
5780,The entire universe feels like it exists between your ears--that's the number one way I'll describe it with people.
5781,"If you have a friend you think is going through something, talk to them."
5782,"Not only do you distract your brain from anxiety, but you also feel good and sharp."
5783,-- Do something creative: Graphic design was always my niche.
5784,Whenever I'm doodling my mind relaxes and focuses.
5785,"Just like with talking to people, whenever you can do something highly functional with your own mind, you realize how much of it is still really there."
5786,"Sometimes I'll do this for hours, and the results make me so proud that I get focused on that--not my anxiety."
5787,-- DO NOT GOOGLE YOUR SYMPTOMS: I cannot stress this enough.
5788,The first few things that will pop up on any google search are usually worst-case scenarios.
5789,"When I first had anxiety I had neck and head pressure, scalp burning, vertigo, diziness, panic attacks, etc."
5790,The first thing that came up on Google search was some guy thinking he had some unknown disease...he let it ruin his life.
5791,Every.
5792,Symptom.
5793,I had.
5794,I freaked the fuck out.
5795,"Turns out, these people are simply hypochondriacs who have failed to deal with their problems constructively."
5796,You can convince yourself of having anything if you try hard enough.
5797,"Nothing is more reassuring than seeing a medical professional and having them simply smile at you sand say, ""You've got anxiety."
5798,"It's tough, but it's not the end of the world."
5799,"Stay calm."""
5800,Whenever I feel compelled to google my symptoms I remind myself of how my doctors have shared laughs with me during discussions--reassuring that what I have is temporary and can be dealt with.
5801,-- Talk to yourself.
5802,Or be funny: I've been blessed with a pretty joking personality.
5803,"A lot of times, if I'm driving and feeling anxious, I'll just start making really stupid, ambiguous noises."
5804,"Ironic, because it would appear to the people on the outside that I'm losing my mind, but in the end it helps me remind myself I'm still here."
5805,-- Exercise: One of the best things I ever did was start a daily walk/jog up and down the mountain next to my house.
5806,Giving your body somewhere else to dispose of energy makes a huge difference!
5807,"-- Eat right: Tuna, blue berries, bananas, non-fried chicken, rice, cereals and trail mix."
5808,Chocolate is actually decent too.
5809,Avoid excess caffeine.
5810,"-- Whatever anyone says, don't drink or smoke: This may be controversial, but both of my bad anxiety episodes were sparked by substance abuse."
5811,"First it was alcohol, then it was marijauna."
5812,Both caused panic attacks for me.
5813,-- Sleep schedule!
5814,-- Herbal tea: Kava seems to help my body relax at night.
5815,-- Sing: I do karaoke twice a week.
5816,"When I do karaoke, my anxiety is gone."
5817,"Singing is fun, and again helps get the mind out of the funky zone."
5818,-- Talk to friends about it.
5819,Get your anxiety in the open.
5820,"Not being open about your anxiety can actually make you feel more stuck in your own head, which causes more stress."
5821,"-- Remember, you're fine."
5822,There's a lot of people out there who have terminal diseases.
5823,Yours is not one of them.
5824,I've tried meds before.
5825,Is there really a medication out there that won't give me these side effects?
5826,I am seeing multiple therapists and doctors and am on meds but it just isn't getting better.
5827,"I've done a lot of research and I thought I had social anxiety, driving anxiety, I thought I was a hypochondriac, I thought I had claustrophobia, I always think if I've drank the night before that I'm having alcohol withdrawals or I'm super unhealthy, that my ADHD medication is the reason for anxiousness (even though it's never ever been a problem in my 10 years of being on it)... but because I've thought ALL of those things and I relate to each and every single one of those and I know it's unlikely it's ALL of them, I've discovered that it might just be more specific than that."
5828,"Up until that point, I was SUPER against taking medication, but things were getting out of control (clearly) and just therapy wasn't working."
5829,"During that period where I went off my medication, I was also not in therapy at all, and I ended up going to the walk in crisis centre as I was having anxiety attacks and the heart palpitations were coming back and I was feeling suicidal."
5830,"I had to go through my whole history and everything with him, which was rough, and then when we talked about medication, he thought that I should switch mediations because I can't even take the typical dosage (60mg) without side effects, and thought I was still experiencing a lot of anxiety."
5831,I'm so scared to switch meds and have horrible side effects again and do poorly at my job that I LOVE and get fired or something.
5832,":) 

**TL;DR: Have OCD, social phobia and depression, don't like having to take medication."
5833,"New psychiatrist wants to switch me to new meds, usually starts with Zoloft and clomipramine."
5834,After that I went to a clinic and began medicine management.
5835,"I haven't had a full panic attack since I started taking benzos, but I still feel it and I am wondering if my medication should be changed; if I possibly have epilepsy."
5836,He put me on other anti anxiety meds that just make me feel blank and nonfunctional.
5837,"I took medication back in my early middle school days for like a month, then I tried a few therapists since then and I didn't really like it at all."
5838,Not on any medication but it is getting worse.
5839,"**BACKGROUND INFO:** I never had this problem before 4 months ago, and my anxiety was always under control with medicine, in fact it was so under control that I elected to go off my meds in February."
5840,"I was doing fantastic, the side effects from my meds were gone (insomnia/rest issues, sexual frustration, teeth clenching)."
5841,I lived in pure bliss for 2 months not having to worry about taking medicine every morning.
5842,"I elected to go back on my meds to see if the sickness/anxiety would stop returning, and I havent been on bed rest since."
5843,"I'm on medication for depression and my general day-to-day anxiety: I take 150mg venlafaxine daily, and I have prescriptions for both hydroxyzine (25 mg) and clonazepam (0.5 mg)."
5844,"On top of all my worries about air travel, I'm also worried that the medication won't work and I'll be stuck in a metal tube for over 4 hours each way uncontrollably weeping and shaking."
5845,"To make a long story short, I hit bottom."
5846,"If you've read my submission history, you probably know that I've struggled with benzo dependence (specifically, klonopin) and anxiety."
5847,"Over the last few months or so I've found myself feeling worse and worse, and so my list of medications got longer and longer."
5848,"Effexor, klonopin, ambien, remeron, and wellbutrin, all at the same time, plus a variety of vitamins and probiotics to help with some of my anxiety-induced physical symptoms."
5849,"In all, I've been downing more than 15 pills every morning and another half dozen or so at night."
5850,"It was the wellbutrin that did me in, though."
5851,"When we added that, everything *really* went to shit."
5852,It was like my life was suddenly on 1000x fast forward.
5853,I literally could not hold down a thought to save my life.
5854,"I was having hand tremors (still am even after a while off of it) and tension and low blood pressure (especially orthostatic), and all in all, was feeling by far the worst I'd ever felt, including before I started taking meds."
5855,So I decided.
5856,No more.
5857,I'm pushing reset.
5858,After nearly a year of these treatments I'm only feeling worse.
5859,So a couple of days ago I began the taper.
5860,"I dropped the wellbutrin like it was hot, cut the remeron in half, and dropped to 0.375mg of klonopin per day (from 0.75mg)."
5861,"I've got like 3 ambien left which I'm not going to use, and I'm waiting a few days before I start reducing the effexor."
5862,"I'm already noticing the withdrawal effects... hand shaking, occasional full-body ""nerve twitches"" (dunno how to describe that, really), tension, insomnia, and of course, anxiety for days."
5863,But I'm hoping it will be worth it.
5864,"I mean, I can't just go on doing the same thing because it's easy if it's not helping, right?"
5865,Rabble rabble definition of insanity?
5866,I don't know.
5867,"I'm just trying to hold it together, and taking a fistful of pills every day hasn't been making it any easier."
5868,This is my life.
5869,I'm currently on medication to raise my blood pressure and I often drink Gatorade (which supposedly has a lot of sodium in it).
5870,"Ever since the New Yorkers' piece on ""the big one"" I haven't been able to sleep without medication (ZQuill)."
5871,"My doctor recommended medication, but I never took it."
5872,I’ve been afraid of going on medication for fear of them judging me or calling me weak for taking medication.
5873,Times like this are when I wish I had some emergency anxiety meds.
5874,"Tomorrow is biochemistry, thursday is A&amp;P.

[spoiler]This was my first semester on medication for my mild depression/anxiety."
5875,I have just started with a new doctor and I am a little underwhelmed at how the PA is with moderating me on these potentially dangerous meds.
5876,"Hi everyone,

I'm on sleepy allergy meds right now so my writing is not the best."
5877,Scared to take meds that will make me not scared.
5878,He recently went to talk to a professional and was referred to another doctor for medication.
5879,He says he does not want to take any medication and believes therapy will not help him.
5880,"Quick Backstory:

I have suffered from anxiety since I was a little girl."
5881,My first recollection of it being separation anxiety from my mother when I was in the 1st grade.
5882,"I later developed anxiety paired with emetophobia, which was then handled with anti-anxiety medications (I've been on them since I was 10/11, and I am now 27.)"
5883,"I then developed a nasty case of GAD towards the end of college, and throughout the first year or so post-college (primarily brought on by fear of failure outside of the college environment, etc.)"
5884,This was the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013 that the GAD really hit me hard.
5885,I recently made the decision to completely eliminate all caffeine from my diet.
5886,"I did it very carefully and gradually, until I no longer was consuming any caffeine at all."
5887,"It has been around a month now, and I have noticed a very positive influence on my overall anxiety levels."
5888,"Things that would have triggered me before, do not affect me now."
5889,"I still have my moments of feeling stressed out, but they are not long lasting like the symptoms of GAD were."
5890,"I am still taking my anti-anxiety medication, but I am honestly wondering if there is a link between Caffeine and anxiety."
5891,Has anyone else noticed a similar effect?
5892,"My mom spoke to them about it, and they said I should give group therapy a few weeks and in the end medication is an option."
5893,"I'm not going to go in and have someone stare at me like I'm crazy and say, ""Well, I'm not a doctor, and I can't give you medication, but I am a counselor and can help with talk therapy so lets try..."" again."
5894,"It gets in the way of so much I want to do, and even on medication and seeing a therapist, it's a steep, uphill battle."
5895,"I feel like a total shit putting someone on the spot to ask them for meds because I realize I risk making them feel ashamed or inadequate if they don't think they can part with them, and also that it is just rude in general, but I'm desperate to avoid a complete meltdown."
5896,"I tried soo many things, from meditation, counseling, medication, and self-help."
5897,I take medication for my ADD.
5898,However with therapy and medication it's gotten much better and these sorts of attacks are very rare for me now.
5899,"I'm wondering if maybe it's a mix of anxiety and depression (I have both), or maybe a strange coping mechanism, or just the effects of my medicine."
5900,"** My doctor says I need a psychologist or counsellor to work through my issues, and that medicine only helps so much, which I agree."
5901,I feel like my mind is for once completely silent.
5902,It feels like the feelings are coming in waves over my body.
5903,"I run a hand over my arm to remind myself it's mine, then a wave hits, and I feel like I'm not connected to my body, somehow?"
5904,"Also, I do small things like adjust the covers or pillow right in front of my face, but it doesn't seem like it's me doing it, even though I can see my hand moving."
5905,I've never had a reaction to Ativan or anything like this.
5906,"I think the problem being I'm a bit sick and wonky from other medicines, and this is the first time I've taken Ativan in a week and a half."
5907,Has anyone else had a similar experience?
5908,Can this feeling be mimicked somehow?
5909,I don't mind feeling dissociative (I'm not sure the proper term to describe it) but also so far removed from myself that I feel like I could do anything without anxiety getting to me.
5910,"I could have a job, I could go to classes, I wouldn't be terrified."
5911,I like this feeling and would gladly take it over feeling trapped in my body as I usually do.
5912,"I'm vaguely sad because I know this feeling will leave, and it is so preferable to my usual mess."
5913,"If there's a better subred for this, please let me know."
5914,I just thought this might be a good place for anxiety medicine related questions.
5915,"I don't want to take any meds, i feel like this ""thing"" can go away without them, any adivce?"
5916,With therapy and medicine I managed to pick everything back up and felt really stable.
5917,I googled and some websites said that certain vitamins can affect how the medicine works.
5918,"Tried numerous calming techniques, medication, breathing exercises, which helped the symptoms but not the cause."
5919,I've been taking a low dose of Celexa for a year or two now and have lowered my dosage or stopped taking it altogether two separate times.
5920,I feel so silly!
5921,"Once I start to feel less anxious on medication, I start hating the side effects I get (constantly tired, emotionally numb, can't orgasm) so I try weaning myself off the meds."
5922,"And of course, each time I get more anxious and have panic attacks all over again."
5923,"It's like when I'm anxious, I forget what it's like to feel normal, and when I feel normal, I forget what it's like to have a panic attack."
5924,"I'm not really looking for advice, I know now to stay on my medication, just venting I guess."
5925,"I've tried different medications (wellbutrin, zoloft, prozac) but celexa works the best."
5926,"I might try lexapro in the upcoming months, who knows."
5927,"Stupid brain chemicals, y u no function naturally?"
5928,!
5929,"I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in a couple of weeks, and I'm going to talk to her about trying something new with medication."
5930,And what if I can't find a doctor to prescribe me medication for when a panic attack comes on?
5931,"Since I'm under 18 (16), my therapist said I couldn't get the whole dosage, otherwise it would cause problems with my other meds and my body especially."
5932,"Here I am waking up to a terrible panic attack despite great access to regular therapy, medication and working out."
5933,I should take medication daily.
5934,Im not sure whether to post this in r/anxiety or r/jobs but I thought I would try here.
5935,I am 6 months into a job and in the process of getting coverted to permanent.
5936,"I won't have health insurance for another month and so I can't get therapy, which I desperately need, until then."
5937,I thought I would ask for help here though to get me through this next month so I don't lose my job due to not being able to afford therapy.
5938,I have pretty serious anxiety and all medicines I have tried just knock me out cold.
5939,This particular issue revolves around me being extremely anxious about losing my job and feeling like a failure.
5940,I owe well over 100 K in student loans and less than half is federal.
5941,If I lost my job I would literally be screwed and would have to make payments of 750 a month (federal would go into hardship based deferment) and if I couldn't then my cosigner (my mom) would be on the hook and she can't afford that.
5942,"My debt looms over me like a mountain, making me feel like I literally am dependent on this one job (same kind of feeling as thinking you are dependent on a relationship)."
5943,I constantly feel the need to seek reassurance that I won't be fired and that my transition to permanent is still going to happen.
5944,The problem is this work place is very stressful.
5945,"Everyone here acknowledges is to the point where in interviews they specifically look for whether the person seems like they ""would be eaten alive by this place""."
5946,I don't have very good coping skills to deal with the stress.
5947,Its a lab job where we do experiments for clients and so mistakes are frowned upon severly.
5948,This is my first job out of grad school and to be honest I have really struggled with learning how to be a good worker.
5949,I feel immense pressure to be perfect in everything I do because we are yelled at any time we make a mistake.
5950,"I don't feel like my training is up to where it needs to be, but I can't tell them beucase my transition to permanent is dependent on them knowing that I can do my job."
5951,So everytime I go to do an experiment I feel immense anxiety that I will fail.
5952,"I also honestly don't think I have the personality or traits to do well in science, and I have been trying to leave for a while but I can't seem to break into another field becuase literally all of my experience is in science."
5953,"I am not a very careful person, adn I probably have ADD."
5954,Science requires extreme focus and precision and while I have definitely learned to be better these things don't come naturally to me.
5955,This stress and lack of self confidence has gotten to the point where I literally feel like I can't do anything right.
5956,I feel like a total failure that I struggled so much at this job.
5957,Im 27 years old and I was in school basically until I was 26 and I was great at school but I feel like I suck at work.
5958,"Most people get transitioned onto permanent after 2 months, but they made me wait longer becuase they were concerned about my performance :(
To make matters worse my body seems to have shut down due to stress."
5959,I have had terrible IBS (probably due to stress and poor diet beucase I have been self medicating with food) and have been forced to take several unpaid days off of work.
5960,My boss knows its due to stress and has expressed concern in the past that I can't handle this job.
5961,Im worried they are going to fire me over this or over the mistakes that I have made (I made about 3 separate mistakes in the past week.
5962,"I don't usually make nearly that many and in fact was improving a lot, but the pressure got to me)

I need help."
5963,I need either coping skills or someone to just listen or tell me about how they managed to get through a tough job situation with anxiety.
5964,I'm on meds and am in therapy now.
5965,I hate being on meds.
5966,I've never been put on medication before and i have no idea what to expect but i talk to the psychiatrist in 2 weeks.
5967,This only started happening recently which tells me it may be medication related?
5968,"I have no medication, this is a throwaway account."
5969,Should I ask my doctor about increasing my meds or adding any?
5970,"I feel fine now, and i'm going to look for a psychiatrist and get some meds, but does anyone have any advice at all on how to cope?"
5971,"I take medication and do everything I can to fix this, and I've grown OUTSTANDINGLY in the past year!"
5972,"I wrote this about ten years ago for my website, which was pretty popular for a few years, but nobody visits it anymore."
5973,"I liked to read it when I was feeling like nobody ever ""got me"", and it made me laugh."
5974,Most of these were submitted by people who visited my website.

6178,"I have no experience with medication, and all the information I have looked up has been too general for me to get a full understanding on what to expect."
6179,I've never really felt that I absolutely needed it and just kind of based on some of the feedback I got here when I was first prescribed medicine for anxiety I felt that it would be best if I could just avoid using xanax altogether.
6180,Or is my medicine not working?
6181,"I've never taken much medication besides antibiotics, birth control or cannabis (for IC)."
6182,"General info: Female, 20, not on medication."
6183,"At the time, I didn't remember that I had a friend with an anxiety disorder that had taken his medication (Valium) at my house."
6184,I'm scheduled to go see a psychiatrist to get medication.
6185,Fired my old medication doctor and went to my first appointment with my new medication doctor.
6186,"My 15 year old developed social anxiety last year, which led to depression."
6187,He stopped attending 9th grade last November.
6188,"It took a while to get the right fit of counselors and medications, but he was finally put on Zoloft which lifted him out of his depression."
6189,"He did a bit of home/hospital study at the end of last school year, but basically his 9th grade was lost."
6190,We don't know what triggered his anxiety.
6191,"Agoraphobia is probably part of it, now."
6192,"He is his usual self in the house, but it is almost impossible to get him out to exercise or go to restaurants for dinner, etc."
6193,"10th grade just started, and he was really excited and nervous to try to go back (he now has an IEP with accomodations) but the minute we pulled to the curb and he saw all the students milling around, he froze and withdrew into himself, like he used to when he was at his worst."
6194,"He talks to his friends while playing on the Xbox, and they try to encourage him in their way, and he is very upfront about what's going on, and always positive about going back to school, but he is unable to do it when the moment comes."
6195,I don't know what to do.
6196,His once a week therapy doesn't seem to have done much so far (4 months in).
6197,"He'll be doing Home/hospital study if this keeps up which means that tutors come to the house, but how can that help him if he is isolated?"
6198,"I don't know how far to push him, because sometimes I don't think he pushes himself enough but I don't want to traumatize him any further."
6199,"I've started to wonder if there is some kind of therapeutic boarding schools, where he would get intensive treatment AND his education?"
6200,"The stories and comments I have read on this board all come from people who have dealt with social anxiety, but have managed to get through high school."
6201,Does anybody have experience with what my son is going through?
6202,I'm already terrified to start taking the medication.
6203,I have been having pretty rough patches of anxiety on and off for the past few months and my therapist suggested I make an appointment with a psychiatrist to talk about medication.
6204,I really do not want to be on medication for an extended amount of time.
6205,I actually don't want to take medication much at all...but I have been seeing limited progress with my therapist (we are speaking tomorrow to discuss a new plan of action or the possibility of me finding a new therapist) and there have been enough times lately where I am non-functioning enough that I kinda relented and decided to consider it.
6206,Doctor suggested three meds...and right now I've been prescribed 30mg of Cymbalta for 7 days then I am to up the dosage to 60mgs.
6207,"I am already worried about getting off the medication before I've even started taking it, though...especially since the withdrawl symptoms seems to be pretty severe."
6208,I've just started other medication (Gabapentin) a few days ago for the nerve pain and I'm hoping that ends up helping with the disc pain.
6209,I've been on medication for depression for around 6 months.
6210,"So,

Have any of you quit Elavil/Amitriptyline before and did you notice a big change after you stopped, or would you say it was more of a therapeutic medicine which facilitated in your journey to not being controlled by your anxiety?"
6211,I think I worry that I'll just continue to be dismissed and given medicine that at the end of the day doesn't help me.
6212,I'm a college-aged female with Generalized Anxiety Disorder currently without any medication.
6213,"I don't know if this helps at all, but I take Cymbalta (90mg) and I also have a prescription for a very low dose of Ativan, which I rarely use- I don't like to feel like I am taking too much medication."
6214,I've been diagnosed with GAD and depression and take medication for anxiety and stuff.
6215,Im kind of embarrassed by my problem.
6216,I have had GAD for almost 4 years.
6217,I have tried a lot of different medications.
6218,"After years of feeling grey, I decided to just go on Ativan for emergencies."
6219,Now I am 22 and live in Russia (originally from Canada) where they don't have good mental health support.
6220,Now for the embarrassing part.
6221,I have EXTREME sexual anxiety.
6222,I fear having sex and the thought of it gives me a panic attack.
6223,I have met a nice guy and we fool around but I freak out and after he leaves I get REALLY bad panic attacks.
6224,Anyone else have a similar problem or know mental techniques to calm down?
6225,I'm thinking about all the panic attacks I will get and all the medication I won't be able to afford.
6226,"I'm going to the doc in a few days to be put back on some meds again, it's at the point where it affects my job and willingness to just go outside even if it's just for a walk."
6227,So does anyone know of medicine where it replicates the anxiety removal effects of said shrooms and speed without the trippyness?
6228,Another checkup is scheduled in 3 weeks to see if the meds have also helped with the ADD since a lot of the symptoms overlap for both conditions.
6229,I'm a student pharmacist soon to become a licensed pharmacist.
6230,I deal with pretty bad anxiety myself and have had major depressive disorder in the past.
6231,"Right now, my anxiety is so bad that my heart hurts and I'm having dizziness and palpitations."
6232,"Despite my personal dealings with these disorders, I struggle with counseling patients on anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medications."
6233,"I tell patients the side effects and how long before they can expect to feel better but most of the time, the patient doesn't want to talk to me."
6234,"For the most part, they just want to pick-up their medication and leave."
6235,What can I do to help people feel more at ease when it comes to these medications and conditions?
6236,What would you like your pharmacist do?
6237,Do you feel judged at the pharmacy?
6238,How do you feel when I ask you if you're taking your medications every day?
6239,Is it okay if I ask you how your medication is working for you?
6240,How can I get more honest answers?
6241,Or should I really just let people go without talking about it?
6242,I am 22 and currently taking medication for depression/ anxiety (escitalopram/cipralex.)
6243,"I'm doing everything I can to stay relaxed and healthy (therapy, medication, etc."
6244,"And he gave me my anti-anxiety medication no problem, so certainly he would understand me not exactly wanting to go out and get a pap."
6245,"I recently went to a psychiatrist to see if I could find any medication that would work for me, since over the past few years I've tried zoloft/lexapro and xanax which neither really did anything for me minus the xanax.. and recently been taking way too much of that because I started a new position at work a few weeks ago and my panic attacks are pretty frequent."
6246,He asked me if I wanted to get on any meds but I said no.
6247,He always is taking new medication which makes him over weight and fucks up his skin with stretch marks and pimples.
6248,I took some medication and I got help from different people and things were working fine for me.
6249,I'm not on any medication anymore (I used to take prozac but stopped because it caused sexual dysfuntion).
6250,"This is my first time posting here, so bear with me."
6251,I got engaged to the wonderful love of my life on Christmas night and I cannot explain how happy I am.
6252,I'm also extremely overwhelmed.
6253,I have always dealt with near crippling anxiety since I was a little girl.
6254,"I never spoke to anyone but family until I was about 6 y/o, I cried at school because I was homesick/overwhelmed by school frequently until about 8-9th grade, some of 10th."
6255,I don't have a lot of close friends because I wasn't good at keeping up with them because it was scary sometimes to have friends (having close friends means you have something to lose D: ).
6256,I now have to wait a year to apply to grad school because I waited too long to apply.
6257,"When something (like grad school) is scary to me, I just ignore it, and now I am paying the price."
6258,My fiance has helped me immensely to get out of my comfort zone and I'm now graduating college this year!
6259,It's exciting but SO scary.
6260,Everything has hit me now that we're getting married.
6261,"I hate making my parents sad that I'm growing up, so then it makes me sad."
6262,Growing up is terrifying and it's just bringing up old things that I worry about.
6263,"Just the other night, I was upset because I was thinking ""what if something happens to my fiance?"
6264,What would I do?
6265,I would be LOST.
6266,"What if something happens to me where I'm horribly disfigured and he never loves me the same?"""
6267,And it just spirals from there and I make myself physically sick from worry.
6268,"All in all, there are a lot of unknowns in my life right now and my emotions and anxiety are REALLY getting the best of me."
6269,"I'm seriously considering therapy and getting on a new medication (currently taking sertraline, which is zoloft ?)"
6270,before I lose my mind.
6271,I need internet hugs and maybe thoughts on peoples different experiences on different medications.
6272,Before i was put on Lexapro and Ativan to control my anxiety and panic attacks there was one symptom that drove me nuts and that was the crazy fast heart beat.
6273,But now that i am taking those medications the fast heart beat really isn't there anymore when i have the attacks.
6274,Now when i am in the middle of an attack and go to check my heart it feels like it is hardly beating.
6275,"I don't get it, first i was afraid that i was going to pass out because my heart was beating too fast, now i'm afraid that i'm going to pass out because its beating too slow."
6276,Have any of you experienced this?
6277,If so i would gladly like to hear any tips on how to manage it.
6278,"I'm hopeful of this option, as I feel I could get a lot better if I invested some time with competently-guided CBT or perhaps medication."
6279,"Ive had quite a few things happen lately that are my major triggers for anxiety and i expected more panic attacks, upped my medicine, etc."
6280,I finally took the leap to get medication for the anxiety from my GP.
6281,"Also do this medication ""correct a chemical imbalance"" or is it just suppressing anxiety symptoms(while I take the medication and things go back to like they were before the meds)?"
6282,"I have a stressful job, so I'm not sure if it's from the meds or my mind racing all of the time about work things."
6283,"This became sort of a mega-thread covering a bunch of topics, I'll likely repost in the future addressing each thing individually :)

**Quick bio**:

* I'm a 20-something year old male."
6284,"* I'm a student in college, it's all I do."
6285,"-----

**Preemptive tl;dr**:

About 1.5 years ago I began attempting to treat my depression/anxiety."
6286,"So far I've done trials for 5 different medications, each one has failed."
6287,"I don't even notice I'm taking the medication, I feel absolutely no different in any way."
6288,I'm unsure if I'm somehow going about this wrong.
6289,"The largest source of my anxiety is school, I'm extremely scared of homework."
6290,"-----

-----

###Story

So far, every medication I've tried has been an utter failure."
6291,"These medications are:

* Effexor
* Zoloft
* Xanax
* Prozac
* Lexapro

I took the maximum allowed dosage for each."
6292,"I exercise (though not currently, I'll start up again next month), used to take vitamins B and D (no longer bother to since I saw no difference after a year of use), and have been taking care to eat meals around the same times every day (as per direction of my doctor, I guess somehow irregularity of meals causes depressed moods)."
6293,I wouldn't be so angry if I at least felt *something* when I took these medications.
6294,"At no time during any of my 5 trials could I even tell I was taking the medication, it felt the exact same when I was taking the medication as when I wasn't."
6295,"To test this, when I was supposed to transition off of a few of the medications, I didn't bother to taper off; instead, I went from taking the maximum dosage one day to not taking any from the next day on - I noticed nothing."
6296,"I don't understand what I'm doing wrong - I would think that I would at least feel *something*; I'm not expecting anything dramatic, I just expected to feel something."
6297,"There were some side-effects, though, mostly related to sleep."
6298,"Some of the medications made me very slightly more sleepy throughout the day (which was really bad given that this is actually the largest reason I was seeking help in the first place), but also probably the worst side-effect was intensifying my RLS to the point that I couldn't control my leg movement when I laid down and wouldn't be able to sleep for days."
6299,So I guess I sort of lied... the only effect I've had so far are side-effects.
6300,"-----

###Questions

*I guess I have some questions that have been on my mind for a while*:

* What if I'm actually not depressed/anxious?"
6301,Is this the reason the medications have no effect on me?
6302,**Would someone who's not depressed/anxious notice any effects from taking medication?
6303,"**

* I notice that when I'm in a social situation/around people that my depression and anxiety are completely gone (for this reason I definitely want to get a job this summer)."
6304,"Is this normal for people with depression/anxiety that being around people makes it go away, or is it always present for you at the same degree?"
6305,* I'll be honest.
6306,"Sure, my depression sucks, but it's something I can live with."
6307,I can't live with my anxiety - it's screwing up my school grades and thus my life.
6308,"Should I ask my doctor to only prescribe medication for anxiety only, ignoring my depression until later?"
6309,"-----

###Goals

My goals with treating my depression/anxiety are as follows:

* Be able to take on my homework without overwhelming anxiety."
6310,"I used to be a straight-A student, now I'm averaging at least one failed class per semester because I'll go days/weeks where I can't motivate myself to even open my school bag while I sit in a chair/lay in bed panicking."
6311,Homework has always been extremely scary to me...
6312,"I have phobias that don't even compare to how scared I am when I encounter homework (and unfortunately homework is a fear I have to face every single fucking day)... but at least when I was younger I could convince myself (after several hours) to just do it, now I can't, something about me changed."
6313,* Obtain the ability to be interested in things again.
6314,I haven't had a single interest since middle school; all I do is school and sleep/eat.
6315,* No longer feel tired throughout the day.
6316,"-----

I covered a lot in this post."
6317,"A lot of it is just backstory/thoughts, hopefully it doesn't detract from my overall question about what I should be feeling/expecting when taking medication."
6318,Thanks for any help/wisdom.
6319,Feel free to ask any questions :)
6320,Well I've been reading a lot and I start to get scared of continuing with the meds.
6321,I'm not depressed and I'm getting the meds thanks for anxiety and being able to eat solid food because I'm scared of choking.
6322,I can handle a week of this I guess but then I read about how hard it is to withdraw from the meds once you're on them and that you will feel like shit and it's the worst feeling you can experience.
6323,"Hah, worried my anxiety meds won't work, I just realized how cliche that is."
6324,And I will really really give these meds a shot.
6325,"I was doing so well on medicine, I don't know what changed."
6326,"So ideally, my pain would get better thanks to other treatments and I could also figure out to deal with my inhibitions and social anxiety without meds."
6327,My doctor just upped my Xanax to .5mg as I start work for the summer.
6328,"He said if it gets to the point where I'm constantly anxious during the day, he would give me a longer lasting medication."
6329,Any ideas what this medication would be?
6330,"And for those who take medications at work, what do you take and how do they work?"
6331,"I went to a Family Doctor, and she gave me some medication that helps when I have the ""feel like dying"" panic attacks."
6332,The Dr. tried finding me a cardiologist and a psychiatrist (or psychologist)- one that proscribes medication; that are within my medical network.
6333,"As a disclaimer, I don't want to say that medication is bad."
6334,I've been in a place where I had no other choice but to use medication.
6335,"I began taking medication in March and started seeing my therapist regularly, which allowed me to do ""normal"" things again."
6336,The psychiatrist switched my meds from Celexa to Pristiq and I've had three sessions of talk therapy for 45 minutes each.
6337,"I don't want to just take a pill and be done with it, I know that meds won't cure anything, they just make things manageable."
6338,"They prescribed some type of medication, I took it, but within two weeks quit taking it because of the way it made me feel."
6339,"Here is the short version, I was recently diagnosed with anxiety disorder/panic attacks and after trying to deal with it for a while and having it wreck destroy my body I finally asked for some meds."
6340,"I am seeing so many people advising sufferers to get medication, as the FIRST step in their treatment."
6341,I am so confused by WHY no one is mentioning seeing a psychologist!?
6342,"If you have anxiety and you have not tried CBT, that would be a really good place to start."
6343,"If you have really bad anxiety, yes, sometimes medication is useful but medication doesn't change your thoughts which means you are more likely to relapse when you go off and you will have more trouble with withdrawal symptoms just because it will freak you out more."
6344,"If you have CBT sessions and you are on anti-anxiety medication, your brain will not learn very well to habituate to everything that makes you anxious."
6345,This may explain why CBT hasn't worked for you in the past.
6346,"Some medications are ok to take with CBT, some aren't."
6347,Anxiety is very treatable.
6348,CBT should be the first step.
6349,There is so much scientific evidence showing that it is a very effective treatment.
6350,Why do I feel like this isn't even general knowledge on this thread?
6351,"The aim should NOT be to remove anxiety altogether from your life, but to be able to live with it and not be bothered by it anymore."
6352,I shall await the downvotes.
6353,This just makes me sad.
6354,"[EDIT: Read further below for more comments about this]

*** [EDIT2: It seems some people are missing my main point."
6355,My main point is that newcomers or new sufferers come on this website and ask for help and people straight away tell them to take medication when their symptoms aren't always really severe.
6356,"All I am saying is that people should be informed of BOTH options - therapy and meds, rather than just meds] ***"
6357,"Actually, I just came back from my Target pharmacy for my anti-aniexty and depression medication, thankfully I have insurance through my mother's husband who is a raging alcoholic and drug addict, but at least has a job."
6358,I ask the technician to place back at least one medication that I know I still have pills of at home.
6359,"The medication used for the depression has a side effect when coming off of it...major depression and suicidal thought/tendencies, which has happened before and is a terrible feeling I wouldn't wish upon anyone else."
6360,"My other medication, allows me to function 'normally' by calming me and keeping me from experiencing severe anxiety and/or panic attacks."
6361,"I choose to put back the depression medication and felt so worthless, even more than I usually do."
6362,"I've got the meds now but I'm very scared about it happening again, even after taking a dose today."
6363,"And I keep having fits of crying that I seriously can't control, which is embarrasing :( I'm even feeling like I'm back to before the meds."
6364,I am currently seeing a psychiatrist for adult ADD (and only take my  meds during the week.)
6365,"I start feeling sick which makes the whole thing even worse ETC ETC...

For example right now im worrying that I have some disorder as I seem to be a lot more anxious than everyone else, my mohter is a very anxious person but am i just more anxious and need some different thought structures or am i Mental in need of medication etc...

Basically Ill end this with what I imagine is a fairly common phrase.."
6366,"We were together until recently, she broke up with me because she wanted to sort our her various issues without always relying on me

While obviously it hurts, I want to be supportive and so was wondering if anyone had any advice with how to at least make things a bit easier for her as at the moment all I've ever been able to do is tell her ""It's going to be ok""

We're both 18 and she's not on any medication; she's been diagnosed by her doctor but the only thing they prescribed her were phone call appointments with a therapist, which she dislikes and some sort of weekly group sessions that she only went to one of because it was not for her

I just want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to help her even as only her friend."
6367,"I'm off of my medication and have been for over a year now, without any significant issues... aside from this."
6368,I'm not sure if it's worth a mention but I'm currently on medication for ADHD.
6369,"Anyways, I was going to a doctor and was on a waiting list for a therapist, I’ve been through plenty of meds for depression and anxiety, my last prescription I’ve taken was a generic clonazepam, or k-pin."
6370,I’ve never driven in my life and I’ve only had one job in my life and that was through college when I was going and taking my medication.
6371,I also fear medication.
6372,I've seen therapists regularly and have been on and off of antidepressants and anti anxiety meds.
6373,I have been having issues with my memory since I started medication to help my anxiety.
6374,TL;DR: I take anxiety meds to make my life easier but they make me stupid and I still have anxiety issues.
6375,I was kind of hoping to see someone that has the ability to prescribe medication since I don't really trust my general doctor for that sort of thing.
6376,"All I know is that studying medicine and human biology has made me a bit more anxious about my health (and more motivated to lose weight, get healthy etc even though it's difficult) and right now I worry I'm tachycardic."
6377,"I have seen no positive outcome in medication, but since my intestinal pain has worsened (as a result of bulimia most likely and among other things,) I'm not exactly sure what to tell my doctor first."
6378,"My logic is, get the mental shit down, get the ""meds"" I need and deal with the intestinal, stomach, liver problems from my drug/alcohol abuse as well as, bulimia later... but that doesn't seem too logical."
6379,first i argue with myself that it's not that bad -- i can handle the attack without meds!
6380,I recently got a job in an office and started taking a new kind of medication.
6381,And I don't really know many other people taking meds for anxiety to compare notes with.
6382,This is my first time taking meds for my anxiety and I am extremely nervous.
6383,I'm most nervous about the potential sexual side effects right now and I'm worried that all of my nerves and my anxieties about the medication will end up counteracting it or I'll have a load of placebo effects happening to me because I'm so scared of certain things.
6384,"In a manner of speaking, my waves of anxiety ebb and flow like the tides."
6385,"In general, my anxiety is a state of hyper-alertness that finds me (more often than not) in a sort of self-preservation mode."
6386,That 'fight or flight' mode that people often refer to.
6387,"Like others here, I have many external and interal environmental triggers (some real, some perceived)."
6388,"Pain, general discomfort, temperature (usually only hot temps), crowd size and density, and sound (particularly loud or repetitive sounds) and lack of sleep are the triggers I'm aware of."
6389,"One of my biggest issues with these triggers isn't just what they are in- and of-themselves, but rather my awareness of them and how great the 'intrusion' is or is perceived to be."
6390,"Sometimes these triggers seem to ""stack"" or build upon one another, almost to the point where I just completely shut-down."
6391,"In a word, it's almost like sensory overload."
6392,"In general, I have (through counseling and self-supported activities) started mindfulness exercises."
6393,"That is, making myself aware of what is happening around me and analyzing how it makes me feel."
6394,"For me, awareness is a key to unlocking this issue of anxiety."
6395,"In my teen years, I practiced meditation, and I am slowly getting back to that path."
6396,"More often then not, I am simply 'not aware'/not thinking in the moment when one of my triggers begins to influence me or my perception of what is happening around me."
6397,"Rather, it feels as though, seemingly suddenly, I feel anxious."
6398,I simply experience the anxiety without necessarily being aware of it or what has triggered it.
6399,"Fortunately, anxiety manifests itself in physical form and if I can ""tune-in"" to it, I can certainly do what I can to trace its root(s)."
6400,"While this seems easy, conceptually, the largest hurdle is the awareness or lack thereof."
6401,"I've tried medications, pharmaceuticals to quell these reactions to stimulus - and while some have helped, I often find I can't cope with the laundry list of side effects."
6402,"Where one seems to chill me out (almost too much), another doesn't feel like it works at all - regardless of dose, yet another might physically affect me (increased sensitivity to light, temperature fluctuations, or sexual function)."
6403,"Not only that, but I have an inherent distrust of pharmaceuticals."
6404,One need only listen to commercials for new drugs to see why - the treatment/cure often seems worse than the disease.
6405,"This part may not be popular, but I do find that marijuana helps to a great deal."
6406,"Not only does is it seem to provide 'awareness of the moment' when I need it, but it also seems to provide me the calm I so desperately need."
6407,"Not only that, but I simply do not experience the side effects (apart from the actual smoke itself and -very rarely - increased appetite and minor moments of paranoia -- not that I don't have those already) that often accompany pharmaceuticals."
6408,"I haven't used it much (it isn't exactly a part of my medical plan) and some might scoff or state that it might lead to further exasperation of my anxiety symptoms, but I have yet to find anything that absolutely proves or disproves these notions incontrovertibly."
6409,"The fact remains that, when I have used it, I find that I'm much calmer, more capable of being social, less irritable, less ""angsty"", I am more capable of ""finding my calm"" and managing my stressors and triggers; it also seems to help with pain and nausea management."
6410,"Even better is the fact that it is not an addictive substance (again, not having found any incontrovertible evidence to support the notion that it is)."
6411,"Furthermore, I can go months and years (I have!)"
6412,without suffering withdrawals or an overwhelming desire to use it.
6413,"I strongly believe that because each of us is a walking, talking chemistry set, results may vary from person to person, so the option/method I described above may not be suitable for some, either due to accessibility, desire, testing, etc."
6414,"I'm wondering, what are your triggers (either singularly or in list form) and what methods have you used to manage them?"
6415,What do you find works best for you?
6416,I'm already on meds for my anxiety.
6417,"He put me on Buspirone, with xanax as an emergency medication."
6418,"Today, we decided we should try another medication, and it came down to Lexapro being what I am trying now."
6419,"I was wondering if anyone had any experience with the medication, of generally what to expect or some red flags I need to discuss with my doctor if they occur."
6420,"I don't want to be on meds, I don't even think that it would help me any."
6421,"Isn't there some way to beat this anxiety legitimately, without the use of meds?"
6422,"I felt sad so much, figured it was a side effect of the medicine."
6423,My dad has since scheduled a psych evaluation so hopfully I can get properly medicated because the medicine i take now is always a tossup between crippling fear or crushing sadness.
6424,"'Normal', happy, carefree, invigorated... until the medication wears off again.. Until my next prescribed doseage."
6425,I'll be better tomorrow.. after my meds.. not so useless and high strung..
6426,Can anyone give me suggestions for meds I can suggest to my doc so I don't make an ass of myself?
6427,Hello my fellow anxious ones...
6428,"I had a troubling experience with my psychiatrist the other day, and I wanted your input on what to do about it."
6429,I have severe anxiety that starts with chest pain and ends up with stuttering and not being able to breathe.
6430,This has happened at work too where I work at a front desk and deal with hundreds of people a day.
6431,So medication is unfortunately necessary for the time being to calm my body down.
6432,I should also mention that bulimia with anorexic tendencies are intertwined with my anxiety.
6433,"I have tried Lexapro, Prozac, and Cymbalta for it, but as you may know anti-depressants can increase anxiousness, which it has every time with me."
6434,The one and only thing that has worked thus far is Xanax.
6435,"No, I am not an addict, I barely take it once a week, unless it's a very very bad week, and I use it as a last resort only."
6436,"I hadn't seen her in about five months and went through about 20-30 Xanax, and ran out, which is why I went back to see said psychiatrist."
6437,"She told me that my chest pain was acid reflux from the purging (even though I said it doesn't correspond to when I purge or eat), but that I don't purge often enough to really be bulimic in her eyes."
6438,"She also said Xanax in the long run was not an option for her so she would not be prescribing it for me from here on out, but refused to try to find any other solution other than giving me Cymbalta and kicking me out the door."
6439,Sooo I feel like I was treated a bit like a junkie.
6440,Is that too sensitive of me?
6441,What do I do in this situation?
6442,I've had chest pain every day in the 1 1/2 weeks since I've seen her and I'm really irritable and talking is difficult.
6443,"Should I stick it out, stand up to her, or just see someone else entirely?"
6444,"I hate finding someone new, it always seems like I have to be on the defense (which maybe I should be, I don't know)."
6445,Any suggestions on what I should do or what medications or therapies have worked best for you I would love to hear!
6446,I constantly worried that people would still find me annoying even though I've been taking my meds for a few years now.
6447,I'm in a relationship with medication.
6448,I come from a very anti pharmaceutical background and taking medication probably depresses me more but I have no choice.
6449,"So basically, I want to stop taking this medicine in its total form, some day, but I definitely want and need to take the 1mg off at nighttime sooner rather than later."
6450,"One last also: any other alternatives for anxiety medication that aren't in the  benzodiazepine class and are effective without the long-term side effects and highly addictive potential of  benzodiazepines, would be greatly accepted and noted!"
6451,He also said that I need to see a doctor soon and get on anxiety medication.
6452,How can I afford to pay for a therapist AND a doctor's appointment AND medication?
6453,I'm still on medication.
6454,I've been off meds since May after being on them for a year and a half.
6455,We're in the UK if that changes anything in regards to medication/healthcare.
6456,"And if you're interested, I'm going to be using this medicine while I also work on the cognitive part and doing exposure therapy."
6457,A couple weeks ago I made the first few big steps to getting help with my social anxiety.
6458,"I told my parents, and went to my doctor."
6459,Prior to this I had spent months thinking and researching about what I need to help myself.
6460,"I've read all about therapy and the countless success stories, long term results, etc."
6461,"I see the appeal of it, but I didn't want to go to a therapist, at least not yet."
6462,All I really need is something to overcome the initial anxiety.
6463,"Getting out of my front door, into the car."
6464,Shaking hands and introducing myself to an employer.
6465,Starting a conversation (even with my best friends).
6466,"All these things make me anxious to a point where I completely avoid them, but I know from experience that once I get past that first thing I'll be able to settle down and realize that everything is gonna be all right."
6467,I decided that I'd ask about medication.
6468,"Something that could just take the edge off, something that could allow me to experience the things that my inhibitions would otherwise not allow me to, and ideally - when I'm ready - go to a therapist for a more permanent solution."
6469,"So I step into my doctor's office, and tell him what I'm feeling."
6470,"He hands me a test to take, I fill it out."
6471,He tells me he'll refer me for a psychologist consultation and meet with me again later on in the summer for a follow up.
6472,"He hands me a referral, a diagnosis and a list of nearby psychologists."
6473,Before I know it I'm out of the office holding exactly what I didn't want.
6474,Now here I am looking at this list of psychologists and my diagnosis.
6475,I could literally have gotten the same results from a fucking google search but instead I spent days stressing out about this doctor's visit.
6476,I have no idea what to do now.
6477,"I'm not looking for change underneath the furniture but i'm not rolling in cash either, I could afford a visit or two with a psychologist but I don't want to pay for something I don't want or need."
6478,"My parents insurance will cover medication entirely, but not a penny in coverage for a psychologist."
6479,Not to mention besides weekends I can't really spare any time for a session.
6480,"I *would* go back to my doctor and just ask for medications, but hey surprise!"
6481,Anxiety!
6482,"Not only would I have to go through the whole process again but now I'd have to tell him I haven't even been bothered to try his suggestion, I just want drugs!"
6483,"I'm not looking for an easy way out of this, I just think that weeks of therapy is overkill."
6484,"There's things I want to do right now, promises I've made that I want to keep, but I can't as long as I'm this way."
6485,"I've been pushing aside depression thanks to the progress I've been making, but now I'm stuck."
6486,"The longer I wait, the angrier I am at myself for screwing up my opportunity to make one of the biggest changes in my life."
6487,I just don't know what to do anymore.
6488,"I'm 25 years old now, but I've always had anxiety ever since I was a kid."
6489,"For years I would try to find a way out of a stressful situation, always avoiding it altogether if I could, and if I couldn't, I wouldn't stay very long."
6490,"In my mind, especially when I was a kid/teenager, if I could find a way out... an escape from a situation that gave me anxiety, it would almost make me feel better."
6491,"Looking back, I can see that it does not help much because lately, I have been feeling severe anxiety, and there's nowhere to run or hide for me."
6492,"When I was younger, I would stress about when my parents would come home from work."
6493,"If they were late by mere minutes, I would begin to panic."
6494,I somehow made it through my childhood without anyone realizing how I felt.
6495,"I did not want to seem abnormal, and I did not want to worry my family."
6496,"As I grew up, I would still stress about when my family would come home."
6497,"Once they started leaving me home alone, I would spend the majority of the time that they were out looking at the clock."
6498,My escape would be leaving my house and going to my friends house down the street.
6499,He was my only real friend as a kid.
6500,"I'd come home a few hours after my parents were supposed to be home, and they always were."
6501,"If I couldn't go to my friends house, I would sit at home in a near panic."
6502,"Still, I told no one."
6503,"Eventually, I began to worry less and less when my family would go out."
6504,"My family got cellphones, and I could call them at any time."
6505,"If they didn't answer though, the panic would come back worse than ever."
6506,"I still had my escape of going to a friends house, but I would be sitting at his house feeling nervous."
6507,"In high school, I became friends with a group of guys."
6508,They were all close friends before I started hanging out with them.
6509,"I knew they liked me, I knew we were all friends, but for some reason, I could never trust them outside of the walls of the school."
6510,"Every week, they would ask me to hang out with them."
6511,"Every week, I would have an excuse as to why I couldn't."
6512,"The odd time where I went out with them, I was nervous the entire time until they dropped me off."
6513,"Eventually, we drifted apart."
6514,"Probably because I wasn't able to extend the same friendship to them, because I was too nervous to do it."
6515,"A few years later, I was about 18 or 19, I was mostly over a lot of anxiety - or so I thought."
6516,"The same things that made me anxious as a kid or teenager, didn't make me as nervous anymore."
6517,I could stay home alone.
6518,"I might glance at the clock, but I could keep myself busy."
6519,I could go out with a group of friends.
6520,"Sometimes I would get anxious, but it would usually pass."
6521,"A few years after that (age 22), I was going on a guys trip with my dad to my parents new house in Florida (we're Canadian) We were going to golf, eat greasy food, and relax."
6522,"On the plane ride down, I had the worst panic attack I'd ever had."
6523,I fell asleep on the plane.
6524,"I woke up after what felt like 4 hours asleep, only to realize it had only been about 20 minutes."
6525,"The plane was whisper quiet, and I realized I had no way out of the plane if I wanted to."
6526,I felt very claustrophobic - even though this had never been a problem before.
6527,I sat in the planes bathroom for 15 minutes.
6528,"The stewardess told me I'd been in there for 15 minutes, and I was shocked."
6529,It felt like 2 minutes.
6530,"I tried to tell my dad how I was feeling, and he tried to make me feel better, but it wasn't helping, and I don't think I was describing it right."
6531,"I thought I was just plane-sick, like carsickness."
6532,"We got off the plane, but I still couldn't calm down."
6533,I spent the whole 5 day trip in a constant panic.
6534,"I wanted to have a good time, but I couldn't do it."
6535,I was too stressed about the plane ride home in just 5 days.
6536,Nights were the hardest.
6537,"I spend almost every night pacing up and down the condo, trying to not wake my dad up."
6538,"Eventually, when we got set to leave, we were about to line up to go through security, and I broke down."
6539,"I teared up and told my dad I couldn't go on the plane, I was too scared."
6540,My dad didn't know how to react.
6541,He said we could drive home if I wanted.
6542,"Somehow I calmed down in time and told myself that if I went on that plane, I would be home and in my house in 6 hours."
6543,"I got home safe and sound, but the anxiety never disappeared."
6544,I finally went to my doctor and told him about it.
6545,He figured it was just a fear of flying.
6546,"He prescribed me Lorazepam, and said to take it if I was going to fly somewhere."
6547,"I never took any, because I haven't flown anywhere since."
6548,I carried those pills everywhere though.
6549,They became my new escape from anxiety.
6550,"I thought that if I ever got anxious enough, I could take a pill and I would feel better."
6551,Obviously I didn't know much about medications at that point.
6552,"Slowly, over the course of nearly a year."
6553,I managed to find a way to live with anxiety.
6554,"The pills were in my pocket so long that they got grinded into a dust, so I threw them out."
6555,"I was living my life, it might not have been perfect, but I had a full time job, friends and family."
6556,"I still had anxiety, and no one knew."
6557,"If they knew I'd had anxiety in the past, no one would have guessed it was still there."
6558,That brings us almost to today.
6559,February 2015.
6560,"My dad, who works for a major Canadian company, had to go on a business trip."
6561,"He'd been on business trips in the past, and asides from some mild anxiety about it, I managed to live with it."
6562,"In February 2015, he had another trip."
6563,This trip was different from the other ones.
6564,"It took him into the Northern part of the country, where there is limited cellphone service."
6565,His ability to contact us was sometimes nonexistent and this brought back every single piece of anxiety I've ever felt.
6566,"I was so panicked the whole time he was gone (8 days), that I couldn't function anymore."
6567,"I could barely eat, barely sleep, I couldn't be productive at work."
6568,I was anxious the whole time.
6569,"When it was finally the day for him to come home, I followed his car ride home through a GPS app on his phone."
6570,I don't know why I had to do this.
6571,"The GPS app on his phone doesn't really make me feel better when it works, but it makes me feel the worst anxiety if it doesn't work."
6572,(Keep in mind it wouldn't work if he had no cell service).
6573,Yet for some reason I was glued to it the whole time he was away.
6574,I couldn't close my phone.
6575,"Even when he was in his hotel, I had to check to make sure he was still there."
6576,I felt like I was 10 years old again.
6577,"It was all the same anxieties I felt back then, except it felt worse now."
6578,I got through the February 2015 trip.
6579,But he had to go away again.
6580,"This time he is much further away (about a 6 hour plane ride away), and cellphone coverage is sometimes nonexistent."
6581,"Even still, I'm glued to the GPS app on my phone."
6582,I can't take my eyes off it.
6583,It makes me feel anxious all the time.
6584,I can't stop looking though.
6585,"His trip is 16 days long, and he has about 9 days to go right now."
6586,I feel like I can't make it through the 9 more days.
6587,"And even if I do, he'll just have to go away again sometime soon."
6588,I feel like I'll never feel normal again.
6589,It was during the last week that I finally told people about my anxiety.
6590,I told my mom how bad it is.
6591,She doesn't know what to do to help me.
6592,She's trying her hardest to help her 25 year old child get over the anxieties of a 10 year old.
6593,I went back to see my doctor.
6594,"He must have seen how anxious I felt because he gave me more Lorazepam, and recommended that I see a therapist."
6595,I booked a session for two days from now with the therapist.
6596,This makes me anxious.
6597,"At work, my performance was suffering."
6598,"I wasn't having fun at work like I usually do, and people took notice."
6599,My boss pulled me aside and asked me what was wrong.
6600,It took all I could do that day to not break down in tears that day.
6601,I told him that I deal with anxiety.
6602,"His answer was ""What?"
6603,Really?
6604,"No.."" It felt okay to be able to open up to people."
6605,But I just feel like people don't understand.
6606,I don't know how to deal with the anxiety.
6607,I don't know if I can keep living with anxiety coming back into my life.
6608,I don't want to live with anxiety controlling me anymore.
6609,I want to change.
6610,I don't know how to do it.
6611,"All my life, I got over anxiety by running from it."
6612,I would try to stay one step ahead.
6613,I can't do that anymore.
6614,Anxiety is always two steps ahead of me now.
6615,"25 years, and I'm still dealing with the same anxiety I had as a kid."
6616,"Thank you to anyone who reads this, because I've never written this out before."
6617,I think I might print this off and bring it to my first therapist session in two days.
6618,"So due to various circumstances, I will be unable to get a prescription for my medication until the 27th."
6619,"I was lucky to stock up on my antidepressant for 2 months, but my anxiety and sleeping medication will be out."
6620,"I have gotten so much better, but it feels like it's all due to the meds."
6621,I remember some blissful times while on meds.
6622,"So far I've managed to only take the prescribed anxiety medication, but the urge to fall back into my old habits is becoming too strong."
6623,"I had been getting support, tried medicine, then I just stopped."
6624,"I want to take any medication that will make me stop being so overwhelmed and afraid, I don't care if they make me feel practically nothing."
6625,I used to be afraid of meds but now I just don't care.
6626,"Please, if anyone has any info that would be helpful, or would like to share their experiences with meds, I would really love to hear."
6627,"Hey reddit,

I felt like sharing my experience, because I postponed taking meds for very long due to fear of side effects and because psycho meds are ""evil"" in my eyes anyway."
6628,"I already feel better, but it most certainly isn't from the meds."
6629,That's awesome though because in 2-3 weeks I should feel *even better* when the meds finally do their thing!
6630,"As I said, the nausea sucks for me, and the tremors are annoying because I hate shaking hands and have them all the time (even before the meds), but that's just me."
6631,"The thing is, I know I'll get better in a couple of weeks due to the meds, and the downsides aren't a real issue."
6632,"*)

Edit: I take my meds in the morning btw."
6633,"The first day I just felt weird, but that was honestly expected taking those evil meds ;)"
6634,I came in today telling them that I'm not happy with the medication as the Zoloft is making my RLS worse and the vistaril does nothing for my panic attacks.
6635,I was sat down with a PA who told me medication isn't the solution and that I need to be in group therapy 5 days a week 8 hours a day.
6636,"I know medication isn't the solution, I told her I wanted to use it temporarily to get my life back on track but she just repeated herself."
6637,Fortunately I complained to another PA and have an appointment tomorrow with an actual psychiatrist that is going to try other medication with me.
6638,"Best I've felt in a long while, and in my elation, I somehow forgot to take my meds (Probably because I fell asleep in my workroom and then went straight to bed skipping the much needed step between)."
6639,"During the school year, I considered going on medication for depression."
6640,"What I want to know is, for anyone who took anxiety medication, did it help you cope with your relationships?"
6641,Your input about either the medication or maintaining relationships is greatly appreciated :)
6642,I've been on anti anxiety medication to help me sleep since I was 14 years old.
6643,Hello all.
6644,Been thinking a lot lately.
6645,Of course.
6646,Never stop thinking.
6647,"Anyways, I’m 22 and a girl."
6648,I’ve been struggling with mood disorders since I was young.
6649,"I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 12 and then Bipolar Type 2 at age 17 and now, about a year ago I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety disorder."
6650,This came at a terrible time.
6651,I was having trouble functioning.
6652,"I felt alone, confused and like everyone and everything was against me."
6653,This was the darkest point of my life thus far.
6654,The relationship I was in ended (because of my anxiety) and as you can guess it only fueled my anxiety.
6655,There were days I seriously just wanted to stop existing.
6656,"I was on medication (clonazepam, 1mg as necessary) for a couple months and even started to go back on my Bipolar meds I had been on when first diagnosed (Lamictal)."
6657,I have since been off all prescription medications for the last 7 months.
6658,I will admit I smoke marijuana on a daily basis but have been considering cutting back on that as well.
6659,"I have been doing better, of course I have my days like everyone but I feel more confident that I will not allow myself to sink to the place I was not so long ago."
6660,"I do not want to be on medication, and I was just wondering what other people’s experience has been managing mood disorders without medication."
6661,I probably need to get in to see a therapist but I hate talking to people about my issues because I have this complex that I should be able to solve all of my problems myself.
6662,What are some pointers anyone might have for coping without medication that have been proven to work for you?
6663,"Weed works wonders for me but instead of being anxious I just sit in my apartment and do nothing, I turn completely antisocial and then get sad for not having friends or hanging out with people."
6664,I guess I just want to move forward.
6665,I feel like I’ve hit a wall in my recovery and I’d really like to get over it and be happy.
6666,TL/DR: Been struggling with ADHD/Bipolar/Anxiety for years.
6667,Gone on and off medication over the years but don’t want to poison my brain with prescription drugs.
6668,I want to know how I can continue to move forward with my personal growth WITHOUT the help of medication.
6669,"Also, will I ever find someone who understands my anxiety and won’t call me “crazy” for it?"
6670,"I already have pretty bad depersonalization due to my Anxiety and medication, and I'm worried that it will worsen greatly, becoming debilitating."
6671,"I was given anti-anxiety meds but because I get the I-don't-give-a-shit attitude I'm afraid that if I feel suicidal, I just might follow through with it."
6672,"I've now had the trembling, retching, loss of appetite (and weight loss), lack of sleep and feelings of depression for nearly one month, my doctor told me it's anxiety and have been put on medication, and counselling to start in the next week or two."
6673,"I should probably look into getting some sort of medication for this at this point, I brought it up to my doctor and I've been referred to the behavioural medicine department for an opening they have sometime in March."
6674,"I attributed some of this to the medication, but once I started school again all the old issues came back."
6675,I guess I'm just confused and stressed about finding the right medication for me and was hoping for any advice or stories you might have.
6676,I want to see people's view on their experience with this medication.
6677,"My wife suffers from Epilepsy, and today was her Neurologist check up."
6678,"When she went in, I told her to ask her doctor about a recommendation on who to go for for acid reflux, as it has prevented her from eating properly and is losing weight."
6679,"During their consultation the doctor decided (without any testing) that her weight loss is due to her anxiety causing mild anorexia, and sent her home with no recommendation, and instead a prescription for Zoloft (generic)."
6680,He told her she 'could' see a regular doctor if she wanted.
6681,This seems odd to me.
6682,This seems like getting ibuprofen instead of a cast for a broken arm.
6683,"We ARE going to seek a second opinion, but my wife wants to start taking the Zoloft immediately because her Neurologist said so, but I am hesitant to start her on mind altering medications just yet, especially over a very mild form of anxiety (especially when Anxiety was not even close to the issue we were there for, See: Epilepsy/Acid Reflux)."
6684,"I guess in my ramblings I misplaced my question, but does this seem like odd behavior to anyone else?"
6685,Does she really need an SSRI to help prevent acid reflux?
6686,And would you think medication is necessary for someone extremely high functioning?
6687,"She works, socializes, does normal human things."
6688,Just gets tense from time to time.
6689,EDIT:  Or if you can message me a better place to post this question as I was unsure of how appropriate it is for this sub.
6690,"I've already been diagnosed with depression, but I am not on medication and not seeing a counseling psychologist or psychiatrist."
6691,"I took some of my prescribed blood pressure medication, fell asleep for 5-10 SECONDS, yes, seconds, and felt a lot better."
6692,At work and on mobile at 4.51 am so ill br quick.
6693,Im a mid 20s male who has been dealing with anxiety / depression and borderline disorder.
6694,Been seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist for some time now and have seen a douzen or so different medications.
6695,Ive been on my current one the longest as up until now it's been most effective.
6696,Yet the past few weeks the effectiveness has been slowly dissapearing.
6697,While my depression is still at bay my anxiety is skyrocketing.
6698,Daily anxiety attacks and panic attacks arent uncommon at all.
6699,And they're much more intense then before.
6700,Is this common for meds to suddenly stop working after a while?
6701,Benzos are all that calm me yet my addictive personality has already clashed with them a few times before  hesitent to ask for more.
6702,Aaaand cue number 2 for today.
6703,And i wish i meant poop.
6704,Bio: I'm a 28 year old female.
6705,"Click here to read more about the borderline personality disorder: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder

I go to therapy called Dialectical Behavorial Therapy."
6706,I take 10mg Lexapro (SSRI) and 2.5mg Abilify (mood stabilizer) every day.
6707,I take Klonopin daily as needed.
6708,It took me about five years to get my medications correct.
6709,"If any of you have questions about medications, I've been on a lot of them, so maybe I could help with my own personal experiences."
6710,"My major symptoms are rapid mood swings, seeing the world in black and white in terms of interpersonal relationships, extreme fear of abandonment, high anxiety/panic, and self harm."
6711,I've been hospitalized five times for symptoms of (but really mostly anxiety about) suicidal thoughts or self-harm relating to the disease.
6712,I still struggle with the disease as I have a rather acute form of it.
6713,But I've been living with the anxiety for the longest time (about 10 years).
6714,"One of my main struggles is with interpersonal relationships, so I spend a lot of time online."
6715,"I know I have burned a lot of bridges with friends recently, so I wanted to do this to possibly answer questions if you know someone that has these disorders to help understand them, or if you have any of these perhaps we can better understand ourselves."
6716,For anxiety I use a lot of meditation techniques and what is called mindfulness.
6717,My specific therapy is called DBT (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy).
6718,"I've also tried other forms of therapy, specifically CBT (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy)

As far as proof goes I have the following:

The workbook we use for therapy: http://imgur.com/uio4g9M

And a piece of paperwork from one of my most recent hospitalizations: http://imgur.com/ZVv5KFJ (Note: this does not list my diagnoses, but I do not currently have any paperwork at my house that lists it, so I hope this is sufficient.)"
6719,"After about 25 minutes, it still felt like I hadn't taken any medication, except I was a tiny bit more relaxed."
6720,"---

**Daily meds:** 170mg Venlafaxine, 180mg Propranolol, a IBS med, an acid reflux med, a contraceptive pill, a diazepam, and a (not important) multivitamin."
6721,You can't tell me whether I did double-take the meds but I need to get this out.
6722,"I initially did very well in controlling my medication and only taking it when I needed it and made my first prescription (90 pills total, 30 per bottle with two refills) last about 8 months, which was way longer than I needed to."
6723,My goal now is to simply get a refill and ask my mom to help regulate my medication so I can find the happy medium I know exists.
6724,I am embarrassed and find it hard to admit to my parents and doctor that I lost control of my medication.
6725,"I'm not sure how to admit i have an addiction, albeit much more mental than physical, and im worried my parents will be disappointed and angry at me as they are the type of people who would rather not have me on medication at all."
6726,I feel slightly better after typing this out but I am anxious that i won't be able to get a refill on my medication and I feel guilty and like i've done something wrong.
6727,While I was there the doctor's changed my meds very aggresively.
6728,This lead him to start seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication.
6729,"The medication has made things manageable day to day, but it really affected things sexually now."
6730,"When he started the medication, it made it really hard for him to cum for awhile even though he still had a desire to have sex."
6731,"He said that if he stopped taking the medicine he would be able to easily cum again, but his psychiatrist said that if he stopped taking it he would build an immunity and never be able to take the same depression meds again."
6732,I talked to my psych about this and said I was ravenous all the time and was gaining weight but she said anxiety meds don't cause weight gain.
6733,I'd take meds but my insurance wouldn't cover all of it and I hate meds.
6734,Anytime I take meds I turn into a different person and get every bad side effect out there.
6735,"I have been off of my meds for about a year, and I just can't take it anymore."
6736,"Also, when I DID have meds, I felt like the doctor wasn't dosing me properly or even giving me the correct meds."
6737,"I don't think she was used to dealing with people with anxiety, so she just slapped me with a very low dose of the most common medication and I had to ask her to up it every single month (Because she made me go back for an appointment once a month, and charged me $300 for a five minute ""No, my dose is still too low"" appt)..."
6738,Would you recommend I talk to my psychiatrist about another medication?
6739,"I don't do drugs, moderate with alcohol, not on any medication and exercise regularly."
6740,"My doctor did not seem to be too concerned about them, just put me on anti-anxiety meds and told me to try to get some rest."
6741,Should she look into going back on the medication again?
6742,"For the longest time I would have disagreed to taking meds, but now I have changed my mind, I would totally take something just to let me controll my fear for a brief time."
6743,Is there special medication to overcome simple panic and/or fear?
6744,This is my first post here.
6745,I want to start off saying that I have had anxiety for around 10 years.
6746,I have tried medications but they don't seem to work.
6747,"I need Help :(...I cant figure out how to change my life into a direction that leads to happiness, I am just sitting here on my computer like I normally do but I feel Anxious, I can't calm myself down."
6748,When I'm around people my heart starts racing but when I'm by myself my heart starts racing because I'm anxious about still being alone and want to talk to people.
6749,It's a vicious cycle (I have grey hair because of this)..I'm 24.
6750,"I don't know what to do anymore, I am not smart enough to articulate myself well to a psychiatrist or therapist to make any progress :(...I'm so alone and pathetic it's starting to make me sick to my stomach that I continue on with life"
6751,Started to think about medicine to help me cope.
6752,Im afraid that I will be a hopeless boyfriend because the medication I take makes my sex preformance unpridictable.
6753,"I'm on several meds, and am going to therapy regularly."
6754,"Don't worry, I'm not going to act on them and I objectively realize that they're a result of the medication."
6755,I don't want to have to see a therapist or go on medication.
6756,"My mom got me an appointment at the doctors, and I thought, Ok I can get some meds and be alright."
6757,I've been diagnosed with both and took medication on and off for a while but am not taking anything now.
6758,Can anyone enlighten me with their experience with the use of this medication?
6759,I've been taking medication (Escitalopram 5mg) for a bit over a month now and thankfully I'm no longer experiencing levels of anxiety that affect my well being.
6760,"When I say consistently, I'm referring to the ***time*** that I take my meds."
6761,"The depression seems like it kind of went away on its own, and the anxiety was SO much better when I started medication."
6762,-I recently upped my medication from 50 milligrams of sertraline to 100 milligrams.
6763,-The medication is just not as effective as it used to be.
6764,Has anyone experienced anything like this after increasing their medication dosage?
6765,The last medication I was on gave me lasting memory problems and I'm scared that it will interfere.
6766,"I'm going to bring my medicine, just in case something does happen, but I'm going to try to not take it."
6767,"I posted about my new meds last week: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/zvwjw/has_anyone_taken_cymbalta_andor_xanax/

The Cymbalta is going ok, but the Xanax is making me feel strange - it seems to be increasing my anxiety and making me feel very agitated."
6768,I already had a lot of hesitations in starting the medication because I didn't want it to change who I am and now that it is increased I feel like maybe I am crazy or something.
6769,"Unfortunately, I'm from kind of a small town, and so the only person I could see about it was a social worker, and totally creeped me out, so I only ended up going a couple times and refused medication because I didn't want to turn into a zombie."
6770,"(Also, I am on no medication for my anxiety, and do not plan to be in the future.)"
6771,I'm on meds and also have ones to take only when I'm feeling specifically anxious.
6772,"I'm wondering if anyone has experienced similar experiences with meds, is it my body getting use to the meds of does it seem like I should try a different med?"
6773,"She also has some mental health issues, but takes medication."
6774,His mother has relapsed and stopped taking her medication (I don't know how long or if she's started again since then).
6775,So lately I have come to the realization that our system and institutional society DOES not give a fuck about mental health.
6776,It is blatantly apparent.
6777,Any psychiatric service independent or owned by the government doesn't care about actually solving your issues.
6778,Instead they give you a fucking chemical cocktail drug that simply masks people's true mental issues.
6779,Why?
6780,Because they want you to keep producing numbers or working.
6781,"Thats all they want people to do. """
6782,Get back to work!
6783,"Get a job bum!"""
6784,"Inherently, NO ONE on this earth NEEDS a job, they're FORCED to have one."
6785,Thats why the U.S. is the economic machine of the world.
6786,Millions of people that are stressed to the max in their pointless systematic jobs and THEY wonder why people have mental issues!
6787,Don't get me started on Mental Hospitals.
6788,Its something out of the Fucking Dark Ages.
6789,Forcing young people to a prison where all they do is judge you and tell you stop being 'stupid' based on the permission of your parents.
6790,"Haven't been in one, but all my friends have said it is nothing but a punish house."
6791,And why in fucking hell is the American health care system a FUCKING INDUSTRY.
6792,Thats pathetic!
6793,Just look around us.
6794,What the hell are we doing??
6795,We're all walking and going through life like fucking zombies and buying into materialism.
6796,"Buying and reading tabloids about celebrities, eating SHITTY food, listening to the panhandling fear inducing news networks, using god awful personal care products that can cause shit like cancers, and moronically looking at internet videos all day."
6797,We're killing ourselves subtly.
6798,But hey.
6799,"Who am I, right?"
6800,"Who am I, when the System doesn't want people to know what's going on."
6801,People are slaves to the machine.
6802,You can't even fucking run away without the fucking feds trying to know your identification.
6803,No one can live a nomadic live in America.
6804,People live in a sedentary place every single day.
6805,The landscape of this earth is FUCKED by humanity's urge to destroy resources and build cities.
6806,"Nevertheless, self awareness is your key to freedom, guys."
6807,What I'm saying is probably controversial.
6808,But damn't someone has to say it!
6809,"You weren't born to this world to ""have a job""."
6810,"You weren't  born to ""buy things""."
6811,You were born for the basics of sustaining yourself.
6812,"Breathing, Drinking good water, Eating good food (grass fed meat, fruits, rice, vegetables,) Having sex, Getting stronger, and ultimately connecting with other human beings."
6813,Thats it!
6814,"Yet all you hear on the news is "" CNN: The Stock is a couple digits down, blah blah TMZ: Kim Kardashian has got a NEW dress blah blah, FOX News: We gotta stop those people from getting weed and marrying the same sex blah blah blah"" Its all fodder."
6815,Its trash.
6816,"Speaking of weed, the psychedelics that naturally occur in the earth SHOULD NOT be illegal."
6817,They are phenomenal in dealing with anxiety and depression especially Cannabis and Ayahuasca.
6818,"The real kind not the commercialized shit like cocaine, meth, etc."
6819,"Don't waste your time with these pharmaceutical passion-stealing medications, just GET some good weed."
6820,There NEEDS to be a change in this society.
6821,"I don't know when, but I do know when the people grow tired and angry, they won't be silenced."
6822,History has shown us this time and time again.
6823,Revolution has been inevitable for any any oppressive government.
6824,"I conclude, you guys here are human beings."
6825,"Take a moment, breathe, and think "" Is this life of being told what I have and being given this medication, good for me?"""
6826,You make that choice.
6827,All I know is that modern life is not something humans will feel be fulfilled by.
6828,"Write and express your angers, frustrations, sorrows."
6829,Take a long nice shower.
6830,"Get some friends some time, maybe get some good weed."
6831,Talk and state what you want out of this life.
6832,Share your ideas.
6833,You NEED a break from this economic money driven routine.
6834,"Unfortunately, the economic system won't be gone for a long time."
6835,I don't like that.
6836,Thats why I'm trying to develop a connected way of business that shares with friends.
6837,"Until then, find your passion."
6838,Its going to be FINE.
6839,We're here to learn and grow.
6840,Not be stuck in a comfort zone.
6841,Take care guys.
6842,Done.
6843,"If I can't stop myself from having a panic attack, then I might have to get back on the stronger meds and all my progress has been for shit."
6844,I am on medicine.
6845,"Despite trying all different types of medicine, the only way I was able to go to the bathroom was by taking a gallon of colonoscopy prep."
6846,I know the medication can take longer to work but it's little consolation when you feel this way.
6847,I also started taking medication for it.
6848,I can't take any other meds because I have to drive the cat to the vet (I have emergency xanax).
6849,"**tl;dr - Unreasonably anxious/worried a close and great friend will suddenly forget about me and abandon me in favor of another person, she might have suspected and reassured me we'll always be friends, but my anxiety persists and I'm not sure how to relax and feel better just yet despite even I feeling completely ridiculous over this but not sure how to relax right now :(**

On one hand, right now I'm on some medicine that does have depression, anxiety, and nervousness as side effects."
6850,I have had bad anxiety for the past several months and I just started a new medication for it.
6851,"I recently ran into an ex girlfriend (one who I genuinely dont care for) and since I have started the meds I have been having strong and unfounded feelings towards her, which is strange because I dont want to have feelings towards her."
6852,"I talked to a pretty close online friend about this who suffers from depression and they said they take some meds which make them feel relaxed and fluid and they said it might be good for me too, is this something work looking into?"
6853,For the past few months my anxiety has been increasing to the point where it is incredibly painful to socialize with others and it's causing me a lot of depression.
6854,"I've taken a lot of different medications in the past and was always pretty unhappy, but I'm considering seeing someone and trying again because it's getting so bad."
6855,My main concern is weight gain.
6856,Right now I'm at a healthy weight but I guess I have kind of a distorted body image and the thought of gaining any weight causes me a great amount of stress because I already feel disgusting.
6857,I know for most antidepressants weight gain is a common side effect but I guess I'm wondering if there is any kind that won't/is the least likely to make me gain weight.
6858,Have any of you here tried this medication on such a low dose?
6859,"I'm just wondering whether to get a second opinion or not, I know I should try out this medication but I was hoping for a more immediate result because I'm going back to school soon and my anxiety increased ten-fold."
6860,But if I'm causing these reactions and they're not just due to the medicine or anxiety I'd like to know so I can better watch out for it.
6861,"I spent about 9 months isolating myself from the world, trying to figure out how to manage my anxiety without meds or therapy."
6862,"It's almost been a week, and I've noticed my anxiety is better, but I can't seem to feel as much pleasure from the things I was once so passionate about, including people."
6863,I want to be silent around people.
6864,The urge to strictly observe is consuming me.
6865,"I am only a thing in the room, not a person."
6866,"I feel disconnected from everyone, even my boyfriend, whom I love dearly."
6867,Sex is difficult to enjoy because I feel so terribly disconnected.
6868,"Food is hard to enjoy, and I've been making myself eat peanut butter sandwiches."
6869,"I am not happy, and I'm scared that this is something that won't pass."
6870,"I'm somehow sinking into myself, and I don't really have anyone to talk to, nor the desire to talk to anyone."
6871,Maybe some of you know what I'm feeling?
6872,"I've struggled with anxiety all of my life, taken various medications, but I've been off meds for over four years now."
6873,Buspar makes me so mellow I want to disappear.
6874,"This is a shock to my system, and emotions."
6875,"I've been crawling through life with severe anxiety for four years, but now things are calm, and it scares me."
6876,I completely understand that everyone is different and reacts differently to different medication but am still wondering what is the general opinion or feeling of drinking while on beta blockers.
6877,"I'm back on meds from the doctor, but it'll take bout two weeks for them to kick in."
6878,I am on meds and seeing a psych and all that.
6879,"There's some stuff going on in my life right now with my partner that I am focusing on, to the point where I work myself into a panic, obsessively researching medication side effects and horror stories online, and such, and I can't seem to control myself."
6880,"I am taking medication, but I know I have to change the way I handle these thoughts if I want true change."
6881,So i had  anxiety with panic attacks since about 6 months...i had actually anxiety all my life but the panic attacks started a few months ago.
6882,My panic attacks got triggerd by a medication for the first time.
6883,From that time i have fear to take medicines (I always read the leaflet hundred times and every symptom of side effect in every meds causes fear).
6884,I am taking Seroquel XR 200 since a year now.
6885,It helps a lot for my sleep.
6886,Before i had panic attacks i was very happy and i did not notice many side effects at all.
6887,"Now that i have anxiety i have this problem:
The problem is that 2 hours i take it my heart starts beating pretty fast maybe 120bpm."
6888,When this happens i get extremly worried.
6889,I always think that i am not gonna get up anymore the next morning (that i will die in the sleep).
6890,"I also use google to search for keywords like ""seroquel irrregular heartbeat"" or ""seroquel tachycardia"" etc."
6891,etc.
6892,Today i found in the leaflet that it is possible to die from seroquel.
6893,I got anxiety from that.
6894,Its always a circle of thoughts.
6895,I know it is rare but i cannot get that out of my head.
6896,"My heart is completly fine, i got it checked a month ago, but i can still not get rid of my thoughts."
6897,"Does anyone else have ""pill anxiety""?"
6898,any suggestions how to deal with it?
6899,?
6900,"I ran out of real meds two days ago, and within the last two months, have fully redeveloped my insomnia."
6901,"Before I had friends and could go out for a drink or two and a deep convo but now it's medication, sleep, ekg's, and panic."
6902,"Since I've started a new job around 9 months ago, I've noticed a huge increase in the amount of anxiety I feel."
6903,"Everything from dying, losing my job, living poor in a box, how other's see me, and passing out on a moments notice."
6904,"I have never experienced these feelings before other than the fear of the unknown, or your typical anxiety before public speaking type events."
6905,I'm dreadfully afraid of assessments and generally anything where someone is watching over me.
6906,"I don't feel confident like I once did and constantly feel like people are ""grading"" me."
6907,There are times when my face turns red and I sweat uncontrollably... My body heats up as though I was standing on a fire pit.
6908,"Sometimes I feel a jolt in my chest, and I realize I wasn't breathing.Vertigo has become this huge part of my life."
6909,Other times I get these white flashes accompanied by a very loud sound in my head.
6910,"I get shaky, and jittery."
6911,I have a hard time finding words.
6912,Sleep is nigh impossible without some form of sedation.
6913,"I've tried breathing techniques, closing my eyes and counting to 10, etc, etc."
6914,I don't know what to do and it's beginning to control my life(or has been for awhile and I'm finally swallowing my pride to seek help from others who may have been in the same boat).
6915,This is the complete opposite of how I am outside of professional life.
6916,"I'm a very sociable person, never short of things to say, and  relate to people very well most of the time."
6917,"I have a lot of friends, great family, and a HUGE support system."
6918,This is such a stark contrast of who I am that I don't know how to even begin to approach it.
6919,"Some background: I have a history of depression, PTSD, and other things I've been ""diagnosed"" with and medicated for but nothing ever seemed to help."
6920,I've had a lot of trauma in my life but I've always been able to handle it on my own or seek help from my support system.
6921,It seems as though this job just brought everything out of me and I do all I can to hide it in my professional life.
6922,I've seen counselors and psychs pretty much my entire life.
6923,"It was to the point where everything that was said, I expected."
6924,"Every medication the was suggested, I tried for quite some time before, to no avail."
6925,I feel as though I could be a psychiatrist with all the experience I have sitting in a room with them hearing them tell me things I knew they were going to say.
6926,"In fact, almost everyone I know comes to me with the same problems I have and it seems I can help them with no problem."
6927,"When it comes to practicing what I preach, nothing."
6928,I have an anxiety and a general distrust for medications that alter the chemical makeup of the mind anyway.
6929,"Not to mention one doc in particular I had been seeing who gave me everything under the sun to try and control these issues was raided and sent to prison for being a ""pill pusher""...it seems that unless I'm willing to ""zombify"" my mind, or numb it in some other fashion...I'm doomed.There it is again...the overwhelming sense of inevitable doom."
6930,Sorry for the rant.
6931,For the past three days now I've been feeling more anxiety and fear than I had before I started taking the medication.
6932,I've never been one for medication if something can be cured without it.
6933,I don't have health insurance now so taking to someone/getting meds isn't an option.
6934,What happens when you can't get your meds for whatever reason?
6935,"The next day, I took the meds and zofran, but I still felt like I was on the verge of another psychotic break."
6936,"The ER doctors and my Primary basically told me to wait until I see a Neurologist before starting on another anti-seizure medication, but things got so bad I went back to my Primary and begged to get on another drug."
6937,I do not have insurance right now so I cannot go get checked out and prescribed medication.
6938,After doing some research I found out that Propanolol isn't the go-to medication for anxiety sufferers.
6939,"I'm a firm believer that the right medication **is** a solution, contrary to popular belief."
6940,What other kind of medication can help?
6941,"I'm not sure how much longer I should give the medication, but I really do feel like I am losing my mind..."
6942,I take medication for my anxiety and I see a therapist but I still suffer from anxiety attacks :\
6943,"That was the first time I tired taking medication, I took a half a peach ( Xanax ) it helped."
6944,"But I didn't start taking them, my friends got bad into them so I always avoided taking medicine my whole life."
6945,"I got medicine for anxiety today, but I'm not sure when it will kick in."
6946,"I have some Prozac leftover I am going to consider using, but do you guys have any other suggestions on medicine?"
6947,I was put on medication but it didn't really help.
6948,Side note: Looking for ways to help anxiety without the use of medicine.
6949,Okay.
6950,First.
6951,"Background about why I'm posting:

I am new to posting here."
6952,I haven't posted before.
6953,"I am actually suffering through some panic simply trying to figure out how to ask this, especially of people I don't know."
6954,"My entire life, people have downplayed and negated my anxiety."
6955,I have had issues with general anxiety for the majority of my life.
6956,"Beginning in middle school, I was teased so horribly (but forced to endure it silently as per teachers and my narcissistic mother) that I began developing anxiety even surrounding going into school."
6957,"When I switched for high school, it improved - until my first major relationship broke up."
6958,"I was convinced I was in love with him, he was ""the one."""
6959,"(Stupid, I know.)"
6960,"Two weeks after he left me for good, my grandmother passed away."
6961,I was extremely close to her.
6962,I had an absolute mental breakdown.
6963,"Welcome, major depression and extreme panic attacks!"
6964,"I was forced into therapy, the wrong therapy."
6965,"I was forced onto medications, the ones that have caused my current cognitive impairment."
6966,I was forced - no one listened because I was not 18.
6967,"With all of those things built up, I began having cyclic panic attacks."
6968,Severe ones that would not enable me to finish my high school in the actual building.
6969,I had to finish my credits online.
6970,"Over the course of the 5 years following high school, I was involved in an abusive relationship."
6971,The panic attacks and physical symptoms were out of control.
6972,"I could hardly stay at work a full day, I didn't sleep, I was over-eating and over-drinking, I would have panic attacks for no reason... And at this point us when the panic became unmanageable."
6973,"My symptoms go as follows (even to this day): 
-heart starts beating so hard I can feel it through my chest (and see my skin moving) 
-my hands and feet begin to sweat so profusely I can neither hold anything (I'm a hairstylist) nor continue wearing my shoes."
6974,"-my hands begin visibly shaking 
-my breath becomes shallow, no matter how hard I remind myself to take slow, even breaths."
6975,"-my legs grow increasingly weak at the same time as my mind fogs up entirely, always causing me to question if I'm going to black out."
6976,"-if I'm inside, I must get outside."
6977,That very moment.
6978,No questions asked.
6979,"-if I can't leave, I begin bawling on top of everything else."
6980,Uncontrollably.
6981,"I can't stop it, the harder I try ..."
6982,The worse it gets.
6983,"-if I am at work, I must go home immediately."
6984,-I will run away if cornered or touched.
6985,"-I end up beating the side of my head repeatedly &amp; calling myself ""retarded"" or ""failure"" 
-every thought in the world rushes through my head."
6986,-I cannot drive.
6987,-I often cannot speak during panic episodes.
6988,"-I cannot sleep or stay still, I can't sit still at all if I'm panicking."
6989,-I fidget uncontrollably and will not make eye contact.
6990,"I wait, then I bolt."
6991,"-I can't handle people looking at me funny, talking in low whispers, or even existing in a certain capacity."
6992,I just want to run.
6993,"-I will spend hours in bed, in the dark, after having a panic attack whilst in the midst of having a major depressive episode."
6994,"-it causes me anxiety to be dirty, or have dirty spaces..."
6995,But I have no willpower to clean because I'm petrified of screwing up.
6996,-I can't go to the grocery store without a buddy.
6997,-I can hardly remember what I'm supposed to be doing when confronted with others.
6998,"-I can no longer work because of its severity, and the fact that medications triple the severity of every issue I have had (and I've been trying all kinds of meds for over 10 years) 


So, all that out there... My life is pretty miserable at times."
6999,I can function but I barely do so.
7000,I mostly am unable to do anything without my partner.
7001,I have applied for disability and medical coverage 3x.
7002,"I am going on my fourth attempt, after almost 6 months of being unemployed."
7003,"They counted an employment that lasted two weekends before I left in sheer panic, speeding the entire hour it took me to get home, as ""gainful."""
7004,That was the first job I'd attempted to take since October of the previous year.
7005,"That lasted two weekends, as well."
7006,I left because my anxiety and I could not handle work (even after months of intensive therapy).
7007,I am at a loss.
7008,"I cannot work, and my SO and I cannot afford to not be homeless if I don't get disability this time."
7009,"They take one look at my age &amp; my condition, and they practically deny me."
7010,I have yet to refute their claim of not qualifying.
7011,I'm wondering if I should have friends &amp; family prepared to send in statements for me.
7012,"I'm just not even sure where to start, and the whole process is absolutely overwhelming me &amp; adding to my anxiety."
7013,Off anxiety medicine for a month or so.
7014,"Didn't have meds with me so I had to wait to take those,  wish I could crush the sensation earlier on."
7015,"I've not been diagnosed, but I'm trying to find a therapist to talk about these things with, and maybe talk about medication or coping mechanisms."
7016,I am currently on anxiety meds and they are working well but then this has happened a few times randomly when I am relaxing
7017,"Okay so this might be long, around 2300 words, but any help would be so greatly appreciated as this has taken me about an hour to write."
7018,"I'm seeing a psychologist today who I've already had 3 sessions with already, but I don't know if he's really helping well: 

So I have anxiety, as you'd expect."
7019,"I've had it for basically as long as I can remember, but I never realized until two years ago when things got really bad."
7020,"I'm out of the really bad stage, and I'm sort of back to the stage I was always at but I know something is wrong that needs to be fixed."
7021,Okay so I'll try to give as many details as possible to help.
7022,"As of today, I am a 19 year old male."
7023,"Okay anyway moving on, I've always lived with both my parents and my younger 15 year old autistic brother."
7024,"I've never been a privileged child, as I suffer from NLD, and its many problems associated with it."
7025,"(Lack of fine and global motor skills, etc) As a person who loves soccer and who has friends who love to play soccer, it was sometimes painful being the worst but I got over it and got a lot better at soccer."
7026,"Still, I have trouble climbing fences, and doing other things kids my age should be doing because of those issues, but I can't complain as I know many people have it worse."
7027,Okay so there is one thing however that has stumped me in my social life.
7028,"Throughout my whole life basically, I've always worried a lot now that I look back."
7029,I have anxiety and seemed to always have it.
7030,I gained a considerable amount of weight when I was younger because I used to eat to feel better and who knows how fat I would be now if my mom wasn't so health conscious and would never buy unhealthy foods.
7031,"Anyway, middle school was probably the two best years of my life (Grade 7 and 8), as I moved from a disorganized French elementary school to a much more organized and stable English middle school."
7032,I feel this is where I started worrying about school.
7033,"Before grade 7 I wouldn't care, and would often get Cs and sometimes Ds."
7034,"However when grade 7 came, I was took over by anxiety and tried my hardest to do well to impress everyone, especially my dad."
7035,I think this came from the summer camps I used to go to.
7036,I'll explain.
7037,"When I used to go to a French school, I used to attend summer camps in the summer with people who spoke English because I am in Canada, in an English province."
7038,"I normally spoke French at home and at school, so although I was born in this province, I didn't practice that much."
7039,"Anyway, people were not nice to me at all."
7040,"I was often insulted and made fun of, and hated the summer camps, and thus developed the idea that English people are mean at a young age."
7041,I didn't know better.
7042,"So therefore, I was worried about going to the English middle school."
7043,"As I settled in, I realized they were really nice, much nicer than the people in the French school, and things got better."
7044,"I started getting As and Bs, and I felt good about myself."
7045,"I went to high school in grade 9, and the first day I actually ended up crying because I was so scared of it."
7046,I told my worries on the first day to the special education head office person and she calmed me down and helped me settle in.
7047,I did not enjoy high school.
7048,"Sure there were some good moments, but I was so anxious all the time about everything."
7049,"So grade 10 came, and I got into a game called Call of Duty back in 2009."
7050,I would often play it all the time.
7051,I couldn't focus in school because my mind was so focused on playing the game.
7052,"I never did math homework, and my marks started dropping in math."
7053,"It's not like I did it before anyway, but because my brain was so focused on the game, I couldn't focus on math."
7054,"Anyway, my dad got me a tutor and it didn't really help no matter how many hours I spent studying."
7055,I couldn't comprehend simple algebra.
7056,I understand why today.
7057,It's because of my obsession.
7058,"When I obsess about something in the future, like an upcoming event, my mind stays focused on it and I can't focus on other stuff."
7059,"Anyway so I ended up getting like a C- in math and my dad took away my PS3 for second semester, only allowing me to play it on weekends."
7060,I also got a tutor for English who was a wonderful person.
7061,My marks went higher and I became a better student in general.
7062,"I felt like whenever I talked to her, I would feel less anxious as she was such a breath of fresh air and a positive person."
7063,"She stayed my English tutor from Grade 10 to Grade 13 (I ended up going an extra year), helping me other courses along the way."
7064,"Anyway, in the summer of grade 10, I was probably at my peak weight."
7065,"I was borderline obese, not obese yet though."
7066,"My mom told me to try gluten-free, and dairy-free for a day and I did, and felt pretty good that day with less anxiety."
7067,"I then linked all my misfortunes to having eaten gluten and dairy and told my friend on chat that it was the reason why I used to act weird, etc."
7068,So I stopped eating anything that had gluten or dairy in it.
7069,Over the next months I lost a lot of weight and started getting respect from my friends and just felt better as a person.
7070,Grade 11 was probably my favourite high school year.
7071,"I still felt guilty about one thing however, and that was lying to my parents about being religious and feeling guilty for not being religious."
7072,"(I'm not religious anymore, that was back then.)"
7073,"So in the religion I used to follow, it is mandatory to pray 5 times a day, each prayer lasting about 5 minutes."
7074,"Also, before praying, if you went to the washroom to relieve yourself in anyway, or if you just passed gas, you'd have to wash your face, hands, feet, etc."
7075,So as you can see it wasn't easy but I started doing it.
7076,I then noticed my life got a lot better.
7077,This was because my anxiety levels went down a lot.
7078,"This was in May 2011, so the end of grade 11."
7079,My life just got a lot better and yeah I felt great.
7080,"I didn't feel muscle tension in my body anymore, so it felt great."
7081,There was only one problem.
7082,"Whenever I used to read about people who were against my religion online and what they said, I felt very worried and started getting panic attacks and immediately had to go on a site that promoted good things about it."
7083,"Then in the end of December 2011, I was done."
7084,"I wanted to get to the bottom of it so I kept reading things against it and I had a really bad panic attack and begged my dad to go back to the hotel room (we were at a religious conference), where I started crying really badly."
7085,"I was in total shatters, I felt my life was going to be ruined just because I was doubting my faith."
7086,"When school started I couldn't do it, I simply couldn't."
7087,"I had suicidal thoughts everyday, and had to go to the hospital 4 times in 4 months for stating that I wanted to kill myself."
7088,"I went on medications for a year and a half, but those didn't help so I went off of them."
7089,"So throughout all of 2012, I wasn't in school."
7090,"The beginning of 2013 was better so I started and finished the remaining semester of high school that I had, but I still felt like something was missing."
7091,"I didn't have panic attacks, but I constantly had muscle tension, headaches, and just plain anxiety."
7092,So I made the decision that I wouldn't go to university in September of 2013 despite being accepted in an effort to try and get rid of this issue.
7093,"I got a job in September at a grocery store as a cashier but although the manager appreciated my effort and attitude, I took too long to adapt to the job and so he offered me a different position in dish washing, to which I declined and terminated my job."
7094,"I spent the next few months at home, and here I am now."
7095,"These past months, I have learned a lot."
7096,"I know a lot of you will be against me for saying this, but I decided to try smoking marijuana out of desperation to see if anything would happen, and I noticed that my thinking was a lot deeper and I was able to use it to try and find the root of my anxiety problems."
7097,"So anyway, I learned a lot which I will tell you."
7098,"But in January, I came home a little high and my dad ended up finding out to which he was extremely disappointed."
7099,"I tried to explain to him why I did it, but to no avail."
7100,"So I just told him I would stop, and I did."
7101,I decided I would stop doing it if I was near the house or was going to be near the house soon and would only do it if I'd be sleeping over somewhere else where the chances of getting caught would be minimal.
7102,"In February 2014, this month, my friend invited me to see him at his residence for 2 nights."
7103,I decided to smoke marijuana there and got really worried about schizophrenia because my dad told me that someone in his family had it after he found out I smoked.
7104,"I don't know if he said that to scare me, but whatever his intention was, it did."
7105,"The last day, I did marijuana again while at a party and it was the night where I learned the most about myself."
7106,"It started off with a really bad trip, until a friend took me back to the residence and then I started talking to my friend's roommate and opened up completely."
7107,"Oh I forgot to say that I got over my religion issues and now no longer practice or believe in it, or any religion for that matter."
7108,"If my parents found out I no longer believe in it they would be very disappointed, so I'm trying to keep that away from them."
7109,"Now that I gave you my story up until now, I will explain to you what I found out I have: 

- I have muscle tension, tension headaches, and basically tension around my whole body which makes me feel very uncomfortable."
7110,"I didn't have this when I used to be religious, and that is what made me find out something after I gave it up, as I went straight back to having muscle tension again."
7111,- I obsess about future events a lot.
7112,"For example, if I am going to a birthday party tonight or something, I would continuously think about it over and over again and wouldn't appreciate the present moment."
7113,"I noticed that it gives me energy, optimism and excitement, but it makes my headaches and tension so much worse."
7114,"Actually, I'm started to think that it's the cause of it since I am always thinking of the future in one way or another."
7115,- I have perfectionism and I believe that is the cause of my anxiety.
7116,I found this out about a week ago so this idea is still fresh.
7117,I'll explain my perfectionism as best as I can: I think it was more about believing I am a morally/mentally perfect person and having to maintain that belief in me caused me a lot of stress.
7118,"Whenever I made mistakes, or did things that weren't normal, I found an excuse for it."
7119,"(Usually my excuse being because I am stressed and that it will stop once I find a solution to my problem, and then I put a lot of emphasis on wanting to find a solution to my problem and as a result I would obsess about feeling better and would just wait until I would feel better and not take action in anything.)"
7120,I'm starting to realize why I was so obsessed with God.
7121,I think it's because I felt like the only thing that mattered was with religion and so I felt the need to be perfect in everything I did with religion.
7122,And then I also did every single school homework question as well.
7123,"Whenever I made a mistake in religion, for example, prayed a prayer late, I would feel really bad."
7124,"Also, seeing myself at school as one of the most religious people at Friday prayers made me feel really good about myself."
7125,Like I have the tendency to try and make everything I do perfect and I take a long time making decisions as well.
7126,"Even in convenience stores, it takes me forever to decide what chips to buy, or whether to get cookies or chips, etc."
7127,"- Lastly, I also think my dad had a part in my perfectionism."
7128,I also think my dad had a part in causing this.
7129,Ever since I was young I always admired him a lot and listened to everything he told me because in my eyes he was very intelligent and wise.
7130,"The thing is, my dad has always been a pessimistic person who rarely takes risks and always makes things seem much harder and more important than they actually are, and so I took life very seriously and developed a sort of anxiety towards it I suppose."
7131,So yeah that's all I have to say.
7132,"I know it's really long, but if any of you could help me, it would be greatly appreciated."
7133,"If you have any questions, I will answer them."
7134,Thanks!
7135,:)
7136,I took anxiety medication in the past but it didn't really do much and I got tired of not drinking alcohol I'm not an alcoholic I'm just 21 and like to go out with friends regularly.
7137,"I have just been prescribed Buspar and Paxil to fight a depression/anxiety combination and was just wondering if anyone else is on or has been on these two medications together or separately, and what to expect and your experiences with them."
7138,Thanks in advance!
7139,"I take Cymbalta and after months of steady improvement with therapy and medication, I've tapered my dosage down to 20mg (lowest) where it will stay for a while."
7140,I had a major panic attack last week relating to my son's recent diagnosis with Type 1 Diabetes.
7141,After confirming with the hospital that there was really nothing wrong with me (not having a heart attack) I have started therapy and wanted to get a doctor's prescription to refill my Xanax and perhaps go on a SSRI.
7142,Before the appointment they wanted me to get some blood tests.
7143,"Well the test results came in, except I had high blood sugar."
7144,"Not high enough to be diabetes, or even pre-diabetes but the doctor was worried enough that the nurse called to tell me."
7145,"Of course, I don't have diabetes or pre-diabetes."
7146,I have been checking my blood sugar all the time these days with my son's equipment and know that my blood sugar levels are normal.
7147,"Unfortunately, my anxiety being all around diabetes, this didn't help."
7148,I actually for a while convinced myself that I had it.
7149,"I did a fasting glucose check, and a glucose tolerance test myself... and my pancreas passed with flying colours."
7150,"Thanks doc, for still not getting me the medications I am looking for, while emphasizing the thing that I am most panicked about."
7151,...the past 2 years of my life haven't gone well.
7152,I got fired halfway through an internship in Florida and moved back in with my mom for a while.
7153,"Came out of the closet, fell in love with an amazing young man (who's honestly been the BEST thing that's happened to me since I moved home), and scraped by on a waiter job until I had enough to move elsewhere."
7154,"I found a full-time job that ended up exacerbating my anxiety, as did the next one."
7155,"I've played brain juice roulette with a total of 3 different medications and 1 supplement, and the 3rd medication is doing reasonably well."
7156,"My car died September of last year, a couple weeks after I went to the ER for suicidal thoughts; I returned in an ambulance 2 months after that."
7157,"The last job fired me on my anniversary with them--the longest I've ever continuously been employed with a company--because of those mental issues; fortunately now I'm on Medicaid and unemployment, seeking vocational rehab, and working a part-time job until I can get back on my feet."
7158,"Unfortunately, my cell phone was stolen right out of my hands on the bus ride home from work last night."
7159,"I feel mentally, physically, and emotionally tired and spent and I'd like to take a vacation to someplace warm ASAP."
7160,"Good news is that I have about a thousand dollars in savings, mostly for rent, as well as some awesomely supportive friends and family."
7161,So that's where I'm at right now.
7162,Thanks for reading and I hope this will help someone understand.
7163,"Me (to good friend): ""Yeah so I halved my anti anxiety meds and I've just been having a really rough time coping, I can't sleep, my generalized everyday anxiety is through the roof...""
good friend: ""You're probably just stressed about work, you probably just need to relax a little""."
7164,"(Visited a psychologist to see if this was a good plan, she agreed)

My situation is as follows, this has happened a few times…

I take my daily meds at night, because my wake up time does vary quite a bit."
7165,"For example: Last night I stayed at my boyfriends house, came home this morning and didn't realize that I forgot to take my meds until around 4."
7166,"I was feeling unusually exhausted and out of it and started wondering why, then realized I forgot the meds."
7167,I don't have any medication for anxiety.
7168,"Taking medication has never been easy for me (medicine in general, not anti anxiety) as I hate the thought of not being in control of myself."
7169,My question to you all is how do you find the courage to take your medication?
7170,"Basically, I know I've had anxiety and have taken medicine for it in the past; it was diagnosed by a doctor, and let that not be of any concern furthermore in this."
7171,I dont know where else to turn and I hate the meds I keep getting put on (Prozac and zoloft).
7172,"What kinds of different medications have you tried, and what worked?"
7173,"And if one didn't work, what was your experience like with it?"
7174,"Have you tried/experienced different SSRI's (if you took any, and if so, did different formulations of SSRI's feel different?"
7175,"(i.e., Prozac vs. Zoloft vs. Lexapro)

Just out of pure curiosity, (hopefully) future medical student here, with mild anxiety issues, and a wild love of understanding drug mechanisms in the human body."
7176,I want to hear unbiased experiences.
7177,"The therapy didn't really help (it may have just been my therapist), but I began taking medication to clear the fog."
7178,"Eventually the medication started doing more harm than good, though."
7179,She also told me that I would definitely need to give medication another try.
7180,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Since all of this has gone down, I've also been formally diagnosed with combined type Adult ADHD and am on medication for that as well."
7181,"For years, I didn't want to be on medication because I, like so many others, thought I should be able to ""handle it"" myself."
7182,"I am on medication, but quite low doses."
7183,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If anyone needs to talk about anxiety or medication or ADHD or anything, really, feel free to contact me."
7184,"I don't want to take any medication, and it's difficult finding a therapist here in Japan."
7185,](http://www.medicinenet.com/mitral_valve_prolapse/page2.htm) am pissed.
7186,"I hate medication, and therapy does not do anything for me after trying it for a month."
7187,"I really want to go to the doctors to try and get some meds, but I am scared of the side effects."
7188,"Obviously I'll talk to my doc before I make a decision, I'm just wondering if anyone has experience with non-SSRI, non-benzo meds for anxiety."
7189,I did okay off meds for a bit but then had a bad episode and decided to try a different SSRI.
7190,"TL;DR SSRIs make me fat, benzos make me tired, brain seems to require meds for decent results."
7191,I have been on about 10 different meds and am currently on 60mg of Paxil daily.
7192,"I've been prescribed with medication, and have plans to meet with a counselor in the fall."
7193,"I have been suffering from anxiety for the last eleven years, recently diagnosed bipolar, and started taking medicine for these conditions."
7194,"I know it's not the other medicine, because I still had the palpitations with it."
7195,"I know that because it worked for me it might not for you, and maybe some of you can't take supplements with your medication."
7196,"I'm looking for a solution to try and get on meds, but my agoraphobia stops be from being able to get to the doctor or eve getting gas for my car most of the time."
7197,"The problem is I want to try meds so I can leave the house and not be afraid, but I can't seem to get those meds because I have these panic attacks and vomit with my panic."
7198,"""People would come to me for medication management or things like that."""
7199,Management of existing medication regimens (which seems to me to be more in the realm of a general practitioner) or the use of medication to manage psychological disorders?
7200,I've suffered from anxiety as long as I can remember and have been taking medicine for about 5 years now and finally have it mostly under control.
7201,I am without easy/affordable access to healthcare providers so I have been off or without my anxiety meds for a while.
7202,Does anyone have an herbal supplements or advice on how to lessen the effects of anxiety without medication?
7203,"We are in our second year of college, and it is very stressful for her."
7204,First semester last year she had to withdraw because of an anxiety attack.
7205,She also gets very stressed and upset about tests/grades.
7206,"She wants to do well for herself, but to the point where she only considers A's acceptable and panics if she gets less than that."
7207,Now she is dealing with a ton of issues in and outside of classes and it is overwhelming her again.
7208,"Many of the issues are simply too big for her to be worrying about all the time, she can't directly influence them but she worries about them despite being unable to change them."
7209,I am a very laid back person and don't get stressed often so I don't know much about helping.
7210,"I keep telling her to do what she enjoys and try to not let her worries control her life, but I don't know how to help her."
7211,She doesn't seem to know how to not let them control her.
7212,"I just don't know what, if anything, I can do to help her."
7213,She has gone to therapy in the past and has medications she takes daily.
7214,"Not sure if there is much you guys can tell me, but any ideas on ways I can help her overcome it or be more supportive would be excellent."
7215,Thanks.
7216,"I have a second interview later today at a theater company - so not a super formal environment - but I am freaking out a little bit since I'm on medication that is making me feeling totally foggy, a little dizzy and not super eloquent."
7217,(also tired... and did I mention - zonked on meds??)
7218,"Just out of curiosity, what are the /r/anxiety community's feelings towards medications, particularly benzodiazepines?"
7219,I take klonopin daily and have no problem being physically dependent on a prescription drug if it relieves my anxiety.
7220,"I am monitored by a psychiatrist, and will be starting therapy sometime soon, hopefully."
7221,"My SO was very freaked out, and told me later it was as though I had taken WAY too much Lorazepam, and just zoned out completely (note: i had not have any meds in 24 hours prior to this.)"
7222,I would prefer not to see a therapist/take meds but looking at my own writing it appears I'm pretty fucked up.
7223,"Although I tend to be way over worried about job security (probably unnecessarily), I probably wouldn't have thought I'd medication."
7224,Medications have always made me nervous because I've seen a lot of people I know turn into terrible bitches on medication or become sort of emotion-less or gain a ton of weight and I don't want any of those things to happen.
7225,They make me afraid to go on meds.
7226,Should I be on medication or what?
7227,"What I was wondering, however, was how affordable medication is."
7228,And how did meds help you get better?
7229,I was put on medication at 15 and was on meds from then until April of this year.
7230,"At this point, I am not doing well, but I never did well on medication either."
7231,I don't think I'm really doing any better or worse than during the breakthrough anxiety periods I had on medication.
7232,I've been on medication for anxiety for over a decade.
7233,"Hello-
This is my first post here, and I'd like to apologize in advance for any misspellings or missteps - I've drank quite a bit tonight."
7234,"To make a long story short, I've felt that I've had an anxiety disorder along with major depressive disorder for roughly 10 years, although I've yet to be professionally diagnosed."
7235,"I'm starting a new job soon and along with that job comes health benefits, which includes mental health - after ninety days."
7236,"I'm strongly considering seeking help once I'm able to thanks to these benefits but I'm also very apprehensive about it, to the point where it might again prevent me from seeking the help I need."
7237,"Aside from the usual fears of being on drugs that will turn me into a different person or make my suicidal tendencies worse, or the fear that therapy won't help, I've also been overwhelmed with the realization that I won't be able to safely drink alcohol while on most medications."
7238,I've just recently turned 21 and alcohol has become a large part of my life.
7239,How did you guys overcome your fear of seeking help and do you possibly have any advice for me?
7240,Thank you.
7241,"Three days ago, my mother attempted suicide."
7242,"For privacy's sake, I won't go too in depth on the reasons."
7243,"She's suffered from depression for a very long time, and it's gotten worse lately due to an injury causing her daily pain, which also prevents her from taking care of her daughter (my sister, special needs, needs assistance with everything)."
7244,"For the last several months since the injury, my sister has been staying with my dad, who, in spite of his denial, is outwardly rude and cruel to my mother."
7245,"He's made her feel even more guilty than she already feels, saying she's ""abandoned"" my sister."
7246,"This combined with a multitude of other reasons slowly built into a clusterfuck of stress, which boiled over three days ago."
7247,"Currently she's in the hospital, and recovery is slow."
7248,"They've got a medication they're giving her that protects her kidneys and liver from the pain pills/other medications she overdosed on (we honestly don't know what all she took, but the potential amount makes it a miracle she's even alive), but it tastes like shit and she's been refusing it."
7249,"I've dealt with anxiety for a few years now, and it was just starting to get better."
7250,"I was doing well in my classes, I'd met a girl I really like, finally got in good enough shape to happy with my body, and my social life was better than ever."
7251,But now it feels like my entire world is falling apart.
7252,"I haven't been to a single class this week, haven't talked to that girl at all this week except to tell her what happened, and I haven't seen my friends in two weeks."
7253,"I feel absolutely useless, and powerless to change anything."
7254,"She reminds me of a child, crying and refusing her meds, asking for her mother, clamping her mouth shut when we get a syringe to make her take the medication, crying ""no"" over and over again."
7255,"For the first day all we could get out of her was ""I don't know"" and ""I've lost my mind""."
7256,Yesterday she barely spoke at all.
7257,"The pain, confusion, and especially the shame in her eyes, hurts so much to see."
7258,It's the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
7259,"The worst part is she genuinely believes that what she did was wrong, and evil (literally her words)."
7260,"She believes that she's ruined all our lives, and that there is no recovering from this."
7261,"We keep telling her it's not true, that we love her, and we're doing everything we can to bring her back."
7262,"My brother flew across the country to be here, and her sister is flying here this Saturday."
7263,Even the nurses keep telling her how lucky she is to be so loved and have so many people who care about her.
7264,"We really are trying, but I feel like she doesn't want to be saved, that she wants us to just let her die."
7265,"I don't know what to do, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out."
7266,"I can't even keep it together half the time I'm in the room with her, I've cried more in the last three days than I have in the last three years."
7267,Sorry for the rambling wall of text.
7268,I just needed to let this out.
7269,"If anyone has any advice, thoughts, sympathies, suggestions, I'll take about anything at this point."
7270,"I just want her back, even if she's not her old self anymore, we all just want her back."
7271,"***TL;DR My mom tried to commit suicide, I'm slowly losing my mind."
7272,What the fuck do I do?
7273,***
7274,So I have an appointment with a psychiatrist next week; I've been to psychologists and my own GP before for medication/treatment - but never to an actual 'psychiatrist'.
7275,"The reason I am going is to find a specific medication that will work for me, but I am a bit nervous about it all."
7276,"I have never had such tests done before from my local doctor even when changing medication, I had a blood test when I was first diagnosed with CBT to rule out other causes."
7277,I have to take antibiotics for a couple days and in total would be 3 rounds of meds to help remove this out of me.
7278,Because of this I probably won't end up taking the meds but I do wanna get better.
7279,"I'm practicing mindfulness, which I'll admit I could do a lot more of, as well as taking medication and frequent meetings with my psychiatrist."
7280,My girlfriend and I have been together for many years.
7281,"She's always been type A, stressed and structured, but over the last couple of years she's been suffering from anxiety."
7282,"It seems to have started after she lost her grandfather, who was a massive support structure for her entire life."
7283,We used to live with her parents and the attacks were very bad.
7284,She would fight with them all the time and end up in several-hours-long attacks.
7285,"We're moved out now and they are less frequent, but still come without warning and can have huge effects on her."
7286,The biggest problem right now is that she refuses to seek professional help.
7287,She hates hospitals and doctors.
7288,She's been prescribed an anxiety medication but doesn't take it because she doesn't like how it affects her mood otherwise.
7289,There's always an excuse not to seek more help.
7290,She's terrified of the side effects of most medications.
7291,She doesn't want to feel like a zombie.
7292,She's firm in believing that therapy is a total waste of time and money.
7293,All the while her attacks are putting a rift between us.
7294,She has an attack.
7295,I can't help her.
7296,"She hates that I can't help her, and I hate how she acts afterward."
7297,She's passive-aggressive.
7298,"Won't talk to me for hours, throws and breaks things out of anger."
7299,Sometimes she has an attack and I have no idea because she goes into another room.
7300,Then I find out afterward and it's worse than when I am around.
7301,So what can I do to help her here?
7302,How do I convince her that this is not going to be resolved until she seeks help?
7303,How do I convince her that seeking further help *will* make things better?
7304,That therapy isn't a total quack.
7305,"And in the meantime, how do I help when she has an attack?"
7306,I've personally gone to therapy when I was a teenager for ADHD.
7307,I think it helped but she sees it as me still having problems so it didn't work.
7308,I'm going to see someone again as an adult and hopefully that will help convince her to see someone as well.
7309,I'm currently not taking medication.
7310,Which anxiety medicine have you guys had good experiences with?
7311,"Despite therapy and meds, keep getting worse...."
7312,"I've taken so much medication that I rattle when I walk, everything from benzos, beta blockers, SSRI, SSNRI, self medication with alcohol."
7313,"I had sought counselling in high school for depression, but I did not ever get counselling or meds for my anxiety in college."
7314,"Is it possible that I can make it without meds, just by myself?"
7315,Should I tell my doctor to higher my dosage or maybe switch to an other medication?
7316,I heard that adderal is the strongest medication for ADHD so if it doesn't work for me what is gonna work?!?
7317,I'm well aware this could come from codependency related to my mothers severe alcoholism but with all the therapy and medication I can't seem to change.
7318,"I wasn't on medication at the time (I have been medicated in the past, but when I feel I'm in a place where I can control my anxiety, I go off of it), and now I'm back on my medication, but it doesn't really appear to be working."
7319,"He freaks out when he has to take medicine, go to the dentist."
7320,"I should add that she's not the type to take medicine, go to counseling, therapy, or understand that she even has anxiety."
7321,So yesterday he switched my meds.
7322,"I have my medication with me, but this is really bothering me."
7323,At least the medication allows me to ask other people like you folks for help now.
7324,"Also, I'm not sure if it's the meds, but I've been constantly feeling like I'm forgetting something, or forget what I'm about to go do."
7325,its one of the things my anxiety meds doesn't help with at all.
7326,"Just want to say that if this medication worked for you, great!"
7327,"The doctor and therapist both told me that this medication had minimal side effects, no weight gain, and withdrawal was easy."
7328,"I know I needed the medication when I went on it, but I can't help feeling that it was a bad decision because of what it did to me."
7329,I went out to the car and freaked out because I knew without some Lind of anxiety medication is end IP back in the hospital.
7330,After two visits to the ER in two months I saw my doctor who prescribed me Zoloft and Xanax.
7331,I'm not big on taking medications but I figured I would start the Zoloft and use Xanax as needed until my therapy sessions start.
7332,"Any how, I'm feeling a tremendous amount of anxiety today and I took one Xanax and it doesn't seem to be helping at all, the doc prescribed .25mg's is it ok to take another?"
7333,How much is ok?
7334,"As someone with a family history of anxiety/depression, and has just recently began struggling with it, I've gotta say I feel for ALL of you who have to deal with this."
7335,"Best of luck to all, and thanks to anyone who can help."
7336,"Either in therapy, medication, approaches...etc?"
7337,"Most of the initial side effects have gone, however I'm still not feeling the medication having any effect."
7338,I've been looking into hypnotherapy for my anxiety/agoraphobia since no medication seems to be helping nor does CBT.
7339,the meds i got was from a surgery on my eye.
7340,Every medication I have tried that helps my chronic anxiety makes me suicidal and depressed.
7341,Is there anyone out there who has stopped their meds?
7342,I don't want to take medicine because I know I'm my own worst enemy.
7343,Has anyone had any similar experiences or know of maybe a different medication that mighty work better?
7344,"First a little bit about me: 

My doctor told me about six months ago that I have general anxiety disorder and a panic disorder."
7345,"I always knew I was way too anxious, but I never really looked into it."
7346,I just dealt with it.
7347,"I also didn't even realize that panic attacks weren't something that always go with anxiety, so it was a shock to me to find out I have panic disorder."
7348,I thought everyone with anxiety had panic attacks for some reason.
7349,Depression has always been a part of the anxiety too.
7350,"I don't know if it's a symptom or its own little disorder, but I get really sad or apathetic kind of often."
7351,"Lately, it seems to be more apathetic rather than sad."
7352,I just don't see the point in much.
7353,I'm so scared of dying too.
7354,It feels like it interferes with me living my life the way I want to.
7355,"I know I need to see a therapist, and I plan on it, but it has to wait until September."
7356,I've tried four different medications in the past six months.
7357,"First was Lexapro, and that lasted the longest."
7358,"It seemed to work the best, though still not perfect, but it made me gain weight and I had absolutely no sex drive."
7359,"So, my doctor added Wellbutrin to try and counter the sex drive/weight thing, but it kind of made me go suicidal crazy."
7360,I thought nothing was real and I was convincing myself that no one was what I thought they were.
7361,"Needless to say, I got off of both after about three months."
7362,"Then, he put me on Buspirone."
7363,I took that one for about two months and then stopped by myself.
7364,It just didn't feel right.
7365,"The fourth one I was prescribed was propranolol, which is only for the symptoms of anxiety during a performance or speech, such as shaking hands and sweating."
7366,"It works, but I'm still just as nervous."
7367,"Now that I've said all that, I've been looking into natural remedies recently."
7368,I'm kind of freaked out by the medication after my run in with Wellbutrin and all the terrible side effects.
7369,"Everyone always says that exercise helps, but I never really hear about people that it has helped."
7370,I wanted to see if any of you have been helped majorly by exercise?
7371,Or any thing that isn't a prescription?
7372,"I read about drinking green tea, l-theanine, St. John's Wort, etc."
7373,and I'm going to try those things.
7374,"Is there any hope for fixing myself naturally with just exercise, those things, and a therapist?"
7375,I'm so tired of feeling this way.
7376,"I'm 20 years old, and I've been so mentally unstable for pretty much the entire time."
7377,I'm also a female in the US with insurance since the rules say I should state these things.
7378,Sorry for the super long post.
7379,"I just didn't know which info was necessary and which wasn't, so I put it all."
7380,TL;DR Has exercise helped you in a major way when it comes to anxiety/depression?
7381,Is there any hope for living a better life without medication?
7382,"The medication I take has been working for me, evening out my mood-- until recently."
7383,"Well, medication but I don't know if that ever helped."
7384,"I've tried medication, I've tried therapy, I've tried breathing and telling myself it's gonna be okay."
7385,I am 20 years old and have had social anxiety my whole life and even though its gotten better with medication and therapy it still holds me back in many regards.
7386,"Hi all

I have recently been suffering from quite bad anxiety."
7387,I have always been someone who stresses a lot but this is a whole different ballgame and really impacting on my ability to go about my day to day life.
7388,It started with a minor car accident that I convinced myself was going to cost me tens of thousands of dollars.
7389,I spent days crying about it and barely sleeping.
7390,Ended up costing me $200.
7391,The latest issue is auditing for a charity I'm on the board of.
7392,"Completely convinced we've screwed something up (I just don't know what yet and some basic legal advice has said that is highly unlikely), that I will end up with a criminal record and won't be able to pursue my career or travel in the future."
7393,Just typing it I know it sounds crazy.
7394,But I'm 50% convinced now and in the height of my panic I'm absolutely SURE it's going to happen.
7395,"At times the anxiety is so bad that I have considered dropping out of university, not going to work, or even at one point had some suicidal thoughts because the idea of continuing on with this fear is almost unbearable."
7396,Has anyone else had this problem?
7397,Honestly it's like hypochondria but to the world at large...
7398,So worried about EVERY potential problem and convinced it's going to screw up my entire life.
7399,"If anyone could lend some support or advice, that would be great."
7400,Thank you!
7401,"I'm in Aus, no medications but booked in to see a counsellor on Tuesday."
7402,Slight history of depression but nothing serious before the car incident.
7403,I use a medication called Clonazepam i use it orally and slip a pill under my tongue.
7404,I guess if it wasn't for the medication I probably would have a massive panic attack.
7405,I thought it was a side effect of my ADHD meds until yesterday.
7406,"I was feeling anxious, and made a mental note that my new meds also made me anxious, when I realized I never took my meds that day."
7407,I want to study medicine.
7408,"I don't want to increase my medication just to work without sobbing in the bathroom, I just need some time to calm down and get my brain back in a regular function mode."
7409,"Since it's the first time ever on this island that they use this medicine, they had to get a license, order from another country ect ect.. well."
7410,I have a prescription for prozac to help the anxiety but my psychiatrist said that the medication for ADD makes people anxious so he can't start me on that until he sees how I do with the prozac long term.
7411,"Does anyone else have anxiety and ADD, how did the ADD medication effect your anxiety or vice versa?"
7412,"It even led to me facing the fact that yes, I needed to fix something, talking to my doctor, starting medication, etc."
7413,Did medication seem to help?
7414,I've suffered from severe anxiety/depression for over 20 years.
7415,We are in financial difficulty (always have been because of this) and now my husband is pressuring me to get a part-time job.
7416,I am on several medications but I still get immobilized by anxiety attacks just thinking of going on a job interview.
7417,I hate myself so much for this and I don't know what to do.
7418,I had to quit a teaching career when I was in my 20's because of this.
7419,I feel so hopeless.
7420,Any suggestions for how to deal with this?
7421,I am interested in how some of you in this community deal with this and how you deal with other's lack of knowledge regarding the terror of this condition
7422,"During the school year I attended therapy with a private professional,and was prescribed medication that I had to take at school instead of home because of my parents."
7423,I was only ever given my medication on campus because my mother purposely neglected to otherwise.
7424,"But then the school year ended-and with it,the therapy sessions and medication intakes."
7425,"Hello, beautiful people!"
7426,"I had to create a new account to post on here for various reasons, but never mind that."
7427,I am a 27 year old married female living in Southern California.
7428,"I have dealt with anxiety since I was little, but I started having full blown panic attacks about a year ago."
7429,"It all started when I had to get a bunch of dental work done for a few months, then I caught a flu and BAM."
7430,Health anxiety hit me with full force.
7431,"This then led to depression and OCD (which is something that I have also dealt with before, but never to this extent)."
7432,"I've tried therapy, self-help books, medications and just plain ol' doing it on my own."
7433,"Each one has had it's benefits, but here I am today, and still struggling."
7434,"Right now, my OCD is what taking over and it's exhausting."
7435,"I wash my hands I don't even know how many times a day, and my hands and dry, painful and cracked."
7436,I hope I will find some comfort here with you guys while we all tread along this journey together.
7437,I hope you guys are feeling okay tonight!
7438,:)
7439,Can medication help with phobias?
7440,My mother just recently mentioned that doctors reccomender anti anxiety meds when I was 12 for problems I was having sleeping and in school.
7441,I had not taken Versed or any anti anxiety medicine by the way.
7442,The anesthesiologist put a medicine in the IV drip to calm me down and I felt so much better really quickly.
7443,"The anesthesiologist put more medicine into the IV, and this time it burned pretty bad."
7444,- My other doctors prescribed me migraine medication and gave me tinted glasses to wear.
7445,"Seeing a psychiatrist is $200-300 a pop, and I can't afford that kind of thing, especially when trying to work out the right meds."
7446,Keep in mind I'm trying to avoid any meds just for the sake of learning and not depending on things with side effects and things I have to pay for.
7447,I keep forgetting to call my therapist to resume visits and talk about the possibility of medication.
7448,"The good thing - I survived everything and I didn´t had a heart attack ;-)
I never took any medication but I changed my way of living."
7449,"**I didnt use medication or a regular shrink and I dont think you require medication either, but if it helps then stay on it."
7450,Any alternatives to melatonin that you may be aware of or any other medication that's known to help people ease their way through benzo withdrawal?
7451,"I'm getting the IV done and i think either they're gonna put too much in, or whatever is in the IV is gonna react with my medicine or one of my mental issues and ill never wake up."
7452,"Normally, my anxiety medication is fine for this, but now I'm moving."
7453,"At 1:00 am, I took a 1mg risperidone (that I was prescribed a long time ago - I'm not on any meds now) to help me sleep."
7454,I'm getting back on some meds - I can't handle this anymore.
7455,"I have some ativan on me, but I haven't taken it in a while and would like to face this with out medication."
7456,The nausea would keep randomly showing up so I started taking the medication and it's helped for the most part.
7457,I sometimes have to double up on the meds if I know I'm going to be in a situation where nausea may arise (like meeting my boyfriend's parents recently).
7458,The meds help for the most part but also don't completely stop it from happening.
7459,"I'm not on medicine, and it doesn't look like I'll be getting the help I probably need until I'm old enough to go to the doctor without my parents knowing."
7460,"2) I do not want to go into a locked psych ward because of a traumatic experience as a teenager (I was locked up and restrained and injected with meds for refusing to take medication I didn't like), so I'm looking for more of a private treatment facility instead of a really clinical or hospital setting."
7461,"I really, REALLY don't want to use medication."
7462,"Off medication, worrying less, no panic attacks, etc."
7463,Is anxiety medication something that could help?
7464,Hey everyone!
7465,This is my first post ever so bare with me if I'm not doing right.
7466,First off I have had anxiety since I was about 7 and have been medicated on 10mg of Fluoxitine since I was 13.
7467,"I stopped last year and it was the first time since I could remember that I could actual feel strong emotions, almost euphoric like."
7468,For almost a year I was free from my medication until I started getting such bad panic attacks that I wouldn't even leave my dorm room.
7469,"I started back on Fluoxitine since this February, and I noticed instantly that my panic attacks have basically gone, but I have lost my emotions once again, and desire to do things such as study, play my guitar, exercise, etc..."
7470,"I haven't got depressed because of this, but I am very frustrated and I was wondering if you guys have had similar situations going back on your medications."
7471,Any insight would be awesome!
7472,Just keep being strong and breathing people!
7473,We can overcome this!
7474,I have been being treated for an anxiety disorder and dysthymia for a very long time.
7475,I have done all kinds of therapy for years and tried a number of different medications.
7476,"I exercise, eat well, and sleep plenty."
7477,"I was pretty on top of it, and managed just fine."
7478,"All of a sudden, I am having multiple panic attacks a day."
7479,I have them any time that I go to class or go to work.
7480,My body feels weird and I can't go in public.
7481,I have no idea what's wrong or what is bringing it on.
7482,"I am taking a beta blocker as needed to keep myself calm, and this has been happening for a solid month now."
7483,It's getting really bad and I don't know what to do.
7484,It's so much worse than I ever imagined that it could be.
7485,"As far as I can assess, there is no specific trigger."
7486,Has anyone else experienced anything like this?
7487,Any suggestions?
7488,Thanks.
7489,"To hopefully get some meds for the voice in my head, but I have no health insurance."
7490,It's coming to the point were I'm thinking I might want to start taking meds because this is no way to go through life.
7491,"I'm just nervous because meds should not be the solution, but maybe they could help ease me into a full recovery?"
7492,I feel embarrassed and ashamed to have to tell my family doctor I want medication because of this.
7493,Hi!
7494,"I'm writing because my medication have an annoying side effect: When I first take them, I feel pretty dizzy."
7495,It last all day long.
7496,"After a day, sometime two, it pass... problem is, I sometime forget to take my medications."
7497,"Not ideal I know, but when I realize it happened, sometime a few days have passed, and then I put off taking my medication again, because I HATE how dizzy it makes me, and how it prevents me from doing even the simplest task(moving makes the dizziness worse)."
7498,Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with the dizziness?
7499,"Anyway to relieve it, so I can stop being afraid of taking it?"
7500,"(My meds: Citalopram (Anxiety, morning), Atomoxetine (ADD, morning), Teva-Quetiapine (Anxiety, Supper). )"
7501,"I'm trying to be positive about this and would love to make friends from here who are also starting a new medication regimen, so we can support each other through a rough time but my question right now is for the veterans."
7502,"I'd like to hear everyone's personal experience with a new medication regimen, good or bad."
7503,"have been unable to get to sleep on my own, my insomnia is making it hard for me to rest peacefully to the point where I am back on sleep medicine."
7504,"And yet even when I take the medicine,  I only get maybe five hours of sleep."
7505,"I am doing well in general since starting medication and attending counselling, but I have been feeling very down and empty and anxious the last few weeks..."
7506,"Plus I have been on this medication before, and it relaxed me so much, that nothing in life threatened me."
7507,"Maybe it's effects are something I'm going to need as I move through the rest of my life, but right now it seems like a kind of backwards solution for me to start taking medicine to allow me to survive in this place, when I was pretty much fine before I came here, and would probably be fine even if I had been put in a different dorm, with roommates or like a common room or something, making it a lot easier to make friends (seriously, everyone in my hall is always just in their room or out somewhere."
7508,"I'm not the biggest fan of medication as I often have averse side effects, but I want something for these physical symptoms."
7509,"Like I said, I've only been on the meds for 10 days, but the change in mood is very apparent."
7510,"In fact, he upped the dosage on my meds."
7511,"The major issue for a while was depression, which I winged without meds because I've always been avoidant  of them."
7512,I just wanted to post to tell others to not be afraid to take that step towards therapy/meds.
7513,"He prescribed the same meds I used to be on (I had run out in around October and stupidly decided I could live without them - I can't) except because of the severity of my depression and anxiety, he started my prozac at 40mg with no upward taper."
7514,I suffer from anxiety as well but will not take medicine for it.
7515,I get depressed at times and I have a hard time confronting her since I know it is the meds and I do not want to worry her.
7516,If she gets off the medicine she wont be able to work.
7517,I have looked up non medicine treatments for anxiety but they aren't doing so well.
7518,"My medication and calming methods have been doing really well, and I haven't had a major episode in nearly a year."
7519,She said they could also discuss the possibility of medication with me.
7520,I don't know if I want medication.
7521,I don't know how anxiety medication Works.
7522,"Was recommended for a mental health assessment, don't know if I want to try medication."
7523,* Should I consider medication?
7524,if so what meds?
7525,Edit: Every week when I see my therapist she asks me if I'm still against the idea of medication.
7526,"Taking medication scares me - I've heard so many horror stories of SSRI side effects and such, and since I have such bad health anxiety I feel like I'll just be all worried about what could happen to me if I take them."
7527,Have you guys had good luck with medication?
7528,"I've been on medication before and it was not a good time, and I've been in and out of therapy since I was 13 (19 now)."
7529,Yet it seems like it would be such an obvious question for a widely used medication.
7530,"I told her I had a medication question, she said she would transfer me to his assistant, but transferred me again to the wrong doctors voicemail."
7531,A little background: Both my parents have anxiety issues and are on medication on a daily basis.
7532,They need to do blood work for anxiety medication.
7533,"So I have to go to the doctor to get a fast-acting anti anxiety pill, so I can then return to the doctor the next week after having taken it, and get my blood taken so I can be put on ANOTHER type of medication, so I can have the gall to go see a therapist."
7534,I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for it but I got to talk to a psychiatrist last week for my GAD and was told/given the list of meds I should take.
7535,"My parents **do not** believe in any of these and think of my anxiety disorder as just a ""personality with a mix of anger"" (I also got recommended meds for my ADHD, which they also believe is just ""my laziness"") and that I'm perfectly normal."
7536,They'd try me on meds which I don't want.
7537,So.
7538,"Anxiety is a terrible thing, it binds us in a stricture that was meant to save us from wild animals, and choosing the wrong coloured berries."
7539,"Unfortunately, this inbuilt safety mechanism no longer serves it’s true purpose; society at large handles that i.e."
7540,"it labels our food, our drink and our poisons; and more importantly it tells us which is which."
7541,"So anxiety would seem to be redundant, a vestigial instinct that has yet to die off; but it hasn’t, not in those of us for whom decisions mark the divergence of two paths - what is, and what might have been."
7542,"I’ve had a lot af trouble with anxiety over the past eight years; it has caused me to take varying medicines of diverse shape, colour and magnitude of effect."
7543,"None of these worked, by the way."
7544,"What did work for me was understanding; understanding that which was happening to me, what caused it, and what it really meant; that was the most important one."
7545,"In the beginning I thought that I was an awful human being, in some way naturally broken."
7546,"Then a few teachers, parents, friends, and doctors made me aware that it was only a very small part of me that was broken, unfortunately it was the part that judged the scale, worth, and importance of EVERY SINGLE THING."
7547,"For a long time this affected me quite profoundly, as I was only capable of comprehending the outside world through a distorted lens; the world seemed strange and warped to me, and people did things under the yoke of seemingly wretched and arcane compulsion."
7548,"I did not understand, and we all fear that which we don’t understand."
7549,"I treated people badly, or at the very least wrongly."
7550,"I had no wish to take part in what seemed like a huge joke at my expense, and acted accordingly."
7551,"I isolated myself, from people, from actions which caused pain or confusion, and from true and authentic living."
7552,"I am sorry if I have ever hurt you, however mildly, through my actions or inertia."
7553,"I tried to cope with what I been dealt; I had mechanisms of control, which however petty or meagre, seemed to provide me with a brief respite from what seemed to be an ever worsening situation."
7554,"Unfortunately, these mechanisms of mine were not always healthy or fair."
7555,"My anxiety has gotten worse of late, and it has begun to manifest itself physically; I feel dizzy and overwhelmed by the possible myriad of situations as yet un-cast, I get chest pains; from what I hope is merely gastritis and an enflamed esophagus."
7556,"There’s just so much going on, over which should I want control, I think that I would have to, in some way, hurt somebody in order to get it."
7557,"That idea is anathema to me, but neglecting that option leaves me in a state of permanent flux; always coming off the loser, by default."
7558,"This is getting pretty incoherent, so I’m just going to say what I originally meant to say - 
Anxiety does not need to control you, or who you are, and you don’t necessarily need drugs to control it."
7559,"All it can take is realising when you are anxious, and compensating, through your behaviour and attitude."
7560,"This in itself can be difficult, and often seemingly inauthentic, but it helps."
7561,"I have spent the last ten years learning how to play an instrument, it has taken me to some strange places, and made me do some strange things; I have dropped out from university, I have lived hand to mouth, I have worked terrible jobs, I have hurt and neglected people I shouldn’t have; all to one end - I have lived with no purpose other than to create something better than myself, with imperfect tools."
7562,"For the last two years I have been recording an album with my band, and now that it is complete I feel that I have earned a small respite."
7563,Respite may be the wrong word.
7564,"I’m taking some time now, to right some wrongs, and to reshape myself as a true and authentic human being."
7565,"I intend to work harder now, and more fiercely, than I have as yet worked."
7566,I owe it to all of you who have stood by and sheltered me from the worst of the world.
7567,See you on the other side.
7568,"However, I'm curious about what I could expect from the medication both in this ""waiting period"" and once it starts to take full effect."
7569,"I have had an anxiety disorder for awhile but over the past year have been mostly successful managing it without medication, so much so I don't think I have it anymore."
7570,With some medication and hard work I thought I was finally cured!
7571,I was off of any meds for about a year but I started buspirone at the beginning of the school year (in the fall) because I couldn't deal with it anymore.
7572,I've begun to stay up considerably later than I used to (as in before I started the new meds) and not sleeping all night.
7573,"And the topic has come up in the past, but she's always told me that I need to deal with it without medication."
7574,"This is my first time posting in r/Anxiety, I just want to share my story."
7575,"I am 23 years old and have epilepsy, I have had epileptic seizures in my sleep since I was 16 or so."
7576,"At the begining I had maybe one or two seizures a year, and that grew to 1 or 2 per month when I was 18."
7577,When I was 18 I got medications and never had seizures anymore.
7578,"They told me that I had to take my medications for three years, because they thought I will overgrow epilepsy in that time."
7579,So I had big hopes that it would disapear.
7580,"Fast forward... 21 years old and I was allowed to stop my medications, I panicked..I got scared that I would get seizures again."
7581,The fear grew and grew till I didnt have the guts to go outside my house anymore.
7582,"I seeked help because this fear, shredded my sociallife and my life seemed to get darker and darker."
7583,The psychologist said that I had developed Agoraphobia(afraid for public places or places where are many people.
7584,After a half year of therapy I felt better and went to school again.
7585,It felt like I had my life back a little.
7586,The seizures came back and I had to go to the hospital for some checks.
7587,They made me to take an MRI-scan and the results broke me...the fear was greater that ever before.
7588,"The neurologist said I have braindamage, after some thinking we come to the conclusion how the damage arised."
7589,"When I was 6 or 8 I felt of a waterslide, about 2/3 meters high with my head on the ground."
7590,My first thought when I heard it was that I probably would die in wheelchair when I was 30 or something.
7591,"After that I got back in therapy..I faced my fear for the last 1,5 years."
7592,"Everyday I did my exercises, ""get out of your comfort zone"" and take little steps in making it yourself harder to pick more dificult thing to do."
7593,"I first was to scared to go outside, then I went outside for little walks etc."
7594,"I did groceries, go more outside and hanging with friends, go with the bus, go to the gym."
7595,"This process goes really slow, but the more you face your fears the smaller the fears will be."
7596,You'll see that there is not something bad is going to happen.
7597,You feel stronger and your confidence will grow after facing your fears.
7598,You did it by yourself and can be proud of it!
7599,Right now I'm working as a volunteer at a school for 2 days a week and I'm trying to get a job fulltime.
7600,I still have a long road to go but I feel I'm getting my life back piece for piece everyday and that feels awesome.
7601,Now my biggest achievement in 2 years is: I went out for the first time..friends of mine play in a band and never went to a show of them.
7602,"So last saturday I went to their show, It was awesome!"
7603,I enjoyed the music and the evening so much and I didn't had fear a single seccond.
7604,After the show I even went to a pub and some afterparty's haha:) I came home at 6 am.
7605,"(and because of the medications I don't drink..I face the fear sober) I told my buddies, that this was the most amazing evening/night in my life."
7606,I felt so proud and good.
7607,I just want others to know that you can do it and you are way way way more stronger than you think!
7608,"Ask me anything, I try to respond to every question."
7609,"BTW bad grammar, English is my seccond language."
7610,"Hi all,

I am posting here for advice on where to go, what to do, and perhaps gain hope."
7611,"Sit tight, it's a bit of a story."
7612,I first encountered problems with Anxiety after a bad mushroom trip almost three years ago.
7613,"For three months I felt pretty screwed in the head, with symptoms of anxiety and dp/dr."
7614,"During this time I avoided all substances (alcohol, weed) and remained sober."
7615,"3-4 months later I decided to try weed again while drunk, and it didn't have a negative effect for the most part -- and I began using it again frequently."
7616,"Over a year ago I got a brilliant developer job working in the city -- the type of job which is very rare -- good money for my age, friendly directors/bosses (more friends!"
7617,"), etc.."
7618,I became very happy.
7619,"I felt like the happiest person in the world, although perhaps a few things were missing."
7620,"I commuted everyday for an hour and a half on the train (three hours a day), which meant that I was leaving at 7AM and not getting back until 8PM - 11PM every single working day."
7621,I was still smoking marijuana at this time.
7622,"About 6 months ago I decided to give it up, and have tried it on and off (maybe 8 times in total) since then."
7623,Ever since I gave up I began to slip into depression and anxiety.
7624,I feel like I am loosing control of my mind.
7625,"For the past three months, I have begun having panic attacks (severe) on the train, and I feel like I just don't have enough energy to cope anymore."
7626,"I gave up on the train and stay in London, but I feel trapped in a city -- a city which is crowded with no countryside."
7627,I feel like I can't take it anymore.
7628,"That, and I wonder if I should be going to university to get a degree and spending more of my life living and experiencing things before I give so much of my time away for money."
7629,I just don't know what to do anymore.
7630,Recently I feel like Iv'e been getting worse.
7631,Paranoid about things around me -- waiting for a 'glitch' in reality to confirm that I'm going psychotic or schizophrenic.
7632,At one point I even felt like I was surrounded by evil.
7633,"I feel like I could get on a train and just completely lose it, smash the windows and jump out, jump off a bridge, whatever."
7634,Like I would completely lose it and kill myself almost as if it was an instant reflex.
7635,I have woken up screaming in the night because I thought I was either dying or my legs stopped working (rare).
7636,"I get incredibly dizzy sometimes, everything seems to fly past, sometimes I litterally feel like I can't walk (perhaps described as legs turning to jelly.. but I feel more like I just cant move)."
7637,Other times I just feel like I need to escape.
7638,More often that not I feel like I can never relax.
7639,Like what is happening to me is constant.
7640,"I try to read things to find help, but people seem to give advice that doesn't seem to help."
7641,People that seem to think it's something that happens once and a while and then you're fine.
7642,Not something constant.
7643,A few weeks ago I ended up in hospital because I demanded that I needed tests done -- they seemed to think it was anxiety.
7644,"I visited a pschologist twice but they just gave me some bullshit questionaires to fill in each week, so I demanded more help."
7645,I was transferred to another more senior psychologist but they dropped me because I didn't attend -- because they sent the letter to my home address and I was not home as I am staying in the city.
7646,"What really annoys me is that I feel like I could have a perfect life, if it were not for the anxiety/depression and feeling so trapped.. and feeling like I'm never going to have any time again."
7647,Like I am a slave.
7648,"I was prescribed medications, but have not taken them because of fear of worsening."
7649,Even if it makes me worse initially -- how am I supposed to commute to work?
7650,I wouldn't want to take them while staying elsewhere.
7651,I have tried excersizing -- that does not seem to help a whole lot.
7652,Maybe I am doing something wrong there.
7653,I just don't know what to do anymore.
7654,I want to live.
7655,I am only 21 years old.
7656,Although sometimes I feel like it's just going to end soon.
7657,That I can't possibly continue.
7658,That eventually I will cave.
7659,I think it's a miracle I havn't already.
7660,I think it'd take a miracle to save me now too.
7661,Like my mind is fucked beyond repair.
7662,Not that I did a whole lot of drugs.. mainly just alcohol and weed.
7663,So if theres anybody out there.
7664,Anybody at all that can say something meaningful.
7665,Please come to my aid.
7666,Should I consider doing medication?
7667,I've researched the pros and cons of meds for anxiety and I'm afraid of the side effects.
7668,Or should I just consider medication?
7669,"After resisting medication for a long time, i finally gave in and started on Efexor XR 75mg, that was six years ago."
7670,"This doesn't really make sense, because I've been diagnosed and am on medication."
7671,3 years go by and my mother found an article in the newspaper about acid reflux medication draining naturally occurring B12 from the body and recommended I take a B12 vitamin daily.
7672,I'm not on any meds or anything.
7673,Also is there any type of over-the-counter medication that would help calm me?
7674,"I just don't want to depend on them, but I think starting medication gives me anxiety and it may be for the best to calm my nerves."
7675,I have some meds prescribed but they don't work as well as I would like.
7676,My symptoms are under control after years of therapy and medication.
7677,Is it safe to have a couple drinks on this medication?
7678,"I'm looking for something so mild, I won't even know I'm on it."
7679,"I'm really nervous about opening that can of worms in my life, getting dependent and all the bullshit that comes with medications like these."
7680,"If any one can tell me about any good but unremarkable (no real negative experiences) experiences they are having or have had, please post it here."
7681,I need to research this before I go any further.
7682,"I'm male, age 42 with no other complications or conditions."
7683,Thank you!
7684,"I have noticed a bit of improvement in my overall mood, but I am not sure if that is the medicine or me."
7685,What would be a good started anxiety medication for people highly sensitive to medication.
7686,Has anyone else suffered horrible anxiety from ADD/ADHD medicine?
7687,"I don't expect anyone to tell me whether or not I should label this as anxiety or whether or not I should get medication, but I'd really love to know if anyone who identifies as having anxiety has a similar experience to mine so that I can reconsider my perspective a little bit."
7688,"I really am starting to feel like if I had medication or something, that I'd have a slightly better handle on my situation and that I could be a bit more productive without panicking all of the time that I'll never be good enough....or maybe I'm just being overdramatic."
7689,"I dont take any medication to trigger it and it comes up for random things, like getting a paper back in class, taking a test, presenting in class, going to new places, riding in cars with my friends and their parents."
7690,Is there any way to break the cycle of these thoughts besides going on meds?
7691,I'm just wondering what combinations of medicine you all take.
7692,"He offered me a medication (effexor) to help deal with the anxiety and although I was reluctant at first I figured, hey, what the hell, it can't be any worse than what I have already been through."
7693,Some notes about me and my situation: I was very reluctant to start a medication because I believe they are just bandaid's to a deeper issue.
7694,Ideally I would have liked to feel better without medication but I have tried my hardest for the passed 10 years and I think I have gotten as far as I can on my own.
7695,"They gave me anxiety medicine and it seems to help, but I do not want to take pills for an extended period of time."
7696,"3 months later they rescheduled my appointment and did not tell me I called after my refill was denied they said i was removed from the system entirely because i missed too many appointments I was mad so i asked how can i get my medicine back i need them to live my life almost normal she said i have to start from scratch go through therapy again then i might have a chance to to see the doctor which could take half a year or more so here i am gone 2 weeks without my medicine i'm scared, depressed and there is nothing i can do."
7697,At the time I didn't understand what it meant and it never directly affected our relationship until he decided to stop his meds overnight.
7698,I am not sure if stopping his meds played a role in what happened next but within a week he started having panic attacks with me.
7699,"For a brief context: I'm emetophobic (fear of vomit), and have always resisted taking daily medication for it, since will my anxiety occurs daily, it's not constant."
7700,Does anyone here have experience with taking medication for phobia-related panic attacks?
7701,I've never taken anti-anxiety medication before and am having a lot of anxiety and trepidation about it.
7702,"But also since it's so situation-based, what do you do when you're on medication and the 'danger' goes away?"
7703,I hope I can get a better management of this new medication soon.
7704,The second time it took a therapist and a bit of medication.
7705,I started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and got back on medication.
7706,"But I'm wondering if anyone here has any ways to cope that worked during their pregnancy since obviously medication is a no-go right now (I'm prescribed Xanax as needed, but I haven't taken any since September, and don't want to take anything while pregnant)."
7707,I try to stay away from meds due to their unsavory side effects.
7708,"While I know medication helps a bit, I am more curious about what helps when medicine can't."
7709,"I still don't know if medication is the right route for me but honestly I don't know what else to do, I have to do something to start feeling better."
7710,I've had to increase my medication just to keep myself from being too depressed to function and to be able to actually sleep at night.
7711,"They specialize in CBT and from what I've seen and heard are generally ""against"" prescribing medication."
7712,My gut is telling me to look for another psychiatrist that could prescribe me meds that can get me going but really would hate to resort to that.
7713,"Ok, so, my brother...well I should say sister (he's transgendered), owns two shotguns."
7714,A Remington 12-guage pump and an expensive as hell 10-guage double barrel.
7715,He is OBSESSED with these guns and constantly looks up nothing but gun-related stuff every time he's on the computer.
7716,"Nothing wrong with that, right?"
7717,"Well what worries me is this: he's suicidal, manically depressed, often expresses he hates people, and she's a hardcore alcoholic."
7718,"Sometimes when she drinks, she'll go upstairs and play with the guns; ie, I usually hear the clicking noise of the 12-guage."
7719,My dad and I had him committed to the ER psych ward a few months ago because he had a mental breakdown and mentioned suicide while talking about his shotgun.
7720,"After being released, he's only gotten worse."
7721,This kind of behavior gives me panic attacks where I'll often go into my room to isolate but I don't even feel safe there anymore.
7722,Here's where it gets scary.
7723,"Yesterday, while getting hammered, he was swinging his 12-guage around after him and mom had an argument."
7724,"While doing so, he had a sinister look on his face and he clearly stated ""I'm feeling psycho right now""."
7725,"Usually when he announces stuff like this, he means it."
7726,His behavior gets downright unpredictable and she often admits she has passive-aggressive anger.
7727,"Now again, he has multiple mental disorders and pardon my switching of ""he"" and ""she"" here and there."
7728,"I'm 100% supportive of his choice (if there's another way of putting it, correct me please) to be transgender but his behavior frightens me some times."
7729,TL;DR - suicidal sibling owns guns and talks irrationally from time to time.
7730,I DO hope this gets completely read though because I'm in a crisis here.
7731,I don't know what to do and I just don't know if I even feel safe anymore.
7732,"One more thing to add: he believes the world will end in 2012 and when that don't happen, he believes there will eventually be a zombie apocalypse."
7733,I shit you not.
7734,UPDATE: Sorry for being late on this but here's the scoop from what happened yesterday.
7735,I told mom about it and she just kept telling me it's the booze.
7736,"I honestly think she might be right because, on the rare occasions my sister is sober, she's a quiet yet respectable (mostly) person."
7737,I can't remember if I stated this before but my sister is a hardcore alcoholic (she buys half pints of hard liquor and a few shots every day) and combines the booze with the several medications she's on.
7738,This in turn is what probably results in her psychotic moods.
7739,"Anyway, sister came home drunk as usual yesterday and went to the off sale to get more."
7740,She came home a few minutes later and I heard shouting from upstairs.
7741,"She explained that someone said ""What the fuck is that...THING?!"""
7742,"while entering the bar and she apparently responded with a ""FUCK YOU!"""
7743,at the top of her lungs.
7744,"Afterwards, an old lady apparently stared at her and started laughing, to which she responded with ""Fuck you, you ugly fucking mother fucking BITCH"", got in her car, and peeled out."
7745,She later started bragging about wanting to kill her while holding her 10-gauge.
7746,I kept telling her to calm down but she just kept getting louder and louder.
7747,"Finally, after a couple weather warnings had past, she started getting more relaxed and went to bed."
7748,Today she had only had a little to drink and was in a relatively normal mood.
7749,Boy was that a relief.
7750,I think I have suffered from anxiety for many years but finally came to grips with it.
7751,I'm a 26 male in California and work a stressful job.
7752,"Even when not at work i'll be overcome by anxiety - rapid heart rate, uneven breath, sweaty hands... it has taken a toll on me."
7753,My employer offers health care but I am not enrolled as it is too expensive.
7754,What are my options?
7755,How can I find a reputable doctor to talk to about this and possibly get prescribed something that will help?
7756,How much am I looking at here out of pocket?
7757,What medications are available and what are the side effects?
7758,This is all new to me so any advice would be appreciated.
7759,I feel sort of embarrassed that I feel like I need medication to help keep my mind working as it should - is this a normal feeling?
7760,"I don't want to go straight to meds, but I can't turn my brain off when I'm not at home."
7761,"I starting seeing a psychologist in April of this year (no meds, refuse them) and the improvement i've been seeing was tremendous."
7762,Ive never felt the need to seek help or meds (but I am terrified of doctors so there you go).
7763,Have you ever asked a doctor for a specific medication?
7764,"By the way, you can find inexpensive Phenelzine (*and other meds*) with this site: http://www.goodrx.com/

Thanks for your time, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you have."
7765,"I came off of celexa and am trying to combat it naturally without medication, though I do have xanax for emergencies and as needed."
7766,I'm seeing an endocrinologist in April about a possibly thyroid issue (or if not that that to see if there is a medical reason for my anxiety/panic) and I think I've decided if he doesn't treat me with medication or give me an answer I'm going to look back at another SSRI.
7767,"I know that I have anxiety (and am on medications), but I have an issue."
7768,"I feel fine at home and such, but the main issue is when I drive."
7769,"I've been to an Opthamologist, Neurologist, GP, Psychiatrist and so on, yet the issue still remains... and I NEED to drive for my job."
7770,This is especially true in the early morning (I get to work at 7AM).
7771,I have a 15-20 minute commute.
7772,I start feeling out of it (spacey) and I get fatigued.
7773,I'll want to kind of take  a nap.
7774,Then I'll get dizzy and feel off and less coordinated.
7775,By the time I am at work it is like my mind is in a vice.
7776,"I get my anxiety, can't think clearly,  and feel imbalanced."
7777,Last year while driving down to another state it got at its worst.
7778,I was driving for 4 hours and got dizzy.
7779,I had felt off the entire trip but pushed through it.
7780,But by night time it got bad... at one point I got anxious a bit and other symptoms came out.
7781,"I felt like I was going to pass out, I got incredibly nauseaus, and I almost threw up."
7782,I had my girlfriend switch to driving and when I sat in the back my head was pounding (it started to hurt prior while driving).
7783,When we got to our destination it hurt so bad and my anxiety was like a whirlwind.
7784,I took Ibuprofen and vitamins and nothing helped.
7785,I laid down and felt a bit better the next day.
7786,I'm at a loss here.
7787,"I've been to many specialists  overall and I've had my eyes checked, an MRI, Balance Test, Cranial Doppler test, blood work and many, many other tests."
7788,I'm pretty healthy otherwise.
7789,"I exercise 5 to 6 days a week, eat well and take supplements."
7790,"For awhile playing video games bothered me too, but I've somehow managed to overcome that hurdle."
7791,Now when I get to work even looking at the computer monitor or my phone for too long makes me feel a bit sick and light headed.
7792,Any ideas?
7793,"I am NOT seeking  professional medical advice, rather I am.hoping someone with similar symptoms can give me an idea so I can then go see a specialist in that direction."
7794,"Do any of you have advice about medication, or therapies for General anxiety?"
7795,"I am on medication, Effexor 37.5mg and have been since September 2011."
7796,"Yes, I hadn't been on medication for very long despite me having anxiety for as long as I have."
7797,"Could medication alone help me, at least to get through college?"
7798,Sometimes i want to go to my DR and ask for medication so i can live normal but then i have anxiety that the medication will change me and i wont feel anything.
7799,"What if because of the medicine i no longer need to turn around at the gas station, drive back to the house and make sure my hair dryer is unplugged JUST IN CASE one of the dogs bumps it and it turns on and burns the house down.... AHHHH 

Sorry this is such a massive wall of text."
7800,"I have told my parents I want to take some kind of sleeping meds like ZZZQuil because my friend(who also has a lot of anxiety) says it helps him, but they just say ""Oh we don't want you on an sleeping medication""."
7801,"I do take medication for my anxiety, Zoloft."
7802,Now i'm not on any medication currently and I am in good shape but I would like to know how common this is and did it improve.
7803,"If you're taking or have taken this kind of medicine,  please share your experience with it!"
7804,"Long story short, 22M dealing with Major Depression/Anxiety with panic attacks for the past 6-7 years (Both officially diagnosed)."
7805,"I've tried doctor after doctor after therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists."
7806,Tried nearly 20 different medications for both disorders.
7807,All of who just tell me that I'm an incredibly hard case to solve.
7808,Having moved 8 times over the last 5 years hasn't helped me a single bit.
7809,"Either way, I've all but given up hope on looking for help with my Major Depression."
7810,"Sure, I can't find any joy in life and I constantly feel like a miserable piece of shit... but hey it's a lot better than dealing with shitty doctors all the time who seem to refuse to try something that effects my dopamine levels rather than drowning me in SSRI's an Anti-psychotics or Mood-stabilizers."
7811,"Anyhow, dealing with that BS then moving away from my Klonopin prescribing primary doctor lead me down the path of becoming a drug addict."
7812,Now I don't exactly go out of my way to find drugs but I just have a way of ending up in the wrong groups of people.
7813,"To put it simply, I loathe self-medicating but god damn painkillers (Opiates) and weed/booze make being alive and around people much easier to cope with."
7814,Which leads me to my current predicament.
7815,Klonopin and Xanax seem to be the only two medications that actually help my anxiety without the need for all the other shit.
7816,Yet it's so fucking difficult or rather damn near impossible to get a doctor to prescribe them to me once I go over my medical history and my rather poor coping mechanisms.
7817,I currently have about a weeks worth of Xanax (2mg's daily) that I got from an ER visit left until I'm fucked again.
7818,I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin.
7819,Does anyone know of a medical service I can use or get a refill or anything until I can get setup with another primary doctor?
7820,"I'm not trying to doctor shop or abuse benzo's, they just happen to be the only thing that works for my anxiety outside of anything illegal."
7821,"This wouldn't even be a huge issue if it weren't for the fact that I'm currently unemployed, broke as shit, uninsured and fucking moving yet again."
7822,"God damn, I'm sorry for venting."
7823,I just happen to be in a really shitty situation at the moment and I have no one to talk to about it all.
7824,"i'm a 21 year old male, have had mild anxiety most of my life, was on anti-anxiety medications for a while but have been off for a year and a half."
7825,my anxiety has always been fairly manageable and hasn't interfered a great amount in my normal life.
7826,"Anyway, five days ago I woke up with mild chest pains and short breath."
7827,"I freaked out a little bit, but wasn't really worried as I assumed it had something to do with my anxiety and would subside in a few hours."
7828,The pain went away within a few hours but the shortness of breath remained for 2 days so I called my doctor who instructed me to go to the emergency room.
7829,They did a bunch of tests and everything came back fine which I assumed they would.
7830,I also assumed that anxiety symptoms would subside after they told me nothing was wrong with me but they did not.
7831,While driving yesterday my shortness of breath turned into a full blown panic attack.
7832,"I got home and just could not calm down, my chest was super tight, my heart was racing and it remained that way for about 6 hours when I finally fell asleep."
7833,"I woke up this morning feeling awesome, I thought whatever had happened yesterday had stopped, but after about 2 hours it started all over again."
7834,"This entire day I have felt awful, it feels like I'm going insane, my brain is foggy, I feel completely detached from myself."
7835,Is there anything I can do that will make this go away?
7836,"I exercised this morning, looked up breathing exercises on the internet which have helped a little bit but not much."
7837,Before this I've had maybe 4 panic attacks and all of them only lasted a few minutes and most were brought on by smoking weed
7838,"I've been to the doctor a few times, and they have always sent me away with acid-reducing medication which don't seem to give me any relief."
7839,(im currently taking rabeprazole sodium 20mg) I'm tired of going to the doctor since I've tried at least 4 different acid-reducing medication now.
7840,"I've tried reaching my doctor but haven't had any response, so I was hoping anyone who has experience with the medication could give me some advice."
7841,"Hi all,

I'm feeling very discouraged today."
7842,"I've never posted here before, so I'll post my deal in brief:

I have ""just right"" perfectionism OCD."
7843,Some days are better than others.
7844,"Today was the kind of day where I was afraid of messing up my hair, so it took me five hours to get myself together to take a shower and wash it."
7845,"If I can't do something perfectly, I struggle with doing it at all."
7846,"The fear is absolutely paralyzing...

...yet at the same time, fear and anxiety is the only thing that motivates me to do anything."
7847,"I had a professional conference earlier this week, and out of fear that I would accidentally sleep in, I woke up early and got ready and rushed to get there on time."
7848,I don't do well with anti-anxiety medications for this reason.
7849,"Without any kind of anxiety, I don't function at all."
7850,"While medication helps to keep me from freaking out over small things, it gives me no incentive to do big things."
7851,My counselor is an amazing woman.
7852,"Her specialty is anxiety, and she's helped me make some strides in a positive direction without medication."
7853,"For instance, I can do laundry now, which is huge."
7854,I was able to deconstruct my ritual and now can effectively do it with really simple steps.
7855,Same with the bathroom.
7856,"However, the rest of my apartment is a wreck."
7857,I feel like I've only accomplished a raindrop in the puddle.
7858,The main area where I struggle with is school.
7859,I'm in graduate school and have a 4.0 GPA.
7860,I'm about halfway through.
7861,"But there are days, weeks where I am too daunted to do any work."
7862,"The irony is that I know I will get an A no matter what because I'm smart, but I struggle with the uncertainty that I will write a bad paper, so I waste a lot of time panicking and trying to escape to various subreddits for hours at a time to avoid it."
7863,"I struggle at managing a schedule because I spend all of my time panicking and escaping and then writing my paper, leaving no time to do anything else."
7864,"My counselor's last text to me was ""Give yourself permission to have thoughts and feelings and allow them to be there."
7865,"Recognize that the goal is not to get rid of them, but to gently allow them to be present while turning your focus on what makes it important to be in school, etc."""
7866,I just don't know how to do that outside of her office helping me through a situation.
7867,Thanks guys in advance.
7868,tl;dr: struggling today.
7869,could use encouragement and advice and stuff.
7870,Usually my appetite isn't very strong so it seems likely it's related to the medication.
7871,"I used to have major palpitations, but they went away after i started medicine."
7872,"Incidentally, I was off meds for a while for some stupid reason."
7873,I also switched some meds recently.
7874,I have been to see a doctor who has offered CBT and anti anxiety meds (citalopram / celexa).
7875,I started taking this medication for an infection.
7876,I dug more into the side-effects of the medication and what I read was pretty shocking.
7877,"I implore anyone not to take this, or any medication in this family of drugs."
7878,"The meds did help me, I have to give him that."
7879,"*  I have an appointment to see a doctor for meds on the 17th, but that feels so far away and I don't know how much it'll help."
7880,"My sole hope is in meds, which don't come for over a week and then need time to kick in *if* they're right for me."
7881,"In  the end of 2010- the start of 2011 I started on Zoloft which seemed to help, but had a bunch of weird side effects so I eventually stopped taking it both from a strong personal aversion to taking medication and the medicine it's self."
7882,"Extra information: I quit taking anxiety meds about a month and a half ago, as they weren't doing me much good."
7883,"I've never really spoken with psychologists about this, as I've always had an aversion to the idea of taking medication, but after seven years of feeling this way in what should be the prime of my life, I just want some relief."
7884,I have been on prescription medication for a very long time and it seems to help but in stressful times it gets worse and im struggling right now.
7885,Not too long ago I was convinced that medication is the only way to elevate the pain.
7886,"I have nausea medicine, but it does nothing but make me less likely to vomit and even then I vomit the medicine up sometimes."
7887,I don't know about getting new medicine because my mom basically tells me to suck it up... which makes me even more frustrated.
7888,"It lasted for weeks before I got on some medication, and even on the medication can go on for several days before I can completely control it."
7889,"Medication is great to temporarily gain firm enough footing so as to build awareness, however if nothing is changed behaviorally or psychologically, ie if awareness is not being cultivated, the medication is merely masking the problem."
7890,"Also, my meds and my stress have made my sex drive non existant."
7891,"Up until Thursday, my nightly meds (I take 0.25mg Klonopin at 9am, 1pm, and 6pm and the rest at 6pm) would immediately calm me down."
7892,"I have a psychiatrist right now, but the medicine I'm taking only does so much for me and I think it would do me good to have someone to talk to, like a therapist."
7893,I was out of town for the last 4 days and forgot to take my meds with me.
7894,Has anyone else felt the same after restarting their meds similar to the way I have just discribed?
7895,I haven't been diagnosed or prescribed medication.
7896,"So, I don't have any medication left until I refill it Friday."
7897,"I spent the week at my boyfriends place, and I never need medication when I'm with him."
7898,"What to do when you don't have any medication on you, your 'happy place' is unavailable right now, you're constantly trying not to think bad thoughts, and nothing is on Netflix?"
7899,I have been taking meds for almost a year (last resort) to help even out my moods and help me think clearly and sleep.
7900,Prescription medication sometimes gets dropped to sustain the meal budget.
7901,"Also somewhat recently, and a partial cause of my anxiety, my girlfriend was diagnosed with full-on schizophrenia, and as a result has been doped up on a huge amount of meds, depakote, clonapin, an antipsychotic, and zoloft, and it's definitely be impacting our relationship."
7902,She sleeps most of the time because she can't handle reality or the way the meds make her feel and it's been hard.
7903,"I'm just unsure of how to get over the feeling that I'm in the wrong relationship, or if I even should...but it's been keeping me up thinking which really hasn't happened since getting on my meds."
7904,"Now I cannot leave the house without my ""emergency medicine"" (klonopin) or I could have a panic attack thinking about what I would do IF I had a panic attack."
7905,"Now I worry that I may have a panic attack and need to take my medicine, which should not be taken with alcohol."
7906,Of course this dizziness makes me nervous that something could be wrong with me and it has since forced me to get back on my medication (which has yet to take effect).
7907,"When I don't take my medication I notice quickly, but when I do I'm fine."
7908,"So my question is to anyone else with experience with this medication, do you drink on it, and do you think its safe to drink lightly on it?"
7909,"She understood, and suggested it might be a way of self-medication, which I agreed with."
7910,"But now that I am on meds that work i started to drink about a cup and a half every morning and i do just fine, it gives me a nice push to start my day."
7911,"I can’t afford therapy as I don’t have insurance, and I’m not looking to take medication because I don’t want to become dependent and I’d like to be able to control it myself."
7912,"Last night I was going to take a melatonin but read on the package they're not awesome to take when your blood pressure is high (mine is usually low, but this past week it's skyrocketed), if you are taking meds that change your blood pressure, or if you're anxious or depressed."
7913,"The medication was working, I was rarely taking the valium."
7914,i've been to my doctor about this but the only thing she has to offer me is a medication that i have a long history with.
7915,"Hey guys, I'm a 20 year old male who battles a few mental health issues."
7916,I'm currently taking a leave from college to deal with them &amp; should be headed back in a year.
7917,I've already taken a year off.
7918,I've seen a number of psychologists and psychiatrists but it's not exactly clear what my formal diagnosis is.
7919,A few have said Bipolar II but I'm not completely convinced.
7920,I will admit that I've gone through at least 2 major depressive episodes followed by symptoms that resemble hypomania.
7921,Maybe I'm just in denial.
7922,"Anyhow, this is the third consecutive January/February that I have started sliding into depression."
7923,I live in the a part of the United States that gets very cold in the winter.
7924,I really don't like how cold it gets.
7925,I'm into running and cycling and have trouble enjoying these activities when it's so cold out.
7926,Even heading to the supermarket becomes an ordeal.
7927,"On a similar note, I've been getting really stuck on the most mundane tasks lately."
7928,I am a perfectionist.
7929,"Sometimes, I will not bother doing something at all if I can't do it to a very high standard I've set for myself."
7930,I've been procrastinating a lot.
7931,"In my time off, I've started a small business and it's hard to maintain structure when I'm working from home."
7932,"I find myself getting into the routine of waking up, having a long list of things to do, getting anxious, freezing up, and getting nothing done."
7933,"By the time I'm ready to sleep, I vow to have a productive day the next day, but the same thing inevitably happens."
7934,I've been seeing a therapist but I'm not too fond of him.
7935,I've honestly had over a half dozen therapists without much success.
7936,Starting to lose faith in therapy's potential for me.
7937,There is one more therapist that was recommended to me but I have yet to call him for an appointment.
7938,It's one of the things I keep putting off.
7939,"Not currently on any medications other than Adderall XR, which one psychiatrist prescribed me for ADHD."
7940,I know that it can cause anxiety but I've been taking it for a few months now &amp; feel somewhat dependent.
7941,It did also make me more productive when I first started taking it.
7942,"Anyhow, I feel like I'm slowly starting to slip back into depression, which sucks."
7943,I can't even seem to get the most simple tasks done without tons of effort.
7944,I bought a white board and desk calendar for motivation but I am currently avoiding them because I'm so anxious.
7945,I've been thinking about getting a regular job again for some structure until I learn how to cope with my mental health issues.
7946,I guess that's all I have to say for now.
7947,Any support or advice would be greatly appreciated.
7948,Please feel free to ask any questions for clarification.
7949,Thanks!
7950,"At my previous university, I found that the Effexor-XR 150 for trait and Xanax 50 mg for state anxiety resulted in a relatively stable mode of living, but have recently started a graduate program at a different university where the clinicians are more negatively biased toward medication-based solutions."
7951,"In a beautiful, perfect world, I would have found a behavioral solution that reduces my social anxiety without medication."
7952,"3) At my previous university, with my standard medication, I **
loved** giving presentations (albeit, when at the beginning of having a panic attack, I had a Xanax)."
7953,The idea of medication terrifies me.
7954,"Thanks to my dad and stepmom, I quit going to doctor's appointments and I dropped my medication because she said that illness doesn't exist and I'm FINE...which I obviously am NOT because I'm sitting here freaking out."
7955,I am on medication for this and it has helped and ive gone through years of therapy and stopped because it really didnt help.
7956,The medication I am on is Pristiq.
7957,It wasn't until I got my anxiety under control with therapy and medication (of which I'm now off) that I lost that happy feeling.
7958,I've been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression.
7959,I am currently in CBT getting help.
7960,I have MAJOR trouble maintaining a healthy sleep schedule.
7961,"I take 50mg of Zoloft, 10mg of Valium, and I'm a Canadian medicinal marijuana recipient."
7962,I am unemployed and not in school due to my ailment (just for this year).
7963,I traveled 3 hours back to PST from EST for 4 days for my sister's wedding.
7964,I maintained the same dose and medications as previously mentioned.
7965,"Somehow, I found myself INCREDIBLY in control of emotions."
7966,I felt much more like myself than ever before.
7967,"I was not only happy because of my sister getting married... but even the days leading up to it, where I was able to relax without worrying about how others perceive me."
7968,"Best of all, I found that my sleep schedule went entirely back to normal."
7969,"Even the nights where I went to bed very late, I was able to wake up efficiently early in the morning."
7970,"Now, keep in mind..."
7971,"I was on the same medications, maintained the same dosage, and had no stressors to 'run away' from (such as work or school)."
7972,Was this merely a case of 'vacation adrenaline'?
7973,Was it the time zone change?
7974,I can't pinpoint what it could possibly be!
7975,Have any of you changed time zones and found your symptoms almost entirely gone?
7976,"Small edit: Also, after returning back to EST, my anxiety/sleep problems came back the next day."
7977,I'm absolutely baffled.
7978,"I have a LOT of experience with mainstream western medicine failing me in various ways, so when it predictably happened again in trying to sort out my digestion problems, I turned to ""alternative"" health (which have helped me far more than western medicine, but that's a whole other topic)."
7979,I'm wondering if anyone who is on any type of medication for anxiety/depression or similar mental illnesses has had a bad experience with alcohol that they can share.
7980,I can only pin it down to the alcohol in me affecting my medication's function and therefore the panic attack came on full strength.
7981,I'm thinking I just need another medication?
7982,"After several weeks of medication, I wasn't seeing much improvement, and felt like my anxiety was just compounding because of this."
7983,"I don't know if I can attribute this to the meds (Lexapro + Wellbutrin + Klonopin as needed), or just the fact that the people here have been welcoming and friendly whereas the people at the marketing company (save a couple of cool people) were extremely passive-aggressive and self-absorbed."
7984,TL;DR A combination of meds and a new work environment has changed my life for the better.
7985,Maybe meds aren't always enough.
7986,"I have no idea how to feel about anxiety meds, the only med I've ever really been on is Concerta (Ritalin)."
7987,I don't know...I just don't know how to feel about meds...any thoughts?
7988,"EDIT: Well just an update, I ended up NOT taking the meds, and honestly I feel completely normal today."
7989,"**TL;DR: How the HELL did you get through your medication withdrawal symptoms, and how long did it take?"
7990,"Hey guys, Ive recently been prescribed Buspar and Im not sure what to expect from the medication."
7991,Can I go to a walk in clinic and ask for medication there??
7992,I'm sorry to be posting here.
7993,"I see a therapist (met with her today, in fact), but my anxiety is truly getting the best of me these days and I don't know what to do."
7994,I've suffered from anxiety and depression for years.
7995,"I was medicated for quite awhile (2 antidepressants, as well as Vyvanse for my ADD), but I was having far more negative symptoms on these medications than I was benefits."
7996,"I've been off of the antidepressants for about 6 months, and the Vyvanse for about a month and a half."
7997,I was very lucky--I did not have anywhere near as close to as bad of a time coming off of these meds that I expected.
7998,"There were a few brief bumps in the road, but, aside from some physical withdrawal symptoms (mainly with the antidepressants), I feel amazing in comparison to where I was."
7999,"I haven't relapsed with my depression, and I've actually be able to keep up my productivity and feel better about my life/self now that I'm off of Vyvanse."
8000,"My anxiety, however, is another story."
8001,"The good part: most of the time, it's not the scary, depressive panicking and unease I would get in the past at times."
8002,"The bad: my life is just very stressful at the moment, and my anxiety about managing it all has increased 1000 times within the past month."
8003,Work has been INSANE in the past month.
8004,"I'm in a tough place, because I am 24 and at a relatively entry level position where I am trying to prove my worth, so it's hard for me to feel totally comfortable going to my boss and tell them I'm too overworked/stressed out."
8005,But I hardly have a moment to sit and take a deep breath each day because there's so much going on constantly.
8006,"And it builds up if I put it off, so it's not like I can just do a reduced amount."
8007,"I have been getting good feedback from supervisors, so I guess that's one good thing, but I'm not sure I can keep this up much longer."
8008,It's really starting to destroy me mentally and physically.
8009,"I feel like I'm aging myself drastically, and getting older has always been its own source of anxiety for me in itself."
8010,"I've been having some weird physical symptoms happening and, while I'm pretty sure it's just side effects of my anxiety, it's really starting to freak me out."
8011,"I will say that I do have hypochondriac tendencies, so I've been trying to tell myself it's nothing, but I can't shake the feeling I'm really damaging myself with the level of stress I'm putting on my body."
8012,My chest has been feeling tight lately.
8013,"My hands will start shaking/have tremors every so often, and sometimes I get a weird feeling in them I can't really describe - not total loss of feeling, but a little similar."
8014,"As much as it scares me, I do think it's best at this point to try to schedule a doctor's appointment, so I plan to call and do that tomorrow because I might as well get a professional opinion instead of just driving myself crazy over it."
8015,"I DO have Lorazepam, which is quite helpful at times, but, in the past, I would try to only take it when I was having more of a depressive panic attack, not so much just stress-related anxiety (plus it makes me drowsy, which isn't so ideal for work)."
8016,"I don't want to become dependent, so I try to avoid taking it more than I absolutely need it (and not multiple days in a row)."
8017,So I'm not really sure what to do.
8018,"Much thanks to anyone who actually read this, and any personal experiences much appreciated!"
8019,Sorry for the long ramble.
8020,I really don't want to start back on medication and I know that it's in my head since I didn't have these thoughts on the medicine.
8021,I have no faith in medication or therapy anymore because I feel like i've tried it all.
8022,I have dealt with social and generalized anxiety for most of my life and at this point I can say that I have a pretty good handle on it without medication.
8023,With out medicine what it's the best way I can stop my mind from teaching and spiraling me in to a panic attack?
8024,"I just started medication this week, so hopefully it will do something..."
8025,"I buy her groceries, clean her house in between the monthly housekeeper coming, take her to doctors appointments (sometimes more than one per week), and get her medication."
8026,"I'm just full of meds, it sucks."
8027,"I've tried a million things to get rid of my anxiety: doctors, therapist, supplements, running, improved posture, you name it I've probably tried it except for medication because I'm scared to death of them."
8028,What makes this medicine work better?
8029,"I've resisted being put on medication but i think I might need it at this point, but I don't have a primary care doctor and it could take weeks to get in at the school clinic."
8030,"I am defending meds, but I realize they aren't the only option."
8031,And there are some for whom meds may be counter-indicated due to extenuating medical issues.
8032,"I can't find a psychiatrist that takes my insurance, so I can't get meds to help."
8033,"But at the same time, I don't want to just yet because if I do have a heart problem, the medicine can trigger an episode."
8034,"I finally got off of the medication rollercoaster at the age of 14 when my family changed cities, my parents split up and I finally successfully argued against further meds."
8035,I've had a panic disorder for 8 years now and have been through therapy and meds and being housebound and being fine.
8036,I've been officially 'off' meds 3 weeks tomorrow but today I had a panic attack.
8037,I was fine literally up until I fully came off the meds and now I'm finding myself worrying about silly things again that I thought I'd gotten over.
8038,Will the meds help this over time?
8039,I haven't taken any medication since.
8040,"I am in the shape I wanna be in right now, that helped reduced anxiety, but now I am gonna be overweight again cause of these meds?"
8041,"I read about the woman taking her meds, having 4 shots of Absolut while watching a movie with her husband and she blew into full panic.. qhich then caused me to worry about having some beers with some friends tonight."
8042,I've been experiencing panic attacks for about 8 years now.
8043,And tonight was probably one if my worse night ever.
8044,"The attack itself wasn't as violent as I can sometimes endure, but I never felt so bad about myself."
8045,Tonight was the night of a huge party at my university.
8046,Me and my best friends had it all planned out for weeks.
8047,We all met at a friend's apartment to start things off with some other people.
8048,"And of course, as things were going well for everybody, anxiety had to kick in."
8049,"You guys probably now how insidious it is, and how fast it goes from ""I don't feel so good"" to ""Oh non, I'm having a panic attack""."
8050,"I never cured myself nor followed any treatment so I don't have anything to fight it back but my will power and some homeopathic pills, which don't do much when the attack is strong."
8051,"So there I was, sick as hell, when everybody around me was getting drunk and having fun."
8052,"Eventually I had to go home, before even entering the actual party."
8053,"I explained to my closest friend why I was leaving, and while they know about my situation and were very supportive tonight, I couldn't help but feel shame and distress."
8054,"I feel like a fool, because I couldn't do anything."
8055,I gave up and fled home for everybody to see.
8056,I really feel like shit and hate myself for not seeking help or effective medicines.
8057,"And yet tomorrow I'll get up, do nothing about it and wait for the next attack."
8058,"Sorry for the rambling, I had to get this off my chest."
8059,I kinda hope it'll help me somehow.
8060,Good night to you all
8061,"It has helped somewhat, but I'm starting to think I either need a higher dose or a different medicine."
8062,"It's gotten to the point where I need to go onto medication because I'm too hard to deal with, so I'm gonna go see the doctor and get all that underway."
8063,The thing I'm worried about is losing a piece of myself (like I don't feel like I'll be myself when I'm on medication) and what things are gonna be like afterwards.
8064,It worries me a lot and it feels like it's a big step transitioning from non medication to something that could change my life so much.
8065,"Any feedback on someone going onto meds for the first time, advice anything would be fantastic."
8066,I've been on and off medication for 3 of those years but it was never consistent past three months.
8067,I am thinking of starting medication again but I know that it’ll interfere with my schooling for at least a good week because of the initial reactions I’ve had in the past.
8068,"I have coped with my anxiety using medication, and have built a nice safe spot in my flat."
8069,I don't want to switch to a daily medication as I don't want to constantly feel medicated.
8070,"These meds are making my life worth living so I don't want to give them up, but I'd love some advice on how to deal with the issue of being... y'know... a little backed up."
8071,I haven't been able to get medication due to lack of health insurance but I shelled out 80 bucks today to talk to someone who told me anxiety isn't a mental illness.
8072,I just hope I can get health insurance soon because I'd really like to try medication I don't want to live like this anymore it's so fucking exhausting.
8073,"TL/DR: VS after head injury, please advice of experience, deterioration, medicine, cures, etc."
8074,"My question is whether there is treatment, is there anything I can do to improve, does it deteriorate, medication?"
8075,I have a doctors appointment this week but I'm afraid they're going to want to throw me on anxiety meds.
8076,I do not want to take any medication.
8077,"He's off his meds, not exercising, not taking care of himself, and lives far away from a major hospital (and he's across the country from me.)"
8078,"I had a doctors appointment this week just for a medication checkup and everything was fine, my Adderall XR (20mg twice a day, since it only lasts 6 hours each) is helping with my anxiety and ADHD without any side effects."
8079,She's painfully shy and has taken medicine for depression off and on.
8080,"She refuses to accept help, routinely take medicine, or go to a therapist."
8081,"Moved house, didn't realise registering at a new doctor would take so long, ran out of my medication yesterday."
8082,Should i try medication?
8083,"First thing she does is switch her to a new medicine, I don't recall what it was, we've been through so many at this point."
8084,"We switch to a new medicine(want to say prozac, with clonazapam as a seditive when needed) and it starts to kick in, she is able to go back to work and function semi normally again."
8085,She is miserable for two months before we try switching meds again in December.
8086,"Last batch of meds were gabupentin, piroxetin, and quetiapin."
8087,"I have no idea what the point of her taking her meds is, she is almost the worst she has ever been, and of course we can't get her doctor to speak to us."
8088,Hello there!
8089,"I never knew this subreddit existed until today, and I could really use some help."
8090,"I'm 23 yo, female."
8091,"I've tried talking to a shrink, and it didn't help at all, since I just felt judged the whole time."
8092,I constantly worry and have several small panic attacks daily.
8093,"Normally, I smoke to deal with it, and if smoking isn't an option, I destroy my cuticles!"
8094,I just keep scratching and picking at them until they bleed.
8095,"I want to take better care of myself, and stop looking like I have ""Crack Hands"" but no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to stop."
8096,"I just had my last cigarette, and I'm already starting to freak out that I'm not going to have another one."
8097,"And when I get too stressed, I snap and I get angry, and I just start screaming and yelling at the people who care about me which eventually spirals in to a full on panic attack."
8098,"I've tried medication, but I don't like how they make me feel."
8099,"I already feel super nauseous all the time, but the medications make it worse."
8100,Any advice would be super appreciated!
8101,I don't want to be a complete mess over the next few weeks!
8102,"I don't have insurance or a primary care physician, so it makes it hard to try and get consistent help and daily medication that will help besides Xanax."
8103,I am 20 and have been on anxiety medication since I was in sixth grade (around 11 or 12).
8104,I thought this was withdrawals but I have been off the medicine long enough now for that to subside...
8105,"I'm not on any medication, I'm willing to fight these thoughts on my own-please, if you can advise any method of how to fight with them, help me."
8106,"Is there anything I can do behaviorally (that is, no medicine) to change this?"
8107,"After a trembling, sweaty, unmemorable appointment that I secretly set up with a psychiatrist, he nearly dismissed me without giving me any type of medication."
8108,I think I am going to try medication but don't know exactly what is right for me.
8109,"Eventually my parents realized what was wrong and took me to the doctors who referred me to counseling, after being assessed they prescribed me meds (no idea what ones) that were supposed to help me, I refused to take them as at the time I was very anti-drugs, especially drugs that I considered messed with your brain possibly doing more harm than good, permanently."
8110,Should I just take the medicine?
8111,My doctor gave me anxiety meds(avitan) that I haven't taken in two days because I don't want to destroy my liver and i don't want to be dependent of any substance but it's getting hard to not use it when the anxiety is getting overwhelming.
8112,No medication.
8113,Been off my meds for 6+ months because I was doing great and I don't like putting drugs in my body everyday.
8114,"Called my doc, can't get in for 2 weeks but starting meds tomorrow."
8115,I have another appointment with my doctor in 3 weeks to see how my medication is going and will be organising seeing a counsellor then.
8116,"I've been on medication (started off Zoloft, currently with Pristique) for the last two years and it really does help."
8117,"I'm on antidepressants, anxiety meds, the works."
8118,"Hey, so since maybe 2009, somewhere around then maybe (ha!"
8119,I can't remember) I have been on an as-needed dose of Ativan/lorazepam.
8120,"There were periods (summers) where I didn't take much at all, maybe once or twice every two weeks in response to medium+ level panic attacks."
8121,"In the other seasons I generally would take my dose every few days or in particularly bad times, every day, which, you guessed it, is a good way to become dependent."
8122,"But dailies never really bothered me, long as I was feeling good, I usually ended up naturally coming off the daily use as the months got warmer."
8123,"But a couple months ago, I redeveloped a daily habit (which my prescription allowed for, actually...) until one day, one fateful Friday afternoon, I lost my pill bottle."
8124,"I have no idea where it went, but I lost it."
8125,"The night I lost it around 2am I started withdrawing so badly, I was very scared."
8126,"Thankfully, I don't think my overall dose was high enough to cause any dangerous symptoms, but boy was I going crazy."
8127,"I called everywhere, no refills, doctors not in after 5pm on Friday, police lost and found not open til the weekend is over, no one can help me unless I'm dying."
8128,I canceled all my plans for that weekend (didn't like that) and spent it in my room.
8129,"Each day I felt better, though I did have dry mouth, a little more tinnitus than usual, and I developed this weird tic with my tongue and lips."
8130,"I began to read up on these medicines more than I ever had and found that I had some symptoms seemed similar to what I had noticed but thought was normal - I was noticeable less intelligent than I remembered, had a harder time remembering things, and felt foggy a lot."
8131,"So I decided, hey, if I didn't die, I may as well quit."
8132,It's gone okay.
8133,About a month ago (so one month into quitting) I had a panic attack and had a take a dose.
8134,"And then, just now, I had a panic attack and had to take another."
8135,But once a month ain't so bad I think.
8136,"And between those times, my mouth tic goes away."
8137,"I feel roughly the same amount of anxiety, if not less, and I feel so much smarter."
8138,But I'm sick of these days when I have to take some.
8139,"The day I lost my meds, I was due to go out of town with some friends."
8140,Today I was supposed to go out and meet my friend's friends.
8141,"(Note: my anxiety is not social, it's more related to a fear of being sick/vomiting)."
8142,And I feel awful for it.
8143,"Any sort of ideas or advice that pops into anyone's head, that'd be cool, but I'm also interested in hearing any quitting stories or anything like that."
8144,"Also, sorry if there were typos in this."
8145,"Taking a dose, while calming, really affects my mental abilities."
8146,I'm going to lay down and watch TV now.
8147,"Unfortunately, I'm currently out of medication, which brings me to my second question...

2) My doctor prescribed me 5 Ativan and told me to call him when I needed the prescription refilled."
8148,"I wanted to try a different medication, as Ativan doesn't help much, but it's obviously more helpful than anything else I can get OTC such as valerian or herbal tea."
8149,I've also never been on any SSRI or benzo or any type of medication for anxiety/depression before so I have no idea what to expect.
8150,"Hiya, /r/anxiety!"
8151,"In anticipation for the new school year (college sophomore), I am going to talk to my doctor about perhaps a prescription for an anti-anxiety medication."
8152,"And, I would like to go into the appointment with some suggestions!"
8153,":) So, does anybody, who has anxiety similar to mine (Occasional and acute), know of any medications that have helped them?"
8154,"I would ideally like to be on one that I perhaps do not have to take on a daily basis, as my anxiety does not become unbearable on a daily basis."
8155,Thank you in advance for any help.
8156,"I told my doctor about it, and he recommended stopping the medication."
8157,"I'm aware that people with my kind of problems develop this kind of thing as a physical symptom of anxiety, but what has me worried is that this had NEVER happened up until I took that new medicine."
8158,"Tremors are one of the listed rare side effects of the medicine, but both I and my mom think that it would have subsided without the medicine in my system."
8159,I know I can't blame my medicine because everything was my choice but I ended up skipping more than 50% of my college classes and eventually dropping out and quitting my good job on a whim one day not caring about bills.
8160,"I then tried to get off the medicine, I was at 30g and I stopped cold turkey...worst 2 weeks of my life."
8161,"I first started going for help with my adhd problems, she gave me medicine for my anxiety( my anxiety can be pretty bad) but i wasn't really wanting to fix that because I could live with it and I learned to cope with some things."
8162,I wanted help to do better in school and with life in general not do worse... Should I consider talking to my doctor about a new medicine?
8163,"I would really like to try out an adhd medicine or something at least then I could see if it would help, or is there medicine that helps both?"
8164,"She's the one who told me I need to see a doctor and get on medication, but I'm not even sure of what I have."
8165,I finally am on medication that's helping.
8166,"Well, I forgot to take my meds this morning, and my anxiety is through the roof."
8167,"[Rant][Meds] Should I increase Lexapro or go to something different

So this is a bit of a question about meds and a bit of a rant."
8168,"The past couple months have been very, very stressful for me and I started a new medication a week ago."
8169,"Recently (even before the meds) I seriously can't keep my hands off my boyfriend, just constantly pawing at him and asking him to flash me when we're not having sex, and have woken up groping/making out with him."
8170,"I'm already on medication for anxiety, can anyone help me?"
8171,"It'll be one year of seeing my main therapist (who determined that I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder)
My main therapist thinks I would benefit a lot from daily anxiety meds and suggested me seeing a psychiatrist."
8172,Chances are I will be prescribes anxiety meds.
8173,MY MAIN CONCERN IS...if I get prescribed anxiety meds...what are the chances of me gaining weight...I've gained about 15-20 lbs this year because of the emotional turmoil I've been dealing with....and now lack of motivation to lose it at the moment ..has caused me to be thicker than i'd like to be...
8174,I worried that if i go on meds...i'll gain more weight.
8175,Any willing to share their experience ... so I can have a better understanding of how meds might affect my weight?
8176,"Before I knew I was behind, I failed to submit work at university, I was being ushered towards counselling and was suggested medication."
8177,(The orgasm being an effect not listed on the medication list).
8178,"When I first tried to masturbate on the medication, it took an incredible amount of time."
8179,"I was not aware that I had never actually orgasmed wanking ever before, and I was suddenly more aware of what the medication has done to me."
8180,"The medication is not known for helping with sexual issues, though it is certainly responsible for my delayed ejaculations (given premature ejaculations are what they are also prescribed for)...."
8181,"The medication has not fixed me, but it has allowed me to understand myself better and certainly has helped to highlight and eradicate problems I didn't know I had."
8182,"We discussed medication and counselling, he left the decision of what  kind of avenue to pursue very much in my hands, and in the end he gave me the names of some support forums, and a prescription of low dosage Propranolol."
8183,"It was nothing like the terrifying experience that I had built it up to be, and I will be happy to return in the next week or two to discuss how my medication works (or if it does), and whether I need to be given a higher dosage, or try anti-depressants."
8184,I am getting SO MUCH BETTER now that I see a doc 4-5 x / wk and she changed my meds.
8185,I wrote this a while ago before I started taking meds.
8186,"I've tried what seems like every medication, with no help."
8187,I have trouble taking my medication because sometimes I think I'm okay but then realize I need it again.
8188,"A little back story I guess: I'm 19 and have been suffering from anxiety and depression since I was 13, have been taking medication since I was 17 but it doesn't seem to be helping anymore and I haven't been able to get to the dr's to talk about what's going on."
8189,"Before starting this medication, my attacks weren't so physical as they were mental."
8190,"While the medicine  seems like it is working, and with very little if any side effects, I am CONSTANTLY wanting to eat."
8191,"I feel like this has been such a battle, trying to find treatment for my anxiety."
8192,"I've posted a few times throughout the duration of my struggle, hoping for some insight/support, because the struggle itself was making my anxiety worse!"
8193,"Well, today I had an appointment with yet another psychiatrist, which I felt, for the first time, actually went quite well (I was disappointed in my regular psychiatrist yesterday, but I'll get to that later)."
8194,"I kept this appointment after a phone call a couple weeks ago that they don't accept my insurance, so it would be $150 self pay."
8195,"I don't really have that kind of money, but I kept it with the blind faith that I would somehow get it."
8196,"I put it on my credit card, hoping to be able to come up with it by my May 4th due date so as to not pay interest (my March statement has already ended, it will go on April)."
8197,"I went, and got turned around and ended up on the wrong road about a mile away in a city I'm only vaguely familiar with from about 5 years ago."
8198,"Called the office in a panic (even though Arlington, TX disallows cell phone use in motor vehicles while driving) to get directions there."
8199,Was already shaking and nearly in tears upon arrival.
8200,She took me in within 2 minutes of finishing my paperwork.
8201,Good sign #1.
8202,"She was very kind and patient while asking questions, and of course detailed."
8203,I didn't have to ask for the help I needed because she was thorough.
8204,Good sign #2.
8205,She could visibly see how shaken up I was.
8206,She didn't make any unreasonable requests.
8207,"When I told her I had to make less frequent visits, because of the costs ($80 after today), she understood."
8208,She even asked about sleep.
8209,She asked about what medications I've tried (I'll take a list next time).
8210,I feel so much better now.
8211,"I now have a prescription for 0.5 mg klonopin 1/2 to 1 PRN for anxiety (#20 for a month), and 50 mg doxepin 1-2 at bedtime PRN for sleep (doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant, not sure if it will affect my bipolar but I'm willing to try at this point for some sleep, #60 for 30 days)."
8212,"I have a refill on each, and will see her again in May."
8213,This is the first time I feel relieved after an appointment in ages.
8214,"I saw my regular psychiatrist (local mha paid for w/ state funding) yesterday, and was disappointed."
8215,"He said there's nothing to do with anxiety except increase the effexor (now 225 mg), I'm maxed out on Topamax (200mg), he doesn't want to add anything else, anxiety medication is too addictive so he won't treat it and he suggests I find other ways to cope (as though I haven't tried)."
8216,"I also mentioned that I was having mood swings and not sleeping, and he completely ignored that, except to say ""I don't prescribe anything to sleep, it never helps for very long""."
8217,"I'm thinking of just sticking with the new psychiatrist, even though I have to pay so much and might lose my case worker...."
8218,I've seen family on anxiety meds and haven't seen great things come of it.
8219,"[Warning: Long, but if you've never tried meds you might find this worth a read.]"
8220,It's been a few days with meds.
8221,I was so anxious and skeptical of psychiatric medication.
8222,"So please, if you can relate to this story but haven't yet booked an appointment to see about meds -- DO IT."
8223,"After being off for about 2 months I thought I'd get a good ""baseline"" for what it's like to be off meds."
8224,My question is if you've come OFF your meds do you have any tips?
8225,I'm hesitant to start on meds again but will if I have to.
8226,"I think today was such a success because of the medicine I've been taking, which is: Lexapro."
8227,"She is afraid to take any medication, being very susceptible, and doesn't feel comfortable going to counseling."
8228,After 3 years of being on Lexapro I came off the meds feeling ready to be my old self again.
8229,The next 6 - 7 months consisted of medication and therapy.
8230,I took both meds immediately prior to beginning an 8-hour shift at work.
8231,"I have diagnosed generalized anxiety, I usually take my meds and the ill be fine."
8232,I was prescribed anti-anxiety medication sometime around January and I had been doing fantastic until Thursday.
8233,"Since starting the medication I haven't had any panic attacks and my depression was under control, but I'm feeling it pretty bad right now.."
8234,"People who are on anxiety medication, have you had ""feelings from the past"" return?"
8235,After talking with me and her doctor and getting on medication for depression (and anxiety soon) she's been happier.
8236,"I started seeing a counselor and got back on medication, but there are two problems with that: 1, counseling hasn't really helped me all that much and 2, I can't afford to go."
8237,"I'm still taking my medicine, but it's not helping all that much."
8238,I am too scared to take my medicine.
8239,I will also be having to get a medicine change as the zoloft was no good and made my problem much worse.
8240,"He refused to even so much as write me a refill after that, saying that I should have successfully withdrawn, and so I was left to find other means to get my medication."
8241,I am very hesitant about going on long term medication.
8242,"I just hear so many stories about side effects and I kinda have a litle phobia of taking medication that alters my ""brain"" anyway."
8243,I hear about meds like Effexor and how people are so addicted to them and get these brain zaps when they miss doses and so on.
8244,It kinda makes me wanna check out meds and see if it gives me some peace of mind.
8245,Edit: Oops I just realized I forgot a title.
8246,That's awkward.
8247,It would be: [Meds] Question about Lexapro side effects and in need of advice.
8248,"Where to begin...

Well, I started Zoloft towards the end of September of last year."
8249,"I started at 50mg, then 100mg, and finally 150mg."
8250,Around August of this year is when I went up to the 150mg dosage.
8251,It had helped me for most of the year up until then.
8252,"Even with the increase, I just wasn't feeling great."
8253,It was almost like it just decided to stop working all of a sudden.
8254,I decided to switch to Lexapro towards the end of November of this year because I was having mental breakdowns and feeling depressed.
8255,"I've been taking 20mg daily for about 3 weeks now, and I've been feeling much worse."
8256,Recently the depression has gotten severe and I know it must be a side effect of the new medication.
8257,I know that you tend to feel worse before the meds finally kick in.
8258,"I'm not sure what to do, though."
8259,"Do I continue to wait it out and just put up with constant breakdowns, depression, and feeling miserable and hopeless?"
8260,I feel like I can't switch medications again because its only been 3 weeks on the new one.
8261,I just feel stuck.
8262,I don't know how I'm supposed to deal with feeling like this for any longer.
8263,What if it takes another 3 weeks until I start feeling better?
8264,How am I supposed to get through another 3 weeks of this??
8265,"I'm definitely going to tell my therapist how I'm feeling, but I'm afraid they're just going to tell me to wait it out because thats when they said last time."
8266,"So yeah, any advice on how to get through the next few weeks?"
8267,And if I'm not feeling better in 3 more weeks (which would equate to a total of 6 weeks taking 20mg of lexapro) then should I consider switching meds again?
8268,Thanks!
8269,I've seen all types of different forms of anxiety but I need to know I'm not alone on this one.
8270,I'm a 21 year old female who has had anxiety since I was 15.
8271,The earliest time I've ever felt this fear was when I slept over at a boyfriends and constantly felt I was going to wet the bed.
8272,I used to heavily smoke pot until one day I had a full blown panic attack.
8273,"I stopped using since then because every time I did, I would now get severe attacks."
8274,"I've never once pissed or shit my pants, but yet this is what I fear the most."
8275,"I've been put on numerous medications to try to combat this, only one working which was Xanax."
8276,"But as I kept taking this my anxiety spread to while I felt that sort of ""high"" it gives."
8277,"Now anything that gives me an altered mindset, makes my panic 10x worse."
8278,"I don't have a fear of going to the bathroom in public places, I have a fear that I don't have control over when I go."
8279,This causes me to ALWAYS have to know where the restrooms are and that I can definitely make it/go anytime I want.
8280,At first it was seldom and I just needed to get up and walk around in social gatherings.
8281,Now I have to go to the bathroom whenever I first come into a store/house.
8282,"Then constantly have to get up to keep going ""just to check."""
8283,I feel like I really have to go constantly and I never go when I get to the bathroom.
8284,"If I try to fight it and don't get up and go, I get dizzy can't breath correctly and my stomach turns which makes me feel even more like I have to go since my stomach is sick making me have the shits."
8285,I have issues with riding in cars however long it will take.
8286,Anywhere I go I NEED to know where the restroom is.
8287,I've resorted to not leaving my house anymore because I can't stand the constant feeling of being uncomfortable.
8288,"If I can't access the bathroom or I don't know where it is, I instantly get sick, dizzy and can't breath right.."
8289,It's frustrating to everyone I know including ex boyfriends because I simply cannot do anything.
8290,"I can't go to the movies, go into stores, friends, parties, even while I was attending college I found myself skipping class so I didn't have to bear that feeling."
8291,I'm currently seeing a therapist to try to figure out my underlying issues.
8292,I'm tired of everyone telling me that I just need to face my fears.
8293,I've tried damn near everything and I just can't take it anymore.
8294,I need to know someone else experiences this.
8295,"I have suffered from depression/anxiety my whole life and was medicated with Prozac before I became pregnant (before anyone asks, I did consult my doctor about going off the medication before we tried to conceive."
8296,"I started seeing a therapist and am going back on medication, which quells my panic and fear pretty damn well, when i'm on it."
8297,"WALL OF TEXT (APOLOGIES):

My healthcare provider is Kaiser Permanente."
8298,"Which means that all of my doctors see my medical records every time I see them, which show that they covered part of my stay at a rehab for opiate abuse in 2009."
8299,Any psychiatrist I've seen since 2009 has completely barred me from being prescribed any medications that could be deemed potentially addictive.
8300,"I've been prescribed Adderall in the past for my ADHD, which did WONDERS."
8301,I absolutely never abused it and stayed at a low 5mg per day successfully for years.
8302,I never asked for a refill early or used my medication up too quickly.
8303,I actually usually had leftover when my psych appointments would come.
8304,"A lot of my anxiety manifests as physical paralysis, being so overwhelmed by all the potential tasks that I have to accomplish that I end up not really accomplishing anything, not knowing where to start."
8305,"Low doses of adderall really helped with my productivity, focus and impulsiveness."
8306,"As a result, counter intuitive to what a lot of people experience with stimulants, my anxiety was decreased significantly as I confidently handled all the tasks in my life."
8307,"At this same time I was also prescribed xanax, also at a low dose, for panic emergencies, which I usually ended up taking about once a week."
8308,I also never abused this medication and always had leftover when my psych appointment would roll around.
8309,I absolutely NEVER indicated to any of my doctors that I was ever abusing ANY of my medication.
8310,"As far as I was concerned, it was doing its job at the doses prescribed."
8311,"I went to rehab for heroin, which I feel I was self medicating with to deal with seasonal effective disorder, brought on by extremely rainy and snowy weather of the city I was attending college in (originally from sunny So Cal)."
8312,"The depression brought on by combined disillusionment with my liberal arts university, and 300 day a year rain and snow triggered the Major Depressive Disorder that I've been struggling with for over 7 years now."
8313,"I guess the point of this is that I'm so sick and tired of dealing with this with SSRIs, SNRI's, and other anti-depressants and bunk bullshit anxiety medications (I'm looking at you Buspar)."
8314,"None, absolutely NONE of the anti-depressants I've taken have decreased my anxiety in any way."
8315,"About a month and a half ago I quit my Lexapro cold turkey because my already fragile self esteem plummeted when I woke up one day after only being on the med for a few months and realized I'd gained 50lbs, and my sex drive had absolutely died."
8316,"I tried wellbutrin, which gave me a seizure and made my hair fall out."
8317,SSRIs usually make me very lethargic and zombie like.
8318,I just want to go back to the medications that worked for me.
8319,"I still have all the same ADHD symptoms I did as a child, I'm 25."
8320,"I still have the same panic problems, with or without anti-depressants."
8321,"I've explained all this to my doctor, and there is no budging."
8322,No doctor covered by Kaiser is going to prescribe me any fucking benzos.
8323,I think they would help SOOOO MUCH.
8324,"My negative self talk is SO BAD right now, I just think I deserve a fucking xanax or klonopin or valium every once in a while to help."
8325,I completely disagree that because I abused ONE specific drug that means I will automatically abuse every single drug.
8326,"I want to know if I should just give up on this whole getting anxiety meds that actually work for me, and attempt other med free methods of dealing with this."
8327,Or should I get new health insurance/pay out of pocket for a doctor outside Kaiser Permanente?
8328,"Other methods I already use to calm anxiety are cutting caffeine, deep breathing exercises, to-do lists."
8329,"I'm still struggling with self care like bathing, money woes have me not checking my bank account when I should, I spend a lot of time sitting around and ignoring my to-do lists."
8330,"I can usually only focus on one self care thing at a time like, oh this month I'll try to bathe more than once a week, this week I'll brush my teeth every day, this week I'll get really into nail polish."
8331,Nothing sticks and I feel so aimless.
8332,"TL;DR - I used to shoot heroin a long time ago so now none of my doctors will prescribe me any potentially addictive medications, even if they've worked wonders in the past and I didn't abuse them."
8333,I've never been this anxious about speaking in front of my class before.
8334,I'm not even being graded for this.
8335,I could just stand there and read straight from my page of notes in a monotone and it wouldn't affect my grade at all.
8336,But that hasn't stopped me from freaking out over this.
8337,"I've tried practicing, and I can't get through the first paragraph without having to stop, even when I'm reading to my dog."
8338,I have to leave in a little under two hours and I'm so nervous.
8339,"If you need any general info, I'm in high school, I'm a female, and I haven't been diagnosed with any anxiety disorder/prescribed any medications."
8340,"I'm also convinced there's something catastrophically wrong with my heart, even though I'm on blood pressure medication and have had a normal stress echocardiogram, as well as a battery of other tests (all normal except for elevated cholesterol)."
8341,Meanwhile I lost a lot of hair and gained weight and was just generally feeling hopeless about my medication situation.
8342,"So, I'm in the process of getting some medication for my physical anxiety symptoms."
8343,My younger brother received open heart surgery when he was about 14 to fix a bad valve.
8344,He had a heart attack that the hospital did not catch and the heart went damaged for a few days before they realized there was a problem.
8345,They had to go back in and do a bypass.
8346,He is now forever in heart failure and has a pacemaker in case his heart decides to give up.
8347,He is 17 today.
8348,"A year after the operation, he began experiencing pain in his stomach which would eventually become vomiting."
8349,"He does not stop vomiting, at all."
8350,It is constant.
8351,He usually has to go to the hospital in which they do something to calm his body down and they restore his fluids.
8352,He looks like a walking dead zombie when he has these episodes.
8353,"I am only his brother, so I do not know everything, but after a long time they have ruled this as being a form of anxiety and an eating issue."
8354,"Stress, excitement, etc trigger him and he begins to be in pain and vomit."
8355,"In addition to this, things he eats also trigger it."
8356,There is a special list of things he needs to avoid consumption of and it is quite broad.
8357,"He is prescribed heart medications combined with Ativan and Zofran to combat his ""episodes."""
8358,"He only takes these when a problem arises, and sometimes refuses and tries to fight it off."
8359,"Not only does this concern me, but what he does to personally fight it concerns me too."
8360,It is only until now that I and my parents have realized he goes into the shower and turns it on as hot as possible and lets it hit his back.
8361,"He does not take his shirt off because of his scars, so he does not ever get sunburn on his back."
8362,His back the other day was completely red.
8363,"As in, he had not been in the shower or burned by the sun."
8364,"Our fear is he is burning his back with the shower and that it distracts him from the pain in his stomach, or the stress in his head."
8365,The only path we have for helping him right now is sending him off to this rehabilitation place where we would not see him for something like a month.
8366,This would both be mentally exhausting for my parents and definitely fought by my brother.
8367,Does anyone know someone who has experienced something even remotely similar?
8368,Do you guys have vomiting episodes?
8369,What did you do?
8370,Any help is extremely useful.
8371,I just want to see him live the normal life he has not had.
8372,"However, this time I do have medication on me (ativan) which I'll be taking before I leave, and carrying with me throughout the day."
8373,It started after I got back from a visit to the doctor about the adverse reaction to the medication.
8374,I don't want to go to the doctor and get put on medication for it.
8375,"I sometimes can't get a hold of my doctor or forget to renew my perscription, does anyone know how I can get this medicine without the formal channels ?"
8376,I was wondering if anybody else has problems like this and if medication helps?
8377,"Also will I  have to go to a therapist if I decide to try medication, I've been to 2 before and didn't find it helpful?"
8378,So a few weeks ago I was prescribed Zoloft for depression/anxiety.
8379,The first week had some pretty awful side effects but nothing I couldn't push through.
8380,Then when I increased my dosage to 50mg I had bloody diarrhea and had to stop taking it.
8381,"Now, I've been put on Lexapro, 5mg."
8382,"My first dose was around 3PM, and about an hour after I started feeling extremely anxious and extremely weird - like spacey, dissociated."
8383,At first I thought it was just my own anxiety about taking medication but I also had a loose stool.
8384,I'm pretty frustrated right now and ready to give up on medications.
8385,**Anyone have any similar experiences but found it beneficial to keep trying different meds?
8386,** I don't want to give up but the disappointment and the side effects just make me want to quit.
8387,Edit: Added the Lexapro dosage.
8388,"I also have a bad cold and have been taking cold meds with phenylephrine in it, which I just found out can increase anxiety."
8389,"And as a result of all of this - being sick, new meds, etc, I haven't been eating or drinking much."
8390,"I don't have any experience with meds, so I'm a bit worried as to how I will react to this."
8391,Does anyone have any experience with lorazepam or similar meds?
8392,"so anyway, im hoping to get put on medication again, just so i can cope with it and move on."
8393,I am new to the whole medicine thing.
8394,I've been terrified to take medicine until recently...
8395,And I just want to know if getting medication for this would help at all...
8396,"I don't even know what I would say to a psychologist, I guess I just need some feedback on if medication has truly changed peoples lives for the better... People that cope with anxiety, depression, etc."
8397,"So I just discovered this subreddit and decided to post on here to vent, talk to someone who understands or whatever."
8398,I made a throwaway because for some reason I'm really embarrassed of people I know finding out about how much I struggle with this type of stuff.
8399,"So I'm in my 4th year of college, but it took me a while to decide on my major and I transferred twice so I'm supposed to graduate next December, but at this rate it might be later."
8400,"I had always had problems with ADD and insomnia, but was not allowed to be on any medication for it until freshman year of college."
8401,"By that point, I knew that I really needed to do something about those two problems or I would flunk out."
8402,The first psychologist I talked to about it had me give a history of what my education had been like and what problems I experienced each year.
8403,"He told me that he thought I had social anxiety (in fact he said it seemed so obvious from such a young age that he might call it a crime that it was not dealt with in elementary school), and that the ADD and insomnia might be separate, but could be caused by anxiety so he wanted to do therapy to improve it over time."
8404,"That was a hard thing to come to terms with, and I knew that in the meantime I would be flunking out of college, so I didn't go back and went to another doctor to deal with the issues."
8405,I got prescribed medication for ADD and insomnia.
8406,"This helped for a while, but now I'm going to a more difficult university and it's just not enough anymore."
8407,"Both medications do a little bit to help, but the anxiety, which I was able to cope with or ignore before, gets worse and worse as my classes get harder."
8408,"It's difficult to go to class more often than not, and I end up missing classes because of it, which makes things worse."
8409,Assignments can be so overwhelming that just the thought of them can make me want to just hide under the covers.
8410,When I try to work on them anxiety just kind of takes over and I can't even get started.
8411,I made great grades in high school and took advanced classes.
8412,"I did really well at the beginning of college too, but starting last semester my grades have started to go down."
8413,"In less than a year, I transitioned from thinking I MIGHT take a semester off before going to grad school, to doubting that I will make it to graduation."
8414,"I just feel anxious and miserable most of the time, and constantly daydream about dropping out."
8415,I just have no motivation and feel like I'm drowning constantly.
8416,"Talking about anything personal is really really difficult for me, especially something like this, but when I do find the courage to talk about it the responses I get from the people I care about are always negative, like ""Oh, you're just really lazy."
8417,"College is hard for everyone,"" from my best friend, or my dad being like ""Well maybe if you put in the appropriate amount of time and effort like everybody else you wouldn't have to deal with anxiety."""
8418,Then that just makes it worse.
8419,I'm sorry that I have rambled on so much and had kind of a pity party.
8420,I just want to talk to someone who understands and won't just make me feel more awful about it.
8421,I have been reading on this sub that people have had issues with gaining weight on this medication.
8422,I have gained a lot of weight in the past year trying to cope with my anxiety and I don't want this medication to get in the way of my ability to lose that weight.
8423,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the place for this, but my fiance has just started therapy and medication for Generalized Anxiety Disorder."
8424,I've been on Klonopin for about 8 months.
8425,It has been working perfectly but I got switched to a new doctor who's against prescribing benzodiazepines.
8426,I'd like to stay on the Klonopin but I'm forced to choose between Neurontin or Vistaril.
8427,It's kind of a long story.
8428,"I'm just wondering if anyone here has any experience with Neurontin or Vistaril and could chime in on how, or if,  it helps with their anxiety."
8429,I'm kind of freaking out a little because the Klonopin has been a wonder drug for me and I haven't read great things about Neurontin or Vistaril.
8430,"I have read some good experiences with these two meds for treating anxiety, but it seems more people prefer some kind of benzo."
8431,Klonopin is definitely a stronger drug and can be addictive but it does work if used as prescribed.
8432,Am I wasting my time switching to Neurontin or Vistaril?
8433,Anybody here with something positive to say about these two medications?
8434,Should I try to find another psych who will keep me on the Klonpin?
8435,Any advice appreciated.
8436,"I'm aware meds aren't going to be some miracle cure, but it feels like I've got as far as I can get with sheer effort alone."
8437,"When anxiety came into the mix a few years ago, I started seeing therapist and psychiatrists, and tried all sorts of meds."
8438,"* FINALLY get a chance to get my allergies which have proressively getting worse checked out but I only get on nasal medication which could have preforated my sinuses, according to the pamphlet which I did not read after a yaer or so of using it too much."
8439,"I became addicted to medication and had a nervous breakdown and I was sent to places that were traumatic because they ripped me from my safe home, and I went through A LOT of abuse in the psychiatric places."
8440,"One of them took the analysis test to see if i should be properly tested for ADHD and it was recommended that id be actually tested to get medication, but i looked around at all the people around me just claiming that they might need meds because they might have ""ADHD"" and it made me feel like one of them just trying to solve my problems with drugs that i dont actually need."
8441,"http://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/autism-spectrum-disorders/mdma-social-anxiety-autism/article/416811/

the Psychiatry Advisor take:
A group of researchers is proposing a study that would examine the potential therapeutic use of the psychedelic drug MDMA, more commonly known as Ecstasy, for the treatment of social anxiety in autistic individuals."
8442,"Alicia L. Danforth, PhD, of the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, Calif., and colleagues argue that when used carefully and in a pure form, MDMA, like other hallucinogenic drugs, is able to boost moods and potentially allow those with autism to open up more."
8443,"Writing in the journal Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry, the authors say that to date, MDMA has been tested in 1133 people for research purposes with adverse events rare and not life threatening."
8444,"In addition, they said that a study began in spring 2014 examining MDMA as a treatment for social anxiety in autistic people."
8445,"“MDMA catalyzes shifts toward openness and introspection that do not require ongoing administration to achieve lasting benefits,” the authors write, adding that this could provide benefits over medications that need to be dosed daily."
8446,"“Consequently, clinicians could employ new treatment models for social anxiety or similar types of distress administering MDMA on one to several occasions within the context of a supportive and integrative psychotherapy protocol.”
MDMA is also being looked at to treat other psychiatric conditions."
8447,"For example, a 2010 study found administering MDMA during psychotherapy alleviated symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compared to 25% who had therapy alone."
8448,"And two years later, most of those who had used MDMA in the study remained without ADHD symptoms."
8449,Can Psychedelic Drug MDMA Treat Social Anxiety in Autism?Can Psychedelic Drug MDMA Treat Social Anxiety in Autism?
8450,"Ecstasy could be taken by autistic adults to help them open up in social situations, researchers say."
8451,The street drug — also known by its medical name MDMA — is thought to encourage a positive mood among strangers and lessen awkwardness.
8452,"Rising in popularity in the the late 1970s and early 1980s among a circle of underground chemists, therapists and psychedelic drug enthusiasts, it later became infamous as the drug that fuelled all-night raves."
8453,"But the side-effects remain positive and the drug is known to increase energy, euphoria, emotional warmth and empathy toward others."
8454,"Drawing on these psychological responses, researchers are planning their first study using MDMA for the treatment of social anxiety."
8455,"I just wanted to give you guys something before... 
 Two years ago I went from being someone who was afraid of being seen in public and almost throwing up two years ago to finding a doctor and getting medication that fixed me for the most part."
8456,I had a meds change (I am now on Zoloft) and so far so good.
8457,However I could see my family doctor for anxiety meds if I need to get them sooner.
8458,Should I try to make an appointment for my doc to get meds for Christmas?
8459,I was already diagnosed with anxiety prior to this but never took any meds.
8460,I am now on some medication that my significant other does not want me to take.
8461,For the past two weeks my anxiety and sense of hopelessness have reached an all-time high.
8462,There have been several times where I've felt intense anxiety surrounding thoughts that I'm not in a sober mindset and that there's no escape from how I'm feeling other than killing myself.
8463,The only thing that keeps me going is remembering that I felt happy and relaxed a year and a half ago before I began having serious issues with anxiety.
8464,"Now I'm feeling that after a graduate from university in a month, I'll have nothing to look forward to in my life and have to deal with this anxiety without the support from the counselors and doctors at the university that have helped me through this really tough time in my life."
8465,I don't know if I'll ever get better or if my mind is just broken beyond repair and will have to experiment with different medications and deal with terrifying side-effects.
8466,I just don't know what to do right now and I'm not sure what other options I have.
8467,"I've spoken with doctors, a psychiatrist, and have been in regular contact with two counselors who have all encouraged me to either increase my medication or experiment with other medications despite my anxiety centering around experiencing the effects of medications and second-hand exposure to other psychoactive substances."
8468,And I'm worried that the coping techniques I've learned (thought-stopping &amp; self-talk) are not enough to help ward off the worrying and sometimes suicidal thoughts that intrude into my mind.
8469,I just don't know what to do.
8470,"As a kid and a teen I was an over-thinker, I worried non stop about things, I couldn't answer the door because Id start shaking because I didn't know what was on the other side, if I saw a pretty girl I wound instantly feel awful about myself and want to hide in a corner or something (which I realize also is a mix of bad self image) and I would have issues speaking or whatnot, etc."
8471,Basically I had a lot of issues that I always thought were my own fault because I was weird or dumb or something.
8472,"They were more minor prior to something very personal happening to me that was ongoing for a number of years (but is now thankfully over).About a year and a half ago, give or take, my doctor diagnosed me with moderate anxiety."
8473,"Which was good, because it made me feel better about how I thought I was just crazy."
8474,Now onto the relationship part.
8475,"I have the best boyfriend ever, hes very understanding and caring and all around great."
8476,"Recently we've been trying to get into an apartment, which has been making me really anxious."
8477,"I keep on worrying something will go wrong, etc."
8478,"Anyways, we applied to an apartment and practically got it, which is awesome."
8479,But Im very afraid that my anxiety will get worse as I start having to pay bills and all that.
8480,"Not to mention Im a full time student, so school stresses me out as well."
8481,He knows I have anxiety and he tries to be super understanding but he hates not being able to make it better.
8482,"Which is a bummer, because he does help and makes me feel better, its just that sometimes I'm really worried or having issues."
8483,"I choose not to take anxiety medication, because I'm worried of its effects."
8484,But how can I cope with my anxiety and just be normal?
8485,"Also, are anxiety medications really that bad?"
8486,Should I consider them?
8487,EDIT: I also have constant bad dreams and I wake up freaking out.
8488,"Half of the time my boyfriend wakes me up gently because he can hear me making noises, which I do while having a bad dream."
8489,Then he kisses me on the forehead and I eventually fall asleep comfortably on his chest.
8490,"But without him I don't fall back asleep, instead I stay awake shaking and crying sometimes."
8491,Does this happen to anyone else?
8492,"Thank you if you made it this far.... thank you...

**Edit: I go to therapy (with a Psychiatrist that I am quickly beginning to think is useless) and I have seen many different counselors for years (probably since I was 16 so on and off for 13 years) and I take medication."
8493,"My second visit to this ""counselor"" and she gives me pamphlets on this pseudo-medicine garbage."
8494,"She then goes on about a ""ritual"" I can do every day when I wake up, and every night when I go to bed that will reset my energy flow to a positive direction (?!?!"
8495,"), because when it's in a negative direction is when we feel worthless in society."
8496,There is this chest tapping routine that tales like 5 minutes.
8497,"Then she gives me more pamphlets for anxiety attacks, depression and anger with the following;

You start my tapping under your eye, then at your eyebrow, then 18 other steps I can't remember off the top of my head."
8498,"Needless to say it's all psychosematic bullshit medicine, right up there with the people in CA doing ""light therapy"" or whatever the newest unproven bullshit new age medicine is.....

Long story short, I'm out on Short Term Disability for losing it at work."
8499,"I just couldn't handle the depression and anxiety anymore and walking out into traffic (on a highway 50feet from where I was) sounded like a good idea, rather than deal with my life anymore."
8500,So I knew I needed help and tried to get it.
8501,(Also there was a medicine change in there from Zoloft to Effexor.
8502,Effexor is not for me apparently!)
8503,"Now I'm looking at one last appt with her before the disbility leave ends (because hey I'm back on Zoloft and it's not as bad anymore... yes it sucks, and I still cry about it, but walking out in traffic isn't on my to-do list anymore), and I need to get in with a psychologist, who has the ability to play with my medicines and do it the right way, instead of my GP."
8504,"Just wanted to throw a warning out there.... She gave these to me as anxiety coping mechanisims, and while you can train yourself like Pavlov's dog... it's not something I care to do for myself."
8505,Has gotten worse with age to the point where i started counseling after leaving school at 16 and meds at 18.
8506,"I have been struggling with GAD for most my life now and it's gotten better with therapy and medications but sometimes I get almost ""flair ups"" of anxiety."
8507,Today I woke up really anxious about work.
8508,"I decided to get ready to go anyway, it ended up getting worse and I'm calling in sick."
8509,"This is a volunteer position I do once a week for fun, I also work two part time jobs and am getting my masters degree."
8510,"I worked two really long weeks so maybe my anxiety is also my body yelling ""I'm tired!!""."
8511,I've already called in so there's no point feeling like crap about that (even though I do) but I'm worried that missing this day will make next week even harder?
8512,How many of you have missed work due to anxiety?
8513,Have you found it harder to go back because of it?
8514,I am currently on a medication called viibryd.
8515,I have an appointment on the 1st to see how the medication is working out but I just don't know.
8516,"He's 62 years old, and takes medicine daily."
8517,"I'm trying this new thing where I muscle up the courage to go to see doctors about my anxiety and am trying to get on some medication, got my first prescription for a non-antidepressant yesterday for hydroxyzine (to be taken 4x a day) but it doesn't seem to be helping at all and is fully knocking me out (ex: i normally go to sleep around 3-4 in the morning because i work second shift, i took some when i got home at 8 yesterday and went to sleep an hour later and woke up at 3)

advice/anecdotes?"
8518,"Almost 10 hours later I can't remember if I took my medication today, (1 per day in the morning) so what I'm asking is if it is harmful to take 2 pills in 1 day (assuming I did take it) or taking the pill half way through the day is harmful."
8519,"Hey guys, I was wondering if you had any advice about what medications have worked for you or friends."
8520,"Also, what are some ways you've learned to cope with anxiety?"
8521,"I'm having trouble even stepping outside my house, so whatever advice you can offer would be much appreciated."
8522,"I'm also struggling with drinking, which is closely related to my anxiety, so if anyone here has any advice from being in a similar situation I'd love to know what's helped you."
8523,"I've recently been dealing with a lot of anxiety, and while there are many different ways of dealing with it, medication, meditation, therapy, or the million other things you can do, I have found a really easy way to take about 1% of the edge off, and I'm sure a lot of people do it."
8524,"My mother is on anxiety medication and says that if I can handle it without medication, she recommends I try that."
8525,I am on medication now and regular therapy.
8526,This sub pushed me forward to try medication and I can't be more grateful.
8527,"I've told my psychologist every single visit that I'd rather not start anxiety medication, since I've had problems with drinking, recently stopped smoking cigs, and am really worried that I'll get hooked."
8528,"Well a recent visit to the doctor's office because I was worried about appendicitis finally made me cave in, and I discussed starting medication."
8529,"I told my co-worker today about the medication I was prescribed, and he assured me everything would be okay, that I should take it to try it out, and that we would take care of me if something went wrong."
8530,"**Anyways, it'd be cool if anyone had stories to share about the first time taking meds for their anxiety!"
8531,My current medication helps some with depression but does nothing for anxiety.
8532,I don't want to be on this medication any more.
8533,"~male, 20, very high-functioning asperger's, no meds at present
 
Hello friends."
8534,This has been going on in some form for the past five years and I've never taken any medication.
8535,I should also note that I have helped cope with my anxiety without the meds by seriously taking up weight lifting the past few years.
8536,"Background info: not on meds yet, I see a psychiatrist and counsler and I'm still going through my psych evaluation and all my other tests."
8537,"I have been diagnosed with panic disorder, specific phobic disorder, and PMDD."
8538,I take medication for these and see a therapist.
8539,I have learned to cope with my diagnoses and do pretty well most days.
8540,Then I hear about how commonly prescribed my medications are.
8541,"If they are that common, then is everyone sick?"
8542,"And if everyone is sick, it is really a sickness after all?"
8543,Sometimes I feel like my diagnoses are made up ways of telling me I don't handle reality well.
8544,"That some people are better at life than others, and I'm just not good at life."
8545,Am I the only one that ever feels this way?
8546,"DSM tells me I'm sick, but is it like a horoscope, where everyone will find their future in the words?"
8547,I've been taking this medication for over a month now.
8548,"Why I started the course:
My psychiatrist prescribed me medication and that was it."
8549,"Although the medication was helping a lot (no more panic attacks, yay!"
8550,"Me after the course:
I'm currently still on medication, but tapering off (2.5mg currently and no major issues, just headaches, lucky me), and have not had a panic attack in months."
8551,"Since that time i have been taking medication, now at my maximum allowed dosage."
8552,"When i started, the medication felt like it was having a positive effect."
8553,Pot is literally my only medication/remedy when it comes to my anxiety.
8554,I'm too scared to go on meds after seeing my older sister almost kill herself trying to get off her antidepressants.
8555,I also have health anxiety and emetophobia so this has me worried that I'm sick with something... but I know some anxiety meds can cause fatigue?
8556,She prescribed me some medicine that I take occasionally when I can't manage the breathing on my own.
8557,So I've been on Zoloft for about a month now.
8558,A week ago I noticed that my anxiety had eased up a significant amount.
8559,"Strangely enough, yesterday I had a horrible anxiety day (mainly health-anxiety related)

Do other people notice peaks and lows of anxiety when on these medications?"
8560,Is that normal?
8561,Thanks
8562,"I know that the common advice for anxiety is therapy and medication, but I'm far too anxious for the former and strongly dislike the latter."
8563,Usually just opiate pain medication.
8564,He was placed on a number of meds and for a while they worked but now his panic attacks are getting worse and more frequent.
8565,Is it normal for the meds to not work good for a week?
8566,"I will be sure to wait a few weeks before I contact my doctor because from what everyone is saying, these side effects seem normal when you first get on the medication."
8567,"*Apologies this will be a bit of an essay but I need to get this off my chest/written down:*

**Background:** In Feb 2013 I started a good job in admin/scheduling, I was living with my boyfriend (together 2 yrs) and I was in control of my anxiety with no meds."
8568,I talked with my therapist and she said if I don't want to go down the medication route I'd have to have long term therapy which I don't mind.
8569,"I was put on Prozac and 5 years later (today at 20) I still have some very mild panic attacks with the agoraphobia, but am no longer in need of the medication."
8570,"I usually take 2-3mg kpin a night for sleep, I'm running low and told my psych today, she said unfortunately b.c of the snow she can't help me until Wednesday."
8571,"I completely understand, so I cut the dose to 2.5 so I can have enough for tonight and tomorrow night."
8572,We also talked about how next time we'll be adjusting so I won't run low anymore and also possibly adding xanax to my regimen.
8573,I took the klonopin 3 hrs.
8574,"Ago and the rushing anxiety is still here, I can not sleep."
8575,Knowing I don't have any more to take is also just stewing the pot.
8576,"My grandmother, bless her, gave me a couple 2.5mg of xanax when she found out, she said ""just in case things get bad, I know what it's like."""
8577,I've never used xanax before and am honestly a bit intimidated/scared by it.
8578,"Also, the thought of taking 2 different benzodiazepines in a 3 hr."
8579,Span doesn't seem safe.
8580,I most likely will not do it b.c I'd rather just struggle tonright and tomorrow and feel better Wednesday.
8581,"I mean duh, my anxiety is triggered by unexpected death, mixing medications sounds like a Molotov cocktail."
8582,"But, I am curious, So, advice?"
8583,"Agree, disagree?"
8584,"Tl;dr had to take a lower dose of my prescribed klonopin, its not working."
8585,"I have an opportunity to take something else, but not very informed on that route."
8586,I'm 19 and have had anxiety issues/panic attacks since I was about 12 years old stemming from a fear of vomit.
8587,"For about 4 months now, I've not been able to do much outside my house."
8588,"I've seen my friends a couple of times, and I think I've went to a local shop about twice.. but that's it."
8589,"Every time I try and go to our local town or go and see friends, I get about half way there and have to pull over in my car because I think if I go any further I'll have a panic attack or vomit."
8590,"Today, our family friend therapist came to my house to speak to me about things and try out a bit of hypnotherapy as this has helped me in the past."
8591,"When he arrived, I couldn't even come down to speak to him."
8592,I spent about 2 hours in my room trying to build myself up and it didn't work out.
8593,He told my parents that it might be a good option for me to try a mild anti-anxiety drug like Diazepam to bring me down from this heightened sense of panic I've been experiencing.
8594,I would go on this drug if I'm able to use it as a crutch to start doing things again.
8595,I just need an extra push and was wondering if this is a route that others have had success with.
8596,"I've never tried any other prescribed medication, I've always just worked with therapists/over the counter medications like Rescue Remedy and Kalms."
8597,"(Which aren't really strong enough to do anything more, if they ever actually did anything)."
8598,I've read/heard things about getting addicted or becoming depressed/suicidal off of taking prescription meds and this freaked me out a little because I fear that the drugs would make me do things I wouldn't do if I wasn't on them.
8599,"If this helps you address this fear, I'm not a depressed person."
8600,I want to get better and I don't wallow in the negative..
8601,I just get a bit down when I'm not able to do the things I want to do.
8602,"So yah, TL;DR ... what are your thoughts on mild anti-anxiety drugs to get out of a particularly hard situation."
8603,"It's been a few months now, and I've been taking this medication every day without missing any days."
8604,"I don't really feel like it's ""fixed"" or even helped my anxiety."
8605,"I still don't want to leave the house if I have to interact with people, I still find myself scared to interact with friends or family."
8606,"I have a more pronounced ""I don't care"" attitude, it feels like."
8607,I'm noticing myself having to force myself to do stuff because it's hard to see any point to anything.
8608,"I don't recall having these feelings prior to the medication, but I'm wondering if this is the positive from taking it."
8609,It doesn't seem that way.
8610,Should I attempt to switch medications?
8611,What results should I be looking for?
8612,"****EDIT**** I meant to say heav***ier***, not heavy."
8613,I've tried a slew of antidepressants.
8614,"I'm currently taking Wellbutrin and Celexa for ""major depressive disorder"" and ""generalized anxiety disorder""."
8615,"The depression has gotten much better, but it's done nothing for my anxiety issues (which the Celexa was prescribed for)."
8616,"I don't enjoy socializing with people, I get too nervous and anxious to enjoy myself."
8617,"I have physical expressions of anxiety, biting around my fingers until they bleed, same with my lips, grinding my teeth, and I have pretty bad muscle spasms in my neck/upper back."
8618,I recently got a pinched nerve because the muscle spasms were causing a straightening of my cervical spine.
8619,"Aside from that, I also have a lot of ""sensory issues"" as my boyfriend calls them; I basically panic about the way certain things feel (mainly slimy things), but it's to a kind of intense level."
8620,"I think I would benefit greatly from anti-anxiety medications, but how do I talk to my doctor without seeming like I'm just looking for drugs?"
8621,"I've just moved and had to get a new general practice doc, so he doesn't know me at all."
8622,"I'm just afraid he's going to think I'm after drugs (since I first saw him about my pinched nerve, which was just shoulder pain at the time)."
8623,How do I talk to him without sounding like I'm faking it?
8624,"first it was like faraway street lights seeming fuzzy and blurry and today just my sight seems off, i feel like i just wanna close my eyes could be eye strain from being on the pc for a while (online class) and reading in a dark room + meds but im getting scared its a a degenerative disease!"
8625,I'm currently on medication (Celexa) but it takes about 30 days to really work (I've only been on it for a week).
8626,"I'm not really sure what I was expecting, I've never really taken meds before."
8627,I was initially pretty glad about being off my meds but the withdrawals are really getting to me.
8628,Many times I debated going back on my meds but I really don't want to fall back on them again.
8629,"I wake up feeling instantly alert when I'm sleeping on a sofa, probably because I never get any good quality deep sleep, and I hate how long it takes me to wake up when I sleep properly (thanks meds)."
8630,I've been prescribed sleeping meds in the past but everything I've been prescribed has made me wake up feeling unrested and too drowsy the next day to function properly.
8631,"Tl;dr- 7 years of anxiety, meds suck, doctors suck, Fresh air and exercise are awesome,"
8632,"I feel like I need to find a medication or something because as much as I seem to understand this test when I'm in the library, I couldn't execute when I needed to."
8633,I was on medicine for a long time and I went back to the doctor and they upped my dose hoping that it would fix my issues but it hasn't.
8634,First time posting to reddit or reaching out to others who suffer from anxiety.
8635,I'm repeating my final year of Political Science and Economics in University after hitting a brick wall with essay writing.
8636,I left half way through my final year and was hoping that the time off would allow me to recuperate and that I would return with a new lease of life.
8637,As it turned out that was not the case.
8638,"Life stalled, my relationship with my girlfriend withered, and just before returning to University my Dad died."
8639,When the pressure of deadlines returned I found myself floundering once again - totally paralyzed and unable to submit anything.
8640,"I have been linked in with various college services like counselling, occupational therapy, and hopefully will see a psychiatrist soon and have been trying to negotiate extensions and accommodations, all the while unsure of how or if I can turn this ship around."
8641,I have not submitted an essay in over a year but I obsess over it and am consumed by them.
8642,In other respects I don't think I am very anxious but with essays I totally self-sabotage partly I think because of my perfectionism.
8643,I just want to get out of this environment and stop wasting so much time ruminating about essay writing.
8644,I have been (tentatively) diagnosed with GAD and am currently not taking any medications.
8645,I would be very grateful for any help and advice for my situation.
8646,Part of me just wants to pack it in and pursue something I find more meaning in.
8647,I also feel the pressure to stay but question my ability to complete the year.
8648,I cannot afford go to therapy or get medication because I do not have health insurance and  cannot take advantage of any government assistance programs because of my income level.
8649,"So my doctor prescribed me Lexapro for my anxiety the other day but I've been too scared to start taking it because the semester is almost over and I want to go hang out with my friends, go to a couple parties, etc."
8650,this summer.
8651,And I don't know if it's dangerous to drink while taking these types of medications?
8652,"I mean I don't really care if it makes me feel a little more anxious than usual or whatever, what I'm trying to figure out is if it's physically more dangerous than just alcohol alone?"
8653,"I guess my question is, for those of you who are on meds, what are your thoughts?"
8654,This medicine is new to me so I just wanted to see if anyone out there had any good information to contribute.
8655,I was wanting to know if anyone has taken this medicine and what their experiences were.
8656,I'm working on a big exercise program in addition to medicine so I hope to see great improvements over the next few months.
8657,"The counseling was helpful but the feeling usually didn't last (catharsis has always felt temporary), but the medication helped so after several months, I stopped seeing the counselor and just stuck to the meds."
8658,"After a couple years and moving on to a better place in my life, I came off the medication and was doing great for about two years."
8659,"I want to take the other approach of seeking psychotherapy in addition to medication, but my previous experience with a college-provided mental health provider makes me doubt how helpful it would be."
8660,"Don't take any medication though, not for anxiety, not for stress."
8661,"They may offer some ""shut up"" medication, some on the spot calm your ass the fuck down pills."
8662,"What started this all really is I've been going to the doctor recently for the first time in a long time, and the first thing they did was remove moles from me and one had a chance of being something worse, which it didn't in the end, but this re activated my anxiety about things that could be wrong with me, and I just want it to stop, I am married with 2 kids, and I don't want to be the scared daddy, I finally feel somewhat better, but I don't wanna take meds."
8663,In recent years I've begun having panic attacks.
8664,"I mostly get panicky while travelling abroad, or when I'm in unfamiliar surroundings."
8665,"In the past, I've had somebody to console me during these attacks while abroad, but I have to travel alone in a couple of weeks and am dreading a potential attack, whether it be at the airport or at my destination."
8666,"I'm genuinely curious as to what alternative route you guys might take to remedy your anxiety, especially panic attacks."
8667,I don't have a prescription for any medications as they're pretty hard to obtain where I'm from unless you pay for therapy (which I can't afford).
8668,Thanks for your help!
8669,After a panic attack at work yesterday I scheduled an appointment to see my doctor about getting put on some more anti-anxiety meds.
8670,"Now I have my medication again, but it hasn't seemed to kick in yet."
8671,"I got things sorted, as far as I know, but I'm basically useless right now, and I don't know what to do until the meds kick in again."
8672,"I'm seeing a therapist, on medication, and have sought help from my university."
8673,"My family doctor, gave me a prescription for anti-depressant/anxiety medication (luvox) and refused to write me a referral, rather seeing if the med's would be the solution."
8674,I also have to take my anxiety meds then which I hate doing.
8675,Is it worth seeking councelling or new meds?
8676,"For the past several weeks, I've noticed that heart has been hurting."
8677,"I'm always under immense stress because of anxiety, always thinking about all of the studying that's ahead of me and how I won't be able to complete it, imagining myself failing at my classes and everything."
8678,"I'm also an exchange student at Denmark, so that has been a new level of anxiety for me as well."
8679,Ever since being here I've noticed that my heart has just been hurting.
8680,"I mean, *really* hurting."
8681,"Sometimes before bed, it will hurt out of nowhere to the point where my eyes shoot open because it literally feels like someone is squeezing the shit out of my heart and sitting on my chest."
8682,"Other times I'll be with a classmate and I'll think they're thinking bad thoughts about me, and my heart will just start tensing up again and when I inhale it just hurts like a bitch."
8683,It's not uncommon for my chest to hurt every now and then.
8684,"This morning when I woke up I freaked out because I thought I overslept, and I haven't been able to shake off that fear even after a few hours later."
8685,I've been really thinking about going into antidepressants because this anxiety has been looming over me since the beginning of college.
8686,"I'm a third year now, about to be a fourth year."
8687,"I have been in therapy before, but I don't see the point in going to a therapist until I head back to the States which is in two months."
8688,"I want to go on a combination of both therapy and antidepressants, because I feel like therapy itself may not be enough for me."
8689,"In the past, I've taken Citalopram but it just made me feel like a body without a soul."
8690,"What do you think, guys?"
8691,Should I get my heart checked out and be put on some antidepressants?
8692,Usually I would stray away from most medications but I think that taking an antidepressant will be more beneficial on my health than not taking any at all.
8693,"For reference, I haven't had a full blown attack since before I started my current medication for the unrelated issue, which is at this point nearly a full year."
8694,"I was put on medication (Lexipro) and I think it's working, but I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to feel."
8695,I decided to taper down and come off the medication as I was at odds with the mood stabilising aspect of the drug.
8696,"For the past three months, I've felt like I've had some neurological disorder, like a tumor or something."
8697,"I am fatigued constantly throughout the day (that has been a problem for years actually), but for the past three months I haven't been able to sleep at night for more than two to three hours at a time, lately it's been getting worse to where my whole body shakes in my sleep, and I feel so scared as if someone is breaking into my house or the devil is in my room or something."
8698,On top of that I wake up with crazy headaches and feel so confused for the first few minutes.
8699,My doctor (and two other doctors - ive gone for second and third opinions) have all suggested anxiety.
8700,I will be sitting for the bar exam on this coming monday.
8701,"The fiance and I are planning a wedding for October, which has taken the rest of what little free time I've had."
8702,And my estranged mother has just gotten hospice nurses coming to her home as she is dying from stage iv ovarian cancer.
8703,"I feel like being overwhelmed by stress in all of that would be understandable, but I feel that I've managed my stress well."
8704,I went to counseling before all of these areas got cluster-f*cked to find out how to deal with these situations before they occurred.
8705,I workout 6 days a week to get stress off and I eat right.
8706,Nobody besides my fiance and my close family can tell that anything is going on in my personal life.
8707,I thought I handled the stress well and I don't get how this anxiety stuff can be happening if I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing physically and mentally.
8708,"But now, I can't sleep until I shouldn't be sleeping and then I can't help but to sleep."
8709,I can't focus to get quality study for arguably the most important test in my life.
8710,I can't hear a motivational song without relating to it to the point of crying for no reason.
8711,I really need to get back to normal.
8712,Any advice would be very helpful.
8713,Thank you.
8714,EDIT: Just now reading the side of this: I'm 29 years old and male.
8715,I'm not on any medications.
8716,My doctor put me on generic zoloft for a minute.
8717,"It didn't help w/ insomnia, but I wasn't shaking or having nightmares and waking up scared back then either."
8718,I decided to get off because they weren't helping me study.
8719,It made me feel lazy to the point of not wanting to do anything but chill out.
8720,"When I am faced with the prospect of taking anxiolytic meds, I am always worried that I will lose my inspiration and just go through life pleasantly but unproductively, creating nothing new and existing as a cultural zero-sum."
8721,"I developed a huge fear of medication, mainly tablets and pills after having a seizure from taking a certain type of medication."
8722,"I never took the step to take antidepressants or anxiety medication, as I was fearful to even approach a doctor and talk about the subject."
8723,I tried to do it without any medication.
8724,"I was hoping to try the anti-anxiety / depression medication ""Wellbutrin""."
8725,"But alas, it is not approved for psychiatric medication in the UK."
8726,"Ive started seeing a therapist, and am not on any meds yet (see a doc on Mon.)."
8727,Im getting a ADHD diagnosis and i wish to go back to school but i'm sure i can't manage it without support and/or medication.
8728,I'm working with a professional trying to figure out medication and such and it seems like nothing is working.
8729,I'm just not sure how I am supposed to feel while taking medication.
8730,ive tried therapy and meds and im gonna try em again except my dads not really giving me much time to fix my problems at all.
8731,"If I try this medication for 3 weeks, is that a) enough time to feel the effects and b) a short enough amount of time not to experience withdrawal if I choose to stop it?"
8732,I've been having some trouble getting my meds refilled.
8733,"I might have a chance to see him on Saturday, but by then it will have been a week since I've taken my medication."
8734,"After starting Zoloft I do feel like I'm more at ease and I don't take shit so seriously, but I can't really discern if it's the medication or placebo, since the change in my mood was pretty subtle."
8735,"I've become convinced that, as much as I didn't want to have to turn for a drug to help, I probably do need a prescription for anti-anxiety meds to at least help me to begin to break the cycle of not being passionate about anything and being too nervous to get out and actually put my life together, but I'm not sure how to get a prescription, with my parents being convinced that it is unnecessary."
8736,"The problem is, I have been to 3 doctors now and not one will give me fucking anxiety medicine."
8737,So I finally went to a therapist today for a longstanding issue with anxiety.
8738,The therapist didn't seem very interested in anything but my current social issues.
8739,"Granted, my social problems right now are through the roof and might be aggravating my tendency towards anxiety, but I have had anxiety over *everything* (mostly academic) for as long as I can remember."
8740,"His ""plan"" for the year is entirely focused on my relationships with other people, and does not directly focus on anxiety in any way."
8741,"I have never been to a therapist before, so I don't know what is to be expected when you need help with something like general anxiety, or when the person you are seeking help from cannot prescribe medications."
8742,"Should I be more firm in telling him that my problem is my anxiety, not my social life?"
8743,(This is my first post here.
8744,I'm sorry if I've asked a tired question.)
8745,"need meds, can't get them."
8746,"So I take my prescribed anxiety medication (Klonopin 0.25 to 0.75 mg), and I calm down but can't focus anymore."
8747,"I've been to the doctor and they prescribed me with Buspar, but I have yet to take it because I feel like meds aren't the answer."
8748,"This morning I spent hours unable to do anything because I was feeling to sick, I couldn't eat anything, I'm feeling a little better now but still delicate."
8749,"I'm not taking any medications that could be the cause of it, my diet is fairly healthy and I drink plenty of water."
8750,What more can i do?
8751,Will I always feel like this?
8752,(I quit in 2011 when I thought I had a heart problem- turned out to be a side effect of the depression medication that I was on - thanks Citrolorapham!)
8753,I'm 22 years old and not on any medication for my anxiety but I've been to counseling about it before.
8754,"I can't sleep through the night at all and wake up terrified, and I can't take some anti-anxiety meds I was given because I think I'm developing a tolerance to them and don't want to risk worse withdrawal than what I'm pretty sure I'm going through right now."
8755,"Unfortunately I find myself in my late 20s and things have gotten out of control (at least a full panic attack per week, anxious non-stop) so my therapist suggested talking to a psychiatrist and perhaps taking some meds."
8756,"Now I was a psych major in college and have a *basic* understanding of how different meds work and the side effects, etc."
8757,so I'm also aware of the benefits of a combo of therapy and medication.
8758,"The pharmacist immediately looks at the medicine and asks, ""what's wrong with you?""."
8759,"He then starts lecturing me on mental illness and  declares that I don't need the meds because what's wrong with me is all in my head and I can ""get over it"" if I really want to."
8760,"Then just stick to your job, tell me about the meds, and keep your opinions to yourself."
8761,I don't know if I should try to get medication/therapy if in a couple months I won't even be living here anymore.
8762,"&gt; This was written in response to a post on here made a little over an hour ago entitled *""[Meds] Was prescribed clonazepam today and I have some questions""* - I wrote up a lengthy response addressing their questions but found the thread and throwaway account it had been posted with were deleted by the time I finished and hit Save."
8763,"I won't link to the deleted thread or copy the text from it and paste it here out of respect to the user, but I figured I should still post my reply as a self-post in case the user is still here...and even if they aren't, hopefully it will be of some help to anyone else dealing with anxiety with questions about Clonazepam as a new medication."
8764,Here is the response I wrote.
8765,I've been dealing with severe anxiety for about half my life now and was prescribed Clonazepam about 4 years ago which I've been using PRN (as needed) to deal with anxiety ever since.
8766,"First of all, I definitely share your fear and worry of taking a new, unknown medication."
8767,"I'm also ""hypersensitive"" to just about every medication/drug I've come in contact with...I've been on a ton of various medications over the years and every one has had an extreme effect on me, way more than is normal."
8768,"In 95% of these cases it's been a bad reaction; for example, a small dose of a med with a side effect that ""may cause slight fatigue"" ends up making me sleep for 19 hours straight and then I can barely function when I'm awake."
8769,"Or something that ""may cause mild anxiety/irritation"" turns me into an insanely anxious basketcase bundle of nerves."
8770,"So again, I share your fear of taking new meds as well as freaking out easily by taking even slightly too much of something."
8771,"All that being said, of all of the medications I've tried (and there have been a lot), in my experience Clonazepam has been by far the ""least worrying"" medication I've taken...and I mean that literally."
8772,To date it is the only thing that actually takes away my worries (albeit temporarily until the drug wears off) and gives me some semblance of peace and quiet in my head.
8773,"I also have suffered from depression for many years and while plenty of other meds have worsened or caused depressive side effects for me, I have not had this experience with Clonazepam at all."
8774,"Also, 0.25mg is a very low dose for this drug - so if it turns out that you DO happen to have any negative side effects, they should be quite mild given you took such a small amount of the drug."
8775,"Drinking with Clonazepam; this is something I have experience with, but it may be dangerous for me to comment on it since my experience could easily not be the same as yours."
8776,This is definitely something you want to ask a doctor about.
8777,"However, a glass of wine with dinner combined with a low dose of Clonazepam much earlier in the day SHOULD be safe."
8778,"I'd err on the side of caution since everyone reacts differently and since you're starting it for the first time, but I'd rate the danger as very low...and if it did have any effect, it would most likely just be a strengthening of the anti-anxiety effects of the medication and all of the effects of the alcohol."
8779,"Basically, at worst, it would seem like you might have had 2 drinks instead of 1 or taken a double dose instead of a single."
8780,But I urge you to talk to your doctor before trying this.
8781,"In regard to addiction; if you do some google searches for ""least addictive benzo"" (benzo is short for benzodiazepines, the class of drug Clonazepam belongs to) you'll find some differing opinions but often times Clonazepam will come out on top as the least addictive."
8782,"It's very long acting which is good because, unlike short acting meds, there's not as much of a rapid and sharp drop-off that fuels the ""I need to take more now, and again and again when each new dose wears off"" that shorter acting benzos have."
8783,"That being said, if you have an addictive personality and severe anxiety, it CAN be very tempting to reach for a pill on more days than you should (assuming you're only taking it as needed) just because if it works of course you want to feel less anxious for a day rather than face the day without any aid or support."
8784,"However, in nearly 4 years of taking this med as needed AND dealing with crippling anxiety AND having a very addictive personality myself, I haven't had much problem with this."
8785,"There are a few exceptions...weeks where I am especially anxious for whatever reason I'll feel the need to take it every day to get by, but those times have been when I've been at my absolute most anxious and are the exception, not the rule."
8786,"Also, once things have calmed down, I've found it not too difficult to go back to the once every 1-2 weeks as needed schedule."
8787,"But again, everyone works differently...basically, I don't think this should be a big concern for you, especially not when just starting out."
8788,"Lastly, withdrawal."
8789,"No getting around it, benzos are the absolute worst in terms of withdrawal."
8790,But you have to understand that the severe withdrawal horror stories almost exclusively only happen when someone has been dependent on the drug on a daily basis for a very long time or has been abusing it and taking far more than prescribed.
8791,"At such a low dose, and if you're only taking it as needed, the withdrawal concern should be virtually nonexistent."
8792,"Hope you don't mind the novel I wrote you, but I feel I could relate quite well to your post and hopefully was able to thoroughly address each of your concerns."
8793,Overcoming or improving anxiety is such a hard fight but please never stop fighting.
8794,Best of luck.
8795,"Does anyone take a medication that just gets them through the work hours, and then leaves them free to not be on a medication the rest of the day and on weekends?"
8796,It seems like a lot of what psychiatrists do is prescribe medication to take when one is experiencing an anxious state.
8797,"So they sent me home with no medicine but at this point I couldn't sleep much anymore, always grabbing my stomach and then I would wake up every two hours shaking and feeling fear."
8798,"Anyway, they gave me some medicine for the stomach to control the inflammation."
8799,"Even after the CT scan that time, they sent me to get an echo for my organs (pancreas, liver, gall bladder and so on), he said, all good (well, except my liver because I am fat but no medication required)."
8800,"I was expecting to go to the doctor and receive a prescription for some anti-anxiety medication, but nope."
8801,I hate medication.
8802,The medication did help.
8803,"I took medicine for a while, but I didn't like it, so I stopped."
8804,"That same week with the support of my amazing SO I made the decision to finally request to be put on meds, that was terrifying for me as I had never wanted to do it, I am very fearful of things like that and was pretty uneducated about it, but I got on 75mg of Effexor and despite a shaky and nauseous first week it had an amazing impact on my life."
8805,"I really haven't felt too much anxiety with the job either, my meds seem to keep everything in check and after the first week I knew what I was doing and can keep perfectly calm on the phones with people."
8806,"So I have been dealing with some pretty extreme anxiety for a while, with some very unpleasant physical symptoms (dizziness, headaches, random pains) as well as some intense panic attacks."
8807,I went to the doctor this morning (my Mom's suggestion) to see about medication to help me manage my anxiety better since school will be starting in about a month.
8808,I have about 3 semesters to go before I will graduate college.
8809,"My doctor has prescribed me a combination of Zoloft and Klonopin and of course the first thing I decided to do was read about all of the side effects, interactions, etc."
8810,of both drugs online.
8811,I am now so worried about taking them that I am feeling like it was a big mistake to even go to the doctor in the first place and I am worried if these medications with make my symptoms worse as I had read that Zoloft in particular can cause anxiety.
8812,I am also worried because I read a lot of negative things about Klonopin as well.
8813,"So at this point, I am unsure if I am just freaking myself out for no reason (I definitely do that to myself) or if I am only going to make my currently situation harder on myself by taking these medications."
8814,Has anyone else taken either of these?
8815,Or both together?
8816,If so how well did it work for you and how troublesome were the side effects?
8817,I don’t want to be seen as someone who’s “just looking for medication”...
8818,"In fact, I don’t even want to be prescribed medication."
8819,"I don't want therapy, I don't want to be on medication."
8820,I took my meds (200mg of Zoloft) and am trying to calm down.
8821,For the first time since in two years Im actually considering of taking medication.
8822,I just want to know how everyone else is dealing with anxiety/ocd that mainly focus on breathing and how medication could help in improving these habits.
8823,I don't want to go on medication because it only happens once every few months.
8824,"Also, if anyone knows, a few months ago, I was prescribed medication for anxiety and depression."
8825,"It was starting to help, but my mother made me feel so horrible for taking any medication (she doesn't believe medication works or that I even have anxiety/depression), I stopped."
8826,I have a couple of questions regarding general anxiety and meds.
8827,"I live in a third world shithole that thankfully has most of the needed meds in pharmacies and doesn't have a big of a stigma on those in the society, still it's hard to be diagnosed because the psychologists have been schooled in Soviet Union and psychiatry kinda embraces leftovers of the punitive past."
8828,Like telling me to do a non-lethal OD on meds in my apartment.
8829,"I volunteer 3 days a week, I see a counselor, I'm on meds, I have a support worker."
8830,"I had a brilliant enlightenment recently,  I discovered that I am an Agoraphobic Claustrophobic, both in nontraditional ways,

Work makes me feel Claustrophobic in that It essentially takes away my ""exits"" (ability to leave) without having to go through some serious consequences."
8831,These bouts of Claustrophobia produce frequent panic attacks AT work (at its worse 2x hour).
8832,"I'm sure I don't need to explain how terrible panic attacks are here,

My agoraphobia takes over once I'm home, in that I am constantly worried and afraid about going back to the place that causes these anxiety attacks, supporting bad habits such as being late or faking sick; coupled with physical inconveniences like throwing up in the mornings, a gagging cough, a lack of energy, and a loss of appetite."
8833,"I am currently seeing a psychotherapist, and am experimenting (with my physician) with different dosages/medicines."
8834,"I have (in the past month) moved out of state to live with my parents again, and have been using my tax returns to get by."
8835,I am very curious to know how (or if) other people have handled situations akin to mine.
8836,"I need to be able to provide for myself,

Thoughts?"
8837,I'm always nervous when starting a new medication.
8838,I've been dealing with depression for the past couple years (I'm not taking medication) and recently I am having major anxiety(?)
8839,I take medication to prevent shaking so that isn't an issue.
8840,"I'm managing it okay though, and don't feel ""stuck"" like I did pre-medication."
8841,".. speaking in class

.. performing spoken word (even though i really want to)

.. asking the teacher questions when other people are in the room

.. taking ANY sort of exam -- i just freeze up

.. fucking up a technical interview, like i just did

.. anticipating being called on in class unexpectedly

it's like i can't think, all i can do is panic

(would medication help with this?)"
8842,"Also, I shouldn't be expecting results quite yet if I've just started the medication right?"
8843,"I have no money, no job (I am looking), no friends, no insurance, no car, no medication, have anxiety, depression, adhd and living under my mothers roof."
8844,After about 8 months of not needing medication i have now decided to go back.
8845,I have had anxiety since the 3rd grade and on medication on and off.
8846,I don't want to go on meds just for the the next month either because of ants.
8847,And thank you to the medication that makes me want to vomit my brains onto the floor so I can pick it apart in person rather than suffer through the confusing twists and turns in my head.
8848,About a year later I was done with college and thought I could handle no meds.
8849,"After about a month off meds, I went back on Lexapro for about another year."
8850,I am starting to think I'm just one of those people who needs medication and I am trying to be alright with that and not feel weak or broken.
8851,So my question to you all of this anxiety subreddit is... What are your experiences with meds?
8852,Which specific meds worked for you?
8853,I think what scares me the most is that I'll try a new medication and react horribly to it and gain even more weight on top of it all.
8854,"I'm planning on making another trip to my GP this week to discuss how I can better handle this (perhaps medication), but I don't know how to tell my supervisors what happened."
8855,I convinced myself it was the medicine and my psychiatrist immediately told me to stop taking it.
8856,The psychiatrist told me that she has never heard a symptom like this and that the medicine should have been outta my system after the first 5 hours of not taking it.
8857,"I have never taken medication for anxiety/stress, but I have taken something called Circadin that helps sleeping (take it as a soft sleeping pills)."
8858,"Hi r/anxiety/,

I've been lurking here for a while since I was diagnosed with panic disorder a couple months ago."
8859,"I've been having (physical) health problems for about a year, and started having panic attacks every few weeks at about the same time, I think related to the stress of dealing with a chronic disease and not being able to do as much as I used to."
8860,"Anyways, when I went into my family doctor to ask for a referral for mental health stuff, she just prescribed me a low dose (.25 mg) of Xanax to take when I was having panic attacks."
8861,"I took it for the first time this morning and it pretty much just put me to sleep, which did the trick, I guess!"
8862,"It's just, you know, sort of hard to keep down a pill when you're violently throwing up."
8863,"I'm wondering if I should push for therapy, though?"
8864,"I'm already on about 6 other medications for my other health problems, and I feel like since this panic disorder is so mild compared to what most of you go through, maybe I shouldn't be on meds for it?"
8865,Perspectives?
8866,"*

I am mostly here to see if anyone else has experienced this - where the doctor either stopped or won't prescribe ADHD/ADD medication due to the presence of THC, and what choice they made when it came to smoking weed or taking meds."
8867,"Anyways, this got me thinking to mention this anxiety to my doctor and get her opinion on starting anti-anxiety meds."
8868,"** 

**TL;DR: Been taking Vyvanse for 2 years and was recently drug tested by doctor for anti-anxiety meds (which I hate and will discontinue taking due to side effects)."
8869,"[This is long, I'm sorry."
8870,Cookie for anyone who reads the entire thing.]
8871,"If anyone has suggestions of online articles, self help books, blogs, or anything within the realm of managing anxiety (social and otherwise, panic, etc), please pass it on."
8872,"I need to know that there's some hope for my future, I keep destroying everything good in my life due to my anxieties."
8873,I live in a city where I know no almost one other than my mother.
8874,"I have an apartment that I love but it's way too expensive to pay for, especially now that I'm unemployed."
8875,"As of now, it looks like I'm going to have to break the lease, lose my security deposit, and probably have a bad reference from my landlord."
8876,"Moving back into my mothers house is humiliating, even though I know it's temporary."
8877,It makes me feel like I have completely failed at life.
8878,I have nothing right now.
8879,I have been here for a year and somehow have managed to fuck myself over completely.
8880,I have absolutely no friends or social life due to crippling anxiety.
8881,"I know that deep down, I'm outgoing and have a strong desire to be surrounded by great people, but I have no idea how I would even go about meeting them."
8882,"At the same time, I don't want to meet new people because I'd be embarrassed to tell them about my situation."
8883,It's a vicious circle.
8884,"I'm depressed and rarely go out, I feel worthless most of the time, especially now."
8885,I'm on BuSpar and Tramadol for my (super fun) variety of issues.
8886,I've tried several different medications and this is the only combo that even *touches* the anxiety.
8887,"Unfortunately, it also makes me exhausted, so much so that if I go grocery shopping or for a small walk, I'm so tired after that I have to take a nap."
8888,I get dizzy and black out every time I stand up.
8889,These things keep me from being able to do what I need to do to get another job.
8890,My savings are going to be completely depleted by the end of next month if I can't find a source of income.
8891,"I feel horribly guilty that I can't get my family what they want for Christmas, and everything seems to have gone to shit."
8892,I quit my job due to being completely physically overworked.
8893,"It was a position as a massage therapist, and now I have tendinitis-like pain in my forearms."
8894,I have no desire to continue with this career.
8895,"I had a bad experience full of harassment from men and inappropriate coworkers; I'm just completely burnt out, I want nothing to do with it anymore."
8896,"When I was working at this job, it was full time and I was constantly in excruciating pain."
8897,"My eczema would flare up and I would be itchy, burning, and dry all over my arms, and still have to apply products to them to massage people."
8898,"When I woke up in the morning, I literally couldn't move my hands or fingers because of the repetition and intensity of the massages."
8899,"I finally worked up enough courage to talk to my manager about going part-time but was rudely told no, due to the business overflowing during that particular season."
8900,"After about 8 months of misery, I completely snapped one day and quit the job without notice, with nothing lined up."
8901,"I was too scared to give two weeks because I saw how horribly my coworkers got treated in their final days, often being told to just get the fuck out."
8902,"I know this was dumb, but I had reached the end of my rope."
8903,"I figured with 3 months of rent saved up, I'd be okay."
8904,I was wrong.
8905,"It's always been very easy for me to get jobs, I've been told I'm great at interviewing."
8906,The problem is my horrid anxiety.
8907,"Having been diagnosed with panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and severe depression, no matter how many times people tell me that it's going to be fine, that I'm great at interviewing, or even the proof of my success in doing so in the past, I'm scared out of my fucking mind."
8908,"I'm terrified of making a fool out of myself, and the worst part is that I know it doesn't matter."
8909,"Logically, I know that I am not important to the interviewer, just another person, and if I embarrass myself, who cares."
8910,I will never see them again.
8911,"Yet, when I think about having to go, my mind goes into overdrive, contemplating all of the things that will possibly go wrong and the whole process of being the ""new"" person, etc."
8912,"I can realistically get past that and go to an interview, I have before, obviously."
8913,"Something now is just blocking my ability to follow through with it, which is not good at all."
8914,"I also know I'm not going to immediately get another ""career"", and I'm not being picky."
8915,"I recently got accepted to an online work program, (LiveOps), which my cousin recommended, but I have no idea if it's going to provide much money at all."
8916,I definitely will need another source of income.
8917,I would work at a fast food restaurant if it meant I could pay the rent next month.
8918,I've reached my lowest point.
8919,I've tried selling all of my valuable personal belongings on Craigslist.
8920,I want so badly to go to college or learn a new trade.
8921,"I have no idea how I would get the money to do it anyway, though."
8922,"I don't qualify for any grants because of ""expected family contribution"" and still being considered a dependent due to age, even though I'm out on my own."
8923,I applied for unemployment insurance but I don't qualify for that either.
8924,"I've tried to get personal loans, etc, but I can't because I'm young, have no credit, and no one is willing to cosign for me."
8925,I feel like I'm completely screwed.
8926,I just want to learn a trade or get a degree and not feel worthless.
8927,But I'm trapped in a pit.
8928,I feel like I'm going to be stuck this way forever.
8929,It's nice to get that off my chest.
8930,Thanks if you took the time to read.
8931,"If you have any encouragement or advice, I would love to hear it."
8932,I need any cheering up I can get.
8933,"I take my medication, I work, and I try my hardest to make friends and be social...but it never seems to go anywhere."
8934,I am no longer on the meds that once saved my life.
8935,"And i really would like to not take drugs, i am worried about side effects and i am not very good at remembering to take medicine consistently, and I am a poor uni student and not sure if i can pay for it."
8936,I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for which I take medicine.
8937,"I see a therapist and take meds for my anxiety, but it's so hard."
8938,"25, M, General Anxiety Disorder (diagnosed), No medication."
8939,"My question is this: I've always been afraid to try medication, so much so that when I was actually holding the pills, it triggered a pretty good anxiety attack and I threw them down the sink."
8940,Is there a chance that taking medication can help me feel like I do in the mornings all of the time?
8941,"That gives me hope that, with work on anxiety through therapy (and probably meds soon), I will get back to that place of rational thought."
8942,I have refused to take medication but I'm thinking that might be the only choice I have left?
8943,I'm taking some medication for it.
8944,I was finally able to stay calm for a bit and I felt the medicine working in the back right of my skull.
8945,"I know there can be a transition period of getting used to a medication, but I experience severe agitation/irritability."
8946,It was kind of the agitation you get from ADHD meds such and adderall or vyvanse.
8947,"I'm interested if anyone who has discontinued their medication without the supervision of a doctor... or with, has had similar experiences?"
8948,"I used to tell myself I would never go on meds, but now I would take anything if it would just make this anxiety disorder go away."
8949,"The thought that the meds could make me that way scares the shit out of me and starts my negative thought cycle, but after working with a therapist I got better about that."
8950,Today I forgot to take my medication and got stuck running errands most of the day.
8951,September this year I got my exam results from last year and they weren't good; I wanted to go into veterinary medicine but failed chemistry and got very low grades in maths and biology.
8952,"Ever since I got on meds (Celexa and Abilify) I've had energy to do stuff, which is great."
8953,"I did an experiment the other night, and only took the Lamictal, instead of all my nightly meds."
8954,"Not that labels matter as long as the medication works but I'm curious.... well, it kind of does matter for me, because my insurance won't approve Saphris on the basis that I'm not bipolar, but yeah."
8955,"I didn't want to start a long term medication, it just feels so serious..."
8956,So after years of struggling with this problem I have finally decided to see the doctor about my symptoms and I'm hoping I can get some answers or medication.
8957,and what should I be wary (if there are any concerns) about medication if thats what the doc suggests?
8958,I'm sure a lot of you will recommend medication.
8959,And trying medication again really fucking scares me.
8960,Can you describe your experience with meds.
8961,"He's convinced it's something physiological, as am I to some extent, which is where medication should come in."
8962,The other psychiatrist barely listens to me and basically throws medicine at me.
8963,Hey everyone-I hope you are having a decent day.
8964,"I do have a question, but first a little bit about me."
8965,PLEASE READ THIS IN ITS ENTIRETY-I WANT TO TRY TO BE UNDERSTOOD.
8966,"Back in college (a few years ago), I noticed something that has always loomed inside my head but I never fully recognized it for what it was."
8967,"That thing being anxiety, and not the ""typical anxiety"" that keeps us motivated to get out of bed to be productive."
8968,The anxiety I have is slowly trying to kill me.
8969,"For instance:

1."
8970,"Social events, such as high school pep rallies or sports events, ect., make me nauseated."
8971,"In high school, I had to convince a friend who was on the council to keep me off the list for pep rally ""noon activities"" for the fear of puking on everyone."
8972,It is simply something I cannot do!
8973,2.
8974,Tests.
8975,"I know the material, no problem."
8976,"Come test day, if I am sitting in the classroom beforehand, listening to everyone discuss what they studied and how they studied, I again become nauseated, gain a headache, and feel like sobbing."
8977,3.
8978,Existential reasoning.
8979,I'm not sure what I think about existence but my mind can't focus on any one theory for long without contradicting it soon after.
8980,It gives me panic attacks occasionally.
8981,4.
8982,My chest throbs.
8983,every.
8984,single.
8985,fucking.
8986,day.
8987,Like taking a deep breath hurts.
8988,Or a brick is laying on top of my lungs.
8989,"Anyhow, back in college."
8990,"I went to CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services), was diagnosed with depression, but it delved from my diagnosis of anxiety."
8991,"(I find absolutely no justifiable meaning to life satisfying, and that scares me.)"
8992,"It is now, at 24, that I am looking into getting back on some medication."
8993,However.
8994,And here's the clincher.
8995,I LIKE THE WAY I THINK.
8996,"I overanalyze, yes."
8997,"I think about everything too deeply, yes."
8998,I enjoy that.
8999,My mind's power is the only resonating factor about my self.
9000,It's the only thing I like.
9001,My question: are there anti-anxiety medications that will help ease my 'symptoms' (?)
9002,and let my mind stay un-hazy?
9003,Any help would be appreciated.
9004,I know this is long post-I simply am a complex organism that enjoys thinking.
9005,Thank you.
9006,UPDATE: I was prescribed an ssri and a benzo combination.
9007,"Second full day, feels nice."
9008,"The ""bricks"" laying on my chest have lessened."
9009,Thank you everyone.
9010,"I told him that I had started medication recently for my anxiety (low-dose Prozac), and he became really argumentative about it."
9011,"I already knew that he wasn't a big believer in medication, but I wanted to let him know I had started on it just to keep him in the loop."
9012,He kept arguing against it and making me justify what was a very difficult decision for me initially (going on medication).
9013,"I was having a lot of difficulty cumming on my medication initially but now that I have been on it (escitalopram) for like three or four weeks, my ability to nut without huge effort is returning."
9014,"medication, I tried psychology but it didn't seem to help)
- NLP 
- Hypnosis

Would love to know anything that has worked for others!"
9015,"hello I a male and have had anxiety disorder for maybe 25 years, for the past 3 I have not on any meds except occasional diazepam."
9016,I know this is a huge factor in the level of my anxiety but I don't want to have to rely on medication.
9017,Well I went to the doctor today and talked to him about my depression and anxiety.
9018,"It went pretty well, and he told me to come back Friday with a parent (I'm a minor) and meanwhile to do some research about possible medications."
9019,"My anxiety is what I would call pretty severe, and has been all my life (maybe some of you will beg to differ, I hope I don't offend) as things like answering the phone, friends messaging me online, people knocking at the door, going to the store or any public place, walking places alone, etc."
9020,are nearly unbearable for me.
9021,"My anxiety acts up essentially whenever I am not alone, or with my 5 closest friends, but I also have what could be called panic attacks, when I shake and feel like all of my stupid actions have essentially led to my doom."
9022,"I also have quite a bit of social anxiety, and have a hard time talking when I meet new people."
9023,"My kneejerk reaction is to hope and pray for benzos, because I would give almost anything just to feel at peace."
9024,"However, I'm a minor (female, 15) so I don't know how the physician will feel about this."
9025,"I have a very high metabolism, and thus a high tolerance to almost all drugs that I have tried recreationally - including lorazepam, which had almost no effect on me (though I obviously can't tell a doctor about my drug abuse, especially with my mother next to me)."
9026,"I feel very intimidated by the  long lists of anti-anxiety drugs, etc."
9027,and I really don't know where to begin.
9028,"If anyone can help me at all, I would be very grateful."
9029,Thanks!
9030,He did a wide variety of tests (including stroke and other neurological tests) but the meds he gave me (propranolol 20mg) only work for a short time before the vertigo comes back.
9031,I got help and eventually was able to stop all medication.
9032,I fear that I might have to go on meds in order to rectify this.
9033,- None of my friends/family take anxiety meds so I can't bum off anyone.
9034,None of my migraine medication (which are on the low end of severity) help with klonopin withdrawal.
9035,"I'm 24, married, and a mother of a toddler and my constant anxiety attacks are getting worse."
9036,"I've always experienced seemingly random spurts of panic attacks in the past, but I've been able to get past it by just distracting myself with menial tasks such as work or chores or even surfing the internet."
9037,"Lately though, it's been getting worse."
9038,For a little background-- my family has been dealing with some really tough health issues over the past two years.
9039,"My grandfather has passed away due to cancer, my great-grandfather on my dad's side passed away, my great aunt and regular uncle also diagnosed with cancer, and my mother has been living with lupus for a while."
9040,I've always had a really hard time dealing with death and/or health issues and with significant priorities going on (such as being a mother) I can't really set aside hours out of my day to just break down and have panic attacks.
9041,"Obviously I can't control this however, and with my family constantly going in and out of treatment I am having a really hard time maintaining my composure while talking to/about them."
9042,"I don't feel like I should be saying ""please stop you're causing me to freak out"" because they've got more on their plates than I do, but I'm not really sure what to do."
9043,"I'm not on any medications because my insurance doesn't cover psychiatric and with my husband needing an adderall script every three months, there just isn't enough extra cash for it."
9044,It's gotten to the point where I have been ignoring calls from my mother because every time she calls she wants to tell me she's in the hospital again.
9045,The last time she called to ask if I would be her power of attorney (in her living will) in the event that something happens to her.
9046,"This was a huge smack on me because I don't have a great relationship with her, but I don't want her to die... My grandma and I keep in touch too, but every time I speak to her she's talking about my uncle or aunt and how well/bad they're doing with chemo or treatment and it's heartbreaking."
9047,"I don't know how she feels, but every single time I have that conversation I go into a full-blown anxiety attack afterwards."
9048,I feel obligated to console her but I don't know how because I can't even console myself.
9049,"I try to live a normal life and not let my attacks interfere with anything, and for the most part they don't."
9050,My daughter is cared for and the worst that happens is that I get too upset to be able to do chores for that day (I clean every day).
9051,"My husband is supportive and tells me to take it easy, but I don't want him to feel like I'm just being lazy."
9052,I just don't know what to do.
9053,I want everyone to magically get all better but I know that isn't realistic.
9054,These attacks make me feel so helpless and I hate it.
9055,I know I shouldn't feel like this but I really wanted to be prescribed anxiety meds or even beta blockers.
9056,"Being 18 years old I have numerous options and this is almost sickening to think of all the potential outcomes, Today I was researching going to university (The thought of university doesn't scare me as i'd be in a town full of strangers) when i discovered i'd have to go to my local college for a year to get an ATHE (Access to higher education qualification) I suddenly felt like I was trapped and a choking feeling completely took hold, my fear of never leaving my town or becoming something more hit me real hard and i had to take medication to calm me down...."
9057,"I don't take medication as I don't like the way it makes me feel (ironic, I know)."
9058,"I'm a twenty-two year old type 1 diabetic (since 5)

I was diagnosed only months into kindergarten with ADD and was prescribed ritalin after only a short doctor's visit, and have cycled through some twenty or thirty different medications, many of them stimulants, up until shortly after high school."
9059,Things would always be good for a week or two after starting a lot of them (others didn't do anything or made matters worse.
9060,But shortly things would be worse than before.
9061,"One particular doctor kept upping the dose and piling on more meds and I only got more depressed, anxious, and couldn't eat or focus, or even sleep."
9062,I would eat about a meals worth every couple of days and sleep for only about fifteen to thirty minutes at a time between an hour or so of time spent awake.
9063,"I hated myself for being so broken, I hated everyone else for not."
9064,I hated my parents for not understanding and I hated the doctor who just didn't seem to care.
9065,"I understand what went wrong now, It was anxiety."
9066,But knowing what I do now doesn't seem to help.
9067,"I'm afraid to go to any other doctors now, but I can't do it alone."
9068,"I'm angry and afraid most of the time, and think about dying a lot."
9069,But I'm too weak to kill myself so I just drink and smoke whenever I'm fortunate enough to find a job that I don't quit after only a few weeks.
9070,What's your experience with trigger-happy psychiatry?
9071,"So, I'm a week late on my period (something that NEVER happens for me, as I am almost annoying regular when it comes to riding the red wave) and I don't know what's going on!"
9072,"Like most ladies who are having sex and late on their period, I already took two pregnancy tests and they both came out negative, so I'm pretty sure there's no baby in my belly."
9073,"But, still, I don't know what's going on."
9074,I do have some pretty hefty issues with anxiety/depression.
9075,I somewhat recently (in September) switched medications from Zoloft (which I had been on for several years) to Lexapro.
9076,"My cycle last month was normal, but this month it's definitely out of whack if not coming at all."
9077,Could Lexapro be the culprit here?
9078,Has anyone had this experience with anti-depressants?
9079,"It actually feels like I have cramps right now, but there's no blood is in sight (and I usually have a heavy flow), so that's also strange."
9080,Any idea what could be going on?
9081,"I thought it might be out of whack due to stress (and I have been a little stressed lately), but not more than I have been in the past (and my cycle was still normal then)."
9082,SOS!
9083,"I would love during one of these episodes to actually just pass out, because then I could be sent to the hospital and have a doctor tell me what's wrong, give me medication, and all is well."
9084,I turned to medication when I actively engaged in therapy last year and was put on Clonazepam (regular dosage and as needed for attacks) and run through the gauntlet for depression meds until I ended up with Wellbutrin.
9085,I had been on my medication for nearly a year when I decided to cut the Clonazepam out at the turn of the new year this January.
9086,"I am looking for an unbiased, outside perspective regarding... well, the title of this post: do the benefits of the meds outweigh the detriments?"
9087,I'm wondering if any of you have made the switch and if Wellbutrin has helped better than other meds?
9088,"So, I have been off my medication (Xanex .5 mg 1x daily) for about a month now."
9089,"TL;DR haven't had meds refilled in 2+ months.. doc lowered my dosage and insisted I make it last a month, now I'm worried she sees me as an addict and I'm not."
9090,"Background: 26years, had depression,anxiety attacks and panick attacks for more or less 3 years, took medication for 1 year, didn't worked."
9091,"If haven't picked up on it already, I am terrified of medication."
9092,I'd rather not go on any medication but I'll do whatever if it works.
9093,How does getting medication work if you are seeing a psychologist?
9094,I had no anxiety while dating her and for once in my life no meds and felt great.
9095,"I was put on Prozac for a bit, then decided I wanted to stop it just because I felt I didn't want anymore meds in me than I already had (I take Adderall frequently - prescribed ofc)."
9096,I’m most afraid my meds aren’t effective.
9097,"However, I vowed to get off my medication in time for starting university and the fear of going full circle and relapsing towards the end of next month terrifies me."
9098,"I do know that if I did not regularly take medicine to slow my intestines, I would be about 30-40 pounds lighter than I am now because I would have extreme diarrhea EVERY morning."
9099,"(I gained 60 pounds when I started the meds, within 2 months, but have dropped back down about 30.)"
9100,"Now with these meds, I have extreme bowel movements every couple days where I literally empty my entire intestinal tract into the toilet."
9101,"I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and it affects my life a great deal."
9102,"I've been on five different medications for it, and I'm not sure if any really work."
9103,"I don't get out and socialize a lot, although I work in an area where i deal with customer on a minute to minute basis."
9104,"I'm very polite and cheerful, but when alone or stressed, worries stack up and emotion tends to scale very high."
9105,"I've tried dating a lot, but most people either stop talking to me, or feel I have too much anxiety."
9106,"When out on a date, I worry about a lot, especially if I've upset my date."
9107,I've been sent to a psych ward for this happening actually.
9108,Thoughts really get to me a lot.
9109,"It's hard to break a negative chain, though I know how to put on a mask and help people at work."
9110,"People usually notice something is up, but not enough to be critical."
9111,"My friend says I know how to fool doctors, as she thinks their diagnosis of who I am seems very off base."
9112,"Anxiety's really affecting my life, and I can't keep living like this."
9113,"I really need your advice, Reddit."
9114,"Well, I'm apparently immune / resistant to medicines like Xanax."
9115,I tried them all in combination with anti depressants and my psychiatrist took me off of them all finally.
9116,So now were trying this Gabapentin and I was wondering if anyone else has heard of this being used for anxiety disorders / have any kind of experience with this medication?
9117,this is a dilemma for me because i take birth control in the morning and i would like to take all my meds at once but i think lexapro in the am might not be worth it.
9118,I can't help but believe the anti-psych people who say this medicine is toxic and killing me.
9119,"I want to be sure that it is the medicine though before I stop, because it is actually helping my depression and anxiety in the daytime."
9120,Do I need to stop taking the medication?
9121,* I always need to have someone by my side when I take a new medication in case I go into some sort of anaphylactic shock.
9122,"For me, clenching teeth, extreme fatigue, loss of focus."
9123,I've been on this drug for the full 6 weeks and have only had those side effects.
9124,I'm talking to my doc tomorrow about it and hope to ween myself off of it soon.
9125,Any advice to help me slowly ween off of it?
9126,"Everyone is different, so I wanted to hear some other stories about this drug."
9127,"I'm sure it's done well for some people, and has been a nightmare for others like all of these medicines."
9128,Note: I'm trying it for anxiety.
9129,"My doc couldn't tell if it was ADHD causing the anxiety, or the other way around."
9130,"I've tried Vyvanse before the Prozac for a little trial period of a few month, and it was great, so I'm definitely going back to the ADHD meds."
9131,"I've seen psychiatrists and been in the psychiatric hospital twice because I was told it would make me more stable on my meds and therefore make them work better, but never really been in therapy."
9132,"I thought, maybe I can go to a therapist they won't push me to take meds and I can just figure out how to overcome this."
9133,"The first few visits were a lot of ""You should really see a psychiatrist and try medication."
9134,"Really really you just weren't trying hard enough before, you were just trying to be difficult and that's what made the medication not work."""
9135,"I was never taken to a doctor, never given medication."
9136,"I became pregnant last year at the age of 28, and had to quit my medication (xanax) cold turkey."
9137,"My mistake was not going back to my doc immediately, putting my kiddo on formula and getting back on anxiety meds."
9138,"Hi,
Recently discovered this subreddit, thought you could give me a bit of advice...

My Fiance has anxiety and she told me there is medicine for this i try encourage her to get it (any help is help)
we've recently just became parents and i feel i need to help her more now than ever 

What advice could you give on what to do and what to avoid"
9139,"I don't take medication any more, fyi"
9140,my medicine is also working wonders.
9141,"I'm curious if anyone has any reccomendations for a non-benzo, non-ssri medication for GAD and Panic Disorder."
9142,I'm a recovering alcoholic so I'm at high risk for abuse (no matter how much I convince myself I'm not).
9143,That's why I'm trying to steer clear of benzos.
9144,I was on paxil 37.5 CR for about 2 years.
9145,It worked...really well.
9146,I can't handle the sexual dysfunction though.
9147,It nearly destroyed my relationship.
9148,I'm in rough shape right now.
9149,I'm through my paxil withdrawals but my anxiety is back in full force.
9150,"In the past I've done CBT, counseling, I've tried exercising, eating healthy, but I'm finding it very difficult to get things under control without medication."
9151,I can (and will) go see my doctor but I want to get some information first.
9152,"I've only seen her once before and I know she is not totally knowledgeable when it comes to anxiety treatment (it's not her fault, she's not a specialist)."
9153,Are any of you currently taking or aware of medications that aren't prone to abuse and won't give me a wet noodle?
9154,Any recommendations/advice would be greatly appreciated.
9155,I have been to my doctor and he has prescribed me some anti-depressant medication which I feel like does nothing at all.
9156,"I have no prior history of mental illnesses, I don't use any medication, nor I smoke weed."
9157,I used to take meds for that (also for depression/bipolar 2).
9158,"She suggested Lexapro (which my psych also suggested 5 months ago, but I felt fine and chose to stay off meds)."
9159,"After being in a stressed out, bad place I started seeing a therapist, and tomorrow I'm seeing a psychiatrist to look into getting some form of meds."
9160,I'm worried that maybe I'm not actually having anxiety attacks and maybe I just have a low tolerance for stress or I'm subconsciously freaking out for attention or it isn't really bad enough to where I need meds.
9161,I'm not currently taking anxiety meds as they make me really drowsy.
9162,"26M, no meds, general anxiety and depression?"
9163,Do meds help you reconnect with the authentic you that's just covered with anxiety or do they simply cover the physical symptoms and make you feel less uncomfortable without changing your thought process?
9164,"Do meds help with any of the negative personality traits i've accumulated over the years due to constant anxiety, and can they help connect with the real you?"
9165,"(I'm not on meds and my mom will not let me, which is good because I'm getting stronger with my problems )"
9166,This is my first long term medication I've tried for my anxiety.
9167,"Also, can long term damage be done to myself by taking a medicine that is not compatible with me?"
9168,I can't tell if it's heat related or medication related?
9169,I came off abilify cold turkey because I lost my insurance and couldn't get my meds.
9170,Eventually I got back on my meds and for the most part everything went back to normal except this symptom.
9171,I can't afford to be on medication or see a doctor about it because my insurance sucks.
9172,"I have never tried medication, but I would be willing to, If I could convince someone that I needed it enough to take the time to care about me."
9173,I have recently been put on medicine and am seeing a counselor who is really helping me to gain perspective on things and has given great coping skills.
9174,"In addition to the multitude of anxiety disorders that I have (SA, GAD, and panic disorder), I have ADHD on top of it."
9175,"I am prescribed concerta and methylphenidate IR, 45 mg/day and 10 mg/day."
9176,I was off of my medication for a few weeks but recently went back on it and I've noticed that my baseline anxiety levels are raising.
9177,Have any of you had any experiences with ritalin increasing your anxiety?
9178,And did switching medication to something like adderall help?
9179,How do the anxiety levels of certain stimulant medications compare to each other?
9180,"In addition, I am on 5mg viibryd (just started yesterday, introducing it slowly and will be tapering up over the next few weeks)."
9181,"Also, I am unable to function in my current school and work settings w/o my medication so I don't see living stimulant-free as a viable option at this point in my life."
9182,"For now I'm going to talk with my therapist and continuously learn new techniques for dealing with my anxiety, so hopefully learning those techniques will be useful (as they have in the past)."
9183,Thank you everyone for replying!
9184,I've been on medication in the past but stopped after a year (Zoloft).
9185,So I am a 28 year old male that was diagnosed with severe anxiety and panic disorder when I was 23.
9186,When I first started battling it I did what I would assume most do.
9187,"Did not think anything was wrong, thought I had health problems, you know heart, lungs, so forth so on."
9188,I then after a stupid amount of medical bills with no insurance sought out a psychiatrist that  was pretty open with me about what I had going on.
9189,At first he prescribed me citalopram for treating the anxiety and also gave me .25 milligrams of xanax to take as needed when I had panic attacks.
9190,The xanax has always worked fine for when I start having bad attacks and helped me a lot.
9191,The citalopram on the other hand made me gain over 40 pounds in about 5 months and was not really doing much for me.
9192,Now I know just from doing my own research and talking with my doctor that its not always the first try with medications to have the right one.
9193,I ended up getting off citalopram after I let him know about the weight gain and such.
9194,I had the worst and I mean worst time getting off of it too.
9195,"Could not stand up, wanted to die, felt like everything was spinning."
9196,You know typical body with drawls.
9197,Which was weird because I did everything I was to do to get off of it.
9198,After I was off of it completely I was prescribed Busprone.
9199,For about 3 years of taking it I was doing really well.
9200,Not having attacks all that often.
9201,If I did I could take a xanax to keep myself from wanting to take myself to the hospital.
9202,That was until December of last year (2013) I was sitting at my computer just being the nerd I am playing video games and I got this awful death feeling chest pain right above my heart.
9203,Trying not to panic just in case it was something serious I took a xanax and took myself to the hospital.
9204,I had never had this kind of pain with my anxiety.
9205,Long story shot on that end it ended up being a rib that I have that goes out of place.
9206,But fuck you guys all know how it goes its never something that simple so for the next 6 months until about the end of May I was having the worst attacks and freak outs I had ever had.
9207,I put my girlfriend though a trying time because I was not myself.
9208,I know I wasn't.
9209,I remember having some of the worst thoughts I have ever had in my life.
9210,Between feeling depressed because I could not get it under control to feeling like a psychopath because of some of the thoughts I was having.
9211,It was just awful.
9212,So now its October.
9213,I am getting ready to get back into the cold Iowa winters we have and despite not wanting to admit it am a little worried that it could have just been an obvious mix of seasonal depression along with the anxiety and well the stubbornness of not wanting to talk with my doctor about some of the thoughts because well.
9214,I am not about being marked if anyone out there knows what I mean by that.
9215,He offered to put me and have me try out prozac and see if that helps me any not just for anything seasonal but in general for my anxiety.
9216,I hate the thought of being on another SSRI because of some of the weight gain and also because I had a terrible sexual side effects and being in a relationship where I am very happily sexually active I really want to not have to deal with all of that again.
9217,Because it did not go away.
9218,The thought of making the commitment to being on something like prozac has started crossing my mind again.
9219,For lots of reasons.
9220,A.
9221,Because I would like to get back to not having attacks every other few days.
9222,I mean I know 100% I am OK I am healthy I have it under control when it comes to thinking I am dying.
9223,I mean of course every now and then I get a bad one and have a freak out.
9224,But in the end I know I am OK and have great support from my girlfriend.
9225,But to be honest there are still some things I just can not do because of my anxiety.
9226,Not that I have not tried just motivation to do those things has been hard.
9227,I have  a few friends I have talked with about them being on medications such as prozac and zolof and such.
9228,But not to be rude to them but to them they just were told to take it so they pop the pills and don't ask questions.
9229,I guess what I am asking is what are some of your guys experiance with your medications.
9230,Did you have doubts about taking them?
9231,Did it scare you to feel like you would have to rely on a medication to stay alright with things?
9232,Do you think it actually helps you in the sense of being able to feel OK?
9233,I have a million questions I could try and ask but I already wrote you guys a short story which I am sure half of you wont completely read.
9234,So below will be the TL:DR version.
9235,Thanks ahead of time for any ones input and advice.
9236,Also thanks for the community.
9237,Shits real.
9238,Its hard.
9239,Such is life.
9240,Least we can do is try and stick together.
9241,"TL:DR 
I have severe panic attacks and they got out of hand again last winter, Its coming back I am considering being put on an SSRI."
9242,Had some issues when I took one once for  a while.
9243,Thinking its time to give it a chance.
9244,What are your opinions and how did being on one effect you and help you?
9245,What were some problems and positives.
9246,Much Love.
9247,"I give him some cheese and bread so that he can take his medicine; a hefty mix of antidepressant, two antianxiolytics, beta blockers and various dietary supplements to minimise the side effects."
9248,"Oh btw, in terms of depression/anxiety I feel great, and feel better since getting off the meds."
9249,"TL;DR: I may have gotten off my meds too quickly, should I consider getting back on and weening off more slowly."
9250,"I went to see my doctor yesterday to have my meds adjusted, etc."
9251,"I've never taken another persons medication before, and this is something that I would never do in a rational state of mind, but I was freaking out so bad that she was concerned for me and she thought it would help."
9252,"I quit smoking a couple months ago and now I feel like the only thing (besides meds, which I don't have) that will calm me down is a cigarette and some booze."
9253,The other hope is medication...but I don't know where that could lead.
9254,I'm heading to the doctor today to hopefully be prescribed some anti-anxiety meds.
9255,"So, I'm REALLY REALLY hoping that medication will help with my inability to concentrate."
9256,"In 10th grade, I took a medication (believe it started wth a ""Z"")and it helped, but didn't fix all of it."
9257,and we are currently on a month trial of being off medication to see how it goes.
9258,And I am not one who is a huge fan of taking medication so I would like to deal with this on my own.
9259,I am taking my medicine correctly and consistently but sometimes it just...doesn't work.
9260,And there is no way I could ever live without some sort of drug; there are times in the past when I forgot to take my medicine for multiple days in a row.
9261,"I can just get by with my medicine, but without it, I might as well be dead."
9262,Has anyone had something like what I have temporary and was successful in beating it without meds?
9263,"I'm also scared of suggesting for her to talk to someone or get meds (I don't actually know the severity of it, she's had 2 panic attacks that she's told me about, and was hospitalized once for it, all in the span of 3 months)."
9264,I've been having bad health anxiety for the last couple of months and finally ended up getting meds to help.
9265,I just feel empty and I'm thinking of just stopping the meds.
9266,I'm not currently on any medication and I'm wondering what other people's experiences of this is?
9267,"And the ways to fix it are difficult (therapy, finding right meds, diet, exercise, meditation, socialization)."
9268,This medication evens out my moods but it makes me depressed when before I was angry and my anxiety is worse than ever.
9269,I want to stop the medication but I'm afraid of what I'll be like without it as college starts back soon.
9270,Should I wait on this new doctor and keep on with the medication and hope it gets better or stop the medication?
9271,I'm on the wrong medication and none of the other life style changes I've made are helping me.
9272,"I was on risperidone and vyvannse going into my junior year when I started fearing a nuclear war and had near panic attacks every time I heard an airplane (I may have went off my meds before that, but I can't remember)."
9273,"I'm not on any medication or drugs at the moment, but smoked weed pretty much every day from mid-senior year to a couple of months ago."
9274,Any comments or info on my new meds would be good.
9275,"I am not on any medication right now, but I used to."
9276,I booked a doctors appointment because I know I need meds.
9277,"I will continue pushing to get better, continue my therapy and medication, and try to focus more of my energy on those who actually care about my wellbeing."
9278,"They offered beta-blockers and some anti-anxiety meds, I said no."
9279,The medicine does help a bit.
9280,What are your experiences for each medication.
9281,"The meds helped me quite a bit during the summer, but now...they just aren't enough."
9282,I get up too early because I just can't sleep or can't find an allergy medicine to drug me.
9283,I am getting help for what is going on and I have meds that I can take when I break down like this.
9284,"All I know is I finally stopped shaking, I am at work, my meds finally kicked in and now I am no longer so tensed up I can't move."
9285,"General facts about me: I am a female, 24 years old, I don't know what type of anxiety I have, my trigger is eating and thinking of vomiting, I am not on medication, and I do have amazing insurance and an extremely supportive family and husband."
9286,I am very hesitant to go to a doctor because I really don't want to get on medication for the rest of my life.
9287,She was put on major meds and returned to work (we were also co-workers) a completely different person.
9288,Yes I've talked to my doctor and was put on a different medication (can't remember) but it didn't work out well.
9289,"I'm not interested in medication, but I've wanted to start mediating with my roommate."
9290,"Is my ""normal"" feeling on tramadol a hint that I may need medication?"
9291,"I am going to the doctor next week to see if I should try some meds (again)
But I feel like a failure."
9292,"She's been on medication for them for years and doesn't have them very often, but I'm always worried that she's going to have one that will be her last."
9293,"EDIT: Sorry, I didn't know how to tag this post as medication related."
9294,I'm taking medicine for anxiety and depression but I guess this is an aspect of my personality (like high sensitivity).
9295,Not on any medication at the moment but I'm looking into it...
9296,"Now the only medication I started using for it was cannabis, that was around 16.. Wasn't until late 16/early 17 that I really started smoking regularly (on and off)."
9297,"When I was on Prozac it significantly decreased my libido, but that was before I was sexually active."
9298,Now I am... And I am going to ask for a new prescription for medication tomorrow.
9299,(I went off Prozac because it wasn't helping my anxiety anymore.)
9300,I've heard that Wellbutrin is good.
9301,Are there any other medications I should ask my psychiatrist about?
9302,Thanks a lot!
9303,"I'm already considered a person with anxiety (thus meds), but I made the mistake and read news and worldnews while on vacation last week and it ruined a part of it until you good folk brought me to my senses!"
9304,"I've tried the anxiety exercises, cognitive behavioural therapy, but only anxiety medicine (clonazepam) calms me enough to function."
9305,It's really frustrating to have to depend on a medication just to feel sane.
9306,Any meds/tips that have helped you guys?
9307,"i've been off and on antidepressants for years now, but i've never once been prescribed with anti-anxiety medications."
9308,"i'm going to talk with my doc about this soon, just wanted ot see if this happens often, or if i'm not really looking at the depression/anxiety spectrum correctly..."
9309,"Three years ago, I made the decision to get off my meds and life is so much better."
9310,"I have a history of anxiety issues that I used to take medication for, but I've been doing better with it lately, and i'm not sure if this is my anxiety kicking in again or what, but does anyone have any advice for me?"
9311,Recently these situations have been lasting all day an I'm looking for a way to get though this without prescription meds if possible.
9312,She doesn't take anxiety medication as she dislikes the side effects.
9313,I have never taken any medication or anything for this before.
9314,"No medication (on hand), I can't be taking these incomplete shifts every time this happens, the call outs need to stop, and no one understands."
9315,"I've had anxiety since I was a little kid, and I've gotten treatment for it since I was 17 years old (28 now)."
9316,"I've been on so many different types of medicines (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.)"
9317,that I've lost track.
9318,I'm currently on Fluvoxamine 100mg once daily.
9319,It seems to be moderate in helping my symptoms.
9320,"I currently take Lorazepam and Clonozopam as needed, which seems to be daily lately."
9321,"Does anyone have any suggestions for a ""better"" anxiety medicine?"
9322,I'm open to anything.
9323,"Also, does anyone else get anxiety from doing simply daily tasks, like sorting alphabetically (for work) or crunching numbers?"
9324,Thanks for your help!
9325,"I was thinking of going to a doctor for  medication but I heard that anxiety/depression medication is highly addictive, and basically once you go that route there's no getting off it."
9326,"For those of you taking anxiety medication, do you feel 'owned' by it, and what does it feel like?"
9327,I'm also too scared to start taking any medication or see someone about it.
9328,I've been off the medication for about 5years now.
9329,I want to find some way to mange this on my own without medication.
9330,Around 5 or 6 months ago my therapist sent me to a psychiatrist who ended up putting me on the medication train.
9331,"On one hand the medication is making everyday life easier and has brought down my anxiety levels a significant amount, on the other hand I don't feel like the person I was and emotionally numb."
9332,So this is my story.
9333,I'm sorry its not well thought out and organized.
9334,I'm 23 now and my anxiety is just uncontrollable.
9335,"It's been bad for years, I ended up dropping out of highschool because of it my sophmore year."
9336,I attempted suicide right before i turned 18 and was institutionalized which didnt help being locked up with 20 strangers and being roomed with someone that always wanted to talk.
9337,"My parents are now seperated and the only person that was helpful in any way, my mom, kinda pushed me out with some strange man that she suddenly decided she needed to take care of."
9338,My step dad just doesn't understand it and is not supportive in any way and Im forced to live with him.
9339,"I know I need help, but because of my disorder I cant seem to get myself the help I desperately need."
9340,"I've been on medications that don't ever seem to help, Ive been told that exercise would help so I lost 40 pounds and still no progress... Im now learning to play the guitar because i was told that a new constructive hobby might help."
9341,"Thats not working cause i now have fears of playing it in front of people, I have progressed to letting my brother listen to me play it now but he is the ONLY person I see basically."
9342,"I cant lets say ""operate"" in public at all anymore because of my panic attacks and I have extreme trouble at family gatherings."
9343,I havnt said a word to a stranger in like 5 months.
9344,And now im begginning to lose hope for any sort of normal life.
9345,I have no friends and no one to talk to.
9346,And just overall starting to give up on life.
9347,I just dont know what to do anymore.
9348,Edit: I should mention Im really tall which brings in extra attention.
9349,"Also my anxiety kicks in talking on the phone for some reason, im incapable of making the appointment for doctors myself."
9350,"Hi I've got a question about medication for anxiety..
."
9351,Im an 18 year old male and over the past few years I've been struggling a bit with depression and anxiety problems.
9352,For about a year up until this summer my problems stopped me leaving my house and any little thing that would stress me meant I'd nearly have a panic attack.
9353,But like I said I've been able to deal with a lot of that myself.
9354,"The main thing I can't shake is the social part, mostly it affects me in school with reading out loud, asking permission to go the bathroom or walking through the class etc.."
9355,"But I really struggle with social events, like going to parties, bars, concerts and I wouldn't dream of going anywhere like a club with everyone I know.. Was wondering if people have tried medication to help with dealing with social interaction and going to places with a lot of people and how these medicines helped or didn't help."
9356,"Any replies would be a great help, thanks"
9357,"Anyways, I've been rather reluctant to get on medication as the side effects are rather disconcerting."
9358,I made a therapy appointment after I was prescribed anxiety medication a few weeks ago.
9359,"Since taking medication, I feel 1000 times better and don't feel like any of the things that bothered me so much before are really affecting me as much now."
9360,I'm thinking about getting medications for my ADD.
9361,I'm wondering if anyone has noticed any differences in their anxiety due to ADD medications.
9362,"I may not even need the medication, but I'd like to know if changes occur."
9363,"I don't know if it matters, but my anxiety is of the social variety and I don't take any medications presently."
9364,Hello!
9365,I am a 16 year-old guy who struggles with panic attacks.
9366,"I have had them after some family trauma when I was younger, and I'm looking for instant methods to calm down during an episode."
9367,"I am ironically very happy and outgoing in public, but I am very nervous when I'm alone."
9368,"I tend to emotionally burden myself with an unreasonable number of responsibilities and relationships, and I have intense emotional breakdowns when I fail to uphold one."
9369,One happened during the last days of school when I just felt like a huge failure to everyone.
9370,"I cried down the halls, in the car, then in my closet for three hours and passed out."
9371,My folks at home were more embarrassed and angry than helpful.
9372,"I felt like I was dying, and I'm scared I might experience worse in the future."
9373,Is there some trick I could try or lifestyle change to help calm down?
9374,"Getting a hold of medications is impossible for me for a while, and I have found that repeating relaxing thoughts during panic attacks only work for so long."
9375,I appreciate your time for helping me out.
9376,I've seen too many friends of mine zombified by overmedication.
9377,I made the mistake of reading the horror stories and feel like a more balanced perspective might encourage me to start taking my medication like a good boy.
9378,My last option I can think of is medication.
9379,I will also be put back on all medication I was previously on and most likely referred for therapy.
9380,I've yet to become medicated for my social anxiety for various reasons and I'm wondering how the medication makes you feel in social situations.
9381,"I want to be able to talk to people and feel normal...

 Also if anyone has any recommendations for medications that aren't prescriptions such as passion flower or any others please let me know you experiences with them."
9382,I know this story is long... but to anyone who took the time to hear me out... thanks... and if you can answer the question... will medicine really help?
9383,I'm really depressed thinking that the meds won't do anything and I'll be stuck like this forever.
9384,I saw my psychiatrist the other day and he is changing my meds... im currently on equetro (among other things)  but he told me he wants me off of it and switch to lamictal.
9385,I have been on so many meds im just desperate for something to work!!
9386,"Hi everyone, 

After trying everything that is not medication for my anxiety, I have turned to medication out of desperation."
9387,"), and I'm waiting to have some tests done before I have any medication prescribed."
9388,What meds have worked for you guys?
9389,Taking some homeopathic anxiety medicine.
9390,hi i have GAD and chronic depression.
9391,i just want to know how you guys deal with PANIC ATTACKS?
9392,while you're HAVING a panic attack what do you usually do to try to calm yourself down?
9393,NOTE:  im not talking about therapy or medicines.
9394,"Usually I've been in meaningless relationships or on my own and able to take the time to recover- just for myself, and slowly I always would, with a mix of medication, exercise and exposure."
9395,"Background, 40 yr old f with 5 sons, rocky marriage, my husband has been on antidepressants for years."
9396,"He has insecurity, control, abuse issues."
9397,"In April of 2011, a half ass doctor prescribed him Chantix to quit smoking, not ever seeing my husband before and knowing nothing of his depression and medications."
9398,"Fast forward 4 horrible months of him raging at everything and anything, he tried to commit suicide."
9399,"I almost divorced him but realized we have 5 children together and yea well, for better for worse, sicker poorer, and he was definitely sick."
9400,"We have been going to marriage counselor for a year now, been a rocky road, ups and downs but I feel we are getting there."
9401,Problem is all of a sudden I am having anxiety issues.
9402,"Started with standing on the checkout line at the store, person in front of me was having a problem with their credit card and the line began building behind me."
9403,All of a sudden I began to shake uncontrollably for no reason.
9404,"By the time i had to pay for my things, my hands could barely function, my legs felt like they could'nt even walk from being so shaky."
9405,"It was visibley noticeable handing the money to the clerk, I was mortified."
9406,"That was about a month ago, it happened maybe once or twice after that."
9407,"But, in the last week it has happened every single time I try going into a store, to the point where I actually leave the stuff I was going to buy in the aisle and just shakily walk out."
9408,Went to our marriage therapist today and told him and he wants me to see the physcologist and go on anxiety meds which I was always against but Im now considering.
9409,"I'm scared to go to stores, help!"
9410,ps.
9411,sorry for length and spelling
9412,Is there anything that has actually helped you calm down other than meds?
9413,Anyone have any advice or felt like this on meds?
9414,Only in the past two years have I tried to seek help and was prescribed medication for anxiety and panic attacks.
9415,"I apologize for my awful, terrible humour in advance."
9416,"Even when I write something serious I tend to put odd jokes in it, probably because I'm afraid that it won't be good enough without any sort of sick twist."
9417,"That being said, I'm not going to pretend that I'm trying especially hard to keep this as solemn as a child's funeral; I think I've become cynical enough that I can pretty much laugh at anything, including myself."
9418,"So, without further ado, read my god damned story:  

-----  

18 years of anxiety, first time calling."
9419,"For a long time, ever since elementary school, in fact, I've had a pretty odd anxiety side-effect."
9420,"Each day, I seem to stay up later and later, until I become nocturnal, and then diurnal again, and then nocturnal again."
9421,"Usually it takes a few weeks to switch either way (although sometimes I can rush nocturnal -&gt; diurnal by staying up late), but in times of stress it increases to about once per week."
9422,"It, perhaps more than my anxiety itself, contributed to me dropping out of school 2-3 years ago, cutting off any social ties I had, and essentially living out my life on the internet, while my parents reluctantly pay and put ridiculous amounts of effort into keeping me as a pet."
9423,"Now, recently, I thought I had it under control."
9424,"I could get up in (roughly) the morning, wash, get dressed, and go outside before it was time to go to bed again, and when it was time for me to sleep, I generally could."
9425,"I even had a membership at the gym, which I would walk to every other day, and I was thinking about getting a job."
9426,"I mean, don't get me wrong, I wasn't doing something as horribly misguided as pretending that everything would be all right - by this time I had had experience with things seeming like they were improving, and, well, if the same thing happens twice, it must mean the first one didn't take."
9427,"Then again, maybe it was that I felt like I was old enough that I might've finally ""grown out of it"", or maybe it was that I was interacting with *real people* for the first time in months, but I felt like this time it was different."
9428,"Of course, since I'm posting this now, obviously I've had no such luck."
9429,"It is currently about 5:15 AM, and I got up at roughly 7 PM yesterday."
9430,"My beard has passed the itchy stage, and my hair is greasy enough to cook french fries."
9431,What's left of my hope is falling out faster than my skin flakes.
9432,Why bother getting up when I can just lie down pretending to be asleep for a few hours?
9433,Why bother washing myself daily when I can't even get myself to go outside?
9434,How can I get myself to go outside when I can't even keep myself clean and groomed?
9435,"Sometimes I really wish I could just go to bed and just keep sleeping forever, which, unfortunately, functions as a rather grim euphemism for what could very well be a possible future for me."
9436,"God, that sounds horrible, and I apologize; I'd never do something like that... but what *should* I do?"
9437,"-----

Other info that didn't really fit anywhere but the internet may be curious about:  
* M, turning 19 this month, living at parents' house in Canada."
9438,"As advised by my psychiatrist, my computer (and therefore my daily life) is in living room so I interact more with my parents."
9439,* I'll have to be switched over to the adult psychiatric health whatchacallit soon after I turn 19.
9440,"At that point, they can refuse to help me if they feel like I'm not making enough of an effort - a byproduct of Canada's infamous public healthcare system."
9441,"I'd be lying if I said that I thought that sort of system could work with me, so I suppose it's been a bit of a shadow over me."
9442,"I've known it was coming for quite a while, though."
9443,"* I've been to lots of therapy, psychiatric health programs, and other bullshit like that."
9444,"After a few months of patronizing, they generally let me go and tell me I'm all better."
9445,"* I'm not on any medications, although I've tried a few."
9446,"* Continuing to follow the seventh bullet thing on the sidebar, here are a few more severe trigger examples (things that would send me straight into an attack) for my particular case of generic, normal, generalized anxiety: Being told I need to do something (go to school, do a chore, go outside, etc), thinking in detail about my future/employment, feeling like I need to get up by a certain time, feeling like I need to be asleep by a certain time."
9447,"Basically, anything that feels ""important""."
9448,"* I also apologize for my lack of subtlety and discretion, but I think I'd have had trouble putting this out there in any other way."
9449,"I'm imagining some guy like me trying to read this and going, ""Fuck this weirdo; this guy's got issues that don't even have a subreddit."""
9450,"**So, let's try this baby out."
9451,"** If anyone has advice for how to better get in control of my sleep, how to persuade myself to take care of myself, and, ultimately, how to get my life back on track, I would love to hear it, and please don't be afraid to be tough on me if you think it could help."
9452,Thanks for the time and patience it undoubtedly took you to read this mess.
9453,"~~Unfortunately, I don't have any refunds, but I suppose that's something we all have to live with here on Reddit.~~"
9454,It took me 4 years to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder and even with medication it's something I ignore.
9455,I'm currently in a partial hospitalization program for my anxiety and have been considering/discussing the possibility of taking medication with my counselors and psychiatrist.
9456,"I've always been kind of iffy' with regards to the prospect of medication, but my anxiety is affecting my entire life and I've come around to the idea of it as of late."
9457,"I've been researching medications prescribed for anxiety, and I was considering discussing BuSpar with my psychiatrist."
9458,Was wondering if anyone's had any experience with this medication?
9459,Today I filled my prescription and finally took medication.
9460,Everyone keeps telling me to get meds for it but I really don't want to because of the side effects and the possible withdrawal process.
9461,I'm on medication for a few days and already feeling much better.
9462,He quit taking all meds about a month ago.
9463,He is open to taking meds again.
9464,"I'm on medication and will be going to therapy again soon, but haven't gone in almost ten years."
9465,"About a year ago I was prescribed to talk Citalopram to help with it, however reading about it online really scared me away from it..but now it's just gotten really affecting in my life and I feel like I need meds of some kind..
   My main anxiety problems come from social situations..pretty much if anybody that's not my 2 best friends talk to me I feel really terrified and inferior to the person that's talking to me, this makes it really hard to do any group work in school or get much social activity, as I'm usually solitary."
9466,"I suffer from alot of energy issues, as I can go from feeling like I had a sugar high to like I just ran a marathon and need to sleep within an hour..my fear is that anxiety meds will heighten this more.."
9467,I'm sorry if this is really dumb..but I need some recommendations as to which anxiety meds I should request?
9468,I'm starting to get over worried that I could now fail a drug test (and lose a job offer) for a legally prescribed medication.
9469,I'm not on meds (yet) because my insurance is all messed up and I haven't had much luck in the past with meds.
9470,I was vomitting so much I couldn't keep down meds - was hysterical.
9471,"Obviously every medication affects people differently, so I guess my title is more of a rhetorical question."
9472,I'm frustrated at the prospect of now trying a *6th* medication :/.
9473,I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced a lack of effectiveness after a few months on meds?
9474,"I'm going to talk to my doctor about either increasing my dosage, or possibly about whether the medication has done all it can and it's time for CBT, but I like to have a little bit of an idea what I'm talking about before I go in for the appointment."
9475,I've been on an anti-anxiety medication that normally works well but today I'm about to burst.
9476,I used to get very shaky and physically dishevled but my meds are keeping me together physically but I feel like I'm melting on the inside.
9477,"I saw the signs that I was headed for a bad place, but I've been trying to mask the symptoms with medication and declining therapy."
9478,"However, if I eat a big meal and don't take stomach meds....."
9479,"Anyway, I went on a short vacation last week and in my rush to pack I forgot my medication."
9480,"I got home on Tuesday and took my medication as soon as possible but it didn't seem to be working at all (I know for most people the drug takes a week or two to work, but for me it has **always worked within 2-3 hours**)."
9481,I have been on many different meds and have seen a therapist.
9482,I recognize that that's self-medication of sorts and I don't want to have to get drunk just to try to make friends.
9483,his recommendation was to try an anxiety medication and see how things go for the next couple of weeks.
9484,I've had pretty severe anxiety/depression since high school but my parents have been completely against medication.
9485,"Towards the end of my high school career I dropped out of sports, exacerbating my moods, and put on ~50lbs (I'm 5'2 female)."
9486,I became very unhappy with my weight and before graduating high school tried joining a gym for a brief stint before going away to University.
9487,"Unlike most people who go away to college, I lost 25lbs the first two months I was there."
9488,"I wouldn't doubt that my drug use had at least something to do with it, as well as the kidney infection I had contracted while there."
9489,But my anxiety and depression had worsened while away at school and I failed out and I came home for spring semester.
9490,"I kept losing weight without even trying, my family and everyone telling me I'm ""wasting away""."
9491,"I eat as much as I can and whenever I'm hungry- a lot of junk food too, but I still don't gain weight."
9492,"Now underweight, I went to my doctor and was able to finally receive help without my parents knowing."
9493,"She gave me a prescription of xanax, which I knew worked for me, but she also gave me Celexa which I've read can cause major weight gain (60+ lbs?!?!)."
9494,"I weigh between 102-110lbs, nothing more."
9495,"I go to bed feeling extremely anxious, which I got a trazodone prescription to help me sleep (which really does help!)."
9496,Most mornings I wake up feeling extremely nauseous and have no appetite until late afternoon.
9497,"I don't care that I'm underweight, I'm happy with how I look, but my anxiety still effects my daily life greatly."
9498,I want to start taking the Celexa but am scared that it will switch my metabolism back and make me fat again.
9499,I know that I'm not fat and if I told my doctor this she'd tell me I'm anorexic.
9500,"If I gained weight it would make me more anxious and depressed, although I know it's in her agenda to get me to gain weight."
9501,Any suggestions or medications that have worked for you?
9502,"I smoke weed heavily because it helps with both the nausea and anxiety, unfortunately where I live we have no medical marijuana laws in place."
9503,-sorry for the long post
9504,"Almost overnight it became overwhelming, I've bought some over the counter medication (which gives me relief for a few hours) but I still find myself crying everyday and it's nearly impossible to eat."
9505,"Just looking for hope I guess, does anyone ever overcome it without medication?"
9506,"My background: recently started seeing a counselor (doesn't specialize in anxiety issues), no meds yet, diagnosed anxiety since I was very young, mostly homebound (leave for PT job, but don't go elsewhere unless it's with my SO), trying to realize feeling this way is OK for now and that I won't always feel like this... it took me an hour to write/send this..."
9507,Has anyone else experienced this when they've switched meds?
9508,"I have ADHD and usually have more anxiety issues when I'm on meds, which can also cause jaw clenching so it could be more related to that I guess, I'm not on them right now but want to know for future."
9509,"So in short, what made her vomit blood and bleed internally was an ulcer in her stomach (now almost treated, it's fine) that was provoked by a strong medication that an inexperienced doctor gave her."
9510,I'm going to try medication.
9511,"By the time she got there, I was starting to feel my meds take effect and I probably looked a little loopy."
9512,"That is, unless my body feels a drunkish-lethargy, I will convince myself that the medication is merely a placebo."
9513,"However, just as someone with anxiety problems might be advised to take suitable medicine, I dont quite understand why I should not be advised to continue with my own medication since it has been only positive so far."
9514,Has anyone been on a medication and stopped with positive results?
9515,My anxiety medication helped for a while but the anxiety is creeping back in.
9516,Anxiety medication isn't helping as much as it used to.
9517,I'm wondering what people that have taken the medicine have had better luck with twice a day of a larger dosage or a smaller dosage three times a day?
9518,On and off meds and having panic attacks hourly.
9519,"I started feeling like there had to be something I could do to help myself with my anxiety, so I asked my therapist if I could try some kind of medication (at 13 years old)."
9520,"I was okay for a while, then I went off my meds after a year thinking I ""won"" anxiety, and I didn't, because at 16 I had to go back on both meds."
9521,I switched doctors and went back on my meds and stayed on them until I started college.
9522,So I went off my meds after two years and then wound up in the hospital because I passed out at my college.
9523,"I've tried meds, therapy, acupuncture, yoga, meditation, supplements, etc."
9524,"I have a good team of doctors who are willing and able to help me, I just feel really anxious all the time and I know it's going to take a few weeks for the doctors to sort out what meds I can be on with the Pain Management guy doing some nerve blocks and opiod prescriptions (as far as SSRI/SSNI's go but jesus I am feeling constantly nervous."
9525,"I know meds aren't the answer to everything, but I'm just really anxious all the time and it's semi crippling."
9526,"I didn't like the way medication made me feel, and I've been generally alright off of it."
9527,Basically for as long as I can remember I've had anxiety.
9528,However I never realized it until 3 years ago when I started to get derealization/depersonalization.
9529,"I kept it a secret at first but eventually I had to tell my mom about how I ""felt like I was in a dream""."
9530,She just thought it was the Claritin medicine that I was taking and would not take me to the doctor.
9531,I stopped taking that medicine and after a few months I believed that I had conquered it.
9532,However it still comes back from time to time when the thought of it enters my mind and keeps on repeating.
9533,Sometimes I feel like I still have derealization  and that I've just been ignoring it for the past two years because I think I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life and not actually experiencing it but idk if that's just me being worried.
9534,About 7months ago I started smoking pot about once every other week and for the first time in my life my anxiety became a little better.
9535,But then I slowly started smoking more and more until I was doing it everyday and It started to get back to how it was and I was becoming sad/depressed.
9536,Then 2 months ago my parents caught me smoking and I haven't done it since and my anxiety seems to be getting worse.
9537,I play football and I get reallllyyy nervous and worried anD basically think about it 24/7.
9538,A few weeks ago i had a really bad panic attack at Football practice where I couldn't breathe and once again my mom blamed it on medication.
9539,I was taking medicine for the infection I had in my knee.
9540,So basically my mom refuses to acknowledge my anxiety and I have no way of making it better but it feels really good to let this out because I've never told anyone any of this.
9541,Also do you have any examples of otc medicines or supplements that I could personally buy without my parents.
9542,I've heard st johns wort works pretty good.
9543,Can I buy that even though I'm under 18?
9544,I'm 16 btw.
9545,I've tried meditation but I'm so busy in life i Can barely find time for it
9546,She gave me a prescription for a low dosage of meds and told me to wait a month for them to kick in.
9547,AND that if I reacted positively to the medication then I could start seeing about a counselor.
9548,Here's hoping this medication works out so I can take the next step.
9549,"I'm in no way telling you to drop your prescriptions, and I'm sure results vary, but I am wondering if anyone else has had success with natural medicine?"
9550,"I've been avoiding medication, like SSRI's?"
9551,Is there anyone that takes anti anxiety medication that works?
9552,"I do have astma, and I am rather lazy on the medication thingy (never had issues unless I want to run or do other demanding activities for extended periods)."
9553,"I'm finding that negative thinking is still tripping me up when demands are exceptionally high, or my resources (sleep, food, medication) are low."
9554,"I do not take medication after my bad experience with Adderal, so that is not an option right now."
9555,"Hello, I've suffered from anxiety attacks/panic attacks for 9 months now."
9556,"As of now, I'm currently sitting on my couch checking my pulse and blood pressure--I do this daily."
9557,"This ritual ruins my life: takes time away from activities I want to do, time with my wife, and just leaves me drained all day."
9558,I usually get a really bad attack once a day--they last roughly fifteen minutes--then the shakiness and fear of another one lasts throughout the remainder of the day.
9559,"Whenever I have these episodes, it's because I'm afraid of my heart stopping/having a heart attack."
9560,It all started 9 months ago when I was drinking energy drinks to stay awake at work.
9561,"One day I ingested 4 in a span of 7 hours--I didn't mind the taste of them, to be fair--and that's when the heart palpitations started."
9562,"From the rapid heart rate, symptoms eventually snowballed into the typical ""impending doom"" feeling, fear of death, constant pacing around the house, and overall sense that I AM GOING TO DIE!"
9563,THIS IS IT.
9564,"Since that night, the night I had my first attack, it's continued and has yet to let up."
9565,"I have tried many things that have helped me in the course of nine months: breathing exercises, drinking ice-cold water in the midst of an attack, changing my diet (I haven't picked up an energy drink since they caused the attack nine months ago), watching my caffeine intake, and just learning to relax a little more--learning to slow down and not rush."
9566,"However, they still hit me...and I still feel that impending ""This is it...my heart is about to stop feeling."""
9567,I'm currently taking Klonopin 1.5mgs daily on top of 10mgs of Paxil.
9568,My current medications have really helped me.
9569,I have stopped smoking--I am now using a vaping device.
9570,"I have a cup of coffee in the morning then finish the day with nothing but water--no more sodas--well, maybe one every couple of days."
9571,I've changed my diet and have become really body conscious.
9572,"Sadly I do not have the time to exercise as much as I would like--work hours, errands, and whatnot constrict me from doing so."
9573,Does anyone out there have anymore tips for me?
9574,Please.
9575,My blood pressure is usually around the 125/85 range with my pulse around 80 beats per minute.
9576,That makes me feel good--I rarely experience any episodes with my heart rate exceeding 100 beats per minute.
9577,I digress: any tips?
9578,Any words of reassurance?
9579,I just feel alone with this.
9580,"My wife is the only supportive figure in my life to listen to me, and I feel as though I make life hell for her when I go through these episodes."
9581,These attacks just keep me from living--keep me from enjoying my life...and I need help.
9582,I've been suffering from OCD and GAD for over 20 years now.
9583,No one in my family has helped and doesn't seem to understand these are real illnesses.
9584,It makes it hard because I literally throw up every morning from all of the anxiety and they just ignore it.
9585,I have been doing so since the 1st grade and I am 25 now.
9586,I finally have my own insurance and was able to get some medication but the side effects are killing me.
9587,I used to never have panic attacks when I left the house but now I am and I feel so up and down not to mention no appetite and I don't feel like myself much anymore.
9588,Some days they help and other days I'm worse than before...any advice on how to cope with these types of issues?
9589,Should I keep trying with these medications or is there something better I can try like some success stories...I know I'm not alone but just the last few days have been really rough
9590,"I was wondering if anyone knows if I describe my symptoms to the doctor, if they would offer me medication for my anxiety, or will they just try more therapy?"
9591,"* Related to my bulimia, if I get very anxious I can't eat, and if I do, I'll binge and purge straight after :(

Thank you for any feedback, this worries me so much and I'm scared for myself after suffering for years..
What should I say to get medication?"
9592,"I don't like taking medication because I'm a firm believer that it actually doesn't help, it just helps me sleep sometimes."
9593,"To be clear, I am trying actively to keep it under control via meds, CBT and determination, and he knows this."
9594,"I'm already taking anxiety/depression medication, which I'm thinking about switching because it clearly doesn't work."
9595,"This doctor said I absolutely do need medication, but that he would not prescribe anything until/unless I had a doctor on the Western side."
9596,"Anyway, I never got out of the house to find another doctor when I went back West, and even though I need the medication, I still do not have it."
9597,"Diagnosed with a panic attack, got medication and a follow-up with a dr. Dr. Said I had esophageal spasms and was causing a health based anxiety."
9598,"Month later, symptons lessened (was having pressure on chest/ sternum, occasional warm feeling there as well) and told to stay on the medication, but down to once a day/ as needed."
9599,"I just upped my dose of meds, despite a long standing refusal to take the chemical way out."
9600,"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2yl0vn/going_to_be_out_of_meds_soon_sense_of_impending/) yesterday, about me possibly having to be off medication for a while."
9601,"Selfishly, I really don't want to really on pills to save me, I have been relying on Larazopam when things get really bad but I won't to try and face this without and medicinal help, how do you cope and do any of you try without medication?"
9602,"TL;DR - Seasonal Affective disorder, can make me suicidal."
9603,"Sad lamp, Vitamin D, medications not working."
9604,Help.
9605,"I have lived in Australia most of my life, in very sunny weather including the winter."
9606,"I moved to New York in 2013, and felt great... until one day in November 2013, overnight, I began hating myself."
9607,I also began to panic.
9608,About everything and anything.
9609,This got worse throughout January 2014 - March 2014.
9610,I went back to Australia for a few months from June - August 2014.
9611,"Doctor placed me on 25mg Valdoxan, and I began to feel really good again, gradually."
9612,Back to New York in August 2014.
9613,"I feel incredible, really."
9614,"November 2014, AGAIN, overnight, I am overwhelmed by anxiety and self-hatred."
9615,"I have never truly been suicidal (meaning, I would actually go through with it) but holy shit, this made me come **close**."
9616,Went back to Australia for 1 month (Jan 15) and officially received the diagnosis of Seasonal Affective Disorder.
9617,"I have tried a SAD lamp, 20,000 IU of Vitamin D a day, 5-HTP, Antidepressant (Valdoxan)."
9618,"Nothing, not a single thing worked."
9619,It has had a horrendous effect on myself and others.
9620,"I came close to giving up my university, career, routinely picked fights with my amazing girlfriend, gave up on friends."
9621,Shit sucks.
9622,I came on here to see if anyone suffers it also.
9623,"I understand it is quite common, however, the effects I am feeling are fucking *insane*."
9624,"If I don't find a solution, I am may have to move back to Australia (and break my poor girlfriend's heart, and miss some great career opportunities)."
9625,"Any advice, alternative treatments or suggestions are welcome."
9626,Thankyou.
9627,"**EDIT:** Sun's back out now, feeling good, planning for future."
9628,"Therapy, medication, or both?"
9629,"If medication, anything I should steer clear of?"
9630,"I just took my first two doses of my medicine...

My Mother in law is with me, she is going to remind me every day to take my medicine and since this is my first time taking this medicine, she is being so sweet and sitting with me..."
9631,"Before people mention it, I have seen a psychologist, but since he vehemently told me to get on anti-depressants after my third session (2 of which with other doctors) I was put off; I went to a psychologist to avoid the psychiatrists, due to the concern they would prescribe me medication without addressing the actual issues in my life."
9632,"Some background, I am a 28 year old male who has dealt with severe anxiety since about the age of 22."
9633,My anxiety got to a point where I could not even look my own family members in the eye and I would break out in sweats over minor events (like almost tripping while walking).
9634,"I was still able to do well in college, graduate school, and have established a decent career."
9635,"Anxiety has held me back a lot over the past few years, mainly with friendships and relationships."
9636,"I started with Zoloft, taking one per day, and am now on 150 mg per day."
9637,"I've been on Wellbutrin for almost 3 weeks, and I'm currently on 100 mg per day."
9638,I still feel panic in the mornings when I have to leave home and head to the subway.
9639,"The subways are a horrible experience, and the humidity makes my anxiety go into overdrive."
9640,The medication has also given me bowel problems and sleep problems.
9641,I hope these go away over time.
9642,"I have been more outgoing, social, talkative, and even flirtatious since going on the medications."
9643,I was able to present in front of a dozen people in a crowded room a few days ago and had absolutely no problems.
9644,I'm also more comfortable about introducing myself to new people.
9645,It's nice to be able to smile and tell jokes and make others laugh.
9646,I severely missed that feeling.
9647,I still have a long way to go but I'm hopeful the combination of CBT and medications will help me get through it.
9648,"I'm so glad I finally found this sub 

I've had anxiety since I was really young, nobody knew what it was at the time though 

so my greatest phobia is of choking (and I'm sorry if this has been mentioned to death, please let me know if I should remove this) 

I'm on meds for OVD/anxiety/depression and have been in therapy since January (finally), but this big fear will just not go away :/ 

I know I'm not the only one...any tiles/comfort/advice/etc?"
9649,"So I made a post about how I wanted to deal with my anxiety without medication about a year ago, and I would love to keep doing that."
9650,"It has been good for a while, but things keep cropping up, be it old symptoms, or new."
9651,"I still withdraw and procrastinate when my anxiety is up, but now I am losing sleep."
9652,"I have stopped drinking coffee after noon, and that has helped a bit, but I am not sleeping like I normally do."
9653,"I am going to get a day planner and keep it as an anxiety journal, as a last ditch effort."
9654,"If I can see patterns, maybe I can nip them in the bud."
9655,But if that doesn't get me where I want to be I will talk to my doctor about an anti-anxiety med.
9656,How should I broach the subject with my doctor?
9657,What has worked for you guys?
9658,I am 27F if medications affect age and gender differently.
9659,Also has anyone kept track of their anxiety in a journal?
9660,Did it help?
9661,How did you set it up?
9662,I have handled certain situations very well that would have normally thrown me into an episode; but it's only been 3 weeks since my diagnosis/since I started medication.
9663,"**

Is my anxiety bad enough on its own to get on medication?"
9664,"I just switched to a new medicine because the old one affected my sex drive too much  and I do enjoy the new meds, but I've never experienced this sort of anxiety as much as I do on these meds."
9665,"Again, these meds are new so I'm curious as to whether I should get a higher dosage or take up my doctors for quick relief meds (Xanex)."
9666,"http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2g9nrv/2_months_on_meds_for_depression_and_anxiety/.compact
That is my original post."
9667,I'd rather not turn to medication but I feel like I'm going to have to if something doesn't give.
9668,The anti-psychotic medication has helped in some ways to conquer my problem.
9669,So basically all the medication has done is taken away the stress because I don't have wet dreams anymore and have absolutely no need for sex.
9670,I went off of meds in 7th grade and had my mental health under control until about a year and a half ago.
9671,So my doctor who is not aptly suited for medicine (angry rant about that another time) is looking to ween me off of klonopin which I have needed and faithfully taken for close to 6 years now.
9672,"I am currently not taking an anti-depression medicine with it, but only because everything I've tried has left me super sick."
9673,"I have noticed that since it take it (yesterday) i have severe lightheadiness (also anxiety to faint or die), restlessness and worries that something really bad is going to happen (allergic reaction or so..)

I also take other meds like lamotrigin 200mg, blood pressure drug and seroquel xr 150mg."
9674,"You are dealing with highly addictive meds here, some even say more addictive than heroine."
9675,I just want to be stable but I'm reluctant to take meds and until I piss clean I can't smoke.
9676,fortunately i'm much better now after meds and gradually stopped having thoughts as much.
9677,* I am wondering why he prescribed me an antipsychotic compared to an anti-anxiety medication... or are these the same things?
9678,Are all anti-anxiety meds antipsychotics?
9679,"* If I decide against this medication, am I supposed to wait until my next visit and say, ""No I didn't take it, I found out it can cause TD."
9680,"Do you have anything else that is an anti-anxiety medication that *doesn't* cause TD?"""
9681,"* I'm scared because I want to try this medication because I think it could help, on the other hand, but I'm so afraid of TD."
9682,"She's bipolar and on a lot of medication, when she remembers to take it."
9683,"I'm 14 years old and the lack of sleep is really getting to me, anyway I was wondering if anyone had something simmaler and maybe knows a better way to describe it so I might be able to get help or medication or something."
9684,Thanks for any input about this medication.
9685,"I don't take meds for my anxiety because I thought I didn't need them, but now I'm rethinking that."
9686,She can't find her meds.
9687,She says that to get new meds she has to file a police report and they're going to want my contact info.
9688,"I've gone to the doctor and have been prescribed .5mg xanax about 3 months ago but have yet to ever take it, as I am reluctant to meds."
9689,"I always keep benzo's nearby for that last ditch option - but it really is a last resort, as in almost never."
9690,"Doctors always casually say, take one on the morning, one at night."
9691,"To me though, taking benzo-class medications slow me down cognitively (obviously), but I'm always afraid that I won't be able to do my job, or say/do something that is outright silly because I'm not thinking straight."
9692,I'm mostly tired all the time anyway and of course always afraid this will just make things worst.
9693,"They are great as a sleep aid, though."
9694,"Any of you take xanax, klonopin, etc."
9695,daily?
9696,How does it effect your day?
9697,How do you deal with the increased tolerance overtime?
9698,Or could this dose/combination of medication possibly be my long sought after miracle combination/dosage?
9699,"She put me in a weekly therapy group, and told me that if my smyptoms are still there after 8 weeks to make another appointment with her, where she might reccomend that I take medication."
9700,"I'm afraid because while I feel meds would probably help me, I'm afraid to go on them."
9701,Has anyone had good (or bad) results with these meds?
9702,I'm not really interested in a therapist or in meds.
9703,"really, we never saw medication as an option."
9704,"ive heard a few bad things about anxiety meds, how they can.. change you?"
9705,Given that these didn't happen before I'm pretty sure this is the meds leaving my system but just wondered if you guys had been through anything similar?
9706,My doctor also keeps messing around with meds it's like they can't find the right thing to keep me stable in the meantime.
9707,"Long story short, anxiety disorder is a distinct possibility for me and my psychiatrist thinks putting me on an SSRI will help determine a diagnosis, plus, obviously, treat it if that's what it is."
9708,He gave me a list of medications and told me to choose.
9709,"This is awesome, but because - as I've been told - I'm highly dependent, it's also pretty difficult for me."
9710,"I narrowed the list down to two (from three) but I feel they have such widely mixed reviews from people that I can't possibly know which one will be ""right""."
9711,"I know no one can [should] choose for me, but I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations as to how to go about choosing."
9712,"If it matters, I'm in late adolescence."
9713,**tl;dr** I have to choose between Zoloft and Celexa for my possible anxiety; any help?
9714,"I'm hesitant to get into taking medicine because I don't want to become dependent, but need help getting over this."
9715,I've only taken the meds for the past day and a half but it doesn't seem to help too much so far.
9716,But because of my bad experience with doctors and their medicine I'm very sceptical.
9717,"Short of seeing a doctor about meds (which is on the table), does anyone have any good ""tricks"" or methods for breaking out of panic?"
9718,"Finally with the help of a counselor and some meds, I put a name to the fear that had followed me all my life and found some solutions."
9719,"Even if I take medication, it doesn't really help."
9720,"So after dealing with anxiety for about 5 years now, in different forms and from different causes, I was finally prescribed medication today by my GP (Paroxetine.)"
9721,"I've seen several doctors over the years, tried several meds (which didn't help), had tons of tests done, and they still don't know what's wrong."
9722,"I usually try to take some medication before getting too nauseous, but it doesn't seem to help too much."
9723,"For the past year I have had medication, but I didn't take it for whatever reason."
9724,That's one reason why'd I'd like to try meds but also because I read a few stories about how people tried meds for the first time and realised just how much anxiety was affecting them without them even knowing it.
9725,If meds would help at all it could change my life in a very positive way.
9726,"But like I wrote earlier my doctor said last time that he doesn't want to give me meds, so what should I do?"
9727,"I recently got a job at a vet clinic that involves me staying there overnight if/when pets stay overnight so I can give meds, take them for walks, etc."
9728,Curious for some information on meds from those who have experience with them.
9729,"Im afraid of anti anxiety meds keeping me from enjoying alcohol, or other things I must avoid/deal with because of the meds."
9730,"I dont know much about the various meds, I just know after a full year of heavy anxiety I need more help."
9731,Hoping for insight on anti anxiety meds.
9732,"I was on anti anxiety and depression meds, but took myself off of the depression meds a bit back because they left me feeling nothing at all, and am off the anxiety meds and run instead."
9733,"My friend made is sound almost to good to be true:)

Note: I didn't stop taking Prozac to start taking this medicine, I stopped because I could no longer take the side effects, and spoke to my doctor before doing so."
9734,"I've tried multiple meds (anti-depressants made me suicidal), therapy, and herbal supplements (L-Theanine, Lemon Balm, etc)."
9735,I currently am not on meds and am trying to avoid that route again - What are some non-medication remedies you've found helpful?
9736,"Every single job I've ever taken, I've normally been pretty excited about it before I start."
9737,"The single moment I step in or clock in, I immediately am filled with so much dread and panic."
9738,Like I'm completely incompetent and it's too much responsibility and I'm in way over my head.
9739,"I just started a really well-paying job this week that's a little more difficult than most other jobs I've taken, and Day One, I thought I was going to have a breakdown."
9740,"I just sit and collect myself, I don't interact at all."
9741,How do I know if I really am in over my head?
9742,What kind of job should I look at?
9743,How do I cope with this overwhelming fear that I can't do it?
9744,Should I quit if it doesn't go away?
9745,Anxiety makes me feel so incredibly stupid.
9746,"I'll call my mom and my boyfriend from the bathroom, crying that I can't do it."
9747,"They'll ask why I feel that way, and I can't even pinpoint it."
9748,It's just overwhelming fear; it's paralyzing.
9749,What do I do?
9750,"Edit: Clarification, I'm a girl in my mid-twenties with GAD."
9751,No medications- I've had nothing but miserable experiences with almost every anti-anxiety med I've tried.
9752,"I want to experience all the emotional highs and lows of a relationship with the woman I love, but would it be unfair to ask her to try and get off the meds given her anxiety?"
9753,"Tl;Dr My girlfriend is an emotional zombie, and I think her anxiety meds are to blame."
9754,Is it out of bounds to ask her to consider getting off the meds given her anxiety problems.
9755,It has stared to make me feel empty now and Im liking the idea of stopping the medication.
9756,"I don't take any medication, so that makes it hard to overcome all of this."
9757,"This time it's different though, I'm kicking the meds in hopes of conceiving a child with my husband."
9758,"Even though the medication helped me get through my panic attacks a little, it was not enough for me to keep up with the material to graduate on time despite being only 3 classes short."
9759,I've been dealing with my anxiety my whole life and for the last four years I've managed it pretty well without medication.
9760,"I'm a 19 year old Male, I'm not taking any medication right now, and I've never been officially diagnosed."
9761,"I have had tests to rule out anything serious and everything has come back fine but I don't feel fine :(

I am not on any medication yet but am going to ask my GP for something as I feel I can't cope any more."
9762,Does anxiety get better with medication and do the IBS like symptoms gt better?
9763,"I've done therapy and medication, and I'm very capable of dating and setting something good up...but I can't afford do spiral down again if that happens."
9764,Was wondering what meds people have found most useful when dealing with anxiety?
9765,I was on medication off-and-on throughout undergrad (I've basically tried every SSRI &amp; also have depression) but it never really helped that much.
9766,hey everyone - recently my dad suffered a number of panic attacks which led him to be hospitalized for a week.
9767,"basically he lost his (high stress) job, his wife got breast cancer (and is currently being treated), and he lost his father in a short time and it triggered the worst out of his anxiety."
9768,"now that he's out of the hospital, i'm home trying to help him get back on his feet, but it's tough to know where to start."
9769,"right now he's suffering some pretty heavy side effects(doctor is aware), and vision and critical thinking are very difficult."
9770,doctor said it'll come back over time.
9771,"it seems like leaving him in the house alone is out of the question (he constantly is thinking appliances and whatnot are broke, so he messes with them to try and make them better)."
9772,"he's kind of a shell of a human-being right now, and it's hard to digest seeing my father like this (he's a sharp guy, an engineer who really has the ability to fix anything)."
9773,could you guys help me establish a good way to care for him?
9774,he's still a few weeks out from being able to make good use of therapy.
9775,and what can he do to help better himself/his situation now?
9776,i feel like maybe some self-help videos or something of that nature might be worth it.
9777,"he's currently on two medications (clonapin and celexa), and i trust the doctor (met him yesterday) and recognize it's a long road for recovery."
9778,I'm scared to try meds because I don't want to feel dependent on something to get me through the day...but right now I'm at a loss.
9779,I've noticed since I began taking medication for my anxiety and depression that I am much less inclined to express myself in the creative ways I did before (i.e.
9780,I don't take any medication for it because my parents constantly give me shit about how much my current medicine (epilepsy) costs.
9781,Thinking of asking for more medication causes fear/stress.
9782,I was wondering about everyone else's experience with this drug/medicine?
9783,I do believe that medication has helped me over the last 15 years but it doesn't prevent those every once in a while bad days or bad few hours of anxiety.
9784,I've been on medicine for a month now.
9785,He put me on some medication.
9786,I got put onto new medication to help cope.
9787,It is a stronger medication and it had to shorten my work schedule a little bit.
9788,My doctor gave me a note saying to shorten my shifts because it was messing with my original medication.
9789,half the reason i feel like i'll never get medication is because ive already told her about all my coping mechanisms and how they work.
9790,if she doesn't bring it up when i see her on friday im going to ask her about medication.
9791,"i want to try medication, but im not sure if it's what i need."
9792,im having a crazy moral battle within myself because i don't want to jump on medication to solve all my problems and rely on that but i feel relying on other people has failed me and relying on myself causes a whole other bunch of problems.
9793,"I'm 31, been suffering from anxiety &amp; depression issues on and off since I was about 13 years of age."
9794,"I've been on a variety of medications, a bunch of different doctors and therapists."
9795,"I got to the point where I wasn't unhappy, but never really felt happy or normal."
9796,"Almost 2 years ago I saw a new therapist, went through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy."
9797,"I've been off my medications, successfully, for almost a year now."
9798,This therapy helped me SO much.
9799,"I am finally able to make sense of where my thoughts are coming from, why, and turn them around."
9800,"I feel ""normal"" for the first time in my life."
9801,"In January I met my bf, online, and we started a long distance relationship."
9802,"It wasn't planned, it's DEFINITELY not easy, but I love him and it's different than any love I've experienced before."
9803,I don't want to screw this up.
9804,"My bf is really easy going, goes with the flow type of guy."
9805,He never worries about anything.
9806,Almost to a fault.
9807,"The past couple of weeks, we've both had things happening in our lives."
9808,One event in particular caused me more anxiety than I've felt in years.
9809,"To the point my eye was twitching every day, I was having violent dreams, my mood was up and down, I've been chewing on my cheek in my sleep."
9810,"We didn't really argue, but we had some discussions that got a little intense."
9811,"I wasn't able to stop focusing on the feelings I was having, the negative thoughts, I couldn't stop thinking about the negative thoughts."
9812,"I couldn't stop talking about it either, it was consuming our conversations each night."
9813,"To the point where he was getting irritated with me, and he vocalized that."
9814,"He doesn't understand anxiety and though he knows about my mental health issues, he doesn't understand."
9815,"I've tried to explain it to him, but I don't think I'm doing a good job."
9816,"When something ""bad"" happens, I get a lot of anxious and angry thoughts."
9817,"Some of them are self blame, but mostly I catastrophize everything."
9818,"I can't stop feeling my negative feelings and work past them, let them go, until I understand why I am feeling them."
9819,"Once I understand what is causing the feelings, it's easy for me to look at it logically and get out of that negative thought spiral."
9820,"Until I identify, understand, and get a different perspective, I'm absolutely miserable."
9821,I feel miserable and I'm miserable to be around.
9822,"I've tried explaining to him why I can't just ""let it go"", but he doesn't understand."
9823,"I've tried explaining it like it's a math problem I need to solve, or a puzzle that's missing a piece, or even a part of a video game I just can't get passed (we both game)."
9824,He still doesn't get it.
9825,"When I was feeling the need to talk through the situation, share where my feelings where stemming, what I discovered was the cause, he was getting really fed up."
9826,"Saying things like ""is this something that's ever going to go away?""."
9827,Which makes me feel A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE.
9828,"I don't know when is the right time to bring up the situation of my anxiety, for a real discussion."
9829,Help him understand what's helpful and what's not.
9830,"I'm terrified that if I bring it up again, he's going to dump me."
9831,"He's going to get fed up, he's tired of listening to my crap."
9832,"My last relationship ended because my bf didn't understand, threatened me constantly that if I didn't get better he'd leave."
9833,How do I help my current partner understand that I'm not just being difficult.
9834,"This is real to me, it's hurtful, it's frustrating for both of us, and I do what I can but I need support and not to feel his anger and frustration when I'm already on the edge."
9835,How do I help him not get frustrated and angry at me?
9836,TL:DR - I don't know how to explain my anxiety in a way that will help my bf understand what I'm going through.
9837,"I'm scared to talk about it for fear of being annoying, and that he'll break up with me."
9838,I had always wanted to try medication since I feel strongly that my reactions to public speaking are an autonomic nervous system response that I can't control.
9839,"However, the clinic associated with my university was a behavioral therapy and not a medication type place."
9840,I have an addictive personality and easily lose track of what I'm doing with psych/ anxiety meds- so I avoid them and can only receive relief via therapy.
9841,I've also experienced a dangerous adverse reaction to psyche meds leaving me recovering from a series of seizures as a result.
9842,So psyche meds are really just an absolute no for me at this point.
9843,"Also I've been looking into getting some meds, like Xanax."
9844,"Which meds, at low doses,  have worked for you guys with the least amount of side affects?"
9845,"I'm desperate for help, but therapy is pointless for me, and I'm not sure if any doctor can give me medication, since I'm a minor and it may make the situation worse."
9846,"Riding in the car with other people, traveling too far away from home, driving on the highway, drinking, taking any type of medicine."
9847,I have considered going to a psychiatrist to see about getting medication but the thought of that scares me too.
9848,"So I'm dealing with college, and anxiety (otherwise I wouldn't be posting on this /r/)."
9849,"My Dad's extremely against medications, and everything."
9850,"I've been diagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD."
9851,"I DO, on the other hand, take prozac and provigil."
9852,"Lately, I've been feeling a lot of anxiousness."
9853,"To add onto this, I broke up with my girlfriend, and it kinda hurts."
9854,"My finals are coming up, and I'm failing one or two classes(?)."
9855,I'm taking about 5 classes total.
9856,What do I do ;_;.
9857,I'm a lot calmer now that I've taken my meds but the headache is messing with me and so are the symptoms I had earlier.
9858,I don't wanna try meds wanna try different types of therapy to see why I can't get over this condition.
9859,"I almost never need medication during the day, but I've come to rely on it at night, not much just .5 to 1mg of clonazepam a night, if I don't take it, even if I had a good day and worked my body to the point of exhaustion, my mind will start racing with anxious thoughts, then full blown anxiety, then panic attacks if I dint take something."
9860,I only have one 30 day prescription left and am aware doctors won't prescribe this kind of medication unless they are regularly seeing the patient because of the abuse potential.
9861,I don't feel comfortable or confident in getting off the medication at this point in time personally.
9862,"All I know is that I HAVE seen doctors, but I've never been on medication or received much professional help outside of my first few trips to see what was wrong with me."
9863,I stumbled out and yelled for my fiancé to get my meds.
9864,"He tells me to just take medication, but there are a lot of reasons I don't want to do that."
9865,Life has been so good since i started the meds and therapy.
9866,And now that I have a semblance of normality (without medication!
9867,I'm currently on day #4 of the medication.
9868,"If the medication is causing insomnia, is it safe to assume that I could take it in the morning rather than at night?"
9869,"And as a related question, I know I'm not far enough in for the medication to really make an impact yet, but does anyone have any similar experience where it seems like anxiety in the morning is worse than usual?"
9870,I have another meeting with the psychiatrist a few days before I'm going away and I'm wondering if it would be bad to ask him about putting me on short term medication for my month away.
9871,"Years of therapy, medication, introspection, and research have made me pretty familiar with anxiety issues in general and how I deal with them in particular."
9872,"And FYI, my current coping strategies include exercise, meditation, therapy, journaling, medication, and talking to friends/loved ones."
9873,"And on a different thought, my fiancée wants me to go back to the doctor to get anti-anxiety medication."
9874,"While I feel like I would benefit greatly from the meds, I am fighting with myself because another portion of my brain doesn't want to admit that I need the meds."
9875,"I was on meds from the VA for a while, but got off them because I thought I had gotten over it."
9876,Part of me really wants to get help but I don't want to take anxiety medication.
9877,"I am freaking out, yesterday I felt like I had a panic attack through the entire day and most of the night (it keeps me up at night) even through my medication which is a relatively high dose according to my psychiatrist."
9878,"How am I supposed to live with the fact that if my family could afford the $3k for more tests, longer hospital stays, and expensive medicine, she could possibly still be here."
9879,"I didn't even work the register my last shift, and I remember next to nothing about how to work it from two years ago, and I don't even kknow what I'm supposed to wear or what if I can't even get in because of the crowds, plus I forgot to take my medicine yestrday  so what if I have a panic attack while II'm there and I can'tt take a break...?"
9880,"I'm not sure what's causing it either, either the med change or the lack of specific anxiety medication."
9881,I can't afford medication or therapy.
9882,"I'm also on a long-acting beta blocker (Inderal - also used for performance anxiety) and another medication for blood pressure, which I also take at night."
9883,"I'm on anti anxiety meds, pretty much entirely because of all the horrible shit my brother has done in the past year, but they're starting to be less and less effective."
9884,i do not have any medication
9885,"I managed on my own for the most part, until I struggled with post-partum psychosis which put me on meds for the first time in my life."
9886,"I needed no medication, no therapy, and managed my symptoms amazingly."
9887,"It began in February, and by April I realized my symptoms were getting bad enough, I needed help, I needed to go on medication again."
9888,"EKG was normal, received some meds and luckily my wonderful GF was there to take me home."
9889,"I have meds for if I have an attack, and I will be seeing someone to talk to about this."
9890,Every once in a while I doubt that medication will work on me and hope everyday it won't make me worse in any way.
9891,"Now add to my overall anxiety two fears, 1) the fear of being without the meds, and 2) the fear of being dependent on them to get to sleep."
9892,"I've tried ADD meds like Adderall, but it gave me intense anxiety after a few days of use."
9893,"Realized I haven't included all of the general info, so here's the infodump: 22f, very specific anxiety that likes to get more general if it goes unaddressed (if I notice I'm actively fretting about climate change, something else is wrong that I'm not attending to), not very triggery (well, so far as I know), not on any meds yet, currently in Washington State, on Medicaid (better than nothing--I'm glad to have it)."
9894,seeking non-medication remedies and ways to *fix the underlying problem.
9895,"It is not nearly as good as a pam  anti anxiety medication, but it does the job for now."
9896,I recently started having panic attacks again after a while of thinking i was going to be ok. My parents are scheduling a doctor's appointment with intentions of getting me anti anxiety medication.
9897,The meds help to a certain extent.
9898,I'm currently on medication and going to therapy to get better.
9899,"My doctor prescribed it to go along with my current medicine, Lamictal."
9900,Not bad at all and I am practically stabilized on my meds.
9901,"To the point where she can feel like her body is ""on something"" - for that reason, she spoke to her doctor, who merely prescribed her anti-anxiety medication, which as you know, kind of just helps you ""get through"" a rough patch rather than working towards some kind of solution."
9902,He didn't suggest anything else but these meds.
9903,Is this a normal way for a doctor to react to with only medication for an anxiety disorder?
9904,"I'm not looking for life-changing shit like therapy or medicine -- that honestly sounds like too much for me right now, as stupid as that probably sounds -- I just want to get some ideas on things to make the day-to-day grind a little happier, more interesting, etc."
9905,I'm a 26 year old female with two very noticeable keloid scars on my right forearm.
9906,I do not self harm anymore and when I did years ago I was always sure to never do so in a noticeable place.
9907,However last year I went through a very difficult breakup with my fiance who was diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 and major depressive disorder.
9908,I spent years struggling with his ups and manic downs.
9909,I even had to have him committed.
9910,During this time I started taking medication to help with my stress and anxiety.
9911,I think it was one of the medications I tried that caused my extreme mental breakdown to be as bad as it was.
9912,It has been 6 months since my break down and I have not only left the situation but moved back to my home state.
9913,I now have a very good job as a pastry chef that I am happy with.
9914,However today during a busy service I walked in on an employee making a joke at my expense.
9915,"He was looking through my drawer for a pair of scissors and said, "" Maybe she took them home and pretended they were razor blades."""
9916,He then ran the scissors across his forearm with sound effects.
9917,The chef he said this too laughed with him until he looked up and saw me standing there.
9918,I'm obviously extremely hurt and unsure how to handle this situation.
9919,It a small privately owned restaurant so there is no human resource to report to.
9920,Should I go to management or should I just drop the issue?
9921,"I have been having bad anxiety lately and I really don't like the way medicine makes me feel, I'd much rather use kava or a natural alternative."
9922,"Now, I didn't ask for this medication, in fact I told my doctor that people I knew (that'd be y'all!)"
9923,had had adverse effects from this medication.
9924,Only losing one hour to medication every two days?
9925,"Most recently, now, I've gotten anxious about being on medication (lol.)"
9926,I was instructed to start taking my meds again.
9927,"Right now, I'm sitting in work, trying to debate on whether or not to take my medicine or to just fight this and keep telling myself."
9928,Nor do I want to go on more meds.
9929,"Did you continue taking the medicine that worked for you or did you find benefits in supplementing other anxiety controlling methods (exercise, meditation, diet, ect)?"
9930,"I'll try to be short about it:

I'm 21yo guy and have always been the calm one in my family and around my friends."
9931,I go out often and used to drink a lot until 2 months ago.
9932,That's when I got my first panic attack.
9933,They keep coming every once in a while and I deal with them pretty well but now they come almost every day because I'm stressed over exams in college.
9934,The psychiatrist prescribed me Misar SR but I'm against any medications so I haven't taken any yet.
9935,Few months ago I had a talk with my parents about my possible ADHD and they agreed to help me any way they can.
9936,It has been difficult in college because of this but now with panic attacks and anxiety is getting worse.
9937,There's this book called Panic Away by Joe Barry so I'm wondering if anyone here has any experience with it or knows anything about it.
9938,"**Edit:** grammar

Thank you all very much for your responses!"
9939,"Bit of background, before I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on medication, my coping mechanism for when I was feeling separation from myself or overwhelmed was self harm... it went on for about seven years."
9940,"However, despite meds and meditation there are still instances when I start feeling as though I'm verging on a panic attack."
9941,I will then see him again on Monday to discuss stopping the medication altogether and the symptoms I experienced.
9942,"Then started a treatment with my shrink..
  First he prescripted me per day- 1mg Clona, 20mg Paroxetina ( Tiarix here, Paxil ) and 600mg Gabapentin at night for sleeping, because I also have insomnio; this was for 10 months.. then he changed me my meds, because it worked, but as I was a benzo addict, I took what I wanted always and I finished worse than when I started ( but not during the middle step in the treatment); remember being prescripted then when I told him was a drugaddict- Pregabaline 450mg 3 doses per day to discontinue clonazepam because its abstinence and still with Paxil 20 (Paroxetine)... 3 months later told him wanted to stop it because the suicide toughts it had gave me."
9943,And then he totally change meds again !!
9944,"Considering I still was taking Clonazepam and Xanax (Alplax here) , Lorazepan too (Trapax here), Bromazepam (Lexotanil here) and Valium maybe or Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) and Dormicum (midazolam), ass you see I'm a benzo addict and drug design.. so that happened to me, and it was happening until he prescripted me again a different medication- Olanzapine 5 (Midax) one at night and Pregabaline 150 2 doses (Lyrica, Neuristan) again :/... then I left and keep self-medicating until I almost die having an overdose because taking all that kind of pills I said, the prescripted ones and the other benzo I like."
9945,"While in school, I went to a psychiatrist a couple times and got meds."
9946,I hated them (the meds) and they didn't work for me.
9947,"**1)** Should I see a psychiatrist, even though I don't want to try meds again?"
9948,The chlopromazine caused nasal congestion and the decongestant clashed with one of the other meds and caused the week long panic attacks which brought back the phobia.
9949,I am on medication.
9950,I've been on medicine for my anxiety for a year and a half now.
9951,"Hi All
32 yo male here, lifelong anxiety and episodic depression."
9952,Have been meditating last 18 months.
9953,I have recently seen a new psychiatrist (only ever really seen psychologists before) and he immediately prescirbed Parnate.
9954,"I have over the last 10 years tried Zoloft, Effexor, Venlafaxine and Paroxetine, and never really noticed any effects, positive or negative from them."
9955,"After I withdrew from the last, 2 years ago, Paroxetine, my episodic depression (which is triggered by anxiety, eg can come when change in circs or am really excited about new things) has got more constant, and I'm worried medications are the cause, and that this will happen with Parnate."
9956,"Still, if I am in a stable envinroment, day to day, while I can get easily overwhelmed, the depression is minimal and anxiety is the constant."
9957,"Reading reviews, it seems to be a useful medication, but people seem to be on it for life, and for severe depression more than anxiety."
9958,"Has anyone withdrawn from it, and remained off medication."
9959,What were the long-term effects - worse after it then before it?
9960,I'm also concerned about whether it is necessary.
9961,"When I saw psych, I was having a very depressed week, and while anxiety and depression does effect me every day, when I am feeling well (most of the time, as long as things are not changing too much or other stressors) I feel like I don't want to risk it."
9962,"That said, most days I do find small things overwhelming and anxiety-provoking, and I know that I could make a success of my business if I could deal with the stress from minor things, self-criticism and 'replaying things in my head' and the over-sensitivity to others' criticism."
9963,"I have stagnated in my life, and I have struggled with mental issues my whole lie (when a child, anxiety would manifest in 'dizzy spells', hyperventilation etc)."
9964,"Also, I really struggle to get motivated and positive in the mornings, although in the evenings I often feel great."
9965,I have also recently returned to having 'depersonalisation' when I'm feeling anxious - like I am watching myself from afar (had also as a child).
9966,So is it worth taking?
9967,You are welcome to read some of my other posts to see my history.
9968,"And I suppose, as a more minor point, how have people dealt with the phyiscal restrictions?"
9969,"(for me, a small price to pay)."
9970,Thankyou.
9971,Also posted in r/depression
9972,"My RX ran out and my car broke down in tandem, so Ive been out of my meds for 3 days now."
9973,Now I'm 19 days off the medicine but I've had a pressure headache for about two weeks and today I feel like I have the flu.
9974,I don't want my anxiety to stop me but short of taking lots of Atvian and possibly getting more anxiety meds I forsee my upcoming flights as horrible experiences in waiting.
9975,I have been diagnosed with ADHD and low level anxiety that may be amplified by my meds since they are stimulants.
9976,"eventually I told my SO (because I was concerned I might say mean things to him, or even hit him) and he reassured me that I hadn't said anything upsetting yet and he was ok with being patient until the meds settled down."
9977,"I recently posted here about what I thought was me having a weird reaction to a new medication (clonazepam), but my therapist helped me find the real catalyst, so that's no longer really an issue."
9978,"In a sense, I felt that I didn't *deserve* diagnosis, treatment, or medication for something that was essentially meaningless compared to people with ""real"" disorders."
9979,It will even give you anxiety about taking your anxiety meds.
9980,Is there any medicine for getting rid of blushing?
9981,I just bought my first bottle as a last ditch effort to quell my out of control anxiety before seeking medication.
9982,"I'm 17 years old and dropped out of school, I really feel like my life is going nowhere, every time I try to do something about my anxiety and depression I'm unable to, I don't take medicine and never have, and would prefer not too unless there is no other way."
9983,"The only things I haven't tried is therapy and medicine, I don't know what too say other than I need help, advice, and support............
(I pretty much stay in bed all day and pace a lot, I also have trouble sleeping [getting to sleep and oversleeping] and also feel that it is effecting my eating too)"
9984,"Hey, so I've dealt with a general anxiety disorder since I was 14 and am not on medication for it by choice."
9985,"I do have high blood pressure, and i feel like (but im not positive) that this bad anxiety all started when i switched to a new medication."
9986,"My mom ha encouraged me to seek help/medication if I need it, but even that would cost money I don't have."
9987,Are you on medication for it?
9988,"He said to me today ""I don't think medication is ever the answer with anxiety, the answer is in yourself""."
9989,My love ones sat me down and told me it was time to go back on medication.
9990,I hope the medicine doesn't change me.
9991,I hate medication.
9992,"Since then, I was in therapy until I was 15, and I've been on medication ever since."
9993,I wish I never switched my meds.
9994,"I get paranoid when I'm on this medication too, like I feel like people are hanging around outside my apartment and I'm just very wary of people."
9995,When I don't take this medication I feel pretty fine and I have basically no paranoia.
9996,"Problem is, I had a panic attack earlier tonight while coming home from a resturaunt (literally no idea what caused it) and at this point at 11:00 at night when I have to work at 10am, I can't take the medicine that she prescribed me without waking up in a sweat in 6 hours and not being able to calm back down to go to sleep."
9997,"Tl;dr:  Got stressed about missing seizure meds, few weeks later had chest and arm pain that ended me in the ER three times, and last night I could stop crying."
9998,"For reasons I won't get into here, I found myself without my seizure medication for 24 hours."
9999,"However, after I started taking my medication, the weird ""waves"" that washed over me didn't stop immediately as they usually do if I've forgotten to take my medication."
10000,"Did not like it, but assumed it would go away as my body readjusted itself after getting my seizure meds back into my system."
10001,"It almost feels like something ""broke"" in me on the day I missed my meds and it opened a floodgate to things I'm not prepared to handle."
10002,"I also have social anxiety that was persistent for years, never really letting up, until around the time I hit university, and then it only began to surface in extreme situations, or when I'd missed my meds."
10003,I'm not a person that strongly disagrees with medication for things FYI.
10004,I'm considering bringing some sort of medication to keep me calm if necessary (I've never taken meds for anxiety) for the plane ride.
10005,"As of right now, I'm trying to focus on my excitement, but any insight you guys could offer on keeping calm during plane rides (including any meds you take) and being in a foreign country would be much appreciated."
10006,I have a pretty bad clinical anxiety problem because of my perceptive disorder and over active nervous system so I've been contemplating getting medication.
10007,"Symptoms: Always out of breath, constant thirst (dry mouth), short-term memory loss, dizziness, hunger pains, lack of energy when I don't eat, can't eat too much at a time, dry hands, and my very favorite... Erectile disfunction."
10008,I've been dealing with this for a year now.
10009,"Basically, if I miss a single meal I'll get really dizzy until I eat again."
10010,"Today, I took a tablet you put under your tongue."
10011,"My friend bought it from a pharmacy saying it's for anxiety... Now I did eat a protean bar and drink a V8 energy drink as well, but for most of the day I felt great!"
10012,The medicine started with an S. Soloman or something like that?...
10013,I can't tell if it was a placebo though.
10014,Can this tablet really cure all of those symptoms?
10015,It just doesn't sound real to me.
10016,Do you guys think I have anxiety?
10017,I have some Clonazepam as well which was recommended by a doctor a few weeks ago.
10018,I never ended up taking it but I'm going to tomorrow.
10019,Any other medicines you guys recommend?
10020,Preferably something I don't need a prescription for as I have terrible health insurance and not much time.
10021,"I have been taking medication for years, and I have just recently gotten off it."
10022,"I'd thought it was 100% due to taking cold medicine, since that can raise blood pressure, but the anxiety persists when I nix those."
10023,I explain this and all she says is take medication...blah blah.
10024,I was on medication for 10 years and I have had side effects that I just don't like.
10025,I am currently off almost all my meds and doing pretty darn well.
10026,"It was my perfect medication: it allowed me to truly apply myself, to do well at things, to think clearly."
10027,"Either way, I stopped seeing the doctor and the therapist, and I stopped getting medicine."
10028,"I eventually managed to get a job, but without any kind of anxiety medication and my current depressive state, I became extremely suicidal after only a month of working."
10029,I think medicine should be a last resort.
10030,Anyone else feel this way?
10031,How do I avoid feeling anxious merely because I wanted to rest and relax one day?
10032,How do I 'take a day off' to do nothing without feeling extremely anxious?
10033,How do I deal with this?
10034,What to do?
10035,"I don't want to take medications, so please don't suggest that as a possible suggestion."
10036,Thanks.
10037,I'm hoping to start some kind of medication because after today it has become glaringly obvious that I am not OK.
10038,"How much does your medication help, and does it hinder your social life (mixing alcohol and meds)?"
10039,My progress is faltering and I'm becoming nearly agoraphobic so I'd like to start taking medication.
10040,"**

26/F here, diagnosed with panic disorder 5 years ago, but things have been better and I haven't been on meds in a while."
10041,"My only reasoning is that they thought I was there to try to get meds, or if it my feelings were something bigger, they didn't want to deal with it."
10042,I have been very tempted to see someone about going back on meds though.
10043,I tried my best to avoid needing medication for my problems.
10044,"I just got put on medication on Friday but it may take weeks to provide any positive impact, if it does at all."
10045,I am not presently on anxiety medication.
10046,I have been off any sort of regular medication for a while now.
10047,"Now I have not taken the medicine route (except I did take B complex when I felt drained of energy which sustained my panic even further, but don't need to anymore), there was a point which I felt that if I have exhausted every other option possible then I would, so there is nothing wrong with it."
10048,Also I'm getting really worried about the hair-loss side effects these meds have.
10049,Not sure if it was caused by the meds or because thats how i'm feeling at the moment.
10050,Three weeks ago I decided my anxiety is too much to handle on my own so I went to psychiatrist who diagnosed me with recurrent depression/ anxiety disorder and immediately prescripted me meds.
10051,"I've taken the meds for 7 days and since the side effects kept only getting worse, I quit the pills."
10052,"Or is it just a problem in my head, maybe caused by how meds were demonized by people around me?"
10053,"I'm a 27yr old male, no medications but a self described night owl that probably doesn't get enough sleep."
10054,Just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar to this since I can't pin it down exactly with google searches.
10055,Occasionally (every 2 months maybe?)
10056,"I will have this thing where I wake up suddenly, either shortly after falling asleep or after an hour or two."
10057,It seems to happen only when I take a nap or fall asleep in my chair accidentally.
10058,"I wake up with a sudden jolt, in a panic about not exactly death itself, but the idea of being dead forever."
10059,Like the fact that someday I will have no consciousness whatsoever for as long as the universe exists and I'll never know anything after I die.
10060,"I'll get up suddenly and yell an obscenity a few times, pretty much involuntarily, but then I'll be ok after only a few seconds when my head clears and the adrenaline comes down."
10061,However during that time it's sheer terror like I'm in a different reality.
10062,What's odd is before I became an atheist I would have the same panic about the idea of existing forever and what that even meant (which I think is much worse).
10063,"I'm not really afraid to die in my everyday life, it's just these ""existential brain spasms"" that happen sometimes."
10064,"It seems like I have some weird combination of a hypnagogic jerk and waking night terror, but I'd appreciate any insight or if someone has had anything like this happen to them."
10065,Is it reasonable to ask about other types of medicine?
10066,"Hi,  

I have a flight in a few hours and 2x ."
10067,5mg klonopin.
10068,I have been diagnosed with panic disorder and now have a huge fear of flying.
10069,How should I go about taking these medications?
10070,Thanks in advance.
10071,I am new to all this... has anyone been able to stop taking meds and still feel this way?
10072,My anxiety has become so awful that I can't even visit my regular doctor and she refuses to refill my medicine over the phone..
10073,"My psychologist (only made it to one appointment this year) can't prescribe and the last time I saw her, she did tell me medicine might be beneficial, but was in a hurry because our session was running late and didn't refer me for the med doctor at the counseling center."
10074,"Since that happened, I figured I would go and see a professional about medication."
10075,"i'm prescribed .5mg KPin and i just recently ran out of them, i now realized they helped diminish my [visual snow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow)  but i really need a fast acting anxiety medication on top of that and from what ive heard alprazolam(xanax) is the best one."
10076,"New meds, went to bed at 11ish, sleeping in a place I know is safe."
10077,I don't want to turn to medication.
10078,"Also, there's no other real treatment for my hearing issues, but anti-anxiety meds are a common things for us."
10079,Not on any meds right now because my last psychiatrist was a quack.
10080,"And as a secondary question, which meds do YOU find the most useful besides Klonopin because they just do not work for me."
10081,My anxiety has been better since my initial panic attack after stop taking the meds but it still sucks.
10082,"I've agreed to stay on the fluoxetine for the month's duration, but I'm not so sure I can't do without it, given the right stomach medicine...ugh..."
10083,"The thought that if I had to be on a lifelong medication that would prevent me from drinking doesn’t upset me, oddly enough."
10084,"Got a survey through from the university I am about to start at asking me a bunch of health questions, I answered it and I put details I deem necessary and always tell HR departments like what medication I take."
10085,"For those who have ended the use of medication, does it get better or worse?"
10086,"Now, this time around, I've since been to the doc and I have some anti-anxiety meds to take along."
10087,I've been diagnosed as a sufferer of social anxiety when I was previously attending regular therapy due to severe depression.
10088,"I went to a massive party about a week ago, it was alright, I didn't feel too overwhelmed and all that."
10089,"I did however notice the day after, I woke up feeling like I wasn't in my body."
10090,"I still feel this way, and this has happened about year ago before."
10091,"I can't shake off this feeling, and I don't know what to do."
10092,I thought maybe its alcohol-related because the last time this happened I was drunk as a skunk.
10093,"It's been over a week, and I can't get control, I feel like I'm playing a sims game in first person."
10094,"I can speak, and move, but it doesn't feel like it's me doing it."
10095,"I'm freaking out, I can't concentrate or study (exam this wednesday), and I don't know what to do."
10096,"I'm 19 years old, female, not taking any medications for my anxiety."
10097,I get anxious/depressed then I use medicine from the psychiatrist.
10098,Too embarrassed to tell my family but I have been telling my councilor and doctor that I have trouble with taking the medicine correctly and I have a history of doing the same thing.
10099,YOU NEED TO STOP FUCKING LISTENING TO *YOURSELF.
10100,*  **STOP LISTENING TO YOURSELF!!!
10101,"**  

You are a liar."
10102,Did you know that?
10103,"There is a part of your brain that is a compulsive, pathological, incessant, unstoppable liar."
10104,"Every day, from the moment you wake until you pass out with your heart racing and feet rubbing together, a voice in your head is lying to you."
10105,"And the worst part about is that every day, from the moment you wake until you pass out, you fucking listen to that voice!"
10106,"Here is what's going on: 

Long ago humans evolved the ability to think on an incredible level."
10107,"But this new brain did not replace the old one; instead, it grew on top of it."
10108,"We still have many, probably close to all, of the primitive functions that even simple animals have."
10109,"You eat, shit, fuck, and fear not much unlike a goddamn squirrel."
10110,You have inside your brain a primitive emotional system designed to provide short-term motivation to do things necessary to keep you alive or to reproduce.
10111,"Fear exists because it helps keep life living: something that's afraid will drop everything and run the fuck away, or fight to the death, better than something that's not, as a general principle."
10112,The problem with you and me is that our primitive emotional system is entangled with our advanced upper-brain.
10113,"It's not just the angry bear standing in front of you that causes anxiety, it's the *thought* of an angry bear that causes an identical reaction in you."
10114,Let me repeat that last point:  your thoughts can cause you anxiety to the same degree as if you were actually experiencing a dangerous event.
10115,"People who have panic attacks know this all too well - there could be literally nothing dangerous in front of them in the real world, but their mind will react to a thought - a goddamn fairy tale in their mind - as if they were facing actual danger."
10116,I think most people have a thought-system that creates and fires off negative thoughts by the dozens each day.
10117,"Some people aren't really aware of their negative thoughts until they really focus on them, though, because they can happen really, really fast and can be going on behind the scenes without the type of focus you usually picture when you think about your ""thoughts."""
10118,These aren't thoughts like the thoughts you have when you're trying to solve a math problem.
10119,"These are thoughts like fireworks popping off at any moment in your mind, almost from nowhere, but sometimes so feint you can only react to it without being aware that it even happened."
10120,What happened beginning in the 1950s with Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck is a new approach to therapy for people with anxiety disorders.
10121,"It's goal is to defeat your reaction to the negative thoughts that act like little angry bears in your mind - you learn that the thoughts are just thoughts, and they usually have little or nothing to do with reality."
10122,"This is the basis of **cognitive behavioral therapy**, which I did for years and am cured of my generalized anxiety disorder."
10123,"I still have anxiety, as does anyone who breathes, but it doesn't even come close to the shit I suffered for 10-15 years before finding a great CBT therapist and reading about it."
10124,"Similarly, **mindfulness** and **mindfulness based cognitive therapy** teach you to ignore, in a way, your thoughts."
10125,"Yes, this can be done."
10126,"The way I think of it is like this:  imagine you are standing in front of a girl naked, and she is laughing and making fun of you."
10127,And this goes on for hours.
10128,How long until you just don't give a fuck any more?
10129,How long until you realize that her laughter doesn't mean shit to you?
10130,"How long until you realize that the voice in your head telling you that you will fail, or you will make a fool out of yourself, or people hate you, or that a girl will reject you, or that you're going to get fired, or that you're going to have a panic attack outside and then the whole world will laugh at you, or that you just can't meet your boss' expectations, etc., are just words."
10131,"Worthless, meaningless, stupid words."
10132,"The next time you're anxious about something, don't run from the thoughts."
10133,Invite them in.
10134,Let them flow.
10135,Relax your stomach and jaw.
10136,"Don't try to breathe more slowly, go with it."
10137,And let the thoughts flow by without reacting to them.
10138,"Because it's your thoughts, and not the world out there, that makes you anxious."
10139,The cure for anxiety is to cure the way you react to your thoughts.
10140,**EDIT 1**:   Reading some of the comments saddens me.
10141,This forum is rife with recommendations and discussions of medications and anecdotal stories about what people have said about what people think is happening to them when they have anxiety.
10142,"Very, very, very few discussions of successful therapies, links to scientific reports and research, and discussions of therapists."
10143,The reason people don't get better is because what they think is wrong.
10144,Dead wrong.
10145,Stop listening to me and others and GO READ THE GODDAMN RESEARCH.
10146,"People who think that the modality is not as important a good therapist of some ineffective modality are dead wrong, and the research proves it."
10147,"And it's not mindfulness, it's mindfulness based CBT."
10148,Mindfulness is different.
10149,"People who think that anxiety just happens out of the blue are dead wrong, except for those extremely limited situations where someone has a medical issue or drug issue."
10150,"Anxiety has thought-based causes, and if you've never dealt with the thoughts, then you aren't aware of them."
10151,"Dealing with the thoughts does not mean stopping them, shutting them off, or stifling them, it means understanding them and their relationship to actual reality."
10152,"I'm sorry, but anyone who wants to get better needs to look into successful treatment and stop bullshitting around this forum with discussions of medication."
10153,Go to a psychiatrist for medication.
10154,And its not medication.
10155,Has anyone else had similar reactions to medication?
10156,I started on anxiety meds about 6 months ago and have been working to find the right combo of anxiety/depression meds but nothing feels like it's helping too much.
10157,I'm wondering if anyone has or currently uses wellbutrin in combination with an SSRI?
10158,"It's been suggested to me - I'm currently taking Zoloft (75 mg), but it has completely killed my sex drive and ability to orgasm."
10159,"It's also left me feeling a little numb emotionally at times - not *all* the time, but definitely noticable."
10160,I'm a bit nervous to do this.
10161,"I know it could potentially help me out, but wouldn't I have double the side effects then?"
10162,"I know wellbutrin isn't an SSRI, but it still worries me a bit."
10163,Plus I was reluctant to start on medication in the first place and now going to two medications just makes me feel so... crazy.
10164,I also tried Celexa and Lexapro before switching to the Zoloft.
10165,"So far zoloft is the only one that is helping my anxiety with less bothersome side effects - as much as I hate the sex problems, it is much better than constant nausea."
10166,Does anyone have any experience with this?
10167,The other thing I've considered is medication.
10168,Take meds?
10169,"Hi there, I'll try to keep this as short as possible."
10170,"I suffer from ADHD and Social Anxiety, the SA isn't terrible, but it's definitely there, and is worsened by any ADHD medication I have tried."
10171,My Doctor decided it would be the best cause of action to target the Anxiety and then focus on my ADHD.
10172,"Although he originally prescribed me Duloxetine, which I have read a LOT of bad things about, so I told him I did not want to take it; given my previous history with medications (they all affect me in very strange ways, so I have stopped taking most medications he prescribed me) he became slightly frustrated (for lack of a better work), and told me that there really wasn't many other options at this point."
10173,"I had to be quite assertive with him and say that it's not my fault and that I am just cautious about what is going into my body, he has since agreed to try ""Sertraline"", which I am aware, like Duloxetine is an anti-depressant."
10174,I am not depressed.
10175,Is this proven to help Anxiety?
10176,Does anybody have any similar experiences?
10177,"I have referred myself to Healthy Minds for some councelling, which will hopefully help with some of the other concerns I have with my mind, I am not sure if they are down to Anxiety or something else, a little confused with it all really."
10178,"(In case anybody may be able to help, I do not feel the same as anybody else around me, I just don't feel like they see things in the same way I do and it confuses me."
10179,"I develop a thorough dislike for people for doing fairly normal things, for example I used to sit at work and watch people making jokes with eachother and it used to make me increasingly angry, I eventually left the job purely down to the people around me, although there was nothing really wrong with them."
10180,There are a whole load of other things but I don't think they're relevant to discuss in this post.
10181,"Thanks - PS: I am an extremely normal person despite what the above may come across as, read it back and I sound like a maniac!)"
10182,"TL/DR, why am I being prescribed anti depressants for anxiety?"
10183,I am not depressed.
10184,I would ask my psychiatrist but it is SO hard to contact him I have just given up.
10185,"Also strange feelings

Thanks a lot"
10186,You can lead a normal life without meds
10187,"I can go for therapy, but not medication."
10188,"   I have been suffering from anxiety for some time now, it seems like it has been getting worse every day."
10189,I have a fear of almost everything and would rather just sit at home most days(but I get scared being alone) I also have a hard time talking to people especially when trying to tell them how I feel.
10190,I was sick with a cough/sore throat and went to the doctor.
10191,While I was there I thought it would be a good time to talk to her about my anxiety problems since they seem to be getting worse.
10192,She gave me an anti-biotic for the cough/sore throat and I told her I had left over cough syrup from early this year when I was sick that I could take so I didn't need that.
10193,She also prescribed me Cymbalta for the anxiety and suggested I go talk with someone.
10194,The next day I get nervous about taking the Cymbalta.
10195,I read up on it and looked at the side effects.
10196,I have been on various depression/anxiety meds in the past and they have all made me not care about anything really.
10197,I was worried about not caring about things and gaining the weight ( 115lbs that I just lost) back.
10198,So that day I made an appointment with a psychiatrist thinking that he could help me overcome my fear of taking the Cymbalta and talk with me some.
10199,Yesterday I went to see the psychiatrist and it was horrible.
10200,I was already nervous about going but it turned out worse than I thought it would be.
10201,"It was the worse experience with a doctor ever, I ended up having an anxiety attack, crying almost the entire time and leaving before our appointment was over."
10202,When I arrived at the office I filled out some paperwork and asked for the restroom.
10203,The nurse showed me to the bathroom and said they needed a urine sample (they supposedly do it for all patients over 10yrs of age and its only to monitor the prescriptions they give) so I gave one.
10204,The nurse then took my blood pressure and I mentioned that I had taken the cough syrup last night and it would probably show up and he said it was no problem.
10205,I then get showed to the psychiatrist office.
10206,"As soon as the psychiatrist walked in he asked me a few questions (name, if I was married, had kids, etc..) then he says your urine test showed positive for opiates, tell me about that."
10207,So I explain to him that I have been sick for the past week and had a cough and I took some cough medicine that I had been prescribed earlier that year.
10208,He then becomes very accusing and I guess you could say suspicious of me.
10209,(his facial gestures and the way he was talking) He starts talking aggressively and it made me feel uncomfortable and scared so I start crying.
10210,"He then says why are you crying ""as soon as I questioned you about you being positive for opiates you get upset""."
10211,"He goes on the say ""why would a doctor prescribe a codeine cough syrup when there are other options."
10212,"That's absurd!""."
10213,I even offered to bring him the prescription bottle that has some cough syrup left in it.
10214,I continue to try to make the appointment work.
10215,"I try to explain to him my anxiety over taking the Cymbalta (but I often have trouble conveying my feelings) and he cuts me off saying ""you had no problem taking opiates did you?""."
10216,"He ask if I have ever taken Xanax and I said yes, he then said ""you aren't/weren't prescribed to Xanax either, are you?"""
10217,I said no I'm not prescribed it but the dentist gives it to me when I go for dental work because that's one of my fears.
10218,"I then described what all they give me for dental work and he responds with ""wow, you have a high tolerance, hummm..""."
10219,Then goes on to say that opiates and benzos are far more dangerous than Cymbalta or any of those medications.
10220,"He says ""lets be honest"" then goes on a rant about how he would never prescribe Xanax, klonopin, etc."
10221,for anxiety with out trying to fix the problem with other non-addictive meds first instead of just treating symptoms.
10222,I just kept telling him I wasn't asking for anything and that I just was trying to find help overcoming some of my fears and my fear of taking the medicine.
10223,"He still couldn't understand my fear because I was having an anxiety attack, I was uncomfortable, and I was scared (making it very hard for me to communicate)."
10224,He said he is a Medical Doctor not a therapist and that he is only a prescriber.
10225,I apologized and tried to explain that I didn't realize this.
10226,He told me that therapy wouldn't work well for me and it would only help after I got on meds/for the long run.
10227,He said he could prescribe be Vibram (sp?)
10228,but if I was just going to look up the side effects when I got home it would do no good.
10229,He said that I should've just took the Cymbalta because I should trust the doctors.
10230,He also said he was typing a report of our meeting so that he could send it to my GP (I could understand him sending them a notification of medication changes but didn't think he could send a report of the entire session.).
10231,After I realized this doctor was not going to work at all for me I said I had to go a started to walk out.
10232,He called the receptionist saying that I was leaving.
10233,"She asked him why and he responded with ""she tested positive for opiates"" and her response to that was ""ohhhhhh...."" while she watched me walking out."
10234,It was embarrassing and it has made my anxiety worse.
10235,Don't really know where to go from here.
10236,What should I do?
10237,"I don't want to see a therapist and be put on meds, not to mention I don't even have the money."
10238,I've been on anti anxiety medication since I was in 6th grade.
10239,"I'm now 19, the medicine works well for me and I've changed my doses a few times but it's been steady for the past few years and I've been perfectly fine."
10240,"I'm already on medication and I've been in therapy, so those bases are covered."
10241,"It's possible I might be on the meds indefinitely, but I'm good with that."
10242,"Quick facts: 

-I'm 23 and shes 22
-We've been together almost 2 months now
-I don't take medicine or see a therapist
-I actually have health anxiety as well so I'm scared of taking medicine for my anxiety because of what it might do to me."
10243,-For those that are going to just go with the easy response and suggest meds or therapists please tell me about your experiences with it so I'm not as anxious about them.
10244,"I know I have to develop a better lifestyle and rely on the medication, but I've come a long way where I came from and I am headed down the right path...."
10245,I want to make it clear to whoever does my intake that I do not want medication.
10246,"I've been on medication for the better part of the past 16 years, and my first encounter with the mental health systems was 18 years ago, when I was only 10 years old."
10247,"I'm sick of the system, and I'm even more sick of medication."
10248,"The only medication I would consider would be for ADHD, because everything else tends to cloud my brain, and I have enough of that as it is."
10249,"It's frustrating me to no end, and I'd like to know what other meds I have a shot at."
10250,How should I go about doing this (I've heard of docs having a general reluctancy to prescribing heavy-duty anxiety meds)?
10251,"I've had about 18 months without much, and the last 8 months or so have been without any medication."
10252,"Hey there, (warning: this is long)

I'm 19, female, at a 4-year school a few hours away from home."
10253,"I have diagnosed GAD, and it's pretty severe."
10254,Hinders every aspect of my life.
10255,"The only supportive member of my family is my father, who tries to tell me that I'm not sick or insane, but he also has no confidence in my success outside of that (puts me down when I tell him about job applications, tells me my grades could be higher, ect)."
10256,"I'm on multiple medications, but I've been out of therapy for about a year and a half- I'm going to get into a domestic violence therapy thing to start up again."
10257,- I have a problem with learning to drive.
10258,"I have my permit, and I've been on the road a few times."
10259,"However, drivers in my area tend to be assholes, with no respect for a new driver."
10260,The roads are big and dense with traffic.
10261,"Accidents occur so often, we're used to them."
10262,"I was considering taking a driver's ed course over the summer, but I don't want to be in a vehicle with 16-year-olds who also don't know how to drive- it scares the shit out of me."
10263,"Also, I'd rather learn to drive upstate where I can be in a calmer environment...there isn't a driving school near my college, though."
10264,My option right now is basically to learn from my friends and boyfriend.
10265,Is this viable?
10266,I know that I'll need to know how to drive if I want to live and work.
10267,- It's in my best interest to move out of my parents' house as soon as possible.
10268,"I dorm right now, but vacations at home are hell."
10269,"Unfortunately, I need money to move out, and I'll need a job for money."
10270,I'll need a car for a job.
10271,Any ideas on how I can avoid home in the meantime?
10272,"- I can get a ton of positive feedback from people, and it won't mean a thing once my family tells me I won't get anywhere in life."
10273,"I'm always told not to get my hopes up, and that my grades could be so much better (I have a 3.5 cumulative, but my dad claims I can have a 3.8 if I put in all of my effort...I go at my own pace so I don't explode)."
10274,Any tips on countering that?
10275,I'll clarify anything.
10276,Thanks so much!
10277,Most recently I discussed with her the possibility of trying medication.
10278,"I have avoided medication up until now, but now I am at the point where my fears about medication no longer outweigh my desire to try it in the hopes that it will help me function."
10279,"She referred me to a prescriber who I met with recently, and I was prescribed Zoloft, and Xanax to supplement the transition into medication (and, I think, to give me an “oh-shit button”, should I need one)."
10280,So far I’m only on day 2 of meds and hoping to feel a difference in the coming weeks.
10281,"But because of my lifestyle changes, I have gained 50 pounds since starting the medication... :-("
10282,I got these same kind of headaches when I was off my meds for a for a long period time (like when I was lazy in get my refills).
10283,So it's been four months since I've been off the meds and I'm curious if I'm still dealing with the withdrawals or if this is some thing that I'm dealing with that had been suppressed when I was on the medication.
10284,I am on anti anxiety/depression medication (im not depressed).
10285,I stopped taking the meds and still feel drained and fatigued!
10286,I dont feel anxious with the feeling of dread anymore (thanks to the meds) but constantly so dam tired!
10287,"I am on meds (Effexor, Xanax as needed, both of them pretty low doses), and I do see a therapist."
10288,"These meds have worked WONDERS for my daily symptoms, but I still frequently have panic attacks that I simply can't come down with, or I have bad days where I have several severe panic attacks throughout the entire day."
10289,"I've started taking anti anxiety/depression meds, and they've definitely helped, but I still don't feel 'right'."
10290,"I have since calmed down, and have not taken my medicine."
10291,"I have been seeing a counselor, but am currently having trouble trying to get medication through my insurance."
10292,I was on meds for a while but once I got a good handle on it I stopped and was feeling quite a bit better than I had.
10293,"I have a doctors appointment Friday to go back on my meds, which I never wanted to do because I was doing well channeling my anxieties and started doing things I love again."
10294,"I've struggled with depression for over 10 years and when I was younger (10-11 years old) I was regularly seeing a mental health professional and taking medication for it, but for certain reasons related to pressure from my family, I stopped."
10295,I told my manager I was having anxiety and I was really dizzy and almost fainted and he let me sit in the office til my meds kicked in and my other manager volunteered to take care of my food running that I was supposed to be doing.
10296,I still take my medication but it seems my anxiety has grown.
10297,"Is it something I should go to the doctor for, or is their any over-the-counter medicine I could be taking to help a little?"
10298,"I'm so afraid to get medication as many people tell me that it's ruined their life, and have made them more of a depressed person."
10299,Will I be prescribed medication right away?
10300,It has even helped me to get out of panic attacks without resorting to medication!
10301,I believe my anxiety started when I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about 1 year ago.
10302,I guess it shocked me because I was 22 years old and a runner.
10303,I've tried 2 different medicines since then and now I'm on a beta blocker.
10304,I started the beta blocker because I started complaining about palpitations a month after I started taking blood pressure medicine (I quit the blood pressure medicine because it didnt work for me).
10305,I had a visible pulse in my neck and stomach.
10306,I am wondering if these palpitations started because of anxiety;  I never had them before.
10307,Fast forward to now.
10308,"I am starting graduate school tomorrow and I guess I have some worries about it, but I don't think about it every day."
10309,I don't really even consider myself to be an anxious person.
10310,"However, within the past month I've added a few more symptoms: feeling as if my throat is swollen/has a ball in it, my eyelids twitching, feeling a little bit unbalanced/dizzy, and being easily startled."
10311,Could my subconscious really be affecting my body so physically?
10312,"Also, does anybody else have these symptoms (ball in throat, eyelids twitching)?"
10313,"I'm really hoping I can get my life back to normal in time for school, because with all of these symptoms, I feel like I am nowhere near myself."
10314,I can't even drink coffee anymore (one of my old hobbies) without feeling like I'm going to faint if I drink more than one cup.
10315,I got medication for it.
10316,"I would not see doctors, consider medicine, etc."
10317,"However, I do not want to become dependent on medication."
10318,"I wanted to get a baseline of how I feel without meds, and then re-evauluate."
10319,I've been living with anxiety for years and years now.
10320,"Anytime I'd go to school, I'd be worried."
10321,"Anytime I met someone new, or even had a conversation with a stranger, I'd be worried."
10322,I don't want to be like this anymore.
10323,"I feel like whenever I have to meet someone new, or talk to a stranger, I get severe anxiety."
10324,I always wonder what this person will think of me.
10325,"I overthink new encounters, even those that are extremely brief and casual."
10326,This has lead me to be much less social.
10327,"I want to meet my friend's friends, and to go out and find a job."
10328,"I am just at the point where I'm invited to attend social events a lot more, and I need to find a job."
10329,"The idea of finding a job, doing the interview, and working every day with new people seems terrifying."
10330,"I've been living like this for 6 years, and I want to change."
10331,"I want to make new friends, and I want to find a new job and have a healthy relationship with my coworkers."
10332,"I want to live life, but my anxiety holds me back."
10333,"I've been thinking about seeing a doctor for anti-anxiety medication, but I don't want understand the medication enough."
10334,"I don't want know if I'd be on xanax everyday, or something like that, or other medications I have a history of substance abuse, and I don't know how that would go."
10335,Are there other medications besides things like that?.
10336,I just want help with this.
10337,"You guys must get posts like this every day, but any advice would be appreciated."
10338,"I'm at a point where I look to drinking most of the week to solve my problems, and I want to end it."
10339,"Therapy didn't, help medication didn't help."
10340,"I was on that for about a year and a half but (stupidly) decided to quit cold turkey my sophmore year of college, partly because I genuinely thought I didn't need it any more and partly because more than anything I want to be normal and not have to depend on medication or combat anxiety."
10341,"The Prednisone actually fucked me up so bad that it messed up my stomach lining and I had gastritis for a month, and had to take an acid reflux medicine."
10342,It's been about three months since this all started and I'm feeling just about as anxious and depressed as I was before I got put on medication for the first time.
10343,What SSRI/medicine helped you the most?
10344,"I have seen a shrink, it helped a bit, but I never took any medication, and he agrees that I should'nt, he says I should be able to overcome it without them."
10345,"I don't have anything else, exercise or medication, that can help me get through it."
10346,But my real problem was I didn't want to feel like I NEEDED medication to function.
10347,I quit drinking (mostly) since being on meds since that's a big no-no.
10348,I was not on any meds and was living alone and supporting myself and doing a job I hated and compulsively binge eating all my feelings and hating myself and pretending everything was fine.
10349,"Take care of yourself, get into therapy, switch up your meds, etc, do YOU."""
10350,"So with my meds (or condition, or whatever I don't know) I was very very antsy and spirally uncontrollable thoughts plagued me and I became cyclically high and low."
10351,"I don't know if I should contact my doctor about it and seek medication, as I'm.worried about getting the headaches again...

My anxiety has always driven me so close to the edge of insanity that I constantly think about suicide."
10352,"I get nervous around people, freak out before exams, and even worse anxiety with planes (before I'm even on the plane)."
10353,The plane thing is by far the worst one.
10354,"I've been on planes, particularly international flights of 12 hours or more, about twice a year for the past 6 or so years."
10355,"Before the flight, I begin to get nervous and think I need to use the bathroom and feel like I'll throw up."
10356,"I start to feel so bad I actually have stomach problems, and this is before I've even gotten on the flight."
10357,"I will often throw up on the flight AFTER landing, when I know I'm safe, usually after the seat belt light goes off and people get up."
10358,"After almost 3 years of college, I have started to have freak outs prior to exams, with similar stomach/nausea problems."
10359,"If I go out with friends, especially if we go eat somewhere, I have the same problems."
10360,"So, I think I have anxiety but I don't know if it's enough to actually call it a problem and even then I don't know if doctors are my best option."
10361,"As a college student, and with such normal triggers as mine, I'm bound to hear the ""try breathing"" ""just calm down"" and none of that is really helpful."
10362,"I don't want medication that's going to make me feel like a zombie, but I don't like this and I'm tired of it."
10363,"I was once prescribed ativan along with some anti-nausea medicine for an international flight, and it didn't work, so I'm also afraid to try all these medications, spend money, and find out they don't work."
10364,Any advice?
10365,Or anything?
10366,I just don't want to feel this anymore =(
10367,"Now I'm not sure if it's the medication or the anxiety thats giving me these problems, like I know I've had sexual side effects in the past so now I'm so nervous I won't be able to perform that that anxiety creates sexual problems on its own."
10368,"I know my meds needed to be changed anyways, but it could have been handled way better without me having to suffer like this."
10369,"The only medication I have here is lorazepam and I can't think well enough after taking it to do any work, something I realized at a really inopportune time."
10370,I know medication and therapy should be long term solutions but what about short term?
10371,It felt like it took a lot of effort to ask him for the meds.
10372,I've been putting off going back to him for my regular physical because I'll have to tell him why I stopped taking the meds.
10373,I work very hard with the help of meditation and medication to remain a functional and loving parent.
10374,"My medication doesn't seem to help, and I'm almost afraid to get put on something stronger, or change meds."
10375,"I've started to double up my meds, because I feel like I need them, however, they aren't anything fast-acting, just celexa....so doubling up doesn't really do anything quickly."
10376,My family thinks I don't need medication for having anxiety/depression.
10377,Ive been unemployed for about a month while the meds side effects slowed down and am going to a therapist on the tenth.
10378,I don't want to mask the symptoms with a medication and while I know in my heart I will be successful I also know it will take longer.
10379,I would love it if she were willing to try an SSRI or some medicine other than xanax (which as I understand only treats the symptoms).
10380,"I have Panic Anxiety, and as I'm fairly new to the whole medication thing, I asked my doctor for a situational medication to try to ease myself into it a little first."
10381,"Growing up when I would have a panic attack I was always told things like ""if you don't calm down we'll have to get medicine for you"", so medication for me is always difficult because I've come to view it as a bad thing, or along the lines of admitting ""I'm weak, because I need medicine to help me"" for a better explanation I guess??"
10382,"Either way, my medicine (Buspirone) so far helps, but I always have anxiety over taking the thing that is supposed to REDUCE my anxiety so I end up either taking forever to swallow it, or dont take it at all, which doesn't help me in any way."
10383,"Does anyone have any tips on what I can do to help out with this, or would getting a daily medication be a better option?"
10384,I'm debating speaking to my doctor to see if he can increase my dose of meds(275mg of Effexor) because they aren't really helping me anymore.
10385,"Since I started on this new medication, the violent thoughts I have are becoming more prominent."
10386,"I spent time with some friends, helped them brew some beer, and was able to open up about why I am on meds."
10387,"I now have a better support system I feel but after realizing my anxiety was getting worse again and that it was affecting not only myself but also those around me, I decided it was time to go back on the meds."
10388,"I'm a 21yof, living in the U.S and still very new to Reddit."
10389,I really just need to talk to someone right now.
10390,My heart is beating really fast and it won't let up.
10391,"I've tried everything that usually works-fresh air, drinking cold water, putting cold water on my face, fingertip touches, lying down, medication (Vistaril), calm music."
10392,It started this morning right as I walked into an annual appointment at the OBGYN.
10393,"My blood pressure is usually perfect, but was in the 145/90 range both times it was checked today around 9am and 930am."
10394,"I was already feeling very nervous and edgy today, which is odd."
10395,I'm usually able to manage my anxiety and talk myself out of panicking about being at the doctors.
10396,"After I was refused birth control because of my blood pressure, I started to just feel incredibly overwhelmed while at the same time trying to appear somewhat normal until I left."
10397,"From then on, things have only gotten worse."
10398,"I called my psych doctor to ask him what was going on, which was panic inducing enough because I'm always worried he'll try and admit me into the psych unit."
10399,"Stupidly about a year ago, I went to the emergency room after an attack and was hospitalized for a week."
10400,"It wasn't a bad experience, I'd even say it was one of the best things I've done for myself, but I don't want to ever return and definitely not against my will."
10401,"I'm rambling at this point, but I think I'm beginning to understand why people like to post Reddit rants so much."
10402,So I've been doing pretty well since being in there and have been diagnosed finally.
10403,"At first I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and learned pretty quick, after a few months of being treated under that diagnosis, that it wasn't right."
10404,"Now I'm treated for anxiety, usually social and occassionally panic inducing, ADHD, and general depression."
10405,Well my psych doctor thinks it's Straterra which I've been newly prescribed (about two months) in response to my now high adderall tolerance and my unwillingness to cave in and raise my dose from 60mg/day.
10406,"I tried the new 40mg dose of Straterra, up from my usual 25mg, as advised to do at my last appointment."
10407,"On the phone, my doctor blames the Straterra for my high blood pressure."
10408,He brushes off everything I tell him about how I'm feeling and tells me to take a couple Vistaril and go back down to my original dose of Straterra.
10409,"Vistaril has been a great medication for my ever day anxiety, but I haven't found any medication or alternative that can calm me down during an attack."
10410,"I don't know if anyone else does this, but I've spent the last hour on google searching high blood pressure and Straterra, as well as my other medications (Adderall, Depakote), and I'm still really scared."
10411,"My symptoms have decreased quite a bit since starting this post, but my heart is still beating fast and all I want is to stop feeling like I'm having a heart attack."
10412,I'd really appreciate any feedback.
10413,I'm willing to try just about anything to recover from feeling like this and quit wasting the day away.
10414,Does anyone here ever actually believe their anxiety is actually gone for good?
10415,It seems like just simply knowing about your anxiety leads to more anxiety; a never ending cycle.
10416,I feel so frustrated because I finally felt like I was winning the battle.
10417,"Yet here I am again lying in bed at 2pm, shaking hands, unable to sleep, nauseous and terrified, thinking way too deeply about my life which until this morning I was happy and optimistic about."
10418,"Now, I have no clue what I hoped to accomplish in writing this."
10419,Maybe I just needed to get my thoughts out.
10420,"Again, if you read this thank you and thanks ahead for anything you share with me; advice, personal stories, jokes, music..."
10421,I'm in therapy and on light medication for the time being.
10422,"I was buckled in for some withdrawal -- I remember forgetting a pill once and having a very difficult time the next day, back when I started on the meds about a year ago."
10423,"**TL;DR** I went off my meds unintentionally, feel pretty good."
10424,"I take meds for my nausea sometimes, but not specifically anxiety."
10425,"I talked to my doctor a few months ago and he said that he doesn't think I need anxiety meds, and I agreed because I thought I was getting way better and I am( at one point boys period made me uncomfortable whether it was intimate or not."
10426,"I was diagnosed with GAD, Depression and Agoraphobia by my very trusted family doctor, and have been receiving medication, and ADHD by a different psychiatrist."
10427,Now the anxiety attacks are very scarce yet I feel like It doesn't matter me taking the meds if something is wrong with me.
10428,I have GAD and used to take medication for it.
10429,I don't want to get back on medication.
10430,"I used to take meds (citalopram), and it just didn't work for me."
10431,"First time posting here, so I supposed a quick break down of my issues would make sense."
10432,I was diagnosed with anxiety in first year university.
10433,"I am the only member of my family who had, at that point, attended a post secondary education."
10434,So that put way more pressure on me than I feel like some other first year uni students may have been dealt.
10435,"(I am not saying that my life or condition was overall worse than everyone else's, I am simply trying to paint a quick picture of my situation for you all)."
10436,I knew something was wrong with me when waking up even 5 minutes later than I planned before a class would send me in a complete melt down.
10437,"I am talking hyperventilating, spazzing, and getting sick, even before fully waking up."
10438,Another big sign that made my family take me for a doctor's appointment was how I started developing social anxieties which made me become a hermit.
10439,"Considering this was first year uni, the time most people are at their busiest socially / most adventurous, I actually missed out on a lot of 'staples' of being a freshman."
10440,It really became noticeable when I would panic at the sheer thought of walking past the front door.
10441,"I had been put on Zolof, I can't remember the dosage, but had to stop taking it after 4 months or so."
10442,"The reason for that was because though I did find that it helped with the 'lows' (the frequency and severity of my panic attacks; which I sometimes refer to as 'episodes'), it made me unable to feel any 'highs' as well, putting me a mental state that I referred to as ""robotic me""."
10443,"My doctor then put me on Cipralex, which I really liked and was on for about a year, until suddenly my ability to keep a regular pill taking routine became impossible."
10444,"I started getting anxious about taking the pill, because it was rarely on time and I was worried more for the sickening side effects rather than the curing properties of my meds."
10445,"I think it is also poignant to know that I have a very weak immune system, and since starting first year of uni (I am now in my fifth, and last, year of school), I have had two dozen or so instances when something as simple as a regular flu bug has knocked me over for weeks at a time, developing weird symptoms such as skin discoloration (my whole body turned into off purple, leopard-print like spots, which the doctors had zero explication for)."
10446,"During the times where I would be sick, I would be violently ill, lose massive amounts of weight at a time, and having to stop attending school (which if you can remember, was the first thing that started my anxiety attacks)."
10447,"So currently, I am off my meds, which I know will be bashed by a few of you, but I felt that if I could try and find non-medical alternatives to my anxiety, I would lead a happier/healthier life."
10448,"And since having met and moving in with my boyfriend, I have found that I have made some good steps in living with anxiety without being dependent on medications."
10449,What I am hoping reddit can help me with today is in regards to my body's horrible affliction with muscles spasms during anxiety attacks.
10450,"Today I have been really sick (stomach bug) which made me have to cancel a shift at work, adding to the stress of trying to get better."
10451,"During my peaks of episodes, my body starts developing twitches and spasms that for anyone who didn't know me, would assume I had turrets."
10452,"If my legs are pinned or unable to swing around, I become more anxious and actually have to fight for breath, making horrible grunting noises that again, parallel what sounds I have heard come out of turret's patients."
10453,None of these twitches affect any other part of my body besides my legs and breathing.
10454,"I was hoping that some of you out there have experienced similar tendencies, and could offer some support for a fellow Redditor."
10455,"I apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes, as I am writing this in a bit of a hurry."
10456,Looking forward to hearing any/all responses.
10457,SF
10458,"Planning to go to the docs tomorrow and get talking to them, i don't want to start and meds."
10459,My main concern about being on medication for anxiety is that if I get on it what would happen when I get off it.
10460,Please if anyone has been on medication and have gotten off it was is it like?
10461,If not medication do you have any suggestions on maybe naturally coping with this.
10462,"  
  My mind is constantly wondering how I am here."
10463,"I obsess on thoughts about time and space, the thoughts cause me to panic."
10464,It's gotten better over the years but every now and then I still get those thoughts and It's awful.
10465,"My medication helped at first but now, not so much."
10466,I feel like everything is just a dream.
10467,I wonder how the body works and how things are actually here.
10468,How anybody is here.
10469,I used to be terrified to fall asleep and sometimes still am for fear that I won't wake up.
10470,Slightly off that subject.
10471,I huge part of my anxiety is driving.
10472,Especially alone.
10473,I panic really bad.
10474,I just got used to driving in my hometown of Florida but now I relocated to Hawaii and I can't even drive on a highway.
10475,"Just being alone with my thoughts is scary, being in traffic is scary, I have to control my breathing and try and keep myself occupied at lights."
10476,Lights are the worst.
10477,I don't understand.
10478,I don't understand where this came from.
10479,I know this is kind of all over the place.
10480,Hopefully someone knows what I mean.
10481,I've been on so many different medications to try and ease all of this.
10482,I'm on my way to being on none know :) Though these thoughts are still very hard to shake.
10483,"Is anyone else going through this, I really feel like I'm the only one."
10484,"Thanks for reading
Sorry for the length"
10485,"I have been off meds for around 4 months and my anxiety is starting to creep back up on me, but I am tired of taking these every day."
10486,I've resorted to taking a small dose of Lorazepam to take the edge off but I'm fighting getting on meds.
10487,She knows I'm on medication that makes me feel bad and that I have generalised anxiety but she seems to think its her.
10488,"I finally went to the ER the second night, was given some meds, and instructed to go to my gp."
10489,"Sorry guys, this might be long.. but I really need some input.."
10490,It's driving me mad.
10491,This happens over the last month and I cannot tell you how much I have changed over these 30 days.. in some case for good and in some case for worse.
10492,"A bit of a background story... about a year ago I started my first job (im a graphic designer, and it's a very stressful job.. the work hours are too much and too varied.)."
10493,That time I used to smoke up/drink a lot.
10494,Then around November I started having heartburns.. which I used to confuse for heart attacks cause by my smoking up.. so (i think) I developed a bit of hypochhondriac mentality.. very brief..
10495,In december..
10496,I had a panic attack because of a strong heartburn pain and we rushed to the hospital where the doctors just told me it was stress related and nothing to worry about.
10497,That day I stopped smoking up.
10498,"Never thought that I would, but i did."
10499,From that moment on to a month ago..
10500,I continued life normally..
10501,I had heartburns; but I now knew that it wasn't heart related.
10502,But still was a tiny bit afraid.. used to get a bit tensed over tiny insignificant pains.
10503,So about a month ago; I was at the cinema with my parents watching a movie and I started feeling a bit of butterflies in my stomach/chest.. and I started panicking and then I had a borderline panic attack.
10504,I was just restless and nauseous.
10505,"The next day, after dinner I had severe burning sensation in my stomach which got better only after I puked my dinner out."
10506,We went to the doctor.. who straightaway said that it was all stress related; but still gave me medicines for a mild gastritis; and he also gave me anxit (.25 alprazolam) to be taken whenever I got those mild restless feelings.
10507,"I avoided taking them because i did not want to be on medications for my mental health.. i wanted to cure it out naturally, but did take them once in 4-5 days."
10508,I used to feel tense and restless and anxious every 1-2 days and puking made me feel better.
10509,A month later i've gotten all my stomach related tests done; and it seems that there is nothing wrong with my stomach or liver or kidneys or gall bladder etc.
10510,etc.
10511,which have led me to the conclusion that it's either acidity related or something or it really is anxiety.
10512,"I've not been drinking or smoking cigarettes for a month now (again something that i thought i couldnever do.. but because i was so worried; it was really easy quitting these things)

I'm an Indian; so instead of the usual spicy and the excessive meat.. i've been eating non spicy and non fattening food."
10513,I've been trying deep breathing.
10514,But there's this slight tension in mind that keeps popping up every now and then.
10515,"(However, i do have a pretty non physical life.. hardly any excercise."
10516,The most physical thing i do is drive for 3 hours a day while commuting for work.)
10517,I am sleeping fine.. 7-8 hours.
10518,"So since 3 weeks, when these feelings of butterflies in the chest and stomach.. sometimes spiralling into negative thoughts.. **basically being afraid of 'becoming a person with anxiety'** have just let my general mood very low."
10519,I pop one anxit once.. and feel good for the day and probably 2-3 days after it.
10520,Then again it comes... then again I take one.
10521,Last week I took one pill on monday and felt almost fine the entire week.. ( i just had a mild panic moment on thursday and it was all fine after vomitting.)..
10522,then on this monday again i felt it coming back and had one.
10523,It just keeps coming and going and is generally absent when im distracted with work.. but the fact that it's there really worries me.
10524,I'm yet to have a proper panic attack like you guys describe here.. but i'm worried that this condition will slowly grow and become worse.
10525,"I used to think of myself as a mentally strong and an intelligent person, but this month has just taken away some of my self confidence."
10526,I have a lot of friends.. great friends; a very understanding family; I have absolutely no bad past event that could actually be a trigger for this too.
10527,I guess im just worried about getting anxiety?
10528,"On a positive note, this anxiety has however made me get rid of the hypochondriac mentality i had."
10529,I'm not afraid of any pains in my body now; im just afraid (or rather worried.. afraid is too strong of a word) of this mental bug I have got.
10530,My mum says that we should go to a psychiatrist if im too worried.
10531,"---
--- 

What do I do guys?"
10532,What is happening?
10533,Sorry for the long post; but Please help.
10534,My sister is getting married in a month and I want to be a 'naturally' happy brother at the wedding.
10535,Thanks.
10536,ps.
10537,i was feeling tensed when I started writing this; but feeling a lot better now having let it off my chest.
10538,"I've been to my GP several times, where they put me on different kinds of medication and I had at least four blood tests in the past year, but nothing came back and the medication only made things worse."
10539,I am thinking it is time to go off my medication but it makes me a little nervous because I don't want to end up where I started...
10540,Has anybody quit Citalopram cold turkey and had a successful experience?
10541,I know very well you are supposed to ween off it but I have a drug test on Monday and I don't want it to show up.
10542,I took my last pill Thursday morning so it has now been 2 days without it.
10543,So far all I've had is dizziness and nausea today but I can deal with that.
10544,"Basically, I'd like to know If there are any supplements or tricks that will get me through the withdrawal."
10545,"I'm only on 20 mg, which I've been taking for about a year."
10546,My drug test is for a job as a flight attendant which is my DREAM JOB.
10547,I know they probably won't test for it but I don't want to take ANY chances.
10548,I also have to fill out a form with all my medical history and any medications I'm taking...I don't want to have to lie so quitting cold turkey seems to be my only choice.
10549,"Any insight is appreciated, thanks."
10550,I stopped taking it because I didn't feel like it was doing too much anymore and I'm still conflicted about relying on medicine.
10551,I would like to find a way to not be on medicine but therapy is expensive and the only therapist I've had a good experience with charges $200 per session.
10552,"I don't see my therapist until the 2nd, and I JUST started my medication (ambilify) for PTSD + BP + Anxiety (I was on meds for this but took myself off)."
10553,"However the pollen count is low, and asthma medication does not alleviate the symptoms whatsoever."
10554,Well... made an appointment with my PCP about medication.
10555,"I live alone and I'm afraid that this medicine could end up doing more harm than anything else, and I won't be able to get help."
10556,I just started my anxiety medication today probably two hours ago.
10557,Can I hear some awesome success stories after starting medication to help calm me down?
10558,I don't want to be dependent on meds again.
10559,what does medication actually do?
10560,"So, should I go on medication?"
10561,"I ***really*** am hesitant about taking medication, mainly because I don't want to be dependent on it and I don't want to be known as the pill-popper."
10562,I should also mention that I'm pretty anti prescription medication for the most part.
10563,"She has been pushing me more towards meds that you take everyday that have to build up in your system rather than the Xanax (that she describes as ""just a band-aid"")."
10564,I wanted others opinion on these type of anxiety meds.
10565,"My last panic attack I believe, along with my doctor, was a result of lowering the dosage on my medication."
10566,"I was great for most of that time, but the last 4 months have been progressively getting worse due to job stress, life stress, and probably just going so long without counseling/meds."
10567,Should I expect to be on medication?
10568,When I woke up I knew for sure that it was that I missed a dosage of meds.
10569,TL;DR: Make sure you take your meds as directed.
10570,I feel as if my anxiety is keeping e from being an independent person and I'm not sure how else to cope aside from taking my medication.
10571,I've also been reading a lot about this medication and people's experiences with it.
10572,"While I fully understand that everyone's reaction to a medication are completely different and there's no way to determine how its going to affect me until I take it, I'm really nervous."
10573,"I don't want this medication to make everything worse, and I'm really afraid of that happening."
10574,I'm kind of wondering if I should just try counseling first before taking the medication.
10575,Would medication even really help?
10576,I did my 12 hours and tried to sleep after taking the medication and I wasn't able to get to sleep for several hours.
10577,"She asked if I would be willing to try another medication, I told her possibly, but I was very leery after what had happened."
10578,She told me how proud the doctor was of me to be willing to consider trying another medication and how happy they were for me for seeking treatment.
10579,I seriously considered going to the ER to get some emergency anxiety medication so I can calm down and sleep.
10580,"I've seen bipolar disorder before and know for a fact I don't have it, and don't want to be given even more medication that will fuck me up even worse."
10581,This medication and treatment thing is all very new to me.
10582,I always get super nervous before taking new meds for the first time.
10583,Well I can't sleep because my mind is just racing and on top of that I'm having doubts about this medicine because I'm afraid to take it.
10584,im having all thee irrational thoughts like I'll have an allergic reaction to it or I'll fall asleep and die because the medicine is too strong.
10585,"I practice yoga almost everyday (which has been a huge stress relief) and adopted a vegan lifestyle a year ago, I still see my therapist, but don't need to as often as I used to, and I still take medication: Klonopin .625 mg a day."
10586,"I had a bad reaction to some medication about 3 months ago, steroid psychosis."
10587,"During the school year, I considered going on medication for depression."
10588,"What I want to know is, for anyone who took anxiety medication, did it help you cope with your relationships?"
10589,"In the end you just give up, and hope your daily dose of medication will start working soon, so that maybe you'll get something done today."
10590,They even doubled my meds!
10591,Is there any meds that can help me?
10592,I did *not* think that medication would help so much.
10593,*Don't* rely on meds to fix your problems.
10594,"However, it's been nearly 2 weeks since I've completely stopped taking it as I don't want to have to rely on medication."
10595,"I would like to know people's experience on switching medications, how it is done and what you experienced."
10596,I am currently on 150mg of Effexor XR (vanlafaxine) and would like to switch to another medication as my husband and I are trying to get pregnant.
10597,I suffer from panic disorder and am yet to see an psychiatrist to receive advice on what my options on other medications are.
10598,I have been on and off Effexor 3 times and haven't had much of a bad experience but I would like to stay on some sort of  safer medication during and after pregnancy.
10599,Any advice or your experiences in similar situations would be greatly appreciated.
10600,"First off, the bottom line: I want to try medication."
10601,What kind of anxiety relieving medication can I take which doesn't require a prescription?
10602,not on meds presently.
10603,I'd rather not see a therapist or take medicine.
10604,"However, if medicine is an only option I'd rather over the counter."
10605,Does anyone else here have experience with this medication?
10606,"A friend of mine has social anxiety (she is seeing a therapist as far as I know, and on medication) though she's been blocking out all of her friends, including me."
10607,"I am a college student writing her English Composition 300 research paper about alternative treatments for generalized anxiety, and other disorders such as OCD."
10608,"If you are a diagnosed with any anxiety disorder, it would be more than amazing if you could answer a few questions."
10609,I get extra credit on this 300 point paper if I include a survey as a part of my research.
10610,"What kind of anxiety disorder do you have, if not generalized anxiety?"
10611,What medications have you been prescribed?
10612,Are they successful in treating your symptoms?
10613,"If not, why?"
10614,What symptoms do you experience that led you to be diagnosed?
10615,Do you use alternative methods to sooth your symptoms?
10616,"If so, please describe them."
10617,Your answers are greatly appreciated.
10618,"Not only will this help my grade, but it will help me cope with my own anxiety as well."
10619,I will quote some answers in my paper with author's permission.
10620,Should I stick it out with the CBT or is it time to see a psychiatrist and try looking into medication?
10621,I'm extremely scared of medication and would like to stay away but i'm starting to feel like it may be my only option.
10622,I've been on meds but I avoid them as much as I can to prevent dependency.
10623,I've gotten my blood pressure into normal levels and came off of my blood pressure medication (I was 142/94 in January and 117/79 today) .
10624,I have posted previously about my relationship problems and medication questions.
10625,I'm not on meds right now but I'm seeing a psychologist.
10626,I've never been on anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medication before and I'm not sure what to expect.
10627,"What I'm confused about is right after he told me he didn't think depression was much of an issue, he prescribed me 1 20mg tab of Paxil per day for 30 days, telling me that it would help with my anxiety and insomnia..according to my research, this is a medication used to treat severe depression, and the side effects are what happen to cause drowsiness and anxiety relief."
10628,"I tried to stay away from medication to help with this problem (foolish pride), but I realized that maybe this is more serious than I would like to admit."
10629,"Does anybody out there have experience with this medication, and is there any other methods I can use to help with this anxiety?"
10630,"I didn't take the other drugs but I figured I keep them around for when I really needed them - if I was in a really bad place and needed to feel better immediately and for some reason had run out of my medication (ativan) and/or needed something stronger or, more honestly - decided to kill myself."
10631,"It was explained to me that ALL SSRI's are ineffective or do the opposite of what antidepressants or anti anxiety medications are supposed to do, due to my null variant of this gene/(genotype)?"
10632,I have tried numerous medications and I don't like any of them due to the side affects or the non help that they give.
10633,Anybody else in a similar situation?
10634,Is there any way I could calm myself down enough to stop the shaking without medication( I don’t take medication now).
10635,"I know that there are misconceptions with meds- that they a personal failing, that they just suppress your emotions and make you feel numb, that they always have tons of side effects."
10636,Is there something I can do to help prevent these things and get better without medication?
10637,We are taking steps (he got a Rx for meds - something we've talked about for awhile) and we're revisiting therapy.
10638,"Dr recently prescribed me Zoloft for anxiety and stability, first time ever on medication."
10639,"However, that resulted in constant tiredness and me falling asleep all the time, so my doctor is weaning me off of Citalopram and putting me on new medication that'll hopefully not sedate me."
10640,How many times did you have to switch medication until you go the right one?
10641,"I'm worried it's just going to keep compounding if I don't do something about it, but cannot afford therapy and want absolutely nothing to do with medication."
10642,"I'm very tempted to visit my doctor to ask for medication, but I'd love to know if anyone has any really good advice for tackling anxiety when you're living alone."
10643,Specific meds may be different here but I'm not sure.
10644,They've been supportive; I'm visiting with a psychiatrist next week to get a prescription for medication.
10645,"It seems like ever since Christmas, I've been ramped up to 11."
10646,"The moments I feel ""normal"" are few and far between."
10647,It's a complete juxtaposition of how I think I SHOULD feel (generally normal with anxiety episodes instead of my current situation of constant worry with moments of normalcy).
10648,I'm scared I can't/won't get better.
10649,I'm scared I'm going to be put on medication for the rest of my life.
10650,I'm a craft beer nut.
10651,I home brew and take about 2 vacations a year to beer destinations like the San Diego and San Francisco.
10652,I'm scared that anxiety medications would end the hobby that has greatly enriched my life.
10653,I'm scared that I'll be dealing with this forever and the combination of the fear and the prospect of never getting better has almost crippled me.
10654,I'm typing this at work trying to hold back the tears.
10655,"I know rationally it'll all be okay and everything will work out, but every future I can see from where I'm sitting is a future I don't want to live in."
10656,"Is there any hope to be ""normal"" ever again?"
10657,Or is the future a constant strain of trying to balance medications and giving up on one of my life's greatest pleasures.
10658,The meds don't seem to help this.
10659,I stopped my anxiety medication and everything seemed fine.
10660,"I've been off meds for six months, but I've been crying every day for over a year and have been really miserable."
10661,I've had so many issues with meds in the past that I just don't know if it's worth it.
10662,That is so frustrating the fact that the medication makes me feel worse than i was before.
10663,"I do not have my father amongst my contacts, but I fear that if he hears word of me putting up a rainbow profile pic (I'm a staunch supporter of tolerance, having been almost completely shunned by my ""family""), he'll actually think I'm gay and cut all ties with me, including stopping providing the medication, which I cannot afford to finance."
10664,So I've been looking for a job recently and out of the blue my friend got me in touch with a job place to get me a position at some office.
10665,"The job place I have to drive to for a preliminary interview, it only involves some highway driving and I have been there before so I am not too worried."
10666,"There is a back way I can go which only takes a bit longer, I'm on and off the highway in less than 60 seconds."
10667,But the actual job I start at the end of this week is a 45+ minute drive on the same highway.
10668,"I'd say it's nearly 20 minutes further down the highway than this place, and at one point I have to merge onto another highway (going the wrong way will take me way out of the way)."
10669,"After that it's driving down further on another highway until I eventually get to the town, and then I have to find the place."
10670,THEN I have to find my way back home at the end of the work day.
10671,"Between the stress of waking up much earlier, adjusting to a new job and getting to the place, I am a huge mess."
10672,This sounds **terrifying** to me.
10673,"Let me give you a bit of background: I am 27, male, no medications."
10674,I've always been an OK driver and I usually do better the more times I have taken a particular route.
10675,"But highways have always made me very anxious and depressed and scared, even if I have been on that route before."
10676,I have to admit I always avoid them and they are probably the only legitimate phobia I have besides dentists (another phobia I reluctantly face).
10677,"In either of the cases of highways or dentists, I almost always have to bring someone with me or I completely lose it."
10678,"There are times I have had to tough it out with highway driving and I just do it, but I never feel better, and what's worse, I **never actually get better at highway driving**."
10679,I am never sure of my driving.
10680,I actually feel like I drift.
10681,I go too slow sometimes.
10682,I have a very real problem with making split second decisions (should I merge now?
10683,Will I crash?)
10684,"or reading signs or understanding exits, signs, lanes and U-turns until I have missed them- and then I get even MORE confused and nervous."
10685,"The strange thing is that I have driven on highways dozens of times in my life, sometimes completely alone, sometimes in the pouring rain, but I suppose I never did it consistently enough to get used to it."
10686,"It's very hard for other people, even family members, to understand where I'm coming from."
10687,"I have had a driving gap for the past few years until very recently as I didn't have my own car for a while, so I only back into driving last week."
10688,I'm going to test drive on the highway (I did today) as much as I can for the next few days with someone coming with me but I really need any help I can get to make this safer and more relaxed for me...please help.
10689,I'm trying to go without medication but if I can't get this under control I'm going to go back to a new medication that my doctor prescribed me.
10690,I'm a 20 year old male that's enrolled in college but didn't attend last semester or this up coming semester due to anxiety (I'm on a planned educational leave while I try to get some help).
10691,I currently see a therapist once a week and have a doctor to help with medication.
10692,"I was mainly wondering if I should see a different doctor for prescription help, but this may be normal behavior from a doctor, I have no idea and live on my own so I have no one to really ask."
10693,"My current prescribing doctor has been prescribing anti-depressants, which so far have all given me bad side-effects."
10694,He hasn't tried to prescribe anything to help with my 2-3 daily anxiety attacks or anything to help with my insomnia which has become increasingly worse to where I average about 2 hours of sleep a night.
10695,He refuses to prescribe new medications or see me in between appointments and won't set up any appointments sooner than 2 months apart.
10696,I've been seeing him for about 8 months but have only seen him 3 times.
10697,"Each time I recieve a new medication, I have fairly severe side-effects almost immediately and after a phone call, he will tell me to stop taking said medication but will not try anything else until I come back into his office 2 months later."
10698,After 8 months I have only been able to try 3 medications and after this next semester I will not be able to take another semester off for medical reasons.
10699,Is this normal behavior from a prescribing doctor?
10700,"I am desperate enough to want to try medication, though I'm the weird type of person who doesn't even like to take mild painkillers for headaches."
10701,And when did you decide enough was enough and that the embarassment of medication was worth a chance of improved quality of life?
10702,Has anybody regretted starting medication because they realized their medication wasnt that bad after all?
10703,"I thought the medicine would help me focus, and it did."
10704,"He has told me that when he was younger, about 11, his stepmom made him to go a Doctor and they put him on all sorts of meds that “zombiefied” him."
10705,"I do hope I get A job, I would like to go back to counseling and get off my meds (10mg paxil, ain't doin shit."
10706,"He dosn't know I went to counciling and am on meds, so he assumes it's just shyness."
10707,"heres the thing though, im already on meds."
10708,I find that Benadryl or Dramamine help calm my anxiety and nausea excellently.
10709,I was wondering if taking one of these daily for extended periods would be bad for my health.
10710,I get nauseous when I'm nervous and I discovered that Dramamine or Benadryl (they're pretty similar chemically) help to relieve it.
10711,I only ever take the single recommended dose once maybe twice a day.
10712,I have been doing this for a few months.
10713,Its non-addicting and I don't feel in anyway dependent on it.
10714,It just seems to help.
10715,"I also do not use them for sleep, just for my anxiety induced nausea."
10716,"I think Dramamine/Benadryl are just basically anti-histamines right, so they couldn't be that bad could they?"
10717,I don't want to try any prescription medications as I've heard that these can be very addicting and have bad side effects.
10718,Is taking Benadryl/Dramamine daily for my anxiety/nausea bad for my health in the long term?
10719,I don't really want to mess it up and say something and have them put me on meds that I don't need...or don't give me meds I do need.
10720,Was on meds for the last 10 years but I don't think they really helped and may have made things worse.
10721,"Ideally, I'd like to get through the flight on my own -without meds, but I'm probably going to have to take something."
10722,I took daily medicine then I weaned myself off and have been anxiety free for about a year.
10723,"I know that the label says not to drink, but I've seen that on pretty much all medication and I've never had anything go wrong before."
10724,I wanted to ask those who are/were on medication for anxiety/depression related issues.
10725,"For example, I've heard many say that the initial onset of the medication taking hold feels quite awful with those experiencing a lot of lows, suicidal thoughts, lack of energy/motivation...etc."
10726,"I am not on any meds, I've only tried Citalopram for like 2 days and it made my jaw clench up so I stopped taking it."
10727,"Feel free to take some medication beforehand like Xanax, if you're prescribed."
10728,A quick google search indicates that extreme anxiety HAS been experienced by some people following this medication and it takes about 6 months for your body to fully rid itself of it.
10729,I know you aren't supposed to use Xanax regularly and I know different medication is required for general anxiety.
10730,Not sure if was due to medication or some other non-obvious reason.
10731,I know she's taken some kind of anxiety medication as long as I can remember.
10732,"Then, recently, it became known to me recently that my mother is also taking a low dose of medication for anxiety."
10733,"Also, are all anxiety meds 'take as needed'?"
10734,"Hello, I just wanted to rant."
10735,I've never been one to talk about things but now everything is starting to affect my life.
10736,"Background, I've never been diagnosed with anxiety."
10737,I don't take any medicine.
10738,Never seen a therapist.
10739,This is about to change and I'm scared.
10740,My girlfriend wants me to see a therapist as my thought process is affecting our relationship.
10741,She said she can't handle it anymore as its too exhausting.
10742,She thinks I have anxiety.
10743,I guess I will be seeing soon.
10744,"Rant time,

I just wish someone could understand the hell that I go through everyday."
10745,On the outside I seem normal and like I have control.
10746,I would say I've done fairly well at controlling it.
10747,But I have now lost control.
10748,A new job has destroyed me.
10749,It pays wells but I hate it.
10750,"But without it, my girlfriend and I can't survive as she recently left her job as it was too hard for her with her anxiety."
10751,Now I feel stuck.
10752,I feel trapped.
10753,I feel like if I leave this job I will disappoint everyone.
10754,Logically I know this is untrue...but my mind won't listen to logic.
10755,I'm having to work long days and I have not time to distress and let myself be free from it all.
10756,Those days are when I freaked out the most.
10757,I am dependent on my SO.
10758,She helps me calm down and those days I didn't get to see her.
10759,And lately she can't handle me so now I feel like I lost the last little bit of control without her.
10760,She assures me she will try but then my thought process takes control.
10761,"""i am stressing her."
10762,I need to give her space.
10763,i can't rely on her.
10764,"She's going to leave me if I don't stop."""
10765,This is my issue.
10766,My hell.
10767,All day I'm plagued by multitude of thoughts.
10768,I am constantly afraid.
10769,Afraid with now reason.
10770,My mind goes into terrible side tracks.
10771,"While I'm driving ""what if I get into an accident?"
10772,What if I'm late for work.
10773,I'll get hurt.
10774,I'll get fire.
10775,"Then I'll hurt my loved ones."""
10776,While I'm at work.
10777,"""My boss is going to fire me."
10778,My work won't be finished in time.
10779,I can't handle all of this.
10780,I hate my job.
10781,I don't wanna be here.
10782,"My coworkers won't like me."""
10783,"When I cant get a hold of my girlfriend ""she must be ignoring me."
10784,What if she's cheating.
10785,I'm pushing her away.
10786,She's going to find someone who's normal who won't stress her.
10787,She's falling out of love.
10788,She's upset that I'm calling her.
10789,She's upset because I rely on her and I can't handle myself.
10790,She hates me when I do this.
10791,She wants to be away.
10792,I m being Nuerotic again.
10793,Now she's mad because I'm Nuerotic.
10794,I can't stop this and I don't know what to do.
10795,I can't talk to her since this upsets her.
10796,"If I upset her, she will want to leave me more."
10797,Why can't I be normal.
10798,"""."
10799,"When plans don't go my way ""what is happening."
10800,Why would someone Change their plans.
10801,Did I do something wrong.
10802,What am I going to do.
10803,Am I upsetting them.
10804,I'm being Nuerotic again.
10805,This is unjustified.
10806,Someone's going to notice.
10807,They are going to judge me.
10808,They will be mad.
10809,They won't be my friend.
10810,Why can't I see logic.
10811,"I know I'm being I Am being unrational but can't stop."""
10812,I get headaches I start to shake.
10813,I cry when I lose control.
10814,I get upset at the fact I can't control myself.
10815,If its really bad I can't breathe.
10816,I get sick.
10817,But rarely do I get that far.
10818,I sweat and yet I feel cold.
10819,I'm happy with my life.
10820,I am better off than others.
10821,I have a girl who loves me and friends who care.
10822,I have many opportunities.
10823,I just worry.
10824,A lot.
10825,All the time.
10826,Every day all day.
10827,I can't stop worrying.
10828,I'm afraid to seek help as my dad drilled into me that I'm not to get help.
10829,He would get upset when I didn't get an A in school.
10830,He would get upset if I asked for help.
10831,It's now drilled into me that I can't ask for help.
10832,"But for her, I have to."
10833,I will go to a therapist.
10834,I will try cognitive behavioral if possible.
10835,I will not take medicine.
10836,It's not my thing.
10837,I have too many bad experiences with friends and family on different psychology medicines.
10838,I don't like the side effects.
10839,This is my personal choice but understand others do benefit from medicine.
10840,I'm still afraid though.
10841,Last night my girlfriend said she was unhappy with our relationship at the moment.
10842,Logical me says we just need to work on it.
10843,I need to address what's bothering her and that all couples experience some problems.
10844,No two people are the same so it's going to happen so often.
10845,But what really goes on in my head?
10846,That I'm destroying things.
10847,That she resents me and is looking for a way out.
10848,That she won't stay long as I've been too exhausting for her.
10849,That ill never be able to fix things.
10850,That she's seeking others attention as I'm not able to give her what she needs.
10851,This is why I need help.
10852,I need to see a therapist.
10853,I have to tell myself that I shouldn't worry all the time.
10854,Normal people don't Allow these thoughts to control their emotions.
10855,That its okay to get help.
10856,It's okay and I'm not a bad person.
10857,I just need help and that is okay.
10858,TL;DR: I worry too much and it's destroying parts of my life.
10859,"When I was in fifth grade, out of nowhere I began having horrible anxiety whenever I wasn't with my mother."
10860,"Not like afraid something's going to happen, but just couldn't handle her not being with me."
10861,"I had no family issues, I never had the anxiety before, and I had no traumatic experiences before."
10862,"I saw a psychiatrist, got medicine, and generally started feeling better until one of the medicines started causing me to imagine violent things (not hallucinate, just imagine)."
10863,I ended up going to a psychiatric/mental hospital and only spent 22 hours there until the doctors cleared me.
10864,"Since then I have had absolutely no problems and am fifteen now (yeah, I know, I'm young), until I got with this girl."
10865,"She was perfect: she was pretty, cool, and fun to be around."
10866,However she and I were completely different in personality and she liked the things i hate.
10867,"But most importantly, she did not want to be around me in public (her brothers went to the same school as us) and so we never really did anything at school or outside of school except when we'd meet in a stair well."
10868,We couldn't really talk because then the teachers in the rooms next to us would hear us so we'd just sit there in in silence and kiss.
10869,We did this for a year and a month.
10870,"The only times I ever really ""talked"" to her were by texts, which would be late into the night, every night."
10871,It wasn't the most enjoyable relationship and I really wasn't too happy.
10872,"She broke up with me three separate times but got back together very shortly after until I finally said ""No, I'm done."""
10873,"It's been over a year now, the break up wasn't too hard on me and I got with a new girl that is really fun and isn't afraid to stand beside me in public."
10874,Everything was going perfectly fine until all of the sudden I started missing my old girlfriend.
10875,"Not like in a remenisent or friendly way, but in a I need to see her now way."
10876,I started freaking out and sometimes can't stop thinking of her.
10877,It only happens as I go to sleep and leaves when I wake up.
10878,I don't love her anymore but I feel as though she is the only part of my life.
10879,I haven't told anyone this before and really just hope it goes away.
10880,It hurts sometimes thinking about her because I know she doesn't love me anymore and I know I wasn't happy at all but I still get true feeling and I can't shake it off.
10881,Any advice?
10882,I have been to counselling and CBT to help myself get through everyday life and for the most part it has really helped- I refuse to be on medication however due to a bad past experience and I personally believe I can work through the problems with enough brain power.
10883,"(That is not to say anyone who IS on medication doesn’t have the brain power, it is a personal thing for me."
10884,I would urge anyone to try medication if they believe they really want it and their doctors give them the option.)
10885,Edit: Not sure but I think it's because of my anti anxiety medication.
10886,"This is what I know though
- I forgot to take my thyroid medicine for a few days so may have gone hyperthyroid a bit
- I have had a lot of caffeine today
- I am exhausted from a long trip

My mind is worrying this is not going to end."
10887,"I have been looking for a new job while still doing my freelance work, I have enrolled in a local community college (I dropped out of the University that I had been going to 2 years ago because of severe anxiety), my boyfriend and I are looking for an apartment, and I have also started taking medication for my GAD."
10888,I've struggled with depression and generalized anxiety disorder my whole life.
10889,I'm a 28 year old female.
10890,Not currently on any medications and have been on a waiting list for a publicly funded therapist for 8 weeks now.
10891,"Lately the anxiety has been coming in waves, followed by bouts of pretty bad depression."
10892,"I can feel a ""cycle"" coming on."
10893,"I woke up with that feeling in my chest... that uncomfortable ""tickle"" in my chest that eventually manifests itself into a pile of bricks that is completely stifling."
10894,I felt it all weekend but this morning the stress of going to a job I despise made the walls close in and I just couldn't break through.
10895,"I got ready for work - got up at 6am, took shower, ate breakfast, but all the while that feeling just got worse and worse."
10896,All morning I was trying to talk myself into going to work.
10897,"""Just go, it's fine."
10898,You'll feel better if you go.
10899,"GO!"""
10900,"It didn't work, I called out."
10901,Now I feel like a huge failure and all day I'm just going to feel guilty.
10902,Is this something that happens to any of you?
10903,It's a vicious cycle for me.
10904,"Once I actually call out of work, I feel like such a pile of garbage... it doesn't solve anything."
10905,"I know this intellectually, but sometimes no matter how much I try to talk myself into going, my anxiety wins out."
10906,Wondering if any of you have any advice on how to overcome these feelings without therapy/medication as I am still waiting to get into therapy.
10907,"(I cannot afford private therapy, my insurance does not cover mental health.)"
10908,"**

To be honest, and I know this is going to sound really stupid, I just want someone to talk to, and maybe some medication that'll make the dread go away and calm me down when I'm in panic mode."
10909,"First off, after reading posts online i have noticed the majority do not take above 200mg and still stopping their medication was a nightmare."
10910,"In fact, my armchair scientific speculation is that it might be a side effect of the meds lessening the intensity of recurrent OCD thoughts."
10911,"Today, I had a test I barely had time to prepare for."
10912,I am doing clinical right now that go along with nursing school and while I was somewhat prepared for the test; I struggled to make up the three days I lost from commuting to a clinical experience last week.
10913,I have a problem with focusing during my tests and struggle to read the key words for the test.
10914,"It gets frustrating, but today I reached a breaking point where I realized that I need some form of help."
10915,I spoke to my counselor at the school and am going to be seeing a nurse practitioner to talk about possibly getting medications for test taking.
10916,I told my parents and they are a little worried.
10917,They have this stigma that any medication is 'bad' and you should not be on it.
10918,While I respect their opinions I think exploring the option of anxiety medications would be a good start for me.
10919,Has anyone had any experience with this?
10920,Or can anyone tell me what it is like to take anxiety medications and how they have helped you?
10921,I also have mild depression and its just the way it has always been.
10922,"I choose not to take medications for it, because I have been able to cope with it for this long and a friend of mine makes me feel guilty for even considering using them."
10923,My anxiety leads to an increase in my feelings of depression.
10924,I always imagine them as best friends.
10925,When anxiety comes out to play depression is not far away.
10926,I have had a panic attack before and am anxious when it comes to making friends/being in large crowds/relationships.
10927,Do other people with anxiety struggle to maintain friendships?
10928,"I have problems maintaining friendships, because I feel stressed out by the amount of time I have to spend with someone in order for it to work."
10929,Anyway thank you ahead of time to anyone who reads this and to anyone who has any advice or insight.
10930,TL;DR Has anyone else taken anti-anxiety medications for test taking?
10931,Did it work and how well did it?
10932,Does anyone else struggle to maintain friendships due to anxiety?
10933,What are other strategies that I can use?
10934,I am a 21 year old female in college who is going to see a nurse practitioner tomorrow about getting medications.
10935,I am diagnosed with anxiety and mild depression.
10936,"I need meds, and I am thinking about taking Zoloft."
10937,"Yes, he did prescribe medication, but he told me if I don't like the side effects he will help me back off the medication."
10938,I just spent a couple of hours laying in my bed watching anime.
10939,"I'm enjoying it, I'm comfortable, and all the while I have nothing to worry about, nothing I need to do, nothing bad going on in my life, no nightmares recently, no recent crisis or trauma, nothing."
10940,Everything is pretty much fine and happy.
10941,"I don't do alcohol, drugs, caffeine, medications, nothing at all."
10942,But I was still anxious.
10943,And worried.
10944,I felt it in my chest.
10945,I still do.
10946,I don't know why.
10947,"There's no reason for it, it's just there."
10948,Why?
10949,Why do I feel like this?
10950,There's nothing wrong.
10951,There's nothing to be worried about.
10952,Nothing.
10953,I have no reason to be anxious.
10954,So why do I still have this anxiety just dwelling in my mind and body?
10955,Why will it not go away?
10956,I don't know.
10957,I think my worrying about why I'm worried is actually self-reinforcing.
10958,I'm completely at a loss otherwise.
10959,"Please tell me I'm not slowly losing my sanity or something, because I feel like I am, and it's scaring me."
10960,Maybe some help on how I can make this stop would be nice too.
10961,I'd had fucking amazing results with meds.
10962,"Could i go on without meds (uh, no, not if i can help it), could i start making enough money online to leave my boyfriend (sure, after meds kicked in again, but then his ways won't upset me), am i hurting my kids by being distant (yes, but not as much as if i were not protecting them)."
10963,Hopefully it helps for as long as it takes for me to be able to buy my meds again.
10964,In the interim I have decided to try betablockers because they are the mildest anxiety medication and I would be adverse to trying anything stronger.
10965,"He diagnosed me with depression, which was accurate, and then prescribed meds (at my request)."
10966,And the meds are great.
10967,They don't know about the counseling or meds or any of it.
10968,I probably need to reevaluate my medication and go back to therapy if I found a new guy.
10969,"Well, I'll give a little background first off."
10970,"I have suffered from panic attacks as long as I can remember and was diagnosed with Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety, and Depression (for which I was briefly hospitalized around this time after a suicide attempt) when I was about 14 (I am 20 now)."
10971,For three years after this I was on a cocktail of medications (SSRI's and benzodiazepines).
10972,"I decided to come off of the medications and was successful in doing so, with few ""episodes"" for two years following."
10973,That was when the shit hit the fan about a year and a half ago.
10974,I developed a hormonal imbalance and fell back into mind numbing depression.
10975,For three weeks out of the month I am struggling to maintain base-level functioning.
10976,"Over the last few months it has been becoming less down and depressed and more manic, hyper panic, craziness."
10977,"My panic attacks used to be shortness of breath, a twisted feeling in my gut and leg and back pain, but now it is to the point I would call it psychotic if I were not completely aware of the change in myself."
10978,"I can not breath, anywhere I can feel my clothing burns and itches, I cannot remember why I am where I am or what I am trying to do, I lose my ability to communicate verbally, and I feel terrified and confused."
10979,I feel completely stripped of control and context.
10980,"It is like there are three people in my brain, one who is thinking about mundane things like work and the weather, another that is telling me to bash my head in or kill myself, and a third that is too scared to fight back."
10981,"The smallest things set me off, a drawer won't close, I can't find my car keys, someone looks at me for too long at a red light, my dog won't stop pulling on the lead- all things that I should be able to cope with- I feel completely insane."
10982,"I have a doctors appointment on Monday, but I feel as if I am out of options, I do not want to go back to being a sedated zombie, but I am starting to feel consequences of my panic attacks (often late to work, parts on my car becoming broken during attacks, my relationship is falling apart, throwing my hands through walls, and I have stopped sleeping)."
10983,What are my other options?
10984,Can anyone help me?
10985,Does anyone else feel this way?
10986,Please.
10987,"7/4- Thank you for all of your support and ideas, I really appreciate all of the time you took to help me."
10988,You are all top notch human beings!!
10989,!
10990,I've have had spurts of anxiety for about 2 years now and decided to go on meds just before starting my new job.
10991,"I have a long-standing history of depression, anxiety, and OCD."
10992,"I have already had Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and it helped lift the depression a bit, but it has been six months since I finished TMS and my depression has worsened."
10993,I've tried CBT and DBT with minimal effects and I'm still in CBT.
10994,"So far I have been treatment-resistant, and I was hoping for some advice."
10995,"I'm stuck, I've made very little progress and I've been in intensive treatment for the past six years."
10996,I feel like I'm at a breaking point and if something doesn't change I'm going to lose it.
10997,I want to know if anyone has had luck with other medications or alternative treatments.
10998,Here is a list of what I have tried and their effects.
10999,"Zoloft: No effect
Abilify: Helped minimally and my doctor decided it wasn't worth the small benefit I was getting."
11000,"Prozac: No effect
Ritalin: Helped lift some of the depression but the effects were only about an hour to two hours long."
11001,"Buspar: No effect
Vyvanse: Helped the depression and gave me more energy but the effects only lasted an hour to two hours at most."
11002,"Anafranil: No effect
Effexor: I had a bad reaction and ended up in the hospital with spams and heart palpitations."
11003,Adderall: Same effect as ritalin and vyvanse and really short-lived effects.
11004,Risperdal: Helped improve some of the anxiety.
11005,Still taking this med.
11006,Klonopin: Didn't make me feel any different but made me look drugged up.
11007,"Lexapro: No effect
Cymbalta: Helped life some of the depression, I'm still taking Cymbalta."
11008,"Trazodone: Helps me to sleep pretty well
Latuda: no effect
Daytrana: Oddly enough made me feel shaky at times even though it's basically ritalin in a patch from what I understand."
11009,"Vybrid: No effect
Nuvigil: No effect
Prazosin: Helps me keep from having nightmares that constantly disrupt my sleep."
11010,Did you find another medication that helps more?
11011,"Hell, even if you guys come here and say ""ya you got control anxiety disorder, go to a shrink and get some meds, you aren't dying of some fatal disease, its anxiety manifesting physically"" it would do a world of wonders for me."
11012,I told my friend's mom about it and she told me to go tell a doctor and take meds; if I'm anxious for no reason its a chemical problem.
11013,We doubled my original dose of meds.
11014,"I've had an old doctor whom I swear is just pushing pills and the medication I've been on through them has always been a wrong dosage, and not only that but my scripts are always filled out wrongly than what the doctor says."
11015,"Father is an addict of pain meds, already had open heart surgery, can't eat healthy, probably bipolar."
11016,"I am currently on citalopram medication, but it is currently being changed to mirtazapine, I start on that next week."
11017,"After 6 months of denial, and an entire summer of pretending I could handle it myself, this morning I went to see a counselor and am being enrolled in a program which will have me put on medication (not sure which kind yet) combined with CBT."
11018,I will be back again once I have had my first session and start medication.
11019,"I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, but do not take medication for it."
11020,I don't necessarily want to take medication.
11021,"I have tried various therapies, and am currently not seeing anyone, although I am switching my medication from Effexor(187.5mg) to Celexa(10mg) and it seems to have no effect on my anxiety."
11022,A few months ago I started taking pain meds for a health issue.
11023,My anxiety before has always been short panic attacks sort of thing which I finally last year bit the bullet and got some medication that I take while I'm having an attack which helps me so much.
11024,side effects of medication.
11025,I'm scheduled for a doctor's appointment next week where I hope I can get some anti-anxiety meds prescribed to help me get this under control.
11026,"But it's so hard and at the end of the day, a couple of drinks is the absolute best medicine."
11027,I live in NJ and I've been to several different psychiatrists.
11028,All of them want to push anti depressants.
11029,"They say xanax, klonopin, valium etc are too dangerous but I've been on 6 different anti depressants now and none of them work the slightest."
11030,I can't drink alcohol cause it makes me violently ill like more than 2 beers causes me to vomit.
11031,How can I illustrate that these medications could help me without coming off as a benzo fiend or whatever?
11032,I can barely sleep night to night cause I'm constantly anxious
11033,What if the meds dont work?
11034,I'd really like to be able to deal with anxiety without medication in the near future.
11035,"They hooked me up on an IV, gave me serum and meds and I started feeling better."
11036,My mom doesn't want me on meds either.
11037,"I suffer from extreme anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia."
11038,It's a terrible mix to have.
11039,"I AM on medications and go to therapy, but those only help so much."
11040,"Anyway, I was supposed to start a new job this morning, and I bailed."
11041,I was crying and was having extreme panic attacks.
11042,"I would have been okay after awhile, but my girlfriend told me she is thinking of leaving me."
11043,"Our relationship has been rocky for the past few weeks, but it was getting better."
11044,"Anyway, my anxiety gets in the way of everything."
11045,And my stress is higher than Tommy Chong.
11046,I just don't know what to do anymore.
11047,Have you had luck managing it with medication?
11048,I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and a doctor prescribed medication.
11049,When the psychologist handed me the letter to my doctor recommending medication I began crying and didn't stop until I was home.
11050,I couldn't cope with the idea that I would need medication in order to be happy.
11051,I saw medication as only for crazy people.
11052,I finally realised I needed medication.
11053,But I was still uncomfortable with taking meds and after my first two month course I decided I could go it alone.
11054,I now understand that right now I need medication in order to live anything resembling a life.
11055,I want to see a therapist and I really do not want to take medication.
11056,"So in your opinions, do you think I should hold off on the meds and continue with the CBT or start the meds?"
11057,In an ideal world is like to stay away from meds but my life is being severely impacted by these symptoms.
11058,I want to see a psychiatrist who specializes in psychotherapy along with medication but I don't even know where to begin to look and I'm not good at talking about my feelings so I know it will be tough.
11059,"My anxiety is pretty severe at the moment even with some medication I took this morning, but I have to do it."
11060,Is there a good way to take control of sleep without medication?
11061,"I've never had one, but whenever I take meds for my pain (Lyrica, Tramadol, Codeine, Buprenorphine patch) they give me side effects, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea and the typical side effects you get from opiates and that makes me think I'm close to a seizure."
11062,"Along with that, she also thinks I'm on the wrong meds, which is probably magnifying the lows."
11063,"Once the meds are changed and my moods are stable, she's going to re-evaluate the anxiety component."
11064,"I don't take any medication, usually I'm better when I'm very busy and don't have too much time to myself, but I feel completely drained and overwhelmed by the level of anxiety I've experienced throughout this moving process."
11065,I don't want this to affect my quality of life and don't want to have to be prescribed daily medication to cope with symptoms.
11066,Apparently he will decide if I need therapy or meds.
11067,But the meds might not of been the only thing that helped me.
11068,"I still have some anxiety meds (not ativan though) for in case, and I've managed to start getting better, but, things have been bad again the past two-ish months."
11069,"I am currently in a psychiatric private hospital getting treated for my anxiety, depression and personality disorder with therapy and medication and my girlfriend came to visit tonight."
11070,"TLDR: suffer from anxiety, had sex with my girlfriend of 1 year and 10 months and had a panic attack straight afterwards and had to take medication (valium) to calm down."
11071,"so i've forgotten to take my meds in the morning the last couple days, and i've noticed that my vertigo is very noticeably worse."
11072,"I checked she had taken her meds, had food etc."
11073,I initially tried medicine but didn't like the other affects.
11074,"I have medication for anxiety, .5mg of Clonazepam, but taking it hasn't been very effective, so I've been taking 2 daily instead."
11075,I don't take medication (other than the ocassional antacid).
11076,"Unfortunately, I lost my medication (fluoxitine) 2 days ago."
11077,"He then tells me ""if someone can proved they're depressed, we put them on medication."""
11078,"I keep a xanax in my wallet at all times, but i dont like relying on medicine and am flat out tired of avoiding public situations."
11079,"I thought I might be able to adjust to these, but the medication has also increased my anxiety to an unbearable level-- so much so that it has made my birth control pill stop working (I have bleeding and cramps where I should never have bleeding; it is a 365 day pill and I take it perfectly)."
11080,"I have never been on any medication other than some anti-depressant in my early life around middle school (I actually never thought of that being a potential trigger until just now, not sure if it is significant)."
11081,i am desperate to have CBT however (iam in the UK) the doctor said that services are too stretched to help me and offered me medication (sertraline) to stabalise me until therapy becomes available.
11082,"i am bummed out because i did not want meds and i have officially been diagnosed by a doctor with anxiety and depression, it was always an idea in my head and now it is a reality that i am not sure how to deal with."
11083,does anyone have any advice with my next steps or whether or not i should take the medication?
11084,"Also, I'm hoping the CBT my therapist is starting next week will help, she said she's gonna teach me a breathing exercise, but I have a feeling that CBT alone isn't going to be enough, and that I need some medication to really cope."
11085,"I'm also supposed to see my regular physician to get some blood tests done, and my therapist agrees that I should ask for some anxiety meds to help in the mean time, while I wait to see a psychiatrist, but I can't even get in to see my doctor, until next Thursday."
11086,I haven't taken any medication yet but I've been a long time user of alcohol which I believe put me where I'm at today.
11087,The only effect of the medication I've actually noticed is that when taking 2x/3x of the dose it makes going to sleep a lot easier (something that I don't really struggle with anyway).
11088,"I am only 23, and I am not, nor have I ever taken medication."
11089,"So over the weekend I was out at a restaurant/bar, and in my purse i had my makeup bag which had a bottle of Wellbutrin and Klonopin which are the two meds I take each day."
11090,Somebody swiped my entire makeup bag out of my purse at some point through the night and so not only did I lose all of my favorite makeup but my meds as well.
11091,"Granted I've never abused any medication, and I've been with my doctor for four years and I'm sure he'd believe me it just sounds so sketchy."
11092,"So here I am, sitting inside on this beautiful Memorial Day, freaking out about my lack of meds, how I'll ask my doctor to help me out with replacing what is left of the script for the month, and just going through all of the various scenarios about how terrible tomorrow is going to be at work."
11093,"I've been on this medication before in the past , but I always feel like such a zombie, yes my anxiety goes but I feel like my personality goes away with it."
11094,I started taking Rhodiola Rosea last week.
11095,For the first couple of days it made me feel GREAT.
11096,On the fourth day I started to feel very anxious.
11097,"I'd like to give it another try, but I'm unsure as to whether I should up my raise or lower my dosage."
11098,I've read conflicting information about the dosage: Some sources say Rhodiola causes anxiety if the dosage is too high; Others suggest a higher dosage causes more of a sedative effect.
11099,Anyone have any compelling evidence to support either claim?
11100,Should I stick to the dosage and cycle it in 3 day intervals?
11101,I've been taking 100mg of the Solaray brand and I'm not on any other medications.
11102,I realize I should switch to a more trusted brand.
11103,"I'm not interested in taking medication... rather, I would prefer to learn long-term coping strategies and gain insight into the source of my anxious thoughts and behaviors."
11104,I understand if I was hospitalized/prescribed medication I would include that.
11105,"(4-5 times a day maybe) 

I have never had anxiety, haven't been on any medication."
11106,"Hey All,

So I'm just starting medication for anxiety."
11107,I've only tried medication once before and I had sexual side effects before it helped with anxiety at all so I stopped that before seeing any effect.
11108,"I haven't told them for this exact reason and I heard them arguing of how ""everyone has stress"" and ""you're in school, you don't have real stress"" and ""your aunt had panic attacks and meds didn't work for her""."
11109,"I barely sleep more than 4 hours a night and she says the doctor gave them because I haven't slept **recently** (I have exams and pulled a couple all-nighters) but she doesn't believe it happens all the time (it does, that's why I got medication)."
11110,"About 3 days into the meds I started to get swelling in my hands, and one night I woke up with a bit of hives on my arms."
11111,"TL;DR
-I have a fear of choking and of having an anaphylactic reaction, top this off with a strep infection and a fear of taking the meds that will make it better, and you got one messed up guy."
11112,I have been throwing the idea around of going to see my PCP about it but I think the only thing he can do is prescribe me anxiety meds.
11113,My question is: If you have taken meds are they worth it?
11114,"Is there something outside of medication, exercise, and pretty clean eating that can help control anxiety that I am just not thinking of?"
11115,I had never been on anxiety meds before in my life and didn't know what to expect.
11116,I was off the trial medicine and NOT doing well.
11117,Does anyone have experience (success or failures) with Zoloft or any other meds?
11118,"I'm heavily ANTI benzos, and really want this medication to work."
11119,I have severe anxiety and am off medication at the moment.
11120,Hello r/Anxiety.
11121,I am a 25 year old female and I have an appointment in two weeks with a new doctor.
11122,I plan to speak to this doctor about my (own strong assumption that I have an) anxiety disorder.
11123,As a child I had a couple meetings with a psychologist about my intense fear of school/leaving my house in any way.
11124,"This did not resolve in much besides ""oh she probably has separation anxiety""."
11125,"My parents did quite a lot to help me, through talking with me and trying to help me rationalize my fears, and by the time I turned 11 or so (yes, from 5-11!)"
11126,I was very outgoing and generally extroverted.
11127,"I have always needed alone time to recharge, but I don't see that as a huge problem."
11128,"Maybe it is...

As an aside, I have been reading through a lot of threads tonight and it seems like another medical issue I've struggled with is made a little clearer - I've always had a lot of issues with my stomach, which I am now thinking is related to my anxiety."
11129,I have had literally every test on my stomach in the world and they never show anything.
11130,"Anyway, I digress...

Over the last 5 years my anxiety has gotten worse and worse and I am to the point that I find it hard to leave my house, get out of bed, my relationships are strained and suffering, and I have serious food/internet/(+other things to distract myself) issues."
11131,I really feel like I am on the verge of a much more serious dive into the black hole of anxiety/depression.
11132,"I try to be rational and logical but I generally spend most of my time hating myself, being unable to complete simple tasks without feeling overwhelmed, terrified and exhausted, and about 15 seconds away from tears."
11133,"My family are not really pro-medication and I guess growing up around the stigma of drug=bad, I am very nervous about the possibility of being prescribed medication."
11134,"Personally, I think medication is a wonderful tool in the process of self-healing, but you know... logic is not always equal to anxiety."
11135,Did/does anyone else feel this way?
11136,Is there anything I should know about taking medications?
11137,"Any stories, advice, or thoughts at all would really help me."
11138,"tl/dr; I feel hopeful about finally opening up to a doctor about my anxiety, but I am (irrationally) terrified that I will be given pills and they will affect me in a negative way."
11139,"This is kind of long, so I apologize in advance."
11140,Hopefully someone will read the whole thing because I need advice.
11141,I won't bother with a throwaway so don't be shocked if someone claiming to be my girlfriend shows up to say something later.
11142,I have been with my girlfriend for two weeks shy of 18 months.
11143,She is the first person I have seriously dated so far.
11144,We're both 21 and we are attending the same university.
11145,I was diagnosed with GAD/PAD a week before I started high school.
11146,My anxiety made high school absolute hell for me.
11147,"I also struggled with depression on and off throughout high school and ever since, especially during the long, dreary winters we have in my state."
11148,"I tried a couple medications for the depression, and ultimately found that Zoloft helped, but nothing I tried helped my anxiety (except Lexapro, but that made me fall asleep constantly and it was completely counterproductive and embarrassing to pass out on a desk in class.)"
11149,"I don't feel that I need to be medicated for the GAD; my anxiety is just kind of a normal, routine thing for me now."
11150,"I see a therapist for CBT every other week, and my panic attacks are now rare and fairly easy for me to control."
11151,The panic attacks are not the problem for my SO; she is having trouble with the generalized anxiety because it interferes with things that she likes to do.
11152,"In this case, going to a dance party thing on campus was the problem."
11153,"There are other areas that are greatly affected by the anxiety, but this is the most recent incident so I will be addressing only the dancing right now."
11154,I get extremely nervous at dances because the voices in my head are just yelling constantly that everyone is watching me and I'm embarrassing myself.
11155,"On top of that, it's too fucking loud, I'm packed into a crowd like a sardine, being jostled around by strange people, and the flashing lights drive me insane."
11156,"I can deal with it better on some nights than others - I actually met my SO because one time I was brave enough to start dancing with her, a complete stranger at the time."
11157,"However, that doesn't mean I wasn't insanely uncomfortable doing it."
11158,"Last night I was very anxious when we were going to go start dancing at an event, so I ended up sitting in the corner of the room with a glass of water and trying to calm myself down."
11159,"I tried to dance for a couple minutes, but I had to sit down again quickly."
11160,"I was eventually able to dance for about 25 minutes total or so, but my SO knew I wasn't thrilled about it and we quit after that."
11161,We got back to my place and she was extremely upset and said she only one more incident away from breaking up with me.
11162,I'm getting extremely frustrated because I can't seem to win no matter what I do.
11163,"If I say how I really feel (""No, I really don't want to go to the dance."")"
11164,then she's upset.
11165,"If I force myself to go to a dance, she gets upset because I'm not into it, and therefore (in her mind) I must not be very into her."
11166,"We are seeing a couples therapist once a week, but I don't know how much progress we're making."
11167,"We love each other very much but I don't know how much longer she is going to be able to deal with me, especially since dancing with me is apparently her favorite fucking thing ever."
11168,Does anyone have any thoughts at all?
11169,I don't know what do to anymore.
11170,TL;DR - My girlfriend loves dances.
11171,I (GAD sufferer) wish I could avoid them at almost all times.
11172,Girlfriend is quite upset.
11173,There are other issues my anxiety is the cause of and she is on the verge of breaking up with me because of them.
11174,"I stopped seeing a therapist after about six months, and stopped the medication then as I felt I was cheating, or not trying hard enough to deal with my problems without medicine."
11175,"It's been over 5 years since then, and after doing some soul searching and reading I've realized I need to deal with my anxiety with a therapist and possibly medication."
11176,"Obviously I can't tell you how much of it is the hypnotherapy, or the meds, but day to day life is so much easier now and I feel so much calmer, so I am able to tackle uncomfortable situations."
11177,"I've been desperately trying to get help and get on some anxiety meds but I'm on a 3 month waiting list for the psychiatrist, and I've called a few therapists and all are atleast a 1 month waiting list!"
11178,What can I possibly do to get help/medication?
11179,"If it helps: I'm an adult male, have 20/20 vision, some history of anxiety/depression, am not taking any medication, and do not drink/use drugs."
11180,"I've tried therapy and medicine, but nothing helps."
11181,She's recently started medicine and that is helping her a little bit more each day.
11182,"Trying to make a long story short, but I have been through everything possible when it comes to anxiety and have tried everything I could to help it (therapy, medication, meditation, reflexology, reike, homeopathy, chiropractic specialist, hypno therapy, breathing techniques etc)."
11183,"So all my tests said I was ok, and it's still anxiety...well I thought I could do it with no medication but I have come to terms with the fact that some people just have it so extreme that medication is just something I may have to take for the rest of my life, and at this point, if it works, I am ok with taking it."
11184,I can't stand having this problem and I am wondering if therapy/ medicine can help.
11185,I live with medication.
11186,"He told them that I tried to overdose on pain medicine, which he shouldn't have said; I'm pretty sure we had a doctor-patient confidentiality."
11187,"I've tried getting therapy, tried medication for a while, but some rocks came along in the road and those things had to stop for a while."
11188,"And now that they've stopped I am unable to get help from a doctor or psychiatrist, and I desperately need medication or some kind of help."
11189,Got treated for anxiety the next week after and been taking meds till August of last year where I slowly winged myself off of them.
11190,So I'm finally going to doctors AGAIN to get back on medication hopefully.......but the thing is I'm scared to leave the house I'm afraid of having a huge panic attack while I'm in the office and even in the car.
11191,I want to give you hope too - go to a psychiatrist and don't be afraid to try medication if they recommend it.
11192,I currently take the Levlen contraception pill (for four years and have never experienced problems with it) and no other prescription medication.
11193,"I've been at this for decades, have taken 9 different meds, seen unknown numbers of doctors, tried all the non-drug therapies I could get myself to try, CBT, ACT, mindfulness, yoga, meditation."
11194,"General doctor, tell him my symptoms, tell him what meds I've taken and get blood work."
11195,Is it normal when first starting this medication to go back and forth on feeling better?
11196,I've never been a huge fan of meds.
11197,"After having a plethora of anxiety attacks over the last 2 weeks in regards to medicines, concussions, health issues..."
11198,I feel a little calm.
11199,Which makes me even more anxious.
11200,"Like my guard is down, aka I'm breathing normally, heart beat is normal, etc."
11201,I found the same issue when I was in a psychiatric hospital and they got me on the right meds... My anxiety came down and it was like I was exposed.
11202,Ironic I know.
11203,Time to get anxious again.
11204,"I guess it would be nice to know if anyone else here gets actual pain from their anxiety, I'm so confused, medication doesn't help because I don't think there's anything wrong with me but it feels real!"
11205,I had been on Citalopram medication for almost all 10 of those years until perhaps 2/3 months ago when I forced myself to come off them after being sick and tired of drugging myself to no real gain.
11206,So here I am 2/3 months later with maybe only a 10% increase in the depression and anxiety I had whilst on medication.
11207,"I can't emphasise enough how anxious I am about doctors surgeries and hospitals, when I was on meds I had to go to the doctors and the 1 hr it would take to get there, see the doctor and leave would exhaust me mentally and physically."
11208,"I had taken a stock pile of my medication with me, and whilst in Japan it ran out, it didn't have a massive effect on me, I continued my journey with Kyoto as my goal."
11209,"(That's another thing about coming off these meds; on the meds I felt nothing couldn't cry about anything, couldn't give a rat's ass if your grandmother died."
11210,"I am sorry I have written so much


TLDR; 10 years of anxiety relating to health issues, been on meds most of them, just come off them, going to Japan in 4 months."
11211,EDIT: I should probably mention that in Japan a lot of SSRI's (and what we may term normal anxiety and depression medication) are banned so this was a big part of why I came off the meds.
11212,So there is the added anxiety of what could I do if I did 'need' meds whilst I'm in Japan?
11213,I'm not under any medical care or receiving medication.
11214,I am always weary to take new meds and was wondering if anyone has experience with it?
11215,"So unfortunately, the doctors thought the meds were working when they weren't, and they called me to justify myself in front of a jury of five doctors why I wanted to ""stop complying with the treatment."""
11216,"(I got off the meds after I left the facility)

Fast forward 6 years, I'm finally in my last semester of uni, and struggling hard."
11217,I realized I need to try meds again in addition to therapy by last October.
11218,I'm actually really scared of taking meds again so I wanted a doc that is as empathetic and competent as possible.
11219,I made the appointment because I recently relocated and needed to get my performance anxiety medicine filled.
11220,The medicine box has been filling up quite a lot these years.
11221,"medication is out of the question, and i really struggle with the techniques ppl tell me."
11222,"I'm still in shock over this, Reddit."
11223,"I've been to a lot of doctors, for both physical and mental health, but I've never met a doctor who was this deliberately cold and just... unfeeling."
11224,She had no bedside manner.
11225,"I started the session off with complaints about my anxiety and depression, chiefly."
11226,This made her sigh.
11227,"I couldn't remember all of the medications I've tried, which frustrated her."
11228,"It's difficult for me to make and maintain eye contact, and I know this, so I apologized up front about it."
11229,"She responded with, ""if I'm going to work with you, I demand eye contact."
11230,"I won't work with you otherwise."""
11231,"Painfully, I tried to make eye contact, to no avail."
11232,"I could tell this made her angry, because right after this, she looked me up and down and very bluntly said, ""so is it a portion control problem, or what?"""
11233,I couldn't believe my ears.
11234,I've been trying to lose weight - it's something I've battled with my entire life - and I just couldn't believe that someone.. a PSYCHIATRIST.. would say something like that.
11235,"She then said, ""if I am going to work with you (again with that line!"
11236,"), you're going to HAVE to lose weight."""
11237,and then spent 5 minutes (out of the entire FIFTEEN MINUTE session) discussing how she planned to have me lose weight.
11238,She asked me what I did all day.
11239,"I told her that mostly I laid in bed because I was too depressed to do anything else, that I read, etc."
11240,"She said, straight up, ""this is not acceptable."
11241,All of my patients have jobs.
11242,"You need to get one."""
11243,"Reddit, I am freaking out."
11244,"I have never been treated this way by someone who declares themselves to be a ""professional"" before."
11245,I paid $175 for a first session that lasted for 15 minutes.
11246,"I spent money to be belittled and made ashamed of myself, my mental state, and my body, for 15 minutes."
11247,I feel attacked.
11248,"I feel like I'm in middle school, and the popular kids are picking on me again."
11249,I had a panic attack when I left the office.
11250,I'm going to give everyone a reminder to Google your healthcare providers before you go out and spend actual money on services that may or may not be rendered.
11251,"The one time I don't research someone, it blows up in my face."
11252,Lesson learned.
11253,Im not on any meds btw
11254,I was going to the doctors in a couple of weeks anyway to ask to be put onto medication for my depression (tried a year without and it just wasn't working with CBT alone) is this something I should bring up?
11255,"Hi, 

My fiancé was just diagnosed with anxiety few days back."
11256,He has been stressing due to work and family issues lately.
11257,He has been given medications now.
11258,"Lately, he has been feeling more and more alone and scared."
11259,I want to be there for him as much as i can.
11260,"Besides moving to the same city and being there for him, how could I help?"
11261,P.S.
11262,I am sorry if this is a often repeated post.
11263,I just need to help him in any which way.
11264,"I FINALLY got myself on medication - the first one worked, it's called Celexa (citalopram)."
11265,Took about 3 weeks for my body to start reacting to the medicine.
11266,I am a HUGE advocate for medication.
11267,"Just don't stop taking the medicine, even after you feel normal again."
11268,I am on medication  for it but it takes a while to kick in.
11269,Are meds the answer or can I beat this without it?
11270,I've been tapering off of pain medication I've been on for 7 years over the last year and a half and i finally completely discontinued it 2 weeks ago.
11271,"I have a very long history with anxiety and other mental health issues, but have not had to deal with them over the period of time on the pain medication as it kind of ""fixed"" me."
11272,I missed a medication check with my psychiatrist and won't be able to get a refill (if he authorizes it) until later in the week.
11273,I came home once we were done with studying and I told my mom that I panicked and (after more than just this situation occurring in the past) and she just told me that I need to cope better when I am sure that I need some form of medication.
11274,I've talked to my therapist about it and he is very so so about giving it to a 17 year old as he isn't sure of what would happen based on the fact that the medication is tested on adults and not teenagers or children.
11275,"In some ways I can't even tell if my anxiety is better or worse since stopping medication, all I know is some days are good and some are terrible."
11276,"My question was, is there any meds that have a similar effect on anxiety that alcohol does?"
11277,"You were forced to sit on a couch all day, and could not move aside from walking to get your medication which was like, 5 steps away, walking to the dining hall, or walking to bed/bathroom."
11278,"I have a doctor(psychologist)  but they do not help only prescribe more meds (seroquil,busiprone,abilify,lexapro) nothing seems to help i only get the side effects."
11279,"So he ups my Wellbutrin to 150mg, but won't give me any anxiety medication."
11280,"I go to see my psychiatrist on Monday, and I'm terrified he still won't give me any medication for my anxiety."
11281,How do I get him to see that I need some medicine?
11282,Is it normal for doctors to not prescribe anxiety medicine until the second visit?
11283,*Throwaway.
11284,"*

This is not the only thing I suffer from."
11285,"I have a horrible panic disorder, social anxiety, GAD, an eating disorder, depression, and PTSD (all diagnosed by a professional)."
11286,"Thankfully, I no longer suffer from insomnia (or I suppose I should say, it isn't nearly as bad as it used to be)."
11287,"I was on *way too many* medications, yadda yadda, nothing worked, I began smoking marijuana, nothing has helped me quite like marijuana has."
11288,I now use it medically for every single one of my issues.
11289,"One medicine for each and every issue, it's incredible."
11290,"Anyway, the point of this post is to tell you I suffer from separation anxiety **from my dog."
11291,** About five months ago I adopted a Doxle (Dachshund Beagle mix).
11292,"I am a positive reinforcement dog trainer and I adopted her to show I can raise a puppy to become a very healthy, responsible, well trained dog."
11293,She is now seven months old.
11294,"She is extremely well trained, very obedient, calm, sweet, anything anybody could ever ask for in a dog."
11295,I cannot leave her.
11296,I haven't left her for more than two hours since I adopted her (not even to go eat).
11297,I haven't been to a sit-down restaurant since I adopted her (aside from one where dogs were allowed).
11298,I just can't leave her side.
11299,"I am so attached, she brings my anxiety levels *way way way* down."
11300,I want to train her to be a service dog for me and my panic disorder.
11301,"The problem is, not just any dog can be a service dog."
11302,"Some dogs just aren't right for it, and I can understand that."
11303,"Even a well trained, well behaved dog, may not be right for service dog training."
11304,I'm terrified of not being able to make her my service dog.
11305,What will I do if she doesn't make the cut?
11306,She doesn't have that big of a problem with separation.
11307,She becomes a little restless after a couple of hours (my boyfriend watches her while I go to class without her once a week.
11308,"Otherwise, she is allowed to join me in class)."
11309,I'm not sure what I'm asking for.
11310,Maybe someone knows the laws better than I do?
11311,Do **I** get to choose my service dog?
11312,"I know she has to become legally certified, but do **I** get a say in any of it?"
11313,I currently take depression medicine and am going to talk to my Doctor for anxiety medicine.
11314,Hi there.
11315,I've been told by several doctors that I should be on medication to control my anxiety.
11316,"Unfortunately for me, one of the big sources of anxiety for me is my health, and I know that prescription medications are detrimental to your health."
11317,"Another big source of anxiety for me is my weight, and I've heard that lots of anxiety medications cause people to gain weight for some reason."
11318,Has anybody had success with anxiety medication (either natural/alternative or prescription) WITHOUT gaining weight or having any other negative health-related side-effects?
11319,I don't trust doctors because they always have a hidden agenda and don't care about side-effects.
11320,"NOTE: I'm all about natural/holistic methods and have been meditating for a couple years now, which helps."
11321,I also get acupuncture to help calm me down.
11322,"But with the level and extremity of my anxiety, I know that I need help in the form of medication."
11323,"Edit: I'm 102lbs, female, 18, 5ft5in, and on no medication."
11324,Been on the meds consistently for many years.
11325,I have an appointment with my new doctor next week and I am wondering if he will continue my medication.
11326,"I have to scrape money just for an appt, which runs me around $50 for a medication visit."
11327,We both agree I probably need more expensive meds but he knows I have an extremely limited budget.
11328,"The most recent meds in that regard did not work and I had to stop taking them because they were making me worse, which I didn't think was possible."
11329,So I am not on any meds for depression because it's a waste of money.
11330,"It makes it to where the terrible feelings don't even come across my mind, but it would be nice if I didn't have to rely on any medicine."
11331,Was this medication related or not?
11332,"She up-ed her meds, but nothing seems to be helping."
11333,Every day I worry about going to work.
11334,Every day it's a struggle to get out of bed and get ready.
11335,"Sometimes I can't get myself to shower, and other times I just can't get myself to eat."
11336,"I stress and stress and it just builds higher and higher until I get to work, and then I'm usually fine until something inevitably goes wrong."
11337,"I work as a nursing assistant in dementia care during night shift, so my job consists of changing residents and cleaning the facility and sometimes showering at most two residents a night."
11338,"I have one other person working on my side of the building with me, so I do have help, but I'm always afraid I'm asking for too much help."
11339,"This is my first job ever, and I've been here for a little over a month, and I've already had two people die."
11340,"The first one that went I was in the room with for her to go, and I cried a lot, but I didn't really know her very well so I got over it."
11341,The second one I went and paid my respects to and was fine.
11342,But now my favorite resident is on hospice and I'm afraid of losing her.
11343,I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this because nobody really understands.
11344,I take medications for my anxiety but sometimes it's just too much.
11345,I also go in for counseling every other week but that's two days away now and I'm panicking and nobody is awake to talk to about this and I can't sleep so I thought I would post here and see if anyone has any advice.
11346,What I really want to know is how can I stop worrying about work before I even get there?
11347,"I think I should probably have been put on an anti-anxiety medication rather than an antidepressant, but I was too fucking anxious while talking to the psyche to speak up about it."
11348,"I don't know if it's the meds or just a coincidence, but I'm scared to up my dosage like I'm supposed to, because if it is the meds I don't want to make it worse."
11349,I am going to a GP tomorrow to talk about medication options.
11350,"I started taking some meds, and it took a while but I found some that worked for me."
11351,"Still taking meds, though a lower dosage, and my wife has been amazingly supportive, even though I'm sure she can't totally understand what I'm going through."
11352,"No medication has worked and we have never found the ""right"" therapist."
11353,"I had been wanting to stop taking my meds because I was doing so well, and when I couldn't reschedule my doctors appointment within my work schedule I decided to self wean myself off."
11354,I've been on meds since age 22 and they seem to really keep it at bay.
11355,I don't want to go on medication if I can help it.
11356,"Should I tough it out until it ""kicks in"" or get a medicine change?"
11357,"My goal was to get a referral to a psychiatrist and ultimately get medicated, as I was convinced id need medicine."
11358,"I have the atarax (primarily an allergy medicine, I've discovered) a fair chance, but it does nothing for me whatsoever but knock me out and cure my runny nose that leaks all winter."
11359,"I've seen a therapist and will see her today as well, and I'll be transferred to her psychiatrist in a week or two and she will have authority over my medication."
11360,I'm a scientist and know/read/watch a lot about biology and medicine.
11361,"How many ""there is nothing wrong"" diagnoses can you get, despite real, physical, constant problems before your doctor (who prescribes your psych meds) thinks you have an issue?"
11362,"How do you deal with what might be a real issue with a doctor who ""understands how you feel"" and ups your anxiety meds?"
11363,I want to ask for meds but my mom has Depression and feels very upset that I might be sick like her.
11364,"I was started on medication (Paxil) almost a week ago to cope with my anxiety, but it really hasn't made a huge impact yet."
11365,"I [f] have suffered from severe anxiety and depression for five years, and have been on a few different medications for it."
11366,I was just curious to see how others deal with their anxiety.
11367,"Also what kind of affects it has on your relationships with SO/Family/Friends, school, work or anything else."
11368,"Sorry if this is to personal, I have never written one of these."
11369,I started taking these meds late 2011 and stopped on my own last December.
11370,I miss the carefree days and disneyfied state of mind when I was on meds.
11371,One thing I was told in CBT is meds target your emotions and physical symptoms but not the thoughts and behavior.
11372,I'd rather not puke every morning until my body gets used to the medication.
11373,Im under the impression i can go in tell them all i know and bam they diagnose me and i get some medication all in one session.
11374,So far he hasn't had too many panic attacks since we've gotten together and apparently he is supposed to start weening off of medication (according to him and his psychiatrist).
11375,"I support him in whatever he chooses to do, and he's talk to me about weening off of medication since he hasn't had panic attacks or bad anxiety in a very long time."
11376,"After surviving on applesauce for 5 days, I told the doctor I couldn't hold out anymore, and we agreed no more meds for now."
11377,"To clarify, I never had attacks this randomly or this frequently before the meds; the ones I had were uncomfortable, but milder, and they had a *purpose*, like not wanting to go to a job interview or not wanting to do a math test."
11378,"I was only on the meds for 10 days, but they've haunted me ever since."
11379,"I don't WANT to try meds again, it's too scary and I don't want to be dependent on them."
11380,"I don't want to blame anyone, but in a way, I feel wronged, like someone should have led me toward therapy first and meds should have waited."
11381,"I really don't want to take medication for anything, especially after seeing a friends life almost end over constant medicating, but having a xanax was the greatest feeling ever."
11382,"Or do I need medication (I hate drugs and side effects and not being myself, so I hope that is not an option) 
  I just don't know what to do, but something isn't right."
11383,The medication has helped a little.
11384,"I'll be requesting the nitrous because A) I have severe anxiety when people don't have metal hooks and drills inside my face, but also B) because I genuinely like it."
11385,I *wish* there were a way to get a prescription for home use nitrous.
11386,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know -- dangerous to OD on."
11387,"But they're making more and more inhalant medications these days, so surely they could work out something relatively fool proof."
11388,[Or whatever.
11389,"If I gotta die, I can't imagine a nicer way.]"
11390,"As I was driving home from work yesterday, I started to feel very bad, and had shortness of breath, chills, sweating profusely, and numbness in my arms."
11391,"Because I had two incidents of pericarditis/myocarditis in 2007 and 2010, I went to an acute care center on Roswell Rd."
11392,"By the time I made it to the counter, I was barely able to get out the words “I think I’m having a heart attack” (that’s what it felt like) before collapsing onto the counter."
11393,The staff immediately called the paramedics.
11394,Before long I found myself being loaded into an ambulance on a stretcher.
11395,"By the time we got to the hospital, most of the acute symptoms had gone away, but they still did a full battery of tests to try to figure out what happened."
11396,The only thing they could tell was that I had extremely high blood pressure (150/95) and an elevated D DIMER level (10.13 mcg/mL where normal range is &lt; 0.45).
11397,"But they were unable to find any conclusive diagnosis from the bloodwork, urinalysis, electrocardiogram (EKG), chest x-rays, CT scan, and ultrasounds."
11398,"They have referred me to a vascular surgeon for followup, and I’m currently waiting to hear back from them as to when I can be seen."
11399,I have also scheduled an appointment with my psychiatrist for Monday to discuss this incident with him and adjust my medications.
11400,WTF do I do now?
11401,"If I can't get this under control, I'm not going to be able to continue to work."
11402,"My job isn't the most stressful in the world, but it requires a lot of critical thinking and attention to detail."
11403,I can't go in doped up on benzos and antipsychotics and stuff and be able to perform adequately.
11404,I'm going to see if my psychiatrist can recommend a therapist to work through some of these issues.
11405,What else can I do?
11406,I visited the ER and they informed me that it's highly unlikely the medication had anything to do with that feeling.
11407,My only experience with not taking my meds is that about a year ago I had a seven day Rx for something that interacted with Celexa and the pharmacist told me to just skip my Celexa for that week.
11408,"I can tell the medication has helped, especially as of recently."
11409,I've been having trouble breathing and chest pains for three days and I was attributing it to having a reaction to something in the air at work.
11410,Then last night I had an epiphany: *what if it's actually a sudden reaction to one of my medications?
11411,"*

I called up the prescribing doctor's office, and the on call doctor called me back."
11412,"I told him that I had trouble breathing, and my inhaler wasn't working, and even though my anxiety doesn't manifest itself this way, I tried taking Ativan and that wasn't helping."
11413,I was taking Allegra so it couldn't be allergies.
11414,He said that meloxicam (the medication I thought was causing the trouble) can aggravate asthma (I have excercise and heat/cold induced asthma).
11415,He said to stop taking it and that since I also have chest pain I need to go to the emergency room.
11416,*Shit.
11417,"*

I tell my boss (who was pissed off that  ihad to leave early, claiming that I was breathing fine....  NO I WASN'T), clock out and drive myself over."
11418,I'm starting to freak out a little bit.
11419,"I would have used deep breathing to calm me down but that was the reason I was going to the ER in the first place *I had trouble breathing, especially with deep breaths*."
11420,My boyfriend was at work so I had to go by myself.
11421,"*Oh dear God, help me."
11422,"*

I was so anxious and jittery and hyper in triage that the nurse asked me ""is anything else going on?"""
11423,"which I think is code for ""Are you on any  recreational drugs right now?"""
11424,I explain that I have ADD and anxiety and a needle phobia and get panic attacks and I was presently freaking out.
11425,"I get settled in my room, talk with the ER doctor, and he says, ""I want to run some blood work to rule out a blood clot and heart damage."""
11426,*FUCK.
11427,"*

I start crying and telling him how I get panic attacks, how I need ativan."
11428,"I've had to have emergency bloodwork done before, so I know I'm capable... but I was really sick when that happened."
11429,They don't do pills in the ER for stuff like this because intramuscular injection works quicker.
11430,He says he'll give me 1mg of Ativan.
11431,"I laughed and said that 2mg by mouth isn't enough, that I need more than 1mg IM."
11432,"He says, ok, I'll order 2mg."
11433,I waited 45 minutes (wtf?)
11434,before a tech came in to draw my blood.
11435,"""woah wait I thought  I was getting Ativan, I have a needle phobia!"""
11436,"When he came back I made sure it was the right dosage, and ugh it hurt and I started getting a panic attack and I cried but  I let him do it."
11437,I felt the vasovagal response build up but then the ativan kicked in and it died down and I felt calmer.
11438,An hour and a half later this super nice woman came to draw my blood.
11439,"She was great, and really helped me through it."
11440,"She talked to me, had me talk to her about snorkeling in the Caribbean and was the most patient kind and awesome person I could have had to draw my blood."
11441,But then......
11442,I started getting a panic attack in the middle of getting my blood drawn.
11443,"Damn, damn, damn."
11444,It was so uncomfortable.
11445,"I wanted to stop, but I knew they needed it, and it was mild enough that I was able to let her continue."
11446,She kept telling me all of those things my therapist would have been telling me.
11447,I started repeating those things to myself.
11448,"""I'm fine."
11449,I'm going to be ok. this pain is temporary.
11450,this needs to be done to see what's wrong.
11451,I've done this before.
11452,this is the result of a wonky chemical reaction.
11453,"*I AM GOING TO BE OK.*""

All of my blood work came back normal."
11454,No heart damage.
11455,No blood clot.
11456,But I need to follow up with a cardiologist.
11457,This is the second time I've had a drug interaction with chest pain.
11458,"It's 24 hours later and I'm still having a little bit of trouble breathing, but I didn't take the meloxicam today and my breathing has definitely improved."
11459,"I was taking my meds right before work so by the time I got there, they were starting to work and hence I thought I was reacting to something in the air."
11460,"I happened to have an appointment with a pulmonologist today to get a consultation for a sleep study, and I got some advair."
11461,"TL;DR: Had to face my needle phobia by myself, and didn't have enough ativan in my system to prevent a panic attack, but I let the nurse do her job anyway."
11462,edit:clarification
11463,"Since then, I've been on and off with meds."
11464,"In october I started seeing a CBT therapist and after a couple of months stepping down with the meds, I today decided to stop with them."
11465,I finally got a PCP and have spoken to her about it and she will be seeking me a therapist and spoke about anxiety medication.
11466,I'm not currently taking any other meds or supplements except glucosamine for my joints.
11467,"I started a therapy and have a second meeting with my doctor for medication in a week, but I highly doubt I'll ever be fine again, or that I'll ever get excited, or get attached to anything, because I know it will be gone."
11468,"I know that there is a certain level of skepticism surrounding this situation, so please don't take this the wrong way."
11469,I am not just attempting to make excuses to get out of this.
11470,I'll attempt to keep this as short as possible.
11471,Two days ago I received my letter in the mail to let me know that I have been summoned to to jury duty in the month of May.
11472,"I have extreme social anxiety, and I do *not* do well under pressure at all."
11473,"When faced with situations like this, I tend to panic."
11474,"There have been several situations where this has almost cost me my job, and honestly, I'm surprised that it hasn't yet."
11475,"I work in a restaurant at a hotel, most of the time it's fairly calm and I can maintain composure with relative ease."
11476,"After the season came to an end, they needed to cut the restaurant staff down so they moved me and a couple other people into catering."
11477,There have been several occasions that I just couldn't handle it.
11478,One night I was working a function and it quickly became too much for me to handle.
11479,I panicked and hid (not exactly proud of that...) in the back hall for 30 minutes to an hour until my manager came and found me.
11480,I explained the situation to him and he eventually sent me home and removed me from the schedule for the next two weeks.
11481,"I finally convinced him to allow me to come back to work, and after that they did their best to work around this issue and find something else that I could do."
11482,"I've never taken medication, nor have I spoke to any doctors or sought any help with this."
11483,I've basically planned around it to the best of my ability and have avoided situations that I expect would cause me to freak out (for lack of a better word/phrase).
11484,"This jury duty situation is out of my hands, and it is not something that I can avoid or try to work around."
11485,"I understand that it is my civic duty, and that I am required by law to do this."
11486,"However, I legitimately do not think that I would be able to hand this."
11487,"*Especially* given the gravity of the situation, it's honestly just too much pressure."
11488,I understand that it's not a yet an absolute as there's a chance that I would not even be picked from the jury pool.
11489,"I realize that most people do their very best to be excused from this for one reason or another, so I expect next to no cooperation from whoever it is that handles the selection process."
11490,"But honestly, at this point I am completely lost."
11491,There isn't a part of this that doesn't scare the shit out of me.
11492,"If I explain the situation to them, then it seems like I am just another person trying to weasel out of it."
11493,"If I avoid it, I face jail time."
11494,"If I go through with it, then ..."
11495,I honestly don't know.
11496,"I don't really know if this is more me asking for advice, or just a rant that I needed to get off my chest."
11497,I guess that one is equally as likely as the other.
11498,"----

I see that the sidebar says to include age and other information, so why not..."
11499,I'm a 20 year old male.
11500,Type?
11501,"I don't know exactly, I'm guessing that it would be social anxiety."
11502,Triggers are generally people and high stress/pressure situations.
11503,"No medications, never diagnosed, etc."
11504,United States.
11505,Alaska to elaborate further.
11506,^^^I ^^^failed ^^^to ^^^keep ^^^this ^^^short.
11507,^^^=/
11508,I am not on any meds.
11509,My meds make my stomach hurt.
11510,"I do have epilepsy however, and I'm on medication for that, and that's probably part of the reason why I've never moved out before now."
11511,"She has had multiple counseling sessions, and a number of medications including Prozac, Zoloft, Xanax, Vibryd, Propanolol and Buspar but nothing seems to work."
11512,"she's been going to a free clinic for monthly appointments for over a year, but recently acquired a PSP and would like to know of any good ideas."
11513,also opinions on cognitive behavioral therapy which has been suggested.
11514,"until she finds a solution she can't handle work, school or basic social situations without drinking and I just want to help as much as i can, any and all suggestions are appreciated."
11515,Thanks Reddit!
11516,I'm not 100% cured but there is a clear way to get over this nasty thing without meds and therapy.
11517,"I don't think meds are an option since I'm still nursing and we're trying for another baby (I would take Xanax before I was pregnant, but haven't had them since)."
11518,I have some good medication but this is still a possibility.
11519,"Having an alcoholic drink is not an option, but I do have 'as needed' medication that has a similar relaxing effect (I'll probably take one right before)."
11520,"Also, I've never liked the therapy portions of treatment, and I'd rather just try medication, and I know anyone I go to will recommend therapy in conjunction with medication."
11521,Well one day before she came over I decided enough was enough went to the medicine cabinet and took one of my dads 100mg viagra.
11522,I have to take anti anxiety meds for.
11523,Recently diagnosed with ADHD I can't start taking the medication because I get a panic attack and make myself throw it up.
11524,I get a panic attack when I take my anti anxiety medication.
11525,"I get a panic attack when I take any medication at all now...

TL;DR - took viagra can no longer take medication without either intentionally throwing them up from fear or just not take them."
11526,I also have been given anxiety meds before but i ran out and forgot to replace them then i was to scared to go ask for more.
11527,"LONG POST AHEAD lol

Well after years of anxiety I have finally made an appointment with my general doctor to either recommend a psychiatrist/medicine that will help."
11528,I know and have been lectured by family as to how foolish it is to take prescription medication without a doctor writing the prescription and finally decided to make an appointment.
11529,"I left school and transferred to CC

I talked to a psychologist for a few weeks but never pursued medication."
11530,I have been prescribed medicine for years but I believe I function pretty normal without them therefore I don't take them most of the time.
11531,The prescribed me a medicine and sent me home with orders to see my doctor Monday.
11532,Since then the medicine hasn't done much for me..
11533,"I'm willing to try anything, even constant medicine at this point."
11534,"Part of me wants to wean off the medication, because I don't like the idea of relying on it."
11535,"How can I tell whether its the medication helping me, or if I have actually developed the coping skills?"
11536,"Before I was eager to discontinue the medication, but now that it's time, I'm scared."
11537,I can't take medication because I'm afraid meds will affect my body in a harmful way.
11538,"I really want to ask a psychiatrist about medication, but when I mentioned this to my mom she started freaking out at me and yelling that ""we should just go back home if coming here is going to make us go crazy""."
11539,For anyone who is on meds for anxiety; does it help?
11540,"I've lived with derealization and depersonalization for a few years now, since withdrawing from benzos and other psych meds."
11541,She's 16 years old and on anxiety medication and she has panic attacks because of her mother.
11542,What I would really like is some opinions on self-medication: what has worked for you?
11543,Which medication has the fewest side-effects?
11544,"I will either source the medication myself, or attend one or two sessions with a psychologist (which is ridiculously expensive) and obtain them legally."
11545,"I haven't dealt with it in a long time, as meds have definitely gotten rid of it, but here it is creeping back again - quite badly today."
11546,Or should I just stick to the meds?
11547,I've been lurking here and wanted to say that what I've seen has been incredibly helpful and constructive.
11548,I've recently been diagnosed with GAD and I suspect I have a little social anxiety as well.
11549,My doctor gave me a low-dose (10 mg) paxil script and xanax for any panic attacks.
11550,I personally am of the belief that there are natural answers (aka not pharmaceuticals) for health issues.
11551,"I know that many people DO need these, I'm not trying to downplay the usefulness and need for these prescriptions for everyone."
11552,"For myself, however, I don't like the idea of being on antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications."
11553,"I've made the decision to use EFT or ""tapping"" to help me process and constructively examine my emotions and what might be contributing to my anxiety issues while I am on paxil."
11554,I am hoping that this will allow me to cope in a healthy way so that the paxil is only a short-term solution in my case.
11555,"This may not be a solution for any or most people, but I wanted to share in hopes that it might help at least one person."
11556,"Here is a link to better explain tapping: http://kriscarr.com/vlog/emotional-freedom-technique-tapping/ and I am currently using Nick's book ""The Tapping Solution"" as well."
11557,I'm learning a lot about myself and what is causing me to suppress much of what I'm feeling.
11558,I hope this is helpful to you.
11559,Thank you for being a wonderful source of comfort as I go through this!
11560,I am on meds that seem to have no effect.
11561,"Hi all,

For the last week I've been stressed, and I run on meds that help with anxiety."
11562,I got given a script for medication to try help with my anxiety today.
11563,"I take medicine for it, smoking mj helps a ton but only for temporary relief, im going to college soon, and I feel like I can't do this, im so pissed off at my disorder."
11564,I don't take medication (besides valarien root) ever since Ativan turned me into an angry vomiting monster.
11565,"I should start off with saying I get help professionally, I've been prescribed medication which I take, and I've also been diagnosed with ADHD (which I also have medication for) and bi-polar disorder."
11566,"My medication seemed to really help with anxiety, in just taking the edge off of everything and making life more manageable."
11567,"For the average person with a common textbook medical condition it's all good, they take their medication as prescribed and they go on their way."
11568,About 6 years ago I had an episode where my ability to breath was greatly reduced and the standard allergy meds weren't doing it for me.
11569,I don't know if getting off meds completely will put things back to normal but it's worth a shot.
11570,"I think I need medication, not sure what kind is right for me."
11571,It's a check up appointment but I was hoping that I could talk to him about the depression/anxiety I've been experiencing and get myself on some meds.
11572,"I've been seeing a therapist for about two months now and he hasn't recommended that I try medication yet, and I was hesitant to go that route for a long time but I'm just sick of this."
11573,"I'm unmedicated, because the thought of having to find a doctor, tell him my problems, and go through the trial-and-error process of getting on medication freaks me out."
11574,"Can't take meds cause they make me have an anxiety attack, and if I had to take them night, forget that, I'd force myself to throw them back up."
11575,"I started going to see my university counselor, and after a few sessions she set me up with an appointment to see a psychiatrist and said medication may be beneficial."
11576,"about starting anxiety medication because I've heard it is really addictive, but I also really can't stand constantly being at battle with my anxiety."
11577,"Links about the drug:

[Wikipedia - Propranolol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propranolol)

[Patient.co.uk - Propranolol](http://www.patient.co.uk/medicine/Propranolol.htm)"
11578,"Now I am sitting at home without any anxiety meds, and found out my favorite Doctor is on vacay for 2 weeks."
11579,I don't want to be on meds the rest of my life.
11580,"Hey guys

I was diagnosed with GAD and Depression a couple years ago, though I had known for a while before that."
11581,I saw a psychiatrist in 2013 I believe and he put my on Venlafaxine which I was on for the past two years or so.
11582,I decided to try other medications because I didn't like how Venlafaxine ruined my libido.
11583,I went to my new psychiatrist in July and I was put on Cymbalta first.
11584,"On Day 7 of taking Cymbalta I experienced the brain fog, and decided to stop it and talked to my doctor."
11585,He then put me on Lexapro and I also was experiencing some bad side effects which I don't have time to work through as I'm in the midst of a summer semester of hard classes.
11586,After those two failings he gave me a prescription for lorazepam as needed and I am taking time to let my body get of all the medications and take stock of where my anxiety and depression are now.
11587,"I do not want to go back on SSRI's personally at this point in my life, I'd like to work through my anxiety and use exercise/yoga and meditation and have some time to learn about myself when I'm not on medication."
11588,"So the problem I'm having now is I'm continuing to have this brain fog, and I can't think clearly."
11589,"I've used the lorazepam twice, one of the times was yesterday I took 1mg around 1pm."
11590,"I guess I just needed to tell someone about what I'm experiencing because it's messing with my life a lot, as I basically failed a quiz today because I couldn't think."
11591,I'm applying to veterinary school right now and not being able to think isn't an option for me.
11592,I need my brain.
11593,Have any of you had a similar experiences with SSRI's and other drugs like this?
11594,I think overall I'm just looking for some reassurance that this isn't permanent and I can get my mind back.
11595,This whole experience has made my anxiety really bad.
11596,For the first couple days off medication last week I felt really good but I think I'm just having bad reaction to the lorazepam or something.
11597,"Thank you for reading, any advice or words of encouragement are greatly appreciated."
11598,Any advice on what to ask doctors about so I can get medication of specific assistance related to the nausea?
11599,"eventually, i got put on meds, and I'm thinking of increasing my dose once i see my therapist."
11600,"the meds have helped a little, but not all that much."
11601,"I'm not as freaked out, i guess, and going to school is a little easier, but i know meds take time and stuff."
11602,"In the ER they started giving me some pain meds through an IV and I was starting to notice my heart pound, I thought that it was due to whatever it was they were giving me and started to panic (not being able to get up and leave can be a major trigger for me as well as medical stuff in general)."
11603,I'm on meds.
11604,"First of all, I am a college student, studying Microbiology and pre-med at The University of Texas at Austin."
11605,"I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorders (specifically GAD and panic) as well as depression several years ago, and I have taken a couple different antidepressants along with low doses of benzos as needed."
11606,"However, after about a year, I began to get worse, having terrible anxiety and depression problems."
11607,"My doc diagnosed me with ADHD, and switched me to Effexor and Wellbutrin."
11608,"I still had panic attacks, so later my doc gave me benzos to take as needed."
11609,"Anyway, currently, my daily medications are 300mg Effexor XR (yes 300mg), Wellbutrin 300mg, 2-6mg Xanax as needed, and 30-60mg Adderall as needed."
11610,"So yes, I am a heavily medicated person."
11611,What do you all think about this combo?
11612,"I have been on it for about a year and a half, and I have recently been having terrible panic attacks and lots of general anxiety and feelings of dread."
11613,"My ADHD is pretty well controlled, but my anxiety issues have been getting progressively worse."
11614,"I still take only 2mg Xanax a day, but my doc said I can take up to 6mg."
11615,Should I actually take more Xanax?
11616,"I feel like it makes me very unfocused and tired during my classes, and I have a hard time paying attention when I take a lot of Xanax."
11617,Hello r/anxiety.
11618,"I'm an 18 year old girl and I'm here to share my story with you all, in hopes that I'll find someone who feels the same way."
11619,"So, all my life I've suffered from anxiety."
11620,I remember experiencing episodes and panic attack-like symptoms at a very young age (6-10yrs) but never knew quite what is was.
11621,"It got worse as I grew, and at age 15 I was diagnosed with General Anxiety, and Panic Disorder."
11622,"At that time, my mom was obviously still in control of my medical affairs, so she recommended that I opt out of any medication and seek natural remedies and/or therapy."
11623,"I took her advice, and it helped for quite some time."
11624,Flash forward to age 17.
11625,"The at-home therapies (breathing exercise, meditation, yoga, etc) were starting to help less and less."
11626,My panic attacks transformed from sudden spikes of anxiety to lingering terror that would last all day.
11627,"The only time I could find relief was when sleeping, which I could only accomplish with the use of sleep aids."
11628,There were days where I physically could NOT leave the house.
11629,I felt as though my heart was beating out of my chest.
11630,"I couldn't breathe, I couldn't eat."
11631,It was horrible.
11632,Age 18 now.
11633,This past year I started college and made that terrifying transition into adulthood.
11634,"It was still a struggle to get out of the house every day, but I managed."
11635,Pushing through my anxieties at least made me feel like a person again.
11636,"Made me feel real... 

And here's where my weirdness comes in."
11637,"Earlier this year, I started having some different... ""Episodes""."
11638,I would feel a strange sensation like I was watching my life as a third party.
11639,"I was entirely conscious and aware of my behavior/movements, but I felt as though I was living in a dream."
11640,I would run circles in my head.
11641,I would convince myself that my entire life was all just some fever dream that Id never wake up from.
11642,That I was vibrating in some different form of consciousness than everyone around me.
11643,"It was quite unsettling, to say the least."
11644,Back to the doctor I go.
11645,"I was then diagnosed with ""depersonalization disorder""."
11646,(DPD) had never heard of anything like this before.
11647,"My doctor told me that while there's no treatment for DPD alone, anxiety medications could help with the symptoms."
11648,"Again, I was hesitant to take any medication, as psychiatric drugs have always been a fear of mine."
11649,My doctor was understanding and fabulous.
11650,"She prescribed me with a medication that I was only to take on an as-needed basis... On the ""bad days"" 

So, we're just about caught up to now, the medication has helped the episodes some, and I feel as though the meds in combination with self-help techniques are really helping me work through some issues."
11651,"But, as you ALL know, mental illness doesn't just ""go away"".."
11652,It is only managed.
11653,"ANYWAY, my question to all of you is... Is anyone out there familiar with DPD?"
11654,Do any of you have it/think you have it?
11655,How do YOUR episodes feel?
11656,What triggers them?
11657,"I feel like the only person in the world who has this, but I'm sure that can't be possible."
11658,I really would love some insight from you lovely souls.
11659,Thanks in advance.
11660,-C
11661,"Every doctor I've ever seen has refused to comment on the tics, aside from the occasional ""it might be a medication side effect."""
11662,"No sorts of therapy or medication are of any help whatsoever, aside from the benzos every now and then and only for a few minutes after they've kicked in."
11663,She immediately suggested I meet with a psychologist who can prescribe me anti-anxiety medication.
11664,"So for anyone who has come off the medication, have you had any experience with this?"
11665,"Is it my mind trying to cope with issues that were ""brushed under the rug"" by my medication?"
11666,Or is there something in my neuro-chemstry of my brain that has fundamentally snapped and I'll always need the medication?
11667,I'd prob get more fine if it look a couple of minutes for me to sleepy then I fall asleep but it sounds like you'll be forced to shut your eyes from the medicine.
11668,I am in therapy and on medication.
11669,I self harm and abuse medication.
11670,I've suffered from anxiety and depression ever since high school and have been on medication for it about 5 years (on &amp; off).
11671,I noticed that when I'm feeling my best I will start becoming very laxed about taking my medicine.
11672,I have had a pattern of doing this ever since I first was prescribed any medication.
11673,"I know its not good, and that the levels of medication in my system can never stay consistent because I do this, but its like I cannot help myself."
11674,I'm wondering if medication would help any?
11675,"I've had anxiety all my life, and have never taken any meds for a prolonged period of time (ativan for a week one time)."
11676,Recently my doctor made some adjustments to my medicine as my depression is getting out of control.
11677,"I was originally on a small dose of Ritalin (5mg) in addition to my other meds, but he is trying me on Concerta (18 mg)."
11678,"Im 22 now and it comes and goes, I have been on meds and I have tried Ativan which helps but I would like something without drugs."
11679,Also I will be consulting with my doctor in Canada and likely be purchasing my medication through an online Canadian pharmacy to have it mailed here.
11680,"My counselor and doctor (for medication) had both mentioned looking into it, and today it was made official."
11681,This explains why no medication ever made the anxiety completely better.
11682,I've stupidly let myself run out of medication because the past few months I've been too nervous to make a phone call.
11683,"I called to leave a message and ask for a prescription refill, called to schedule an appointment, called back because I realized I needed to reschedule, and then just now answered a call from the medication nurse, who told me she's calling in my prescription now."
11684,I found a way to deal with the panic attacks without medication.
11685,"I hadn't noticed any significant changes in my anxiety, and though it hasn't been a long enough period to make a definite decision about if the meds work for me, it has been long enough that there should've been some progress... in fact, I was experiencing heightened anxiety before falling asleep that made it more difficult to fall/stay asleep."
11686,"I guess my question is: is anyone else taking Buspar or a Prozac/Buspar combo, and does anyone have any suggestions for how I could improve my sleeping with these meds?"

That was a month ago, and since then I have been slowly weaned off my meds."
11688,"So remember people, if you're thinking about quitting your meds or thinking you don't need them any more, please please PLEASE do yourself a favor and talk to your doctor first."
11689,"I was also having anxiety over taking the medication to help my anxiety (stupid, I know) so I stopped taking it."
11690,"I thought at first it was because I was taking my meds at night, so I've been taking it in the morning instead."
11691,"I'm going to schedule another session for next semester, and I want to at least open the possibility of medication, but I don't want to get shut down or treated like some kind of drug addict."
11692,"I haven't been takings meds like I should, and school has always been the biggest trigger."
11693,"I've tried taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication, but the anti-depressants never seemed to work, and the anti-anxiety meds (xanax and klonopin) led me to abuse the medicine, so I stopped taking prescription medicine altogether--the only time I take medicine now is if it's an antibiotic or something."
11694,I fear talking to a counselor and I fear taking medication.
11695,"I was on meds, it helped and I stopped taking the meds after a couple years and I have been ""fine"" since, for the last 6 or 7 years."
11696,I considered seeing a doc for some more meds to help keep be balanced but I didn't and my anxiety just went away.
11697,"Either way I am unable to take medicine for the time being, since I am pregnant."
11698,I'm just wondering if there are other solutions to anxiety without medicine.
11699,Can anyone recommend a solution or a medication I can take to calm myself down?
11700,I'm someone who doesn't want to rely on meds but I know I should probably start seeing someone.
11701,"bottom line, these meds take time to work."
11702,Also no I am not on any meds.
11703,She took the place of medication.
11704,I stopped taking my medication because I never remembered to take it on time.
11705,I was on 80mg of prozac and it helped but it was making me miserable.
11706,"I had to take it with food, specifically yogurt or cereal and milk."
11707,"Which is a problem because we don't always have it at home, I hate eating in the morning and too much dairy makes me sick."
11708,If I didn't take it with dairy I would end up in the bathroom making my roommate and mom think I was dying or something.
11709,I got into an argument with my mom about taking my medication and ended up throwing it all away.
11710,"I could get more if I needed to, but I don't want to be that miserable."
11711,I'm worried that my anxiety will become unable for me to handle.
11712,"I am better at dealing with it, but I still have that fear that I'm going to fall apart again."
11713,"I am doing what I can to stay positive, active and healthy."
11714,"My paranoia is pretty bad too, I was wondering if anyone could suggest anything that might help?"
11715,I know there are mixed reviews about herbal supplements but of it does *help*.
11716,"I say it like that because it's all I need, help, not a cure."
11717,Just something to take the edge off without making me so sick.
11718,I can't afford more expensive doctors to keep trying all kinds of medications that might not even help.
11719,"I am also pagan, so I prefer to find a more natural way to help myself overcome these issues."
11720,"I have my beliefs and you have yours, just leave it at that."
11721,I've had trouble before with asking for help on herbal supplements and I don't want to deal with it again.
11722,I have been feeling really uncomfortable around people and my medication for SPD seems like it isn't working anymore.
11723,Going to see the psych nurse tomorrow so hopefully she can adjust my meds or tell me something to make me feel better or whatever.
11724,"I'm back on medication for anxiety and a tic disorder (20 mg Citalopram and valium as needed)

It's great for my mental health but shocking for weight."
11725,I've been considered anxious ever since i was around 6 and have been taking medicines since then.
11726,it all happened after my sister went through what could of been a life ending battle with anorexia.
11727,i feel this scared anxiety into me at young age.
11728,ever since the past few year my anxiety has greatly gotten worse as i neared college.
11729,i believe im becoming agoraphobic which is scary to me because i watch all my friends have the time of their lives as they move out from home and are living awesome lives.
11730,whereas im stuck at home typing this because im too afraid to go anywhere and it hurts to think that all the work ive constantly put towards this has done nothing.
11731,im afraid that ill never get better.
11732,im only 19 and i want to live my life with a smile but right now thats way harder than it needs to be.
11733,anyone out there please feel free to help with suggestions
11734,She gave me meds for anxiety and something to keep me from vomiting.
11735,"After a year of that I had no libido and was prone to dizzy spells, so I decided to stop taking daily meds all together."
11736,"I spoke with my doctor and we agreed that I would cope just fine with ""as needed"" meds (Ativan, Klonopin and Xanax)."
11737,I plan on going back to my doctor  immediately when I get back home and starting a daily medication again.
11738,I don't take any meds either.
11739,"I don't know what to do, I've tried medication, it doesn't work."
11740,Tell me about your experiences coming off meds?
11741,I went to the doctor today.
11742,"I was totally freaking out about having to go and talk about my problems, but I feel very relieved that he was understanding about what I was saying."
11743,I'm glad I built up the courage to go.
11744,"Although I kind of knew this already, the doctor said I have anxiety, depression, and insomnia."
11745,"He prescribed me 50mg of Sertraline (generic Zoloft) to take every day and 0.5 Alprazolam (generic Xanax), to take as needed."
11746,"I never thought I would have to take medication, but that ship has sailed for now."
11747,"I'm a little nervous about taking the medication because of side affects and such, but I'm trying to be hopeful that it will help."
11748,"On the other hand... My boyfriend has been on my ass about going to the doctor, for the past 2 weeks."
11749,"Now that I went, he seems completely unsatisfied with the results."
11750,He said the doctor should have prescribed something milder and that I am going to have personality changes.
11751,"Well, my response to that is..."
11752,He isn't the damn doctor.
11753,"My boyfriend has never been understanding about my anxiety and he has repeatedly stated ""anxiety doesn't exist, I don't believe in those things""."
11754,"Which makes it confusing to me, because he was on medication for similar issues, a few years ago."
11755,"I wish I was able to talk to him about everything, but every time I do, he just gets frustrated and kind of belittles me."
11756,"I don't like being told that my feelings are ""wrong""..."
11757,"But like I said though, I'm looking forward to getting my life back in order, at least a little bit."
11758,I'm going to try to exercise more and be as healthy as I can be.
11759,I took my first Zoloft pill about 20 minutes ago.
11760,My doctor suggested taking it at night because my anxiety is worse during that time and it can also cause drowsiness.
11761,Also...
11762,"I know everyone responds to medications differently, but what were your experiences with Zoloft?"
11763,Did it help?
11764,"The meds seem to be working, but there are some side effects that are fairly minor, but I am concerned none the less."
11765,When I was a kid I self-injured for several years.
11766,I stopped during high school.
11767,"Now I'm approaching the end of my first year of college, and I've just not been able to control my emotions."
11768,"The last 4 years I was pretty calm and in control almost all the time, but now I get upset about little things like having difficult homework or my boyfriend going to a convention over the weekend."
11769,"Over the last couple months it's been getting worse, to the point where I'll break down crying every couple days because I'm just too stressed."
11770,I can't talk myself out of it even when I know that I'll get my work done on time or whatever I'm worried about isn't really a big deal.
11771,"My boyfriend has been really helpful, but we decided that I should go to the counselor on campus before it gets to where I start missing school or hurt myself again."
11772,I just want to talk to someone and get advice on how to handle it.
11773,I don't think that these issues are interfering with my life enough to justify going on medication.
11774,"I'm kind of worried because last time I went to a therapist I was too afraid to tell her that I was trying to stop self-harming (my parents didn't know, they just thought I had anxiety alone)."
11775,"Even without knowing that she kept bringing up medications, and I kept telling her I didn't want to do them."
11776,Eventually I told my mom I wanted to quit because I didn't like my therapist and she agreed.
11777,"I'm kind of worried that the new therapist will try to convince me to go on meds like the other one did, but I'm better at communicating now than I was when I was a kid so I don't think she will do that."
11778,"I'm also going to make sure I tell her everything so she can actually help me, unlike with the other therapist."
11779,"Annnnnyway, does anyone on here have advice/stories about therapy?"
11780,What should I do if I'm afraid to tell her something?
11781,(I think I might just try to write notes to her if I can't talk about some stuff.)
11782,Does anyone have success stories without using medication?
11783,"I'm not on any medication, and have only ever been under a general anaesthetic for dental work so I was completely passed out."
11784,"Hi, so I have a girlfriend who has general anxiety disorder and panic disorder."
11785,"She's had this for about two years, and her previous medications worked fine until she waned herself off the medications without telling her doctor."
11786,"(Bad decision, I know.)"
11787,She wanted to see if she needed them anymore because they worked so well that she didn't think she had panic disorder anymore.
11788,Not being medicated worked fine for about three months until she got a horrible panic attack one day when she went to a concert with her friend.
11789,"She ended up in the emergency room and, to make a long story short, her psychiatrist prescribed her new medications including Buspar to prevent anxiety and Xanax to deal with anxiety attacks when she gets them."
11790,"She gets anxious at the thought of having a panic attack in public, which causes her to start having a panic attack."
11791,This has made it so she is unable to drive and she can't sit in a classroom.
11792,"This has only been for two months, and she is starting college in three weeks but she doesn't think she can do it."
11793,"She's horribly afraid of having to drop out of school and live with her parents in the town that she hates, but I honestly think that might be the result if she can't deal with college for fall semester."
11794,"She thinks she'll *never* get better, but I don't know about anxiety disorder well enough to know whether this is true."
11795,I'm worried about her becoming seriously depressed or suicidal.
11796,"She has not shown signs of it, but she's great at hiding her feelings and I don't want to make the assumption that she wouldn't do it."
11797,How can I make her feel better or provide support for her?
11798,Is there anything that can help her?
11799,I've never experienced it before and don't really know what derealization feels like... but I do know that it's a withdrawal symptom of SSRI meds and I've been experiencing that withdrawal effects a lot the past few weeks.
11800,"I don't want to go back right now, they won't find anything, they won't give me the medicine I need."
11801,I was on meds that I liked and starting seeing a therapist a little under a month ago.
11802,"*I'm not on any kind of medication (used to be on Zoloft, but quit because I didn't like how it affected my sex-life, now I just meditate daily), I'm a 25 year old male, and I have social anxiety disorder, and maybe some self-loathing issues."
11803,"I've tried (I think) 3 types of medication early on but all 3 made me vomit constantly, and one made me hallucinate (all of this I think is probably linked to the anx' rather than the meds)."
11804,I was afraid to start taking my medication for months because my anxiety revolves around health problems.
11805,"So if you are sitting on medication like I was, you have nothing to lose."
11806,I was so afraid of being on meds my whole life but now I feel like it's only a temporary thing and I'll get better on my own and be able to cope without getting into my deep depressive state.
11807,Is there anything else as awesome as this medication?
11808,So im wondering if anyone here has taken cold medicine and had any bad reactions?
11809,**edit**  We have an appointment for 10am tomorrow morning to get his medication changed.
11810,"I'm not on medication for my depression, which I need but can't afford due to this fear that if I get on it, he'll fall apart and I'll have wasted money we need to survive, I don't have a car despite desperately needing one in order to get out of the house on a normal basis (he'd stay home 24/7 if he could; I'd be out 10 hours a day if I was able to be), and even though I hate my job I feel like I can't even start looking for another one right now."
11811,"Although I seem to have overcome most of my depression on my own, I still haven't beat it, and my anxiety has only worsened, which is why I decided to go on medication."
11812,"I'll see whether he thinks I should continue with the medication, or if I should try a new SSRI or possibly an SNRI."
11813,"I'm not just going to rely on meds, but I would like to know what would be a good med I could suggest to my doctor if I still don't feel any benefit from the Lexapro when I see him."
11814,"as she still hasn't really found a way to deal with her condition (no meds, and currently no therapy - she has tried a couple of therapists but they weren't the ""right fit"")."
11815,I am wondering if taking the medication at night will help?
11816,hey guys im gona be talking to a doctor tommorow about meds.
11817,I don't pay for treatment or medication and I've never had the same psychiatrist for more than 2 appointments.
11818,"I've been officially diagnosed, but I'm not on any medication and have just been doing CBT."
11819,I'm thoroughly sick of scheduling doctors appointments just to be told it's anxiety and to try meds.
11820,I stopped taking my medication in 2009 - 2010 when I started a job that requires shift work.
11821,I get suicidal thoughts that aren't stopped by my meds.
11822,I can't stop these mood swings without the meds.
11823,"I'm aware that there are so many unknowns with medication and mental illness, and some days it feels like I'm 'back to square one' and a depressed piece of shit."
11824,"), triggered at night thinking of tomorrow, thinking of lost friends, no meds, US

What I've done so far:
Googled anxiety, came out with webmd.com."
11825,I have not started any medication nor have I gotten any professional help with anything yet.
11826,I feel like I would stop trying to get better once the meds make me feel better.
11827,"I have been on a variety of meds, for a variety of disorders I was thought to have had (bipolar, depression, briefly ADD), all of which ended up being contradicted by different professionals."
11828,"Looking forward to your thoughts and experience on this... 

Just wanted to add, I have tried:

Depression meds

Bipolar meds

ADD (just vyvanse)

CBT and/or DBT (works a little bit)

Exercise (it helps some, but only temporarily)

Vedic meditation (helps a little, but is very time consuming - 40 minutes a day)

Psychotherapy"
11829,I'm curious to hear how this medication helped others with their physical symptoms.
11830,"I faild at that and I have failed at life and all I want to do is kill myself , but I would probably fail at that to because im a coward im getting therapy and im on mood stabalizer pills but I stopped taking all my meds in hopes that I have a serious break down and just get shot by the cops."
11831,I've been on various anxiety/depression meds since I was 23.
11832,Has anyone ever gotten off their meds?
11833,"Hey guys, I'm here asking about what you guys might be taking for meds and if you drink, how you are working with that."
11834,"It would be nice to have some meds around to level it out, and although I do keep a Xanax or two around for emergency reasons, there's a bit of an issue."
11835,"However, there are other meds out there."
11836,I was working with a fantastic therapist at the time who suggested I may need medication because all the work we were doing together wasn't helping my anxiety.
11837,"](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-km8O6sY5Rmo/T4oLwpZb_YI/AAAAAAAAS0U/wLeYbqHx3zU/s400/loveisnotenough.jpg) I think many people can feel like a failure if they have to resort to medication when they shouldn't, especially when people suggest they just ""try harder"" to feel better."
11838,Now I'm just kicking myself for not seeking meds out sooner!
11839,I finally made the decision to talk to a doctor about getting medication.
11840,I've tried so many non-medicine routes and nothing has helped.
11841,I just read up on anti-anxiety meds and how they work.
11842,What has been your experience with meds?
11843,I'm nervous the meds will make me feel this way.
11844,I started taking medication this year to stop it and everything was fine.
11845,I got better and stupidly stopped taking my medication.
11846,I'm back on my meds and I want to take two pills rather than one but I'm guessing that is a terrible idea.
11847,Does anyone in this subreddit use medical marijuana?
11848,"and if so, how has it helped you compared to other medicines you have been on."
11849,"I used it at one point to self medicate and it really worked out for me, so i was just wondering your opinions on this as well."
11850,"Fast forward to my 20's, I got on meds, went to therapy and gained weight..too much (5' 1"" and 153 lbs.)"
11851,"I take medication for depression and anxiety - I have been diagnosed with both, however I was not on medication last year and only went back on it after I had my daughter."
11852,"I honestly have no idea what is in my medical record, really, I see my GP once a year and the depression and anxiety are well managed with medication (Wellbutrin for depression, BuSpar for anxiety, a very small dose)."
11853,"If it would make a big difference, I'd just wait it out a year or so (I'm planning to go off the medication, I just haven't been to see my doctor since January as I have a really hard time getting off work, etc.)"
11854,"I am on anti deppressants and anti-anxiety medication, but they didn't really seem to help last year."
11855,"To begin with, always had anxiety."
11856,Always been a shy kid with not many friends because I thought I would make a fool out of myself and be a laughed at or think I am weird.
11857,Ever since kindergarten I've been this way throughout my life and social experience my anxiety decreased overtime.
11858,But the anxiety of being judged is sti there.
11859,If I go to the mall (worst place for anxiety btw) I get anxious.
11860,"I get tense, I feel like I'm being looked at."
11861,My heart rate pounds harder and my thoughts goes a thousand miles a minute.
11862,I get butterflies in my stomach and headaches when I'm done shopping.
11863,I always feel like I'm gonna say stupid shit to the cashier (like she even cares) and so forth.
11864,High school is a nightmare for me at the moment.
11865,I'm an upcoming senior and luckily it's my last year but my god I get terrible social anxiety there.
11866,I just could not make friends easily as others.
11867,"I've never been to a psychiatrist, knowing they would put me on countless medications that probably won't even work."
11868,I don't know what to do or how to treat it.
11869,It's always there.
11870,My therapist offered me medication for unrelated anxiety and I turned it down and I really regret that right now.
11871,"I have no idea why, but I have been through situations since then that would normally make me have monster panic attacks and need meds, but this time they had virtually no effect."
11872,Has anyone else been on this combo of meds?
11873,There is no improvement outside of taking the meds.
11874,"I'm trying meditation/mindfulness, exercise/yoga and have been on several meds (right now 1 mg of Klonopin and 15 mg of Lexapro) and nothing seems to help."
11875,"I am NOT on ADD/ADHD meds (nor have I ever been tested/diagnosed as such), and don't really want to at this point in my life (I have a bit of an irrational fear that if I do go on meds, I'll just like it too much...sort of like an exhaulted Red Bull OMG I FEEL AWESOME kind of high...which I am aware doesn't really make sense)."
11876,"I always thought it would go away on it's own, so I didn't seek therapy or meds for years."
11877,I've been working with therapists and medication(s) over the past couple years to come to terms with my depression and anxiety with varying levels of success.
11878,(Bonus points for really bad fear of failure) I've got an appointment with my meds doc tomorrow morning and a therapist appt.
11879,"* don't want to have to take medication for my entire life just to feel ""normal""."
11880,Should I try this for a month before diving into medication?
11881,"When I was diagnosed with anxiety, my mom, my doctor, and I decided that benzos were not the right path for me since they can be pretty addictive."
11882,I was prescribed Paxil and I've been taking it for 5 months or so.
11883,It helped with my anxiety tremendously!
11884,"But after a month or so, I realized that it was making me incredibly exhausted."
11885,"I would need 10-12 hours of sleep a day to even feel close to well rested, and if not woken up, I could sleep for 20 hours or more."
11886,I was even sleeping through classes.
11887,I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem on Paxil.
11888,I've since switched medications (I'm on Lexapro now) but I'm just curious.
11889,"From what he and his mother have told me, before he started on the meds, he would cut and burn himself, as well as become even more withdrawn and irritable with those around him."
11890,"I don't want to force un needed meds on him, but I'm getting worried."
11891,I'm not meds because they don't work.
11892,I started on 180 mgs of effexor a day about a year ago with tremendous results.
11893,No more voices telling me I was doing everything wrong or I looked stupid and my general anxiety was reduced.
11894,"However, I'm a small girl (around 5 ft 2 100 lbs) and my sex drive disappeared."
11895,I talked to my psychiatrist and the obvious step was to decrease my dosage.
11896,"After 5 painful months (effexor causes a pretty intense withdrawal where I would sweat the bed, have migraines and faint) I'm finally down to 75 mgs a day...HOWEVER, I still have no desire to have sex."
11897,I'm never horny!
11898,This was not like this before I started on this medication.
11899,I don't want to change medications altogether because effexor works for me and I've tinkered around with ssri's and ssnri's since I was 13...not about to start that up again.
11900,Has anyone on this sub experienced something similar?
11901,Does anyone know what I can do?
11902,Help....Me....
11903,"I mean, I've been taking these meds since I'm 12 and I'll probably die because of liver failure by 40, so why bother right?"
11904,"I can't afford a therapist (not even with a sliding scale payment) and medication doesn't help me, so I'm pretty much on my own."
11905,I was prescribed a anti anxiety medication but the problem with it is that it made my stomach burn.
11906,"I started Cipralex a few days ago and I've been getting massive headaches which are causing me even more anxiety because I didn't want to be on the medication in the first thing place...basically I'm not sure if I'm causing myself all this anxiety and thus these headaches because I keep telling myself that this medication causes headaches but after researching it,  it mihht be the actual medication that does cause headaches so I'm really confused in all..."
11907,"I'm really stressed right now because I haven't been sleeping much, my head is killing me, and im currently on a weekend trip but I'm ruining everyone's trip because I can't find the strength to get out of the hotel so I'm basically staying in bed all day and I feel bad that I'm doing that for everyone."
11908,"Any advice on how to deal with these side effects would be realllly appreciated or how to deal with headaches in general without taking advil cause I Dont want the medications to interfere 

PM me if you prefer it please and sorry for this text that most probably doesn't make sense."
11909,Thanks everyone
11910,"I also don't want to be get diagnose and prescribed meds and have frequent appointments, because my parents are guaranteed to find out since I'm on their insurance."
11911,Even with ED meds.
11912,"I'm at the point now where I'm going to ask to be referred to a psychiatrist to get medication, because I'd rather be totally sedated than deal with this for even a second longer."
11913,"I had that prescription refilled at the start of January (my second refill) and since then I've been feeling a lot of the side effects I felt when I first started the medication (indigestion, strange dreams/trouble sleeping, slight disconnect with reality at times) although maybe a little less severely than before."
11914,I also have been feeling anxious which had really been helped by the medication before.
11915,Has anything like this happened to anyone else here (even with a different medication).
11916,Does anyone else have anxiety about taking medication?
11917,"When I turned 19 and became aware of the fact that I was throwing my life away by sitting around playing video games and gorging myself on refined sugars and pork products all day, I began posting here in the hope of getting some feedback on my anxiety and the ways my daily behavior might be exacerbating its severity."
11918,"It was tremendously helpful for me then and so now, nearly three years on, I'm here again hoping to gain some outside insight on my anxieties and also where I'm going wrong in my efforts to treat them."
11919,I know well enough now that my problems stem from my tendency to cast my thoughts needlessly into the future.
11920,I can rationally assume that I am a very poor judge of what is going to happen to me in the coming months and years given that my predictions have historically been far worse than what has actually happened.
11921,"Of course, if it were enough to simply be aware of the fact that I'm a poor judge of outcomes then I wouldn't have come to an anxiety subreddit to discuss my issues."
11922,These days I make an effort to take care of myself.
11923,"I know I have body issues so I exercise to keep the fat from hanging over the edge of my trousers (My body refuses to deposit fat anywhere other than my love handles) while the endorphins keep my thoughts elevated, away from the pitfalls that await a stagnant body and mind."
11924,I know I have a chemical inclination towards anxiety and so I eschew caffeine and all refined sugars.
11925,I take flax and chia seeds with my smoothie of a morning to bring some magnesium into my diet which I have heard is useful for combating stress which leads to anxiety.
11926,Alcohol makes rare appearances in my diet but I make an effort to make sure I do not consume it to excess.
11927,Naturally when I do consume it to excess I am motivated by how negatively I feel the subsequent morning to avoid alcohol in its entirety.
11928,"Unfortunately, people always seem to want you to drink when you're my age and it's difficult to refuse without incurring feelings of social anxiety as well as feelings of self-hatred (if I decline invitations so that I won't have to consume alcohol)."
11929,In the past I've been known to use alcohol to cocoon myself into becoming a social butterfly for an evening and so people tend to carry on with the idea that I am an avid drinker and still even now I find myself to be socially incapable without a drink in my hand so I don't really have any options for socialization.
11930,I'm sure my sober self makes people feel quite uncomfortable and now even my drunk self appears to be a less-inhibited reflection of my inner misanthropic angst rather than a lumbering fun-drunk flirt (not your ideal party guest).
11931,I do not presently take any medications for my anxiety though previously I have taken zoloft (3 years) and wellbutrin/trazodone (about 5 months).
11932,I tend to carry a pot of clonazepam around with me in case I find myself in a situation where I'm about to feel very anxious to the point of panic when I really cannot afford to be disquieted (usually when I'm in the supermarket or lecture).
11933,I do not much care for clonazepam as it gives me awful pains in my joints during and for a few days after its effect.
11934,I feel negatively towards medication and resentful of the idea that I might be better off with it since I do not see why I should have to rely on medications while other people get to walk around enjoying life without them.
11935,I'm sure viewing myself as a victim doesn't help my anxiety to get better but it seems I'm helpless to avoid those patterns of thinking.
11936,Lately I have stumbled upon some new anxieties that I cannot really rationalize for myself.
11937,"I like to read because it's fun and also an independent means of achieving personal growth, however in the past month or so (following the termination of a decently long term relationship) I have found it increasingly more difficult to read without feeling incredibly anxious."
11938,"This may always have been a problem for me as I know in the past I have always read a lot less than I wanted to, but now it seems that I almost cannot stand to endure the process of reading."
11939,It's like I simultaneously want to weep for the fact that I cannot stand to put my attention so specifically into one thing and furthermore for the fact that I *expect* I won't be able to focus my mind to the task.
11940,It's like I have performance anxiety but for reading.
11941,Does anyone else experience something like this?
11942,"Speaking of performance anxiety, I'm presently in the process of seeing a sex therapist."
11943,I've only had one appointment so far and am set to have another later today.
11944,This is the fifth person I have seen for mental health purposes in my life.
11945,These sexual anxiety issues I have are body related primarily and I am intending to have a surgery next month in order to rectify an issue that keeps me from having a fulfilling sex life.
11946,I feel like I'm going crazy over this because it's elective penis surgery.
11947,"I may be miserable without it, but nothing drastic would actually happen if I didn't have it besides what I expect would be a slow deterioration in my mental health that'd land me somewhere I'd rather not be."
11948,"I've decided I need this surgery and so I'm basically accepting that what I am is wrong, and that I need to change in order to be right."
11949,"Which kinda kills me, if you can understand."
11950,"It really pulls me out of myself and makes me look back in the third person and all I really see is me as a child, helpless but innocent."
11951,It used to be (and I'm sure it still would be) that all I have to do to make myself sob is lie in my bed in the dark and picture myself from the third person.
11952,Either I'm an Olympic self-pitier or I really am that tragic of a specimen.
11953,Being reduced to begging doctors to cut apart my reproductive organs so that I can feel normal like everyone else.
11954,So I don't have to feel ashamed for being interested in girls because I'm so dysfunctional underneath.
11955,I've felt some very weird things this past year.
11956,"Sometimes when I'm around people I feel very old, but not in the sense of having experience, rather in the sense that I feel impotent and then I make myself feel unwelcome in the presence of others by pointing out to myself all the dynamic and carefree things they feel, that I don't."
11957,My roommate is my best friend and he is happy.
11958,"He has troubles with girls and he struggles and tries and gets taken advantage of sometimes, but he is at least imbued with enough goodness to do the things that make his day to day life better."
11959,I feel like shit around him.
11960,I feel like I can't do anything with myself because I can't seem to manage what I feel even though I try so much harder than him.
11961,"I tear through journals keeping track of my every day emotions and feelings, fears and worries."
11962,"I don't hold back, I dig for the nastiest most rancid looking emotion and put it on the page so I can confront it, but to no avail."
11963,I feel like a wandering idiot.
11964,I can't even approach the idea of finding work so that I might have something to fill my days and distract me from the pain I feel over my helplessness.
11965,"Every day I remind myself what a desirable thing death is, but only in speculation."
11966,"I want to feel none of what I feel and I know I've felt this way before but some part of me knows that death isn't the answer, and that even if it were my anxiety would keep me from ever trying to have it."
11967,"I'm trying to grow, but the soil isn’t giving me anything."
11968,"I'm wilting, honestly."
11969,Whatever used to be inside me that made me magnetic and charming and fun is long gone and now I just want to drown and take the whole world with me.
11970,I sit in my room.
11971,I struggle to read.
11972,I feel like death.
11973,I sleep.
11974,That's all I do.
11975,I'm totally imprisoned by my anxiety.
11976,Now the internet’s down and I’m almost feeling hopeful again.
11977,"Writing out my feelings always has that effect, even if it’s totally false."
11978,I think it’s funny how I started this post really formally and then deteriorated to shit once I stopped talking about all the things I do right.
11979,Oh look it’s back.
11980,I don’t really care what you say to me but I’d like it if you said something.
11981,I don’t really know what I’m meant to be doing anymore.
11982,"First night of a new medication, but it is supposed to make me drowsy."
11983,"First of all, let me just say I'm sorry for the wall of text."
11984,"I have a feeling this is going to be a long one, so thank you to anyone who takes the time to read it."
11985,"I am a fan of this sub, I visit it frequently on my other account but never have posted."
11986,This is a throwaway for the main reason that I don't want anyone to know about this in my personal life.
11987,"Anyway, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and PTSD 5 years ago after a major traumatic event in my life."
11988,"I did half heartedly try some medications, I was pretty much against though, because my mother has abused and has been addicted to these types of medications for as long as I can remember."
11989,I've always been terrified of going down that same road.
11990,I did agree to take adivan/lorazapam as needed when my attacks got to much to handle.
11991,I went to counselling for a long time and learned some techniques to get me through my days.
11992,I've done a ton of research and tried many different things to help me keep this under control.
11993,"But as we all know when an anxiety attack comes on it can be pretty difficult to control, but I have managed."
11994,Lately though something is different.
11995,"I have had a few blows in my life, my step father died, I moved across the country, have been struggling majorly financially to provide for my 2 year old son, fighting with my SO etc."
11996,"my anxiety has gotten considerably worse, and I've recently realized that when I am extremely anxious I am plucking out my hair."
11997,"Just one strand at a time, and I don't even realize I am doing it until I have a ball of hair in my hand."
11998,"I am not making a conscience decision to do it, I just do."
11999,"It's got me worried now, and I know I should probably go see a doctor..."
12000,But I'm afraid to... My doctor in my old town was always so pill happy.
12001,"He always wanted and pressured me to take all these different sorts of meds( mainly for depression, he was convinced I was suffering from depression as well as the anxiety, but I don't believe I was/am) and I hated them, none of the ones I tried helped me at all, granted I didn't stick to any of them that long (besides the adivan because I didn't have to take that one daily, but since moving 8 months ago I haven't even had any of those) for fear of becoming addicted/abusing meds like my mother."
12002,"I guess my question is, do any of you survive this without meds?"
12003,Are all doctors like my old one who are just happy to write you a script and send you on your way?
12004,"Just for the record here, my old doctor was just a regular family doctor, not a psychiatrist, he never did refer me to one, only a counsellor."
12005,I feel like I'm spiralling out of control.
12006,"I have a beautiful little boy that I want to be there for, but at the same time, I don't want him to grow up with a zombie of a mother like I did... Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated."
12007,"previous post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/34kec1/cant_stop_worrying_about_sleep/

So, I just had my high school graduation and i'm finally done."
12008,I was able to make it through the end of the year.
12009,I eventually was able to get into a groove (after upping my citalopram dose to 20 mg again even though i'm not sure how much it helped because it takes a while to kick in).
12010,"However, on the last night I had to do it, I had trouble getting to sleep."
12011,I'm not sure if it was because I had a lot on my mind or because I was simply uncomfortable (my room was pretty warm).
12012,"In the end, I decided to skip my last day (it wasn't  a school day, our year ends us doing internships and projects and I had an internship that was finishing up, so I didn't really miss anything)."
12013,"Since then, my worries have started up again and I've been having a lot of thoughts about not being able to keep things under control, or worse, being okay with giving up."
12014,"I'll be starting college this fall and I'll be living in a dorm, so it will be a new environment for me and I fear that I won't be able to handle it."
12015,For my entire time at high school I've made it a point to work hard and stay on track.
12016,"My biggest goal was to work hard so I had strong potential for the future, but now that I'm at that point, I'm having trouble finding a new goal to replace it."
12017,"What I do know is that my issue isn't really insomnia, but the fear of not being able to sleep."
12018,"I feel like I take my sleep too seriously (which I know is a good thing to an extent, but I'm at the point in which it's causing a load of stress)."
12019,"In the end, what I'm hoping to accomplish is being okay with the possibility of not sleeping, and being calm and relaxed about getting to sleep at night."
12020,I'm just not sure how to get there.
12021,"I don't like the idea of going on new medications, but I am definitely open to therapy."
12022,I'd love to hear some suggestions or anything you guys have to say that might help me.
12023,Thanks.
12024,"Edit: 

Just some more stuff I wanted to add:

Like I said, the sleeplessness on its own happens fairly rarely, but when it does, the usual feeling in my head is a lot of thoughts."
12025,If I had a hectic day (or just an eventful evening before I went to bed) my mind might start replaying these thoughts and prevent me from being able to relax.
12026,Another common culprit for whatever reason is a song being stuck in my head.
12027,It just plays over and over and over and I'm unable to let my mind settle.
12028,I just have no idea how to get everything under control.
12029,"Also, as of now I'm not really doing anything this summer."
12030,"I don't have a job lined up though I'd like to get one once (if) I can straighten everything out, and I'd also like to take a few online classes to prepare me for my major in college."
12031,"**About me** 

27, male, agoraphobia (at least thats what they said years ago), no medication anymore, germany

**What happened**

Almost eight years ago when I was about to finish my apprenticeship as an IT guy, I just passed out in the garden of my (ex)girlfriend for no real reason."
12032,"Tried so much (serveral therapies, medication), failed so often."
12033,"OK, so ever since i was born Ive had crippling social anxiety and panic disorder."
12034,"So much so that i can hardly leave my house, have mental breakdowns, and often contemplate suicide."
12035,"I am right now taking Prozac for my depression, anxiety and OCD and i take Klonopin for my social anxiety and my panic disorder."
12036,"I used to smoke weed for my anxiety and it worked like a charm, however my parents threatened to kick me out of the house so i was forced to stop."
12037,My question to you Redditors is what medications and treatments do you use to help you function and make it through the day.
12038,Any advice would be helpful because i am at the end of my rope with this.
12039,"Thanks,
cudderisback2"
12040,"I've had some medical issues due to getting my gallbladder out a couple years ago, which I'm on medication for and its helping."
12041,I'm about to start taking Lexapro and i'm vaguely aware that the first month or so is when the medication can cause some nasty side effects.
12042,I'm trying to be as prepared as possible so if I start feeling nauseated or something i'll know its most likely the meds and not something more sinister.
12043,Within 3 days of taking his medication I saw a severe change in how he was treatin me.
12044,I'm wondering if anyone one here has been on and off a similar medication with similar side effects and how your life was affected.
12045,I had mentioned to my boss in passing a few weeks ago that I had a therapist/psychiatrist appointment which I was going to attend.
12046,"Flash forward to yesterday, I went out to eat with him and I mentioned that now that I have insurance, I finally caught up on all my doctors appointments."
12047,"The boss responded ""That's great, but the one I was worried about is your shrink."""
12048,I took this to mean that he was concerned for my wellbeing.
12049,"As we sat down to eat, the case seemed to be otherwise."
12050,"He asked what mental condition I seek help for, and I told him."
12051,I have generalized anxiety disorder and a tendency towards depression.
12052,"As I was talking, it came out that I take an SSRI and I have a benzo to control panic attacks."
12053,The boss seemed attentive as though he were fishing for information about behavior that would be detrimental in the workplace.
12054,He kept referring to psychiatrists and psychologists as shrinks.
12055,"Then today, the boss walked into the office and mentioned  that he had experienced a borderline panic attack recently."
12056,"After mentioning it, he said ""maybe I should just go to the doctors and get happy pills like everybody else."""
12057,"Now I feel like my boss is one of those people who doesn't believe in nor understand psychiatric conditions, and I felt somewhat belittled by his comment."
12058,"This only adds to my anxiety because:

1."
12059,I don't want them to think I'm some drug addict that takes a bunch of junk that might affect my work performance.
12060,I take the medicines that I NEED to balance out the chemical deficiencies in my brain.
12061,2.
12062,"I'm (perhaps irationally) anxious that they might fire me because they feel I'm a strain on their insurance plan, fire me because they think I'm unstable, or fire me because of the drugs I take."
12063,"If I could go back, I wouldn't mention it."
12064,Now I can't seem to feel stable about my job.
12065,"I'm willing to try everything, except paying or medicine."
12066,"I've seen a doctor who has prescribed some low dose medicine, but I've been reluctant to take it as I haven't been a person to take medicine for much of anything."
12067,"breathing techniques, thoughts, meds...
Also, if you didn't have any of these and you stayed in the area when you were having the symptoms(panic attack) what happened to you?"
12068,I have ativan for panic attacks and I've tried taking other meds but they make me too sick.
12069,TLDR:Mixed messages and emotions about my meds.
12070,I'm really frustrated and just want to see if anybody else is experiencing the same symptoms as I am.
12071,"I used to feel awesome, but after a few traumatic events I've gone completely down hill."
12072,"I used to be comfortable with myself, love having a good time, love to party, hang around with friends, joke around, make chit chat with classmates, etc."
12073,"I liked to be funny, draw, play music, and all the good stuff."
12074,I'm an intelligent person and used to do very well in school but no more.
12075,After a few traumatic events (est 3-4 years ago) my personality completely changed.
12076,Here's what I feel like every day.
12077,"- I feel physically tired all day
- I haven't had a genuine laugh in years
- I can't connect with anybody, I have a few friends on the surface but no friends that I can just relax and enjoy myself with
- Extremely low self esteem
- Tons of anxiety
- Can't concentrate on my studies
- Have no passion for any subject or hobby
- Push people away when they get too close
- Constant knot in my gut
- At any time in the day I would rather be taking a nap
- Talking to anybody about anything is exhausting for me
- Constant verbal thoughts about killing myself."
12078,"Stuff like ""fucking shoot me in the face"" ""if I could push a button so that I would never exist I would"" ""kill me now"" **note that I'm not suicidal or anything, these are just thoughts that kind of precipitate out of my frustration**
- Drinking does not affect me at all in the way that it used to, so while all of my friends love to party and have a few drinks I can join but I don't enjoy myself."
12079,"- When my old friends from high school who knew me as a fun guy come back to town it just stresses me out because now I act awkward and apathetic around them
- Can't even feel comfortable around family anymore."
12080,"Things I have tried (believe me I am proactive at trying to conquer this fucking shit)

- Zoloft (Currently taking)
- Celexa
- Effexor
- Therapy
- Putting myself outside of my comfort zone/""out there""
- Never making excuses to not do something social

None of these medications have seemed to do anything and I have a strong suspicion they're probably more or less placebos."
12081,"FML

I don't think I can be fixed"
12082,Is this an indication that maybe her medication is too low dose?
12083,"He was my medicine, and the sheer idea of losing that, and then it happening, sent me over to the realm of the unfeeling."
12084,"I tried to branch out relationship-wise, thinking that was the solution, and that maybe I could find another medicine."
12085,"I'm hoping one day to completely stop taking any medication, (Still the lowest prescription of Lexapro) but I know I will always be affected in some ways."
12086,I'm not on any medication currently and I'm on a waiting list for therapy.
12087,The ER doc gave me meds - Ativan and Buspirone.
12088,"I saw a psychologist, and will continue that, but it is really hard to find a psychiatrist to help get my meds sorted out - they all have waiting lists for literally months out."
12089,"I don't take medication because I want to get pregnant again (strangely -- I do LOVE being a mom and caring for my son, and I want more kids)."
12090,"Since we've been on the medicine, his sex drive has certainly decreased somewhat but mine has become nonexistent."
12091,So I guess I don't know how much of our lack of passion can be attributed to the meds since I felt something with that other guy.
12092,"Lately my anxiety and panic have been acting up, I have a substance use therapist that helps a lot and am in the process of getting a dedicated anxiety therapist but I don’t want to go on medication."
12093,I have been on cipralex for five weeks now and it's great.
12094,I don't think I've ever felt this good.
12095,My only concern is that I'm really not sure what I can and cannot mix with it.
12096,"The insert it came with listed a bunch of medicines I've never heard of as well as ibuprofen, St Johns Wort and ""some cold medications."""
12097,My doctor left on maternity leave right before my refill and I saw another doctor long enough for him to write me a new script so I didn't get to ask any of the questions I had prepared for my doctor.
12098,"I have a killer cold at the moment and when I went to fill my prescription today, I asked the pharmacist and she said that I could take a decongestant but not an antihistamine."
12099,Does anyone have additional information or experience with mixing cipralex with something like nyquil.
12100,Thanks in advance.
12101,"But due to money, I treated with my meds at home (tons of benedryls, Xanax, Gax-X, 2 halves of Vicodin over 8 hrs, plus ice bags and breathing bag for hyperventilation) — it was HELL from 5mt after I ate some of the yogurt (lunchtime) until about 11pm last night."
12102,"They called back, and I'd called them a few weeks ago with similar issues, only I said it was panic and maybe crazy drugs (as doc was giving me various crazy meds over last few months, but I just wanted stability, as before I got sick with c-dif)."
12103,"So you do exposure therapy and face your fear, letting yourself be afraid without anxiety medication or alcohol, and then that fear goes away."
12104,So yesterday I forgot to take my AM and PM medications.
12105,On top of that I had too much caffeine yesterday and as a result was wide awake in bed all night - didn't sleep *at all*.
12106,I feel like I'm going to have a mental breakdown.
12107,And today is *supposed* to be a good day.
12108,It's my company's summer outing.
12109,I don't even have to do work today.
12110,"Food, ice cream, mini golf, all kinds of stuff."
12111,And all I want to do is curl up in a ball on the floor.
12112,I haven't felt this awful for a long time.
12113,I hope this isn't the beginning of another major depressive episode.
12114,I've been struggling with anxiety most of my life.
12115,"Mostly generalized and social anxiety, with occasional anxiety attacks."
12116,"I've also been diagnosed with ADHD, and after visiting two psychiatrists, both first suggested Lexapro."
12117,I tried it but noticed a decrease in libido and inability to maintain an erection.
12118,"I've always had trouble maintaining erections which I believe to be poor circulation, but felt like the Lexapro made this worse."
12119,"I stopped the Lexapro, and tried Vyvanse to help with ADHD."
12120,"I'm a software engineer, and weight lifter and noticed huge improvements in my work, focus, and energy levels."
12121,I do not have problems with erections or libido when I take the Vyvanse early in the morning.
12122,"The side effects were slight insomnia, raised anxiety and irritability and worst of all has been **premature ejaculation**."
12123,I've always had performance anxiety with sex which I know exacerbates my sexual dysfunction but I'm getting so frustrated with the additional side effects of these medications.
12124,"SSRI's are known to help with premature ejaculation, but Lexapro gave me ED

Vyvanse *may* have amplified premature ejaculation for me, but this might just be an increased anxiety."
12125,I have never tried both drugs at the same time.
12126,"I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar issues, or had experience with both Vyvanse and an SSRI."
12127,Any advice is appreciated
12128,I'm withdrawing off Lexapro for the third time and I was wondering how people managed to live life off meds.
12129,"Then I got a job and a new apartment and I thought ""Oh life will be good now, I can totally get off these meds."""
12130,What I'm more concerned about is how people manage to stay off medication long-term.
12131,":(

So, I'm going for a good ol' clean start with medication."
12132,Met my current gf during my hardest year and was prescribed Lexapro 10 MG to go along with my stimulant medication.
12133,feel like a failure because i told my mom everything was fine and the medication was working fine.
12134,"* After seeing her, she suggested putting me on Zoloft starting at 0.25mg, but I wanted therapy sessions before I started taking medication."
12135,"You go to the doctor, they get you on some new medicine."
12136,Maybe the medicine doesn't work.
12137,Maybe you got to try a different medicine.
12138,"My hands have been shaking all day (despite taking anti-anxiety meds), and the adrenaline surges will not stop."
12139,I have taken medication in the past (last time maybe 6 mos ago) but had to stop because the side effects were kicking my ass.
12140,"I've honestly avoided taking anti-anxiety meds and anti-depressants, because they make me feel so tired throughout the day."
12141,"I'm sorry if the following wall of text is a bunch of garblecrap, but I feel like I'm losing it."
12142,I'm 27f and I'm crying like I'm 5 years old again.
12143,"I've been to counseling, I'm afraid of actual medications, and my dad is my only soothing savior because he is a licensed mental health practitioner and knows how to handle the craziest of crazies."
12144,"My mom, on the other hand, is an alcoholic bipolar manic depressive, she's 54 and has driven me crazy all my life."
12145,"She too, acts like a toddler in ways I'M TRYING SO HARD NOT TO BE."
12146,"But sometimes it gets too hard and I have to cry my ass off at night thinking about how much I resent her for the hell she's put me and my dad through (they've been divorced for most of my life), and yet how much I need her embrace all at once."
12147,"In the last year I've begun a process of detachment from her in such a careful way that doesn't totally destroy her, because she's too fucking fragile to be around."
12148,"I'd been making so much progress with my own emotional strength and maturity that maybe I got cocky, so I decided I was okay to finally go visit her for a few days, if anything to see my grandma and other family members too."
12149,"Well, right before taking off, my boyfriend and I had another almost-breakup conversation but decided to work things out when I got back."
12150,"I think all my reserved strength for the week got spent towards being okay with that and suddenly I was vulnerable to serious emotions regarding my mom, past, family, etc again."
12151,But none of it hit me until I got back home.
12152,Now I'm home.
12153,"I've been sick with a cold for the past few days, bed-ridden, watching endless Netflix (The Office) and reflecting on the rocky state of my year and a half long relationship with my boyfriend who's been going through a personal crisis of his own this past winter (turning 29, starting a new extremely-stressful job, falling depressed, pushing me out, etc) ...and so I lost my shit."
12154,"* I'm so scared I'll never get over my parents' divorce, no matter how much counseling I get or how much I talk about it."
12155,"* I'm afraid that after last week, my only solution really is to cut her out of my life because I was doing so well until I saw her."
12156,* I'm afraid I'll never get over how much I resent/need my mom.
12157,"* I'm afraid I'm too much to handle when I break down like this, and that my boyfriend or anybody else is going to give up soon enough, or eventually."
12158,(My self-esteem hits rock bottom during these moments and I'm super mean to myself.
12159,I know I shouldn't be but I CAN'T HELP IT.
12160,MY BRAIN IS FULL OF FUCK.
12161,"IT'S SO LOUD)
* When people try to help me, my mind tries to convince me that people are annoyed with me, hate me, wish they were doing something else, etc."
12162,I hate it.
12163,"I hate subjecting people to my shit, especially my boyfriend because he has no clue what to do or say, and then I get frustrated, and he gets frustrated, and I panic that we're doomed and it's an endless nightmare."
12164,"My goals are to be better than this, but I am having the worst time believing in myself again."
12165,"I, in theory, want to be a wife and mother, but I cannot for the life of me see myself as being any good at it because of my own mother's shitty example."
12166,"""Well, take the things that she did wrong, and don't do those things!"""
12167,OH OKAY.
12168,Like it's so simple.
12169,"This is me, plus crying: http://i.imgur.com/Lfhilia.jpg


tl;dr: I'm in a windtunnel of fear, panic, negativity, and ""I can do this."
12170,"No I can't."""
12171,Is there any sort of emergency action that anxiety patients are able to take to get more medication even before they are eligible for a refill?
12172,"it started in 2011 and i got on meds ( 25mg of amitriptyline) in early 2012 and it was good for a while, I had my life back but it gets worse then gets slightly better then worse then slightly better... sometimes I leak a tiny bit."
12173,"I took medication to try and calm down, but nothing works."
12174,Going to try one last time to beat this thing without meds.
12175,Could it be because of my meds(Sertraline/Zoloft)?
12176,"Before I started taking medication for my depression and anxiety, I started becoming absolutely fearful everyday I was going to have to go to the doctor or hospital and get some sort of surgery."
12177,"Last week, 1 or 2 years of feeling pretty good on my meds, I found out I had to get an operation."
12178,"He is not on any medication btw and, until recently, has refused to even see a doctor."
12179,He is suppose to be seeing a doctor this Monday who will prescribe medication.
12180,"I'm not against medication in any sense, I just think maybe I haven't found the right one."
12181,"Got on new medication then taken off it, now can't eat at all, slowly going to starve to death....oh boy...so much fun."
12182,I refused to take Lexipro because I don't want to depend on medication like that.
12183,"Uh, not really sure where else to put this, but I just took an extra 50mg of my zoloft medication that I use for my anxiety."
12184,This round of exams in particular is pretty difficult because I *need* to pass everything to keep my provisional place in a graduate medicine program.
12185,How do you guys keep your head about you when you don't know if you are really messing up or if it is just the meds?
12186,"I was recently treated for depression with medication, and one of the side effects is anxiety, which I usually don't have to deal with very often."
12187,I started having serious panic attacks daily back in October 2012.
12188,They would be so severe I would have to go to the hospital almost daily  due to my blood pressure going as high as 190/120 and my hear rate exceeding 150bpms.
12189,It took about two weeks to confirm this as panic disorder.
12190,I was a paramedic for several years prior to having this happen to me.
12191,They placed me on celexa and clonezapam.
12192,The clonezapam was 0.5mg twice daily and celexa was initially 10 raised to 20mg later.
12193,During those two years my life accelerated down hill very fast.
12194,I developed agoraphobia and major depressive even while on celexa with suicidal ideation.
12195,I couldn't work a job and getting actual treatment with no health insurance was very difficult.
12196,Mental health care is lacking in the USA to say the least and I was bounced from provider to provider when I was able to actually see someone through either a clinic or medicaid.
12197,Most of them just wanted to keep me on the status quo since the panic attacks effectively stopped once on klonipin and I never abused / raised the dose.
12198,"It would be ok, but I was still unable to function like a normal person in society and could no longer work as a medic as my cert lapsed."
12199,After getting past agoraphobia via by taking a break from the Celexa I thought i was going to make progress.
12200,However the depression and suicidal ideation was too much so I was back on it.
12201,With a better understanding of it the agoraphobia was still there just not as bad as before.
12202,I obtained a pretty good job as an emergency communications officer for a county government however I lost it 5 months in due to problems with depression.
12203,Fed up with how my life has only become worse on the medications after 2 straight years on clonezapam and almost 2 on celexa I stopped them cold turkey.
12204,I stopped celexa first and then 3 weeks later clonezapam.
12205,I was in a world of pain for a month straight with constant anxiety / pain in my ribs chest etc but not panic is the best way to describe it.
12206,There was also insomnia.
12207,Eventually it passed and I felt better then ever.
12208,Until last week its about 3 full months off the medicine and I had a serious panic attack that wound me up in the hospital.
12209,These attacks are beyond my control it starts and goes full throttle in an instant.
12210,I feel and get convinced I will die no matter how much I tell my self other wise.
12211,The attack continued for hours in the hospital until they finally gave me iv ativan.
12212,They then sent me home with 1mg ativan 16 pills total.
12213,Each day since being home I have had to take two a day and the anxiety / panic is barely manageable.
12214,Is this my life now if I don't start clonezapam again?
12215,I am basically homeless as I write this with a job starting this week at a major themepark as a landscaper making a whopping 8.35 an hour.
12216,Quite the fall from grace if you knew how independent and well off I was before.
12217,I have zero friends from this.
12218,My girlfriend of 8 years is all I have and even she has her own problems.
12219,I don't know what to do.
12220,When does this resolve?
12221,I'm excited for the new job and I'm hoping it will get me through this but 8.35 an hour is not a livable wage anymore and with no friends or family left I am one mishap from being on the streets.
12222,I'm quietly staying in my girlfriends apartment she has with a gay male roommate.
12223,Its two bedrooms.
12224,I have bills and will probably lose my car which is almost paid off before I can get caught up.
12225,"I'm 31 years old, tell me there is a way out of this."
12226,"Long story short, I have been off my meds for a few months now and am having a full on meltdown."
12227,"I am already in danger of losing my job due to my ""attitude"" lately and taking unscheduled time off will be the final straw.I need to get this doctor to put me on short-term disability while I get on some meds and get myself stabilized."
12228,Hello internet people.
12229,This is my first post.
12230,I have decided to tell a few people that I have anxiety problems.
12231,I recently lost two of my best friends within 4 months and am finding things hard.
12232,Was wondering what you do that may help me other than the medications I'm on.
12233,Any advice is appreciated.
12234,I don't know how to communicate that my medication might need to be changed.
12235,I said OK and got the medication.
12236,"Has anyone experienced anything like this, on those meds or otherwise?"
12237,"I'm hoping to try some medicine for anxiety in late August, and I really hope that helps."
12238,A year ago when I started seeing a therapist I was again told I had GAD and mild OCD with regards to intrusive thoughts and also a panic disorder that developed since trying to go through this medication free.
12239,But if I do that wouldn't it be possible that my body may develop some resistance to it and make the medicine not work ?
12240,Would someone on anxiety meds just not even have a care about it?
12241,It is very frustrating and it feels like my meds aren't helping at all when before they were.
12242,I am a Mental Health Nurse developing an outpatient group for people diagnosed with various Mental Health conditions.
12243,"To start, people with depression and anxiety will be the majority of the group members."
12244,"This will be an 8-12 week (not sure yet) long group, with a CBT basis-heavy on the mood logs and goal setting."
12245,"There will be guest speakers for relevant topics: medication, relationships, fitness, mindfulness, finances, etc."
12246,"This isn't a ""support group"" in that it will be structured and clients will know what each session will cover."
12247,"However, I am very pro-discussion time and feel that this is when a lot of breakthroughs happen."
12248,"One last note, I myself have a significant history of depression and anxiety."
12249,"With support, 1:1 counseling, independent learning and (in the past) multiple medications, I am now confident and getting up in front of groups like a rock-star nurse!"
12250,"I have never personally been in any groups like this... and this is why I ask what people want/need, like/hate..."
12251,Thanks in advance for your input!
12252,I'm less stressed already and the medicine hasn't even kicked in.
12253,"hey guys, I just have a quick question."
12254,"I've been having anxiety and panic attacks for about 6 months now, recently it got worse so I finally forced myself to get some help."
12255,"Anyway, I've been prescribed xanax (0,5 3 times a day, but I'm trying to take them only when I need them so I take 1-2 per day)."
12256,"I can say it's definitely working for me, I feel more relaxed, more social and more functional in general."
12257,"The thing is, when I was getting my prescription, shrink asked if I thought I needed some antidepressants too and I decided to try just xanax first, see if it helps and if it does, avoid additional ""unecessary"" medications."
12258,"Well, as I said, xanax is really doing wonders for my anxiety, but every time I take one, I feel my anxiety getting better after 15 min, but I also feel depressed for the first hour or two, and by depressed I mean I usually cry, don't want to interact with people around me, feel like nothing matters or makes sense etc."
12259,"I should mention that this doesn't happen every time, but like 8/10 cases."
12260,"Anyway, it usually lasts for about an hour or two, and then I just start feeling relaxed and ready to cope with everyday activities which usually represent a trigger for me."
12261,My question is: is this normal?
12262,has anyone else experienced that sad/depressed feeling after taking it?
12263,Or does that mean I should consider antidepressants too?
12264,"and as a result.... just stay inside as long you can?~ What worked for you medication-wise because I feel like I've tried everything?~





(It might not help that I cancelled my last 3 appointments too.)"
12265,Uhhhh feel a little bit lightheaded... kinda woozy... maybe it was those meds I took... maybe it was my breakfast... maybe its low blood sugar... maybe its high blood pressure... maybe it's a stroke... maybe it's a heart attacks... my mind and heart start to race.
12266,Is there another way to get medication without a blood test?
12267,"i often worry (even post meds) that the chefs in a restaurant will mess with my food, or that certain food isnt cooked properly, or that some people are out to get me (not to an extreme but to a nuisance degree)"
12268,"For the past few months I have been getting weird spurts of anxiety and depression, when previously I have been fine for about 3 or 4 years on my medicine."
12269,"I've been to the doctor, she raised my meds for now, but is going to get me into a psych therapist to better prescribe."
12270,"I'm taking medicine: alprazolam and propranolol for my anxiety, to be taken when I need to perform academic tasks that require me to talk."
12271,"It's/I'm not as severe as some of what I've read here, and I'm kind of doubting my diagnosis in retrospect but I'm glad I have the option for the medicine, I guess."
12272,I don't take medication.
12273,"Despite meds and therapy I keep sliding down to where I am, unable to function at work and so afraid of failing little things that I always fail the big things."
12274,I was recently diagnosed with GAD and have had issues with depression in the past.
12275,My doctor has really been encouraging me to try medication but it's never been something I've wanted to try.
12276,I have had a few friends who've reacted terribly to medications &amp; it's really put me off of the concept...
12277,But my anxiety has become rather crippling recently &amp; I'm starting to open up to the possibility.
12278,So I'm basically crowdsourcing experiences with medications as treatment for anxiety and/or depression.
12279,Tell me your stories!
12280,"I have medicine, but try to head off these attacks before they occur!"
12281,I've been on medication but would like extra tips for calming myself down when i have one.
12282,"The gist of it is that I was laid of from my job and lost my medical insurance and thus lost my ability to get prescription meds, specifically Prozac."
12283,I've been off them for about two weeks and have noticed I've been experiencing [brain zaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome) and am just wondering if there's any way to cope with this as well as possibly deal with onset of increased anxiety which was the reason I was taking these meds in the first place.
12284,"So, I will tell you a little about myself in this, first, paragraph."
12285,"I'm 23 years old, I have been a bit social phobic, and have always had anxiety and depression since I was a small child."
12286,I had a break down in Feburary in which I was put into a facility so I wouldn't harm myself.
12287,"I had became detracted from the outside world a little more as the last couple years went by, then it was like boom, I couldn't go to work, I couldn't be out in public, I can't drive my car, be out in my yard, etc."
12288,"So I agreed with my Dad that we would go to Six Flags this monday coming up (7-30-12), and the closer it gets to Monday the more I am starting to freak out."
12289,"I have not, in almost two years, been out in a crowd like that without my fiance."
12290,"I'm afraid I might faint or hyperventilate, or go into a full on panic attack in front of everyone and ruin my Dad and his gf, and her two kids, trip."
12291,"I am going because I have been pretty much cooped up for 4 years, seeing people every now and again."
12292,"So this is a HUGE LEAP for me to do something like this, when I can't even go into the grocery store alone to get milk without feeling like my chest is going to explode!"
12293,"Any advice, I'm bringing extra hydroxyzine with me, that is what I am prescribed as an extra to my Prozac."
12294,As for medications I'm not sure what I can do.
12295,"I'm so scared HELP ;_; I can't back out now, he already bought tickets and everything."
12296,I'm freaking out right now...so yeah Advice Pls
12297,":)

Tl;dr: Have to go w/o benzo meds for a few days bc doctor is on vacation."
12298,"During this time, I have been taking my medication (clonazepam, generic for klonopin) nearly daily, maybe having an odd good day in between where I didn't need it."
12299,"So, after a week of taking the meds almost every day, I'm now trying not to take it, and feeling fairly awful."
12300,Time to get some meds
12301,Am considering (putting off) going back on medication again because I am frightened of the negative side effects I experienced last time.
12302,Would appreciate some insight into other's experiences on medication :3
12303,I have meds to assist me (propranolol and lorazepam).
12304,I did have some meds on board to help though.
12305,Not sure what's happening but I get soft easy now (I'm usually always rock hard) and I know it's the medicine.
12306,"Girlfriend stuff, work, medicine issues... and I don't 100% know what's actual stress and stress from the klonopin."
12307,I'm really not sure if I want to start taking this medicine.
12308,"*""  ""*I can't go back to my old psychiatrist or my GP for my meds because they will be utterly convinced that I am a drug-seeker."
12309,"*""  ""*The doctors that say they want to help me refuse to give me the only meds that I have found that actually help me."
12310,"If I went to the doctors with a broken arm, I would expect them to set it, put it in a cast, give me pain meds and show me the door."
12311,"There is no need for them to agitate the injury or for me to **explain** why I need to have my arm reset, or need pain meds to make the agony more bearable."
12312,"**

**At first i just wanted to ask about medication....but when i was finishing writing this, I decided that i was going to call the doctor to ask for some soft benzodiazepines for my exam period."
12313,"I plan on seeing a school counselor or psychiatrist and from what I've read on various sites online, it seems to me that I'll probably end up getting medicine for my GAD."
12314,"Hopefully I don't need the medicine, but just in case I do I figured I'd reddit."
12315,1.
12316,What medications have you taken?
12317,2.
12318,Have they been successful?
12319,3.
12320,Were there any side effects?
12321,"I know everyone reacts differently, but I figured I'd ask here just to kind of get an idea."
12322,Feel free to add anything else into your answers.
12323,Thanks!
12324,"So, I've been dianosed with the anxiety and panic for a few years, and I'm doing alright with all of that, still on meds."
12325,"I'm sitting here typing this, subdued by the meds, and still thinking ""you fucking idiot, now shit's always going to be awkward with her, why even talk to her?""."
12326,"Don't wait as long as I did to get help, whether it be therapy/medication/or something else."
12327,I've been dealing with severe depression and anxiety since maybe 14 (24 now).
12328,"Started with physical harming, and later found myself dealing with drugs, alcohol, and many abusive relationships."
12329,I knew I needed to get away from all the people I was surrounding myself with because they were just enabling me to do these things.
12330,I moved away to another state and things started to get better!
12331,"I started making new friends, found a non-douchebag guy I didn't friendzone instantly, and I wasn't harming myself!"
12332,"I don't do drugs anymore, I seldomly drink when we go out, I *try* to exercise when I can..."
12333,BUT without falling back to my old ways I find it harder to deal with them spot on.
12334,"My anxiety is ten times better than it ever has been, it never fully went away, but instead of it being EVERY SINGLE DAY BAD, now its just SURPRISE!"
12335,JUST WANTED TO SAY HI BY RUINING A RANDOM DAY OF THE WEEK FOR YOU!
12336,"So, I lost my job back in May and ever since then my depression and anxiety have sky rocketed.."
12337,It's hard for me to even leave the house most days.
12338,"My friends think I'm just blowing them off when I say ""Hey my anxiety is really bad I don't think I can hang out right now""."
12339,It is extremely frustrating wanting to have friends but not be able to have them for a lack of better way to phrase it..
12340,I have a hard enough time trusting people with the background I've had so to let someone in and then it not work out is like a total blow to my self esteem.
12341,"I've tried seeing therapists (no luck), I've tried medications (no luck)..."
12342,"The only thing that keeps me sane is my significant other, but I don't want to keep using him as a crutch."
12343,**What ways have you found to help make and keep friends?
12344,And what things have helped keep your anxiety down?
12345,**
12346,I was reading about heart related stuff in regards to a medication I may start and then they started a couple of days ago.
12347,"I've had anxiety and mania for years, nothing new."
12348,I'm not much into medications but I do have some small valium on hand.
12349,I took two housecleaning jobs outside of the home to pick up extra money and get out my anxiety.
12350,Both employers have told me I do a great job and they're very happy.
12351,"Today was simple, I worked for one of them, but I was purchasing a dresser from the other one so I had to go to her husbands office to pick it up."
12352,"Everything went smooth, but I feel like I texted to enthusiastically about the dumb dresser, it's just furniture but I always take it over the top."
12353,"Anyway, went to the other place to work and really no issues, the other one texts me looking for her swiffer."
12354,"I've never seen or used it but it upsets me so much that she can't find it that I start to needlessly text her again, finally being so stupid I text her that I'll go buy her one and bring it to her."
12355,Way over the top and she probably thinks there's really something wrong with me.
12356,I just want to smoke cigarettes (I'm not a smoker of cigarettes) and run there is so much adrenaline running through my body.
12357,"I'm almost ready to call up and quit the job with the missing swiffer because I feel so damn stupid, and I didn't even know this problem existed and it really has nothing to do with me?"
12358,"This makes no sense, what is going on with me?"
12359,I just needed to get this out.
12360,"As ridiculous as it seems, I am very anti-medication (I was on some for five years, which helped form my opinion), so I haven't considered the option just yet."
12361,"I've been considering asking my psychiatrist for some anti-anxiety meds to help for when I get really anxious, although usually it manifests as nausea, pooping a lot [TMI, I know], and insomnia."
12362,"In the morning, my mom got my meds (Ativan) and gave them to me before she left to do errands."
12363,I needed my medicine.
12364,I have tried CBT and SSRI medicine.
12365,"I just started treatment (meds + therapy) for depression and GAD, and a new major source of anxiety for me is that my health care providers don't believe me -- I worry that I'm just whiny, it's just first world problems, I'm somehow faking it, I'm not sick enough, it's all in my head, etc."
12366,"It's making me not want to continue treatment, but rationally I know that at least my prescribing doc thought the issues were serious enough for meds."
12367,"I'm not sure about about others on here, but I would at some point, like to live a life not taking these meds... 

You can PM me or respond on here, but you are highly appreciate for your thoughts, feedback, or similar experience."
12368,I came off meds because of the seemingly unstoppable and slow weight gain.
12369,I was great on the meds and I'm afraid I made a mistake.
12370,"Plus, I want to see if I can get through this without medication."
12371,"As I've been through many medications now, I thought it might be interesting to list my experiences and I'd like to compare them to yours if you'd like to share."
12372,**Lexapro**: Think I started on 30mg and went up to 50mg.
12373,I found no changes what so ever.
12374,I didn't even feel sick or get any symptoms for the first few weeks of starting them.
12375,For some reason the drug had no effect on me.
12376,**Tamazepam**: A drug to help you go into a deeper sleep at night.
12377,I was taking this in combination with the Lexapro.
12378,No discernible effects.
12379,**Prestiq**: Started on 50mg and went to 100mg.
12380,As far as side effects this was by far the most active.
12381,I'd get intense burning all over my body mixed with electric jolt sensations.
12382,I found the side effects too unbearable that it was just adding to the anxiety.
12383,I remember going to the movies with my wife and just be dripping in sweat and felt like my whole body was on fire.
12384,"I've since always felt the burning sensations after taking this medication, it's become a part of my anxiety now."
12385,**Avanza**: This one went too far in the opposite direction.
12386,In that I was like a zombie.
12387,"I didn't talk at all, I'd go to bed as soon as the sun went down and I just didn't care about a damn thing."
12388,"My wife said I wasn't like me any more, I was barely looking after my daughter and not spending time with my wife."
12389,But I'm not quite sure if this was the drug or a deep depression phase I was going through.
12390,"Either way, I realized I had very little quality of life, I was merely drifting through the day so I could go to sleep soon as night hit."
12391,**Zyprexa**: A drug usually used for schizophrenia but has also been effective with anxiety sufferers in low doses.
12392,It was given to me to take with the avanza (zyprexa during the day and avanza at night).
12393,"This wasn't too bad, no discernible side effects (although the dose was low) and did seem to reduce the anxiety."
12394,I'm not sure why this one was scrapped.
12395,I think when I told them about the avanza they just decided it's best to take me off everything and try something else.
12396,**Lovan**: Wasn't on this for very long.
12397,I kept throwing up everything I ate.
12398,**Aropax**: Finally something that worked with minimal side effects.
12399,"I was on these for a fair while, I started becoming active again, working around the house."
12400,I did start noticing some weight gain.
12401,I started get additional stresses at this point because my work decided it might be best for me to take 3 months off to focus on my health as I was not performing well.
12402,I eventually had financial trouble and dealing with insurance companies to get temporary income benefit which was like climbing Mt Everest.
12403,I ended up relapsing and decided to go back to mental health.
12404,**Faverin**: They decided to put me on this drug which I'm still taking now which they said was very similar to the Aropax.
12405,It's been not bad.
12406,I'm on 100mg and it hasn't removed much of the anxiety symptoms but does take the edge off and I guess make it more controlled/manageable to the point that I can do other things (like mindfulness).
12407,Since the aropax my weight has gone from 60kg to 95kg.
12408,"I'm a slim build so this isn't usual, definitely something with the medication."
12409,I've since fallen back down to around 85kg.
12410,**Endep**: Helps with sleep.
12411,I take this in combination with the faverin.
12412,I'm better than I've been on anything else so I'm sticking with it for awhile.
12413,I have had something happen on my current medication but it's very rare.
12414,"A few times I've been jolted awake and can't go back to sleep, my brain seems to go spastic and I see the room bounce back and forth like a speaker, when I close my eyes I see light pulses."
12415,Feels like my brains flicking through radio channels and just one thought to the next.
12416,"For some reason it doesn't bother me though, I feel very calm so I don't care."
12417,"If you're on any of these and would like to talk about them let me know, I'm happy to share more about them if it helps you compare it to your own experience."
12418,"Right now I have Ativan prescribed to me, 1-2mg tablets sublingual daily, as needed."
12419,Some days my anxiety isn't that bad and don't feel like I need one.
12420,Other days it feels that I do.
12421,Rarely do I take 2mg.
12422,I feel like this is a bandaid solution as I have been told that Ativan or benzos in general shouldn't be taken for long periods of time?
12423,"My doctor has informed me that because I take it here and there, that there really isn't much risk for addiction etc... Oh I should also note I have only had it prescribed since about last May."
12424,However I feel that I may be interested in trying to fix this problem with medication suited for it I guess?
12425,"I should note I have had therapy, I have taken group anxiety disorder classes which taught cognitive behavioural therapy."
12426,"The CBT I feel helped but I finished that at the end of October and I feel my anxiety may just be returning to normal again due to life stress (baby on the way, work, etc....)

I guess my questions are: what medications are usually prescribed?"
12427,which ones are the good ones/bad ones?
12428,Meaning what are some drugs people have had success with.
12429,And finally how long are these usually prescribed for?
12430,"I've heard people say until you feel better, but if the meds make me feel better, why stop?"
12431,Anyway thanks in advance for answering any of my questions.
12432,I never tried anti-depressants since my father has been taking medicine for so long and now he can't live without them.
12433,"From the medicine all I experienced was dizziness and low energy, and partially helped for my sleep problem."
12434,I finished the medicine a week or less before Christmas with no results.
12435,Is this because I'm off my medication?
12436,"Im only 22 and have meds and regular therapy, but still this waking panic is such a shit way to start the day."
12437,"I have a long history of dealing with severe anxiety without medication, not that successfully, but I never was diagnosed in the past despite suffering for decades."
12438,She's already on anxiety medication but is basically non-functional at school and will probably have to leave entirely in the next few months.
12439,"She has seen my meds, but I have just downplayed it until she didn't even worry about it."
12440,"I started going to therapy, but she cannot prescribe medication."
12441,What was the first medication you were prescribed and how did it affect you?
12442,"I felt it necessary to share with you all here, that with the right support and treatment, **you can improve your way of life**, and quite possibly without relying on medication."
12443,"I had to stop seeing my therapist, stop taking my meds and stop seeing my doctor."
12444,He doesn't even seem to care how hard it is for me off my meds.
12445,"Before I start I just want to say I am not on any meds, and haven't been told I have anxiety, but sometimes you just know."
12446,"Is this a ""hey powertape33 grow some balls and nut up"" kind of thing, a ""you're just a little insecure, go exercise"" kind of thing,  or is this a ""hey, you should see a therapist or consider anxiety medication"" kind of thing?"
12447,"And to top it off I can't believe that exercising, having a good diet, doing some 5htp/omega 3/ therapy/ meds can stop these thoughts or this identification with anxiety."
12448,Any tips or maybe some herb or relaxing medication?
12449,"I know all the ways that should fix it - exposure, CBT, meds - and in some ways, I have improved."
12450,"Here's the link: http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/54028-treating-anxiety-safely-effectively/

It breaks down the pharmacological MOAs of all the more common (and many more obscure) anxiety medicines and why they are or aren't feasible as a safe and effective long-term solution, with references to relevant scientific studies and intelligent discussion in the following pages of the thread."
12451,"Naturally this isn't the be-all-end-all of what you should and shouldn't be taking - many of you will have had great luck with some of the less-recommended meds, and horrible reactions to the ones that get the ""okay""."
12452,Everyone's different!
12453,"But at the same time I think it's useful to have an understanding of why certain things can be dangerous, why certain things really work, and why you might have had a bad reaction to something."
12454,"All of us know that benzos can be addictive and that excessive use can be dangerous and cause severe dependency, withdrawal, etc."
12455,"But having a basic understanding of  what's going on in your brain to cause these subjective experiences, for me at least, makes it far easier to understand and adhere to such cautionary advice."
12456,"If something you're taking isn't discussed in the thread and you're looking for similar insight into how it works, then search around the Longecity forum and you'll inevitably find relevant discussion about it, or otherwise make a post yourself and you'll likely receive advice in a timely fashion."
12457,"I know at least a few of you have probably stumbled onto the Longecity forum before, but for those who haven't I hope this can at least be of some help or interest!"
12458,"He gave me another
medication to control the extra beats, It has been helping."
12459,For others who have OCD - are there any meds that help with it?
12460,I once worked at a fast food place for six months and it was probably the worst of my life.
12461,"People don't understand that when I say I can't have a job, it's not because I don't want to, it is too much for my mental health."
12462,"Even though I'm only 16, I feel like I'm supposed to have a job."
12463,I'm not supposed to have my parents buy me clothes or pay for my bills.
12464,"When I had a job, it didn't seem like there was anything worth doing when I wasn't working."
12465,"The only thing I did was go under extreme panic about my next shift, even if it was days away."
12466,I don't mean doing something I would always do while worrying about it.
12467,"I would lie in bed for hours, shaking, crying, feeling like I was going to die."
12468,It got worse and worse every day.
12469,I took daily medications for anxiety.
12470,"It didn't help much, so my doctor prescribed me pills that I can take when I'm experiencing bad anxiety."
12471,Didn't help.
12472,I feel like nobody understands.
12473,My parents think I just don't want to have a job.
12474,The thing is I really fucking do.
12475,"Trust me, If I could not have an extreme panic attack every time I think about applying for a job, I wouldn't."
12476,It's not something I can get over.
12477,I've tried so hard.
12478,I've been unemployed for over a year now.
12479,"I have frequent nightmares where I'm at my job again, as dumb as that sounds."
12480,It still gives me anxiety just thinking about it.
12481,It just makes me feel like I'm so fucked for my future.
12482,How am I going to live on my own and support myself if I can't handle a job.
12483,I honestly can't imagine myself being stable at all while having one.
12484,"I guess what I am trying to say is, do you think I need medication for this trip?"
12485,On the other hand I have never wanted to take medication for this and have never asked for any from my doctor.
12486,"Any advice on how to cope with this type of anxiety, or options to seek medication would be really helpful."
12487,"*I guess this is the best subreddit for writing about my experience.. so here I go..*

Its sometimes difficult do describe your exactly 'ilness' or in better words: to be exact as possible when using words like anxiety disorder or depression, but thinking of all that I've read, experienced and got explained from my psychotherapist/ psychologist, the title describes it at best."
12488,**What happened to you?
12489,"** ...it happened four years back...I was a normal young man,  21 years old and I left Europe for a whole year to work at a volunteer organisation in South Africa."
12490,"I never had a problem with tight spaces, e.g."
12491,"full busses or trains, croweded stadiums etc."
12492,"One day during my stay in South Africa, we went for a trip with some other volunteers."
12493,"We were driving with a normal car, so there were three seats in the back, but as you might know, the laws considering traffic are not that strict, so we were sitting with actually four people in the back since we were six people (including driver) going on a short trip."
12494,"It was very tight in the back, we were sitting uncomfortable and the ride took about an hour; until then, no problem for me!"
12495,"We took a look around (it was some kind of national park which we were visting) and drove back, same situation: I was sitting in the back of the car, in between three other people."
12496,"After five or ten minutes of driving, a feeling came up, that is very hard to describe."
12497,"Somehow i felt sick, like I had to throw up, but then again not really, I was feeling like im about to faint, I just didnt know was kind exact problem my body was to tell me, I couldnt 'classify' the feeling which made me feel very uncomfortable."
12498,"I will sum up the story here: we had to stop, I got some water and fresh air, changed seats with the guy sitting in front and contuined to drive home."
12499,"Since that day everything started, I dont know what exactly happened there, and I will probably never know."
12500,"Since that day those moments of feeling uncomfortable in a situation where are 'many' people on one space, came up more and more frequently."
12501,I was already fearing about my flight back to Europe - but obviously I made it.
12502,Back home i started studying at a university.
12503,"You can imagine that the lecture halls and the rooms with many people in it, were not the best moments for me - actually it started to become a fucking nightmare for me."
12504,"A year or more passed, and I couldnt stand it anymore, I couldnt go to university and I slowly realized that I have to do something about it, otherwise I will become a person who will never leave the house anymore."
12505,**What are your exact symptoms?
12506,"** Well if I'm in a situation, a place, where are many people, especially in one room (that could be on a bus, train, in an airplane, even in a taxi/car) I start to feel some kind of dizzy, I'm sweating, my heart beats as fast as possible, I feel like I'm about to faint and I have to just run and leave that specific situation."
12507,Another thing is the panic disorder which I think is a result of my claustrophia.
12508,"Sometimes I'm realaxing home, just chillin', and out of the blue there is a feeling which is even more difficult to discribe, I then feel physically weak and there is a feeling in my head which makes me think I'm about to insanse - it's horrible."
12509,**You consulted a psychologist?
12510,** I told myself that I have a serious problem and I searched for a therapist and after some while I finally found one.
12511,"I did a behavior therapy (which was actually about talking a lot about my exactly fears and the consequences) and since my symptoms were so strong, I was send to a psychologist, who was responsible for my medication."
12512,He gave me Venlafaxine (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)) which I took daily (and still today) and a Lorazepam for special situations to overcome (e.g.
12513,a crowded place or a lecture which I had to attend).
12514,I can say the medications combined with the therapy helped me to come out of that fucked up situations.
12515,"Back then, the days were very 'long and dark', I was feeling like shit and the biggest problem was that I didnt know why, I didnt know what happened, all of a sudden my life changed completely."
12516,"As I said it started to get better and better, I learned to handle those fearing situations again and became more and more a person who was pacticipating at the normal-social life."
12517,"You need to know that it was very difficult not only having anxiety for croweded and tight places, but also cant go out with your friends anymore and doing all that kind of stuff you did before - and you cant really tell them why."
12518,"You start to find strategies, excuses and adjust your life to your phobia - which is a vicious circle."
12519,"But again, it got better and today I'm almost a 'normal' person again, I even got into an airplane last year, which was one of my biggest fears since you cant escape from that situation while you're obviously in the air."
12520,"**If you ask me, what helped me exactly, to get out of this missery?"
12521,"** Well, I can't tell 100% for sure, but I guess the therapy combined with the medications, which I still take today, helped a lot, it did the start-up."
12522,Another thing is that I found a new hobby for me: genealogy.
12523,I helped me to focus on something and it is one of those hobbies/ projects which is probably never really finished.
12524,"Another thing is, that I started to tell close people around me, about my problem."
12525,"Not every person who you meet, but people of who you think that you can tell them and they will understand, especially when you share a lot of time with them."
12526,You make them understand your behaviour and they can start to learn to deal with it.
12527,"Everything besides that would be unfair to them, since they are not Nostradamus."
12528,"Another thing is my job, I'm studying Linguistics and working side job at the university."
12529,I do researching in archives and working on historcial lexicography.
12530,"When you find something that you really like and that really challanges you, you have less time to think about 'how am I going to stand the situation X tommorrow/ next week' - and besides that, it just makes you feel good!"
12531,"Thinking about a specific situation which is upcoming, is also a big problem."
12532,"It's the point where you're fearing the fear, sounds weird but it's definitely a very fucked up feeling!"
12533,To sum it up: yes I'm almost okay today.
12534,"Sometimes I still have problems and there are some situations which don't make me happy, e.g."
12535,"going by airplane, but I can handle it."
12536,"I still take Venlafaxine (pls google it up, it's too complex to explain it here for me) and I almost got none side-effects, it's a very good medication for me(!)."
12537,"My life will probably never the same again, which is completely okay for me and sounds worse than it is - I just sees things different now, I'm more realexed about certain issues, I try to enjoy, not to complain."
12538,"Wherever you guys are and you're reading this and might identify with my problems I had and still having, I wish you all the best and empower you to fight."
12539,"At the end of the day it's your life and your time, nobody else got the right to judge about your decisions, start doing what is good for you!"
12540,"Good luck, I'm with you!"
12541,"I took meds, I went to counseling, I did the homework."
12542,"Crying all the time, having to take more Xanax as rescue medication more frequently."
12543,These mostly happen when I am hearing or learning about what medication does to your body.
12544,"With the help of (very weak) meds, a therapist and a lot of sports I got rid of them (hadnt had one in two/three weeks) which I am very happy about."
12545,"Clonazepam worked, but after a while he started abusing his medication and taking high doses every day."
12546,"*

I asked him last night if he would consider going to a psychiatrist again and do therapy/go on meds again."
12547,Does anyone here have anxiety/OCD that really mimics ADHD?
12548,"I've tried virtually all of the ADHD medicines, and they never helped."
12549,All they did was make my anxiety worse.
12550,But I've read that ADHD medicines not working is often a good indication that ADHD is not the problem.
12551,Now I'm starting to think it may be the anxiety that's doing it to me.
12552,It's already very clear to me that I have very bad anxiety and OCD.
12553,I'm seeing two therapists for it at the moment.
12554,"But anyways, I can't read almost anything without having music playing in my head (usually the same song over and over for hours), completely distracting me."
12555,Now I'm in my first couple weeks of grad school (don't even know how I made it this far) and the amount of reading is just absolutely killing me.
12556,"I spent just about all day today only doing reading assignments for one class, and I really don't think I got anything out of it."
12557,"It's so absolutely discouraging to put hours upon hours of work into something all the time, and get absolutely nothing out of it."
12558,"By the time I finished doing all of my reading tonight, I was just completely burned out, drained of all mental energy."
12559,And I have nothing to show for it.
12560,Did I mention I'm only taking 2 classes?
12561,I don't see how I'll ever make it all the way through (or even through this first semester).
12562,I am just so upset right now... anyone have any ideas?
12563,:(
12564,I was prescribed anxiety/depression medicine and it didn't help.
12565,"I was so frusterated that I started looking into alternative medicine (acupuncture, etc."
12566,"I am happy I started the meds, not sure if I would have been able to get through last semester without them."
12567,"(This doctor failed me big time, I laid down all of the meds I was on in front of him and asked him if it could be from any of them."
12568,It wasn´t until I finally saw another doctor right before christmas in my home country who realised what it was and switched my meds.
12569,This experience and switching meds made me realise how much they affect me.
12570,"I feel like I view the world differently, some of my behaviour is very un-me and the carefree feeling the meds give me have gotten me into trouble a few times."
12571,I´m scared that these changes and others I haven´t even noticed might be irreversible and the chance of that happening increases the longer I stay on the meds.
12572,I´m scared that I might have to stay on these meds forever cause I won´t be able to function without them.
12573,I feel like the people I´ve gotten to know since I started the meds aren´t getting to know the real me.
12574,I think it´s the easiest way to stop my anxiety about them and much more logical than upping my dose of anxiety medication to kill my anxiety about anxiety medication.
12575,"I needed meds to help when I just couldn´t handle my anxiety, when nothing went right, they helped me not to crash when everything was falling apart around me."
12576,Although that might just be the meds talking.
12577,But he did say he was exited about getting to know meds free me.
12578,I had to assure him that I know I am ultimately in this alone and that I am very independent on and off meds.
12579,So Now I´m anxious about continuing my meds and about quitting them.
12580,"I´ve heard about people not getting support in seeking help, getting meds and are instead just told to just tough it out but I seem to have the opposite problem."
12581,"tl;dr 
I´m anxious about being on my meds
I´m anxious about quitting my meds"
12582,"I have never taken medication and I have mostly learned to use the relentless energy to my advantage, forging a fast paced career for myself at 23 years old."
12583,medicine = take as directed.
12584,"So, first off, I know this is all centered around my medication."
12585,The nausea from my medication plus the nausea from my concussion was too much for me so I stopped taking my medication (I know!!!).
12586,"Actually, the not taking my medication part wasn't that bad."
12587,Nothing seems to be working to calm me down because it's the medication giving me my anxiety.
12588,"Don't mess with your meds, folks."
12589,"I don't know if it was because of my 2 day break, or because I took it at noon or completely my imagination,  but I really realized I need to adjust my meds."
12590,"Hello everyone, yesterday I was feeling particularly anxious and sick (My stomach hurts a lot when I'm anxious) so I decided to check my blood pressure."
12591,"Though my blood pressure was mostly okay, I was shocked to find my resting heart rate during this bout of anxiety was ~135 (For reference my pulse was 68 this morning when I checked.)"
12592,"I feel nervous knowing how high my heart rate gets during anxiety attacks, I figured it may go around ~100 but to see 135 was scary to me."
12593,"I'm an active person with low body fat and a generally healthy diet, but I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder (With a huge emphasis on social anxiety as a trigger.)"
12594,Does anyone else notice dramatic increases to either their blood pressure or pulse during anxiety?
12595,Any good ideas to combat this?
12596,I was struggling so much to even take a deep breath yesterday when I felt like this.
12597,Edit: Just mentioning that I'm not on any medications.
12598,"I have suffered from all forms that anxiety can take, from ocd to full panic, since I was 5 years old."
12599,It is constantly eating at my mind and body.
12600,The stress caused ulcers at the age of 8 and stomach issues ever since.
12601,My main phobia is vomiting and even typing that makes me afraid.
12602,I am also on the autism spectrum where I am referred to as being pdd-nos.
12603,Too bad I have actual physical ailments which cause the anxiety to increase in intensity all around.
12604,"They include: renal agenesis with fused right kidney, bladder cyst which irritates my pudendal nerve, stomach ulcers/hiatal hernia/gastritis, kidney edema, severe gerd and carpal tunnel which keep me from my interest of playing and singing music."
12605,It is the horror I am trapped in.
12606,I'm finally seeing an endocrinologist to discuss my androgen/adrenal neurotransmitter dysfunction that could exist because of my kidney issue stated above.
12607,Almost nothing works and every day I wake up with something new and physical that I cannot escape from.
12608,I have grown to a point from this storm of anxiety where I feel like I wont be alive by the time I'm 30.
12609,"I never think of suicide as an option, this is just a general assessment based on my physical body in this point in time."
12610,What can I do when my fear is a part of the very fabric of my body?
12611,"When going out I soak up the world as if I was a black hole, retaining everything to the point of bursting."
12612,It is horrifying.
12613,I bear this body like a cross and just want some peace for once in my life.
12614,It has destroyed the best relationship of my life a few years ago.
12615,"It prevents me from working, dating, seeing friends."
12616,What can I do?
12617,"I've been to therapy and that didn't help, every psychiatrist I see usually ends up messing up medicines because of mistakes they make somewhere i the process."
12618,My hypothesis of adrenal dysfunction is the only thing that keeps me going.
12619,I feel like a being who is made of painful lightening.
12620,Consumed by the flames of my own thoughts.
12621,"My mom was prescribed anti-anxiety meds herself just a few months ago, but I don't want my parents to pay for a therapist we can't afford if it's not a serious issue."
12622,To medicate or not to medicate?
12623,I am constantly fighting this war with myself.
12624,When I am on my meds I just don't feel like myself.
12625,Then when I stop taking them everything blows up.
12626,I feel guilt about taking meds too.
12627,I feel like everyone I talk to is going to know I am on something.
12628,I know it shouldn't matter but in my brain it all matters.
12629,"I am only 28 and I just found out that I am going to have a hysterectomy due to endometriosis and when I told my mom the first thing she said to me was ""oh good."
12630,"Then maybe you can get off some of those medicines you are taking."""
12631,She refuses to even entertain the notion that these medicines I am taking are for mental illness not just because I am depressed.
12632,"I am damn depressed because I have such a hard time existing in this world with other people who seem to have their shit together without falling apart over things like answering simple questions, being in large groups of people, not pleasing everyone..."
12633,I just want to know that at some point I am going to have this great revelation and be fine with having to take meds and not have to feel like a drug addict or a zombie.
12634,"My grandma and my mum are on anxiety medication, Diazepam."
12635,Nowadays she still takes medicine for this especially pre and post menstruation.
12636,"I've been on some natural medication, but I don't feel like its doing much for me."
12637,I struggle with extreme interpersonal anxiety.
12638,I always make sure everything is okay between friends and family.
12639,"When I say always I mean conversations everyday, actually asking a friend if ""we're cool?"""
12640,constantly.
12641,I interpret and over analyze interactions with friends and family and my mind spirals out of control.
12642,I think people hate me and talk behind my back constantly.
12643,I've had two long term relationships fail because I guilted myself into my own personal hell because I thought I was always doing something wrong.
12644,I felt inadequate in every way and was admitted to a acute behavorial psych ward for 4 days.
12645,"I learned a lot and now am more selfish (In a positive way), more content with life, and making sure I'm happy first."
12646,"I still struggle with anxiety, depression, and panic attacks."
12647,My advice is to get help.
12648,I finally found the right medicine and the right therapist to transform my incorrect and irrational thought processes through psycho therapy.
12649,"Friends, it took me 6 years of therapy and medicine experimentation to find the most fitting treatment."
12650,Never give up.
12651,I gave up countless times and was non compliant with medicine at times.
12652,"It's hard, anxiety is SO painful."
12653,I want to relate with fellow anxiety sufferers.
12654,I've been on many medications and have been through some tough times so don't hesitate to ask for advice.
12655,"I know many of you are suffering, but please don't give up."
12656,"It's difficult to put forth the effort to heal yourself, but if you keep trying your inner strength will grow."
12657,"Thanks for reading this, I hope those who are suffering find peace."
12658,"TL;DR
Ended up in a psych ward because of anxiety."
12659,Doing much better now.
12660,"Willing to offer advice 


Edit:  Not looking for karma, just feeling content currently and want to help people suffering"
12661,"I realize psychiatrists just deal with medicine, but I can't stand having one with no sort of compassion."
12662,"So anyway, hoping he will have some idea of a Med/meds that could work for me, he gives me a script for .5 mg Xanax taken every 4 hours."
12663,"Because of this, I'm not willing to go on medication."
12664,Finally my meds are ready..
12665,The only time I felt really free of all of this was btw when I got medication.
12666,"But my doc (not a psychiatrist, normal doc) told me I'm too healthy for meds."
12667,"I plan to go talk to my doctor and ask for some medication to make it easier, but I don't really know what to say."
12668,"My mother recently took all of my meds away (even the ones I don't take)
Because she heard from my psychiatrist that I am suicidal."
12669,"I can't think of anything else I was exposed to that is different than normal, so it's most likely the meds."
12670,What meds do you take now?
12671,"I don't take medication, I only went to three psych sessions, and I can barely control them when they do occur."
12672,"Last night, I had another breakdown because I had gotten irritable with my SO and it has happened a couple times lately and I had already gone to bed, but was up crying mostly just to myself, and he came and I just said I'm sorry and broke down, he comforted me and we talked and he said I don't want you just to turn to meds because that's what is solving everyone's problems, but I want you to try, with my help, working through it."
12673,"We do have resources locally that can help people who need free or low cost therapy/meds/etc, but the last time I went through them I had a really terrible experience and stopped, which is also a source of great shame and guilt and anxiety and depression."
12674,I'm wondering if this medication is supposed to work by giving depressed and anxious people delusions that everything is going to be okay when it is not.
12675,"I used to take Paxil, but stopped after 3 weeks because I wasn't responding well to the medications."
12676,"My psychiatrist prescribed me with lexapro, but I decided to go the non pharmaceutical route."
12677,"It is on and off, but the off days are really bad and I'm heavily considering to start on the lexapro."
12678,What's your thoughts or experiences?
12679,"I was put on medication for over a year and it didn't seem to get rid of my stomach pain, but it did help somewhat."
12680,"Hi all
i have been dealing with mild depression and mixed anxiety since i was 17 and i am 28 now."
12681,"i started seeking treatment only 2 years ago and was first diagnosed with ""Neurosis"" and was prescribed an antidepressant (ecitalopram) which i took for 10 months, i noticed a slight improvement in mood, then i was able to go back to school and hold a job, after 10 months i stopped taking the med gradually for 3 months as i thought my depression was gone.. unfortunately it didn't last that long and i had a hysterical episode that got me to the hospital, i got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was prescribed medications for it, it improved sleep and appetite but i was still severely depressed and things got worse after i lost my job so i saw another psychiatrist who dismissed the bipolar diagnoses and replaced it with a mix of depression and anxiety with obsessional thinking, he prescribed an SSRI, now i am not so depressed but my anxiety is often uncontrollable and sometimes i fear i would lose my mind at anytime!"
12682,"i know it's a common fear along people with anxiety but even being aware of that doesn't help much, i am having difficulties dealing with people even close friends, when i wake up i don't feel like doing anything at all (is this avolition?"
12683,is it only exclusive to schizophrenia?)..
12684,"i am supposed to start working at my new job the next week and i just don't know if i can or should go if i stayed like this.. i always think of the worst case scenarios that even if i got schizophrenia i will have the one with poorest prognosis (disorganized type) and i will get no help and end up homeless and forgotten.. my current therapist totally dismisses this thought and told me it stems from my anxiety but somehow i can't stop thinking about it..
any tips will be appreciated :)"
12685,"](http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Way-Calm-Aid-Softgels/dp/B007TYY2JA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425647195&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=lavendar+pills) I've been taking them once a day (intermittently because I'm fucking terrible at remembering to take medicine), and their use has been augmented with my paroxetine, therefore I know it's hard to be objective, but I feel like I notice a bigger improvement with the lavender pills than the paroxetine."
12686,"I drank too much, got on anti-anxiety meds and abused them, hung out with the wrong people, and fucked my life up for a while until things got too bad."
12687,-Why am I not on meds?
12688,"I don't want to have to resort to taking meds, but I don't know if I really need them."
12689,"The ""crutch"" is a stigma I bought into... and undermined the medical need of this medication to keep my usually positive attitude and calm alive."
12690,Or tough it out and do what I am afraid of - stay this way and forget it can all be better with a little medication...
12691,I had a third panic attack yesterday.
12692,"The first two were directly triggered by a certain individual (a month apart each), The first time I didn't know what was about to happen, and I passed out."
12693,Since then I know to at least try to control my breathing.
12694,"This time I stood up, I felt lightheaded, I freaked out, there was a rushing sound in my ears, I sank back down to the floor and had to catch my breath... all in the middle of a staff meeting."
12695,This attack had no identifiable trigger.
12696,I get these feelings sometimes when I'm falling asleep.
12697,"I'm almost asleep, but I'm falling asleep the wrong way, and it jerks me awake."
12698,That's the best I can explain it.
12699,"If I feel the slightest bit like an attack is coming on, I get scared, and that makes it worse."
12700,"My leadership encouraged me to see a doctor, and see if they could prescribe me meds."
12701,"I have been struggling with these attacks for three months, and it's awful."
12702,"I fight the feelings sometimes for a few hours at a time, and it most always when I am in public."
12703,What are the repercussions of being officially diagnosed with a panic disorder (physically and socially when it comes to jobs and such)?
12704,Do I have to be diagnosed in order to receive medication?
12705,"Are there medications you take only when you need them, or are they usually an every day thing?"
12706,Are there any kind of over-the-counter meds to help?
12707,"I refrain from caffeine, that's just asking for trouble."
12708,"How do you cope with panic attacks, besides trying to control your breathing?"
12709,"I wish I had medication or SOMETHING to help me cope but I have nothing except for self injury, which is how I used to cope, but my therapist doesn't want me doing that anymore."
12710,"As the title says, just got a prescription for celexia to treat depression and anxiety."
12711,"10mg daily for the first two weeks, then 20mg daily."
12712,"I've never tried any antidepressants or anxiety medications before, so I'm not really sure what to expect and I'm kind of terrified."
12713,I was wondering about some of the side effects.
12714,"I heard it'll kill your sex drive, which has me really worried."
12715,I have taken my medicine once.
12716,"So for general anxiety I noticed a big change and for social I noticed a slight change, I am still going to therapy and he knows I still need work with the social aspect of it but I think the meds helped me by 70-80% and that is huge to me and should be for other people too."
12717,So I know the meds route can be scary for some for many reasons but I think it's a great tool to help people with anxiety and depression.
12718,I've never had anxiety so bad that medicine wouldn't even help the slightest.
12719,I have been off medication since September.
12720,"I'm interested to try new helpful herbs, but people I know who suffer from anxiety, tend to take chemical meds."
12721,Especially when I take my medication and it makes me feel normal I'll panic.
12722,19/F if that's at all relevant.
12723,i don't even know where else to start.
12724,i'll clarify any points if needed if something ends up not making sense.
12725,"first comes a preface section for info about me, then i'll explain what is specifically setting me off tonight."
12726,"i'm so sorry for this but i'm about to write a novel

history: i have been diagnosed with the most severe case of generalized anxiety disorder my therapist had seen in someone as young as myself."
12727,"i am currently 19 but i was diagnosed when i was like... 14 or 15. yes, i was one of those growing up... been to hospital after hospital on medicines i couldn't even spell at the time and had more therapists and psychs than i have fingers to count them on."
12728,this has been a problem my whole life.
12729,"and not just anxiety itself, but it has been a physical manifestation for as long as i can remember, specifically, ibs."
12730,"i was also given a few other diagnoses like schizoaffective and depression, but i'm almost 100% positive the symptoms i was experiencing were a direct result of my anxiety because it's just so fucking bad

currently: i'm not seeing any doctors at all because i have gotten so fucking sick of spending money for nothing."
12731,my last prescription was xanax and i can't remember the dosage at the time but it just didn't help.
12732,i've been on pretty much everything that can be prescribed for severe anxiety.
12733,"i have tried my fucking hardest to sit still and meditate, but to no avail."
12734,"about my anxiety: my anxiety level is always at LEAST 7/10, assuming that in panic mode and in really awful situations, the boundary can extent to like... 15/10."
12735,my thoughts don't stop.
12736,"i could give an example of frequent thoughts here, but, it's just... everything."
12737,i think and worry about literally everything.
12738,"and as my worries build up, my heart starts to pump in my throat, my stomach does flips and i start to sweat."
12739,"like i said before, ibs... but i wanted to separate a part specifically to explain how bad it gets besides having my stomach in knots and have to vomit while stuck on the toilet with anxiety-induced diarrhea all day, as if that didn't sound awful enough already!"
12740,i shake.
12741,"i convulse so fucking hard that i cry and the only thing that helps is attempting to fall asleep, which is near impossible because the shaking itself forces me awake."
12742,i don't know what a seizure feels like so i cannot even try to compare... but it's SO bad.
12743,i'm scared it is literally ruining my body to be convulsing this hard.
12744,"and my head hurts as i'm typing this and i was shaking earlier, so, great, i'm going to worry about having a brain problem now

---

tonight, i am beyond pissed at myself."
12745,"with my previous diagnosis of major depression, i have been suicidal in the past, but it wasn't really about hating myself?"
12746,it was about hating my anxiety.
12747,"knowing that after so many years of trying to fight this shit off, i will probably never get rid of it."
12748,my anxiety will be with me my entire life.
12749,"every single day i wake up, i will probably already be at a 7/10 no matter how much i go outside and have fun doing what i love doing."
12750,i'm a freelance photographer and i make good money!!!
12751,especially for my age.
12752,"my job isn't stressful, i saw no reason to go to college because i already had the skills i needed and a path to the job i wanted, and now i'm here and i keep getting better day by day."
12753,"so, i don't go to school, and on the days that i do have work, it's something i absolutely love doing!!!"
12754,"there should be no reason for me to hate any aspect of my life, right?"
12755,especially since the day i'm writing this marks 2.5 years with my current boyfriend.
12756,i'm a long term relationship kind of person and i'm really comfortable with this guy.
12757,i love him so much!
12758,"on a logical note, i am perfect for him."
12759,"we both love video games and nerdy shit and, me, being as anxious as i am, try to converse with haste and finish people's sentences, but it hardly EVER works for him because he is always thinking of something that doesn't naturally occur to me and i love it

as pretty much everyone with anxiety knows, though, we aren't always fully functioning with our most rational foot forward."
12760,"fuck no, that would be way too easy."
12761,"so, tonight, he was on the phone with his best friend and he literally just said ""what's her name?"
12762,"oh yeah, that's her."""
12763,and that is when all hell broke loose.
12764,"like usual, i was already on edge, but when he fucking gave acknowledgment to another female human on this planet, my stomach exploded."
12765,i was so done.
12766,"i live in maryland and it's humid as shit right now, and my room is a sauna, and i have been sweating bullets ever since

BUT THIS ISN'T ME."
12767,this is NOT who i want to be!
12768,obviously.
12769,"this specific kind of situation with the relationship jealousy happens every so often... it isn't my main trigger for anxiety, but it's up there."
12770,"i mean, everything's up there... everything sets me off."
12771,hhhh.
12772,"it just sounds so ridiculous, and even in the heat of the moment a few hours ago i could tell you that."
12773,"but nope, 15/10 anxiety for hours."
12774,"i didn't know what would fix it, so i tried admitting to him that i had that problem."
12775,"""i got unnecessarily worried because of a thing you said on the phone,"" kind of helped."
12776,"it's embarrassing to admit to something like that, but he's been with me for 2.5 years at this point... he knows just how anxious i get."
12777,it's hard for him to fall asleep sometimes because of how much i'm shaking.
12778,"but, alas, i'm here, so pissed about who my anxiety makes me, and back up to 15/10

i don't want to type any more because i'm embarrassed about this."
12779,i probably sound so fucking stupid.
12780,maybe this is enough?
12781,"if it's not, tell me, i'll expound on parts for you or something."
12782,thanks so much for reading this mess.
12783,if you can somehow take all of the anxiety out of my body for good i will buy you a lifetime supply of burgers.
12784,scout's honor.
12785,"I went to my doctor yesterday; I'm working on my medication, going to a new psychologist, I don't need more doctors visits."
12786,"I dont know what to do, I have medication but it doesnt really help the attacks."
12787,What I wanna know is if people ever go from the way I am to being able to stand in front of a class and teach without the use of medication?
12788,"After shakily explaining my symptoms to my GP, he determined that I was suffering from acid reflux disease and prescribed medication to help."
12789,I've been through therapy/meds/partial hospitalization etc.
12790,"No longer on meds, but trying to manage regardless."
12791,My doctor said there's no way of knowing for sure what's going on (if this is part of the rebalancing or if I'm just this anxious without medication) and I understand that fully.
12792,I'm so scared that I can't do it I know I'm going to be mentally exhausted from it all and I don't want that I have been doing great since I've been in therapy and am off my medication now.
12793,"I've been to therapy, I've been taking my meds, but I can't shake this feeling."
12794,"I've mentioned this to my Psych and Therapist, but I don't want to play ""medication bingo' again with all the side effects it entails, and my therapist, while well meaning is no match for the anxiety and pessimism in my head."
12795,It's ruined my life &amp; I have been on medication for ever!
12796,Anything I can do during the work day to calm down without my medication?
12797,"Okay, so while I do already suffer from depression(5 yrs) + PTSD(3 yrs ago), for the past few months I've been dealing with severe nightly anxiety attacks all revolving around death."
12798,"None of my medications seem to be helping, nor does distracting myself."
12799,It's gotten to the point where I could be thinking of nothing of relation to dying and still end up thinking about it within 10 minutes.
12800,The attacks have gotten to the point where I'm literally screaming at the top of my lungs 'NO' at the very thought of death.
12801,This is severely messing with my emotional and physical health.
12802,"Any advice on what could be causing these attacks, and/or what I should do to prevent them?"
12803,"My mother won't let me get on medication as she tried that when she was sick, but it didn't help."
12804,"I have Panic Disorder, GAD, and mild OCD."
12805,"I do NOT take any SNRIs, SSRIs, or Xanax or Klonopin."
12806,I believe that many people with anxiety can get through it without these medications.
12807,I don't like the feeling of being on medication and I think especially kpin and xanax are crutches and don't actually treat the problem.
12808,What are your opinions?
12809,Does anyone else feel this way?
12810,Has treating your anxiety (meds/therapy) helped this at all?
12811,"However, I am nearly out of options and I am looking to try  another prescribed medication for situational anxiety induced insomnia to get over this hump."
12812,"When I was fifteen my mom asked me to go into my sister's room and get out her advil, while in the process of trying to find the medication I found a small case and I opened it."
12813,"I was prescribed .5mg Ativan a few days ago, and could not bring myself to take it..."
12814,I had the pills in my hand and couldn't do it.
12815,"I'm reading so much about medication that I didn't know about recently, and I'm wondering."
12816,Is it even worth it?
12817,"These medications aren't like antibiotics that'll kill our anxiety, they just mask what we're feeling."
12818,Most of us have anxiety because of underlying problems we have yet to deal with.
12819,"I'm just wondering why we poison ourselves with these medications, (some of which are very addictive and require weening off of) when doctors have no idea what is really going on in our brains, at least not enough to deem anything a ""chemical imbalance""."
12820,There has got to be another way...
12821,"I know these doctors mean well by handing us these pills and telling us to take them to feel better, but there has got to be another way than having to deal with addiction and all of these side effects."
12822,I don't even want to go anymore but I have to do this visit to get my meds.
12823,I've suffered from paranoia and *severe* social and general anxiety for years (unable to be in a social situation with *anyone* other than my gf without meds or alcohol).
12824,"I am however a freelance game developer so my career is going ok.

My family are very bohemian and for years warned me against western meds, I tried absolutely **every** alternative medicine you can think of, and only got worse and worse as the years went by."
12825,"Some alternative medicine does work/help, but when it comes to my issues, which are quite serious, it's not enough."
12826,"But I still feel like *something's* wrong, something the medication is not addressing."
12827,"I feel my anxiety is under control now with the medication, but there's something else and it's getting worse."
12828,"Therapy, medication, hospitalization."
12829,"My mom took me to the doctor, and the doctor told me it was most likely an anxiety problem &amp; gave me some medicine to take whenever I started to feel that way."
12830,"I don't remember what the medicine was called, but I didn't have to take it daily - it was a situational type thing."
12831,What if I'm on daily medication?
12832,"I'm on medication and seeing a therapist, and I'm actually doing fairly well except for a pervasive fear that I'm going to have a stroke and/or die."
12833,I take Celexa and Lisinopril (for blood pressure) and I really don't want to take more meds.
12834,"
I feel so overwhelmed lately and have come to the realization that if I don't do something to alleviate my anxiety soon, then things will continue to worsen and the path I am leading towards is agoraphobia."
12835,"[Sorry this is so long, I just need to get it off my chest]

Basically..."
12836,I grew up in Tornado Alley where it stormed constantly.
12837,"Once (around age 10) my mother was driving in a torrential downpour, thunder &amp; lightning etc."
12838,I look out the window and see a funnel cloud and immediately turn and projectile vomited all over my sisters friend.
12839,"From this moment on, the thought of storms has made me physically ill. For a while it was manageable, a slight stomach ache when it would be storming ... but now things have taken a turn for the worse."
12840,"I'm not sure what escalated it..other than that it's been extra bad weather this summer, I got stuck driving home in a downpour with 90+mph winds, where I watched a freaking woman grab onto a pole so she wouldn't fly away ... all while my car is rocking back and forth."
12841,"Then I had to work on the 45th floor of a building downtown, with windows all around me (the view that some would kill for, but a view that made me want to die) because the week I worked there it stormed all week."
12842,"I keep trying to figure out what made this worse, but fall short."
12843,"I have always had serious anxiety issues, mainly mostly affecting my head where I just worry constantly, but within the past year this fear from storms has lead to full on &amp; multiple panic attacks."
12844,"My chest feels tight, my heart starts racing and my hands and legs start shaking - which isn't an ideal situation ever but especially not while driving."
12845,Sigh.
12846,I had to start checking the weather to have an idea if I would need an umbrella when I worked a job with quite a long walk into work...so from there it has escalated to downloading multiple radar apps and constantly staring at them..wondering when it is going to storm.
12847,"I am pretty sure this makes it worse, considering meterologists can be a joke sometimes..so for example - I spent all night Saturday at work stressing out, preparing myself for the storm that was coming, only for it to rain for like 10 minutes."
12848,"It's gotten to the point where I will try to get my shifts covered at work if theres a chance it will storm - even though I really need the money, the overwhelming pain I feel from panic attacks doesn't seem worth it."
12849,"I have always been weary of anxiety meds - as I am already succesptable to tiredness, but the meds my doctor has previously given me (Vistaril) have only made me fall asleep - with no actual relieving anxiety."
12850,"-sigh- any help would be appreciated, any medications you take that seem to help...(my doctor recently prescribed me effexor xr but my anxiety is so situational that I don't want to be taking something every day that changes my brain chemistry)."
12851,"any advice would be greatly appreciated, i feel like my life is falling apart..all over the stupidest fear."
12852,"[TLDR: storms are causing me panic attacks, making me want to avoid leaving even if theres a possibility of one : i need a thundercoat, any advice?!]"
12853,I am taking GERD medication and follow a diet but this wait has drained me mentally.
12854,"I went to the doctor and she said that physically i'm in great condition, i exercise 6 days a week and I eat the best i can, and that my symptoms are more or less caused by anxiety and said she wouldn't recommend me any medication as I'm not physically suffering."
12855,I have tried so many strategies and meds and it feels so hopeless.
12856,I've discovered that my brother has been depressed and physically sick these past 2 weeks.
12857,"He's had a pounding heart, nausea, and no motivation to get out of the house."
12858,Total surprise to me but my mother informed me because he went to the hospital with a pounding heart and he mentioned he thought of suicide.
12859,"(he said he didn't want to kill himself, just was thinking about it)."
12860,So my mother decided I needed to know.
12861,He's had anxiety before when he was younger but nothing this bad (that we know of).
12862,He's a very private person and keeps to himself so it's a blessing that he even brought this up.
12863,He's tried several medicines since then but most have made it worse or he just threw it up.
12864,(he hasn't eaten very much) He's got an evaluation today and hopefully will find the right doctor for him.
12865,"He's really stressed about his new job shift (same job, just switching to night shift) coming up this weekend."
12866,And that's just piling on him as he stresses to get better before he has to start working again.
12867,My mother asked me not to approach him because she's been hiding it from me for a while.
12868,"So I'm really upset because:

* I really want to help him but I can't even speak to him about it because my mother is afraid it might bring more attention to his condition."
12869,"* I'm just in general shock and reflecting on our childhood, feeling like shit for all the times I might have made it worse."
12870,"* Since he's so quiet and reserved, it's hard to know just how much he's been suffering."
12871,"* I've believed to have minor anxiety issues my whole life but shrugged it off thinking ""no way"" but now I've discovered that there is a good chance I've got it too as it now runs in the family."
12872,I'm worried how I might take this information and is it going to make things worse.
12873,"More importantly, I know how it feels to have anxiety and have an attack and I just can't stand knowing that he's feeling 10xs worse and much longer."
12874,Thanks for letting me vent.
12875,I really hope he feels better.
12876,"I'm considering looking for medication, but I don't even know how to go about that."
12877,"I figured it was a fluke, but at some point since then I stopped taking my meds."
12878,"I have already gone to a psychiatrist and been on medication since then, It has helped but even know I feel horrible."
12879,I want to become a neurologist at some point in life and my uni allows retakes for medicine so it's like everyone's giving me a chance but I'm ruining it for myself.
12880,Anyone have problems with dehydration causing anxiety while on (or off) meds?
12881,Has anyone else had issues with dehydration and anxiety or has the medicine just suddenly actually started working for me around the same time I started to drink more water?
12882,"I don't know where this sudden outburst came from, maybe because I haven't had my meds in two weeks and my mood is swinging like a hormonal pregnant teenage chimp."
12883,"So, I went home to my parents' place for Christmas holidays for the next three weeks and left all my anxiety meds at my apartment."
12884,"I have no way of getting them and also can't get my hands on the prescription, which basically means I accidentally forced myself to go off my meds until the 3rd or so."
12885,"So far her CBT counseller, and phychiatrist have just gone the route of meds, and CBT is just not something she feels works at all."
12886,"A few notes that may or may not be helpful:

-I have depression but it is pretty much under control and I have been off meds for about a year now

-my mother suffers from anxiety and depression 

-I recently started smoking marijuana."
12887,I'm not sure if it's my medication (Lexapro) or if I'm just having an off day.
12888,I'm already a quiet/anxious guy but these meds just make me not feel bothered to socialize.
12889,"I have some familiarity with the subject, as my SO has gone through a long process of taming her own beast (GAD) with a combination of therapy and meds."
12890,I'm having a bad time right now.
12891,A seriously bad time.
12892,I think i'm having a panic attack but it feels weird.
12893,History: I've had a history of panic attacks and general anxiety.
12894,When I get anxious I get hypochondria.
12895,"It's weird, hypochondria is not a thing that causes anxiety, but when I get anxious, things hurt and I think to deep and I fear the worst."
12896,I can always tell when I'm having a bad anxious moment when I feel the need the phone the doctor constantly.
12897,So I'll go over that first: My chest hurts.
12898,"My right shoulder hurts, its so tense it hurts."
12899,"My face hurts, I think its my sinuses, mostly on the right side."
12900,I had a sharp pain in my head yesterday that has me convinced I have an aneurysm.
12901,"I made the mistake of reading the ""Cancer survivors, how did you discover you had cancer?"""
12902,thread on here earlier... big mistake.
12903,"Fun story, when I was 21 I requested a colonoscopy."
12904,"Colon cancer is in my family, I get horrible stomach pains, and I just felt paranoid, and the doctor obliged."
12905,Test came back totally clean.
12906,"But the first post in the thread was from a person with colon cancer, who had a colonoscopy and it came back clean because the tumor was in a weird place."
12907,I threw up about an hour ago.
12908,Stomach still doesn't feel well.
12909,"My breathing is not steady, it hurts to breathe."
12910,I feel bad.
12911,I feel like I'm dying.
12912,I just went through a maybe-breakup.
12913,"I've been with this guy for 2 years, things have been rocky."
12914,He doesn't handle my anxiety well.
12915,"He texted ""Sorry for being a dick."
12916,If you need to talk let me know.
12917,"A lot of stuff is getting to you"" I declined."
12918,I can't handle talking to him right now.
12919,"I love him, but I just can't, it will be messy."
12920,He can't handle me either.
12921,Sometimes when I have a panic attack I just need to lay there and have someone rub my back.
12922,"Friends will do this, my ex did this with no questions."
12923,Current-maybe boyfriend will not.
12924,I do not know why.
12925,"He doesn't like being touched, and he doesn't like touching."
12926,It's little things like this that have added up and made me a worse person to deal with and we're just at a breaking point.
12927,I was on a few medications in college for anxiety.
12928,The last and longest one was Buspirone.
12929,"THis made me incredibly dizzy, but I didn't have any episodes on it."
12930,"My general day to day worried demeanor did not change, but in my 6 months on Buspirone I did not have one huge episode like this."
12931,"When I left college I did not call a new doctor to get my prescription transferred, so I just stopped taking it."
12932,"Nothing changed immediately, but the episodes started again."
12933,"Then when I reached out for help, none of the places I reached out for accepted my health insurance."
12934,"I only tried 3 places, but that was enough, I don't take rejection well."
12935,I gave up.
12936,I don't know what I need.
12937,But I've just been pacing my room sick and unable to breathe and havng such a bad panic attack that I don't know what to do with myself.
12938,"I pace my room and go on reddit and look at a new picture, then pace and look at more."
12939,"I tried laying down and listening to calm music but I couldn't, I just could not sit there."
12940,I have so much nervous energy I don't know what to do with myself.
12941,And the more I panic the more lightheaded and bad I feel.
12942,Thanks for reading.
12943,I need some help.
12944,How do you calm yourself down?
12945,"My usual method is to force myself to lay on my back with loud non-verbal music so I can just focus on not-words and focus on sounds, but it isn't working right now."
12946,"Before I started having problems my meds were working great....now, not so much."
12947,"""...except for some reason the deflector shields(meds) aren't working."
12948,Anyone think it's time to switch anxiety meds and try something different?
12949,I'm not on an medication at this time
12950,The only option I can see left now is anti-anxiety medication but I can't see them being strong enough to prevent my panic attacks.
12951,"I then proceeded to drink heavily to calm myself down, since I currently am not on any medication."
12952,One of my hangups these days is I am looking for a job and trying to be productive because I'm working towards applying to medschool.
12953,It wasn't until after I got on meds that I had the contrast to compare against and realize I had been miserable for over a decade.
12954,I never took the medication out of fear and my parents being very against me taking them.
12955,I guess I am just lost and I am looking for some advice on therapy and medication or just some comforting words.
12956,"still, though, i have another waitressing job and my hands are so incredibly obviously shaky as fuck when i'm handling plates around people and stuff

i'm sorry this is kind of all over the place, thanks for keeping up... i can clarify anything if need be

so anyway i haven't been on meds for about two years now, and i guess it was a combination of anxiety and nerves in general and the heat and my general not-feeling-well, but i fainted."
12957,"and i just generally don't feel comfortable wasting time with meds again if they don't work

again i can clarify anything if you need me to; i'm a mess right now i apologize but i don't expect everything in this to be perfect

thank you very much, i hope you're at least having a great day"
12958,TLDR: I'm very sensitive to medication and I took a small amount of Serax daily for 2 and a half weeks 5 months ago.
12959,"I really need meds, my life has pretty much fallen apart..."
12960,I was diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety when I was 10.
12961,"Throughout the years they tried me on different medications, but none seemed to work."
12962,Skip to when I turned 15.
12963,"I started smoking weed (actually vaping it, but same concept), and it helped in unbelievable ways."
12964,"I was no longer anxious, my OCD (sometimes) halted altogether, and I could be productive while feeling great."
12965,"Skip to present day, I take my (useless) medication and smoke on top of it to hinder the effects of anxiety and OCD."
12966,"I know some people use weed as a medication, but it's still in debate."
12967,What do you think?
12968,I haven't smoked in two weeks and I feel somewhat miserable and scrambled.
12969,"One might argue ""Oh!"
12970,"So you're addicted and you need marijuana to escape reality."""
12971,"Perhaps, but aren't you just describing all medicine?"
12972,"Comment, share your beliefs, agree/disagree, I want all opinions!"
12973,"I'm 21 and I live with my parents still, I've worked since I was 16 and paid for two years of community college, I'll be a junior in the fall."
12974,"After I graduated high school, my long time gf broke up with me, all my friends moved to different schools while I was still at home."
12975,"I was depressed and my anxiety caused many panic attacks during this time, my grades slipped also."
12976,"I talked to my parents a lot about this, just trying to get help."
12977,"They tell me I'll grow out of it, and that I just need to calm down."
12978,"I tried a couple medications throughout the year, and explaining to my mother that some just won't work well with me."
12979,"She claimed I was wasting money, and that anxiety and depression isn't a chemical imbalance in the brain like my doctor told me, and that I just need to grow up."
12980,"Other than this, my mother is completely loving and does everything for me."
12981,But she stresses me out so much.
12982,I've since brought my grades up and my anxiety is manageable currently.
12983,"I'm still working and saving up, and decided recently I want to go to a college 2 hours away."
12984,"My younger brother just graduated high school and is going to one of our states top public college and they are 100% supportive of him, always talking about it."
12985,"But no support for me at all it seems, and they tell me it's stupid to leave and not commute to the local college I got accepted into."
12986,"I want to go to the school two hours away, because I love the school, I love the program and I also want to leave this house."
12987,"They don't understand that they make my anxiety flare up constantly throughout the week, always wanting to start fights over small things, just complaining 24/7."
12988,"I've just started noticing this year how much of my anxiety is because of living here still, and my parents."
12989,"God I love them, but it's too much for me now."
12990,They tell me that I'll just get worse anxiety when I'm 2 hours away and on my own.
12991,"When I actually visited friends at their colleges and stayed for a couple days, hung out and went to events and I had a blast, yeah sure I had a bit of anxiety but I managed and I ended up having fun."
12992,I didn't want to go home when visiting.
12993,"Right now I'm waiting to hear back from the college, and just start the process of moving hopefully."
12994,Does anyone else have this sort of problem?
12995,"I have no one to talk to or ask about this, so I figured I would put this on here...

TLDR; Had serious anxiety my whole life, moved overseas @ 23 and had very little, moved back at 27 and had serious anxiety again, just returned to overseas and have none again."
12996,I struggled with anxiety my entire life growing up.
12997,"I went through a whirlwind of medications, therapists, good and bad times."
12998,"Eventually, I began to use marijuana daily, since it had less side effects than the other medications, was socially acceptable, and helped me make friends."
12999,"I grew very addicted and dependent on it, however, for almost 7 years."
13000,"When I was 23 when I was desperate for a job and newly graduated, I taught abroad in Korea."
13001,"Suddenly, my anxiety was gone, or at least greatly reduced."
13002,"For the first time since I was very young, I felt normal and happy."
13003,I stayed abroad for 4 years.
13004,"Though my life abroad wasn't perfect, it really helped me gain confidence, and I felt ready to go back to the USA 2 years ago."
13005,"In my home state, I found a good job in the tech industry, advanced my career to management, and made much more money than ever before."
13006,My family was so happy.
13007,"But my anxiety returned with full force, and I realized that I hadn't made any progress at all, that it was just some weird fluke I'd found."
13008,"Within months, I was again shy and reserved and unable to do things I enjoyed, couldn't date, and became again dependent on marijuana."
13009,I finally quit my job and moved back to Asia to teach ESL again.
13010,"My anxiety levels almost immediately plunged back to almost nothing, and I'm happy again."
13011,"The thing is, is this really sustainable for the rest of my life?"
13012,"I'm trying to advance my career more here, but I am limited by being a foreigner."
13013,I also really want to know if anyone else was helped by doing something similar.
13014,"I feel very lucky to be able to circumvent something that was so disabling, but also very lost, and having no one to talk to about this."
13015,"I'm on medication, I meditate I have been working towards 'normal' for a long time."
13016,Then suddenly I take anxiety medication and it calms down a bit so I'm curious do any of you get this symptom?
13017,i would like to know if anyone could recommend medication that would fit me.
13018,"I'm afraid to see a professional because of what he may say, I'm also afraid of getting put on medication, I don't want to rely on drugs to feel normal, and I don't want to be taking 20 pills a day in 10 years."
13019,"Today I sit here medication free for years now (not that there is anything wrong with medication, but if you feel like you don't need it than why bother)."
13020,I was put on meds to help with both with the anxiety and the depression.
13021,Now I've come off my meds and I'm trying to see if I can cope without them.
13022,Since it takes a long time apparently to get an appointment to see one (almost three months apparently) I opted to have my doctor prescribe me medication (50mg of Zoloft).
13023,"Once coming back to school and starting therapy at the counseling center I asked my therapist if I could get an appointment with a psychiatrist on campus, just for a consultation to be sure I was on the right medicine and what not."
13024,"I have been in therapy for social anxiety for almost 6 months now, and I have about reached the point where I am seriously considering psychotropic medication."
13025,Part of me feels like I am giving up by trying medication because I feel like I should be able to be happy without having to rely on meds.
13026,"If anyone cares to share about their experience with medication, I would be greatly appreciative, especially if your story is similar to mine."
13027,"I'm 21M from Ontario, Canada, about to graduate university and pretty concerned about life after school."
13028,I've never been diagnosed with or treated for a mental disorder before but I think I've deteriorated to the point where I need to start considering treatment.
13029,"I'm not sure if this is an overly common question and I'm sorry if it is, but I haven't seen any answers that really helped."
13030,I've just decided I need to get serious about treating my anxiety but I'm worried about being excluded from certain careers based on this decision.
13031,"I've heard that it's illegal to discriminate based on mental health, but things like [this](http://news.clearancejobs.com/2010/04/23/mental-health-and-interim-security-clearances/) don't really inspire much confidence."
13032,"I'm looking for answers to these sorts of questions:

- Have any of you experience discrimination and exclusion from a job/job opportunity based on a history of anxiety?"
13033,- Do people discriminate differently against those taking medications for anxiety vs. those pursuing exclusively non-pharmaceutical therapy?
13034,- Would it be moral/legal/possible to withhold information on a history of anxiety?
13035,- Are there ways I could protect myself against future discrimination (e.g.
13036,by providing evidence that the therapy would not interfere with my ability to work)?
13037,"Thanks for everything, you guys are the greatest!"
13038,"Whether it be a medicine, stuffed animal, person, etc."
13039,"He hit all the questions you're supposed to ask when giving care to someone who may lose consciousness, questions to ask while you're waiting for the ambulance to arrive:  *are you taking any medication right now?"
13040,"Then we start talking my meds, which include Lexapro, Xanax, and Neurotin, and she mentions that I should try Welbutrin as well, which I was up for."
13041,"I am really wary about going on meds, because I'm a nursing student so I've basically seen/learned about every terrible thing that can go wrong while taking every kind of antidepressant."
13042,My anxiety has been relatively manageable recently but I just finally got a prescription for nuvigil after years of being lucky to get occasional samples of the medication.
13043,I have been on the medication for about 5 weeks after constant depression and the occational tantrum leaving me in a sometimes (more often than I'd like to admit) crying state.
13044,"A few weeks before I recieved medication After 2 weeks I was upped from 5 to 10mg a day, although I have been led to believe that escitalopram is a really weak anit-depressant(?)."
13045,"Google tells me the medication ""supposedly"" works, followed by a full page of side-effects."
13046,To be completely honest I don't feel anything from the medication.
13047,"I don't think my psychiatrist is going to take me off my current medicine (100 mg Amitriptyline each night), but I was wondering if anyone else had suffered from a vitamin D deficiency and if the supplements helped you."
13048,Right now my primary prescription writer is my family doctor.
13049,"He's done a great job up to now, but I see him so rarely that I would like to think someone else who gets to know my needs a little better could prescribe more efficient medications."
13050,I also know that its about time for me to start some sort of therapy again.
13051,"However, I hadn't had good luck at finding a psychiatrist who is good at both the therapy side as well as the medication side."
13052,"It seems like I either find a shrink who just wants to push pills, or someone who thinks everything can be solved without drugs and only therapy."
13053,I did manage to get on the wait list (a wait list for therapy?)
13054,at my local colleges clinic who has a very respected psychology department.
13055,"However, they specifically mention they would make medication recommendations."
13056,"**TL'DR Know I need help, looking for help, can't find help."
13057,Dealing with healthcare is a pain.
13058,**
13059,"(Also, I'm not an any medication except Xanax, which I take as needed.)"
13060,I've been dealing with moderate to severe anxiety and depression for the past three years.
13061,"Prior to this bonanza of mental disorder, I was a bright, independent thinker who prided herself most on her sense of humor and her ability to make people laugh."
13062,"However, these past few years have put me through countless trails of failed medications, ever-evolving anxiety symptoms, eating disorders, and a psychological and/or physical addiction to Lorazepam (Ativan)."
13063,"I'm not currently on any medication, as I've become far too over-sensitized to handle any of the initial side effects."
13064,"My symptoms started simple enough; nausea, light headedness, pounding heart."
13065,"At the time I was horrified, but now I can't help but look back with bitterness in regards to my naivety."
13066,"As I stated earlier, my anxiety is always constantly evolving."
13067,"Once I'm able to conquer a set of symptoms, my brain is always able to come up with something worse."
13068,"My current panic attacks involve derealization, inability to breath, heart palpitations, shaking, diarrhea, and a nightmarish existential mindset."
13069,"Since stopping medication, my panic attacks significantly decreased."
13070,"However, my generalized anxiety developed many new symptoms that I still don't completely understand."
13071,Most of these symptoms are mental.
13072,"I've always been a bit shy, but not so shy that I hid under my bed, with my laptop, in the dark, eating a mixture of brown sugar and honey (the only 'foods' that were in my room) for most of the day because I didn't want my flatmates to know I was home."
13073,Social anxiety is something I never experienced before.
13074,It's almost a physical sensation that creeps up and lingers around the back of my neck.
13075,I feel it.
13076,I feel the shame and judgment from people who aren't even there.
13077,It's morbid and ridiculous.
13078,The thing I'm struggling with most at this point is my ability to think and my loss of personality.
13079,This aspect is without a doubt the most upsetting.
13080,I don't feel like a person.
13081,I don't remember how to think on my feet or use my creativity to have a sense of humor.
13082,"I think that's the best way to describe it too- as if you'd forgotten something, something that you were once very familiar with, but is somehow now unattainable."
13083,This one is also like a physical sensation.
13084,"Like a hot, hazy, fatigued feeling in my brain."
13085,"It's as if my brain can't physically access that information, which is heartbreaking."
13086,"It happens socially as well, where I find myself either responding or reacting to what someone else is saying."
13087,"Somehow that allows the conversation to carry on, but I'm fully aware that I have no thoughts of my own to offer."
13088,"The same applies to any type of thinking, though, not exclusively creative thinking."
13089,"For instance, academically, I have such a difficult time understanding anything."
13090,"I can comprehend basic, surface ideas, but if a concept required much use of deeper/higher thinking strategies, my brain can't do it."
13091,I get that fatigued brain feeling and can't physically multitask with ideas.
13092,I need to have the simplest concepts explained to me in excruciating detail in order to understand them.
13093,I'm not even sure how to explain it without confusing myself in this exact way.
13094,I've also developed OCD like tendencies.
13095,"I will not try to claim that I know much about OCD, nor do I believe I have it."
13096,"It's almost as though everything must be perfect and in order, all the damn time."
13097,"It's taking all my strength to just write what I think, rather than write a spotless piece of prose."
13098,"The majority of the time I either must make everything perfect, and if I cannot I do not attempt it."
13099,"Or rather, I know that I can create something beautiful, but I also know that the extent of the mental fatigue and frustration I will feel in the process is not worth the product."
13100,"I'm in my second year of university right now, and I don't know how to deal with this."
13101,How are you supposed to live life like a real person when you don't feel like a real person?
13102,"Any help, advice, or similar experiences welcome."
13103,"Side note: I realize that much of this is a scattered and irrelevant mess, but I suppose that's just an accurate representation of how I feel at the moment."
13104,"**TL;DR Over time I have lost my ability to think creatively, have a distinguishable personality, comprehend ideas (academic or otherwise)."
13105,"And hell, many other issues that can't be summarized in a TL;DR.**"
13106,"I have IBS too and sometimes my antispasmodic medicine helps, but it isnt great."
13107,Maybe for some of you therapy or medication hasnt been working and isnt the answer.
13108,"I feel that I have it pretty well under control with medication and coping strategies, but one thing that still triggers anxiety flair ups is having to sleep in new places."
13109,"Even though the medication worked to some effect, i still felt the increasing urge to escape my reality and i turned to drugs."
13110,"If there is nothing medically wrong, than trying out medication or seeking therapy can really help."
13111,*can* prescribe and manage medication on a regular basis).
13112,"It's progressively gotten worse, and I finally made the decision after a few months of counselling to start medication."
13113,"TL,DR, I occasionally mix my Meds with Alcohol after really bad (2-3 hour long) attacks and it works but I wonder if I should get a different medication."
13114,"Back story: diagnosed with GAD about 3 years ago, refuse medication and just trying to handle it myself."
13115,I was up till 6am and finally got to sleep after a heavy dose of medication.
13116,"I've researched enough and the Doc has gotten great reviews, my question is, is it okay to talk to a regular physician and possibly get medication for this?"
13117,"I know there's no easy answer to that question, but I'm interested to hear why those of you who take medication decided to do so."
13118,"It's caused me to seek therapy, get on medication, read self-help books, surf this subreddit, read others' stories..."
13119,"I'm assuming I have some genetic mutation or biochemical imbalance that leaves me predisposed to this illness, because medication has helped significantly."
13120,I have never really taken any kind of medication before.
13121,Hi friends!
13122,"I have some questions about what appears to be anxiety, and how to manage it."
13123,"I'm considering seeing a doctor soon, however I don't have insurance and am wary of beginning new medications, although I have done some light research into CBT and am considering that option."
13124,"Background info: 
The last few months of my life have been pretty intense, I've ended an unhealthy relationship, begun a new (incredibly healthy and supportive yet intense both romantically and creatively) relationship."
13125,I just put in notice with a part time job and began a new one all the while having another full time job in between.
13126,Essentially I have three jobs for the next month and a new relationship on the go yet have always been used to a sizeable amount of alone time for relaxing and recharging which there doesn't seem to be enough hours in the day for anymore.
13127,"I have always been an over analyzer, however over the last two weeks I have gotten stuck in my own head, experiencing endless mind chatter and feelings of dread, intrusive thoughts such as unwarranted feelings of doubt towards my relationship and other negative thoughts."
13128,"Physically I have been experiencing headaches, chest tightness and a fast heartbeat, achey or weak feeling muscles and a general malaise."
13129,"All of these things come and go, any tips or tricks for managing these symptoms?"
13130,"Currently I'm trying to drink more water and schedule more time for myself to relax, and writing positive mantras for myself to remember during the more intense anxiety attacks."
13131,"Tldr; relatively new to anxiety, please help!"
13132,http://youtu.be/1eSMxRya2S8
13133,"I don't take medication, because I never believed that I needed it, but this event is making me think otherwise... F 19"
13134,"My psychiatrist said that the worst of it should be today, tomorrow, and the next day, so I want to try to continue the meds but I'm finding it hard to keep motivated when I know that if I quit I would go back to 'normal' in a day or two."
13135,I went to see my GP thinking he may want me to switch meds.
13136,He also said it typically takes 3-4 weeks at theraputic dose for the side effects to go away and 6-8 weeks for the meds to start working.
13137,"I didn’t tell her that every night when I took my medication, I would pour out all of the pills into my hand and wonder if this was the night they’d go down my throat instead of back into the bottle."
13138,"So, this is my first post on /r/anxiety, I was up until 4am last night jumping out of my skin, worrying I was going to jump out of my house or die in my sleep from halving my anti-anxiety meds that I've been on for (no joke) FIFTEEN years."
13139,"There's a tornado watch in my area, I have no medicine (besides alcohol) and I am alone and really scared."
13140,Are my meds not working?
13141,I think that is because I have fairly vivid and intense dreams due to the medication I am on (30mg Mirtazapine) and sometimes even waking up with sleep paralysis which isnt pleasant.
13142,I gave up on therapy because finding the right mg of my medication seemed to reduce my problems to the point that I could have a normal life.
13143,I've been dealing with very bad anxiety that has almost made me completely house-ridden for about 7 years now and have never taken medication for it and try to avoid taking medicine as much as possible.
13144,Im getting counseling and they suggested I try medicine considering how debilitating it is so I decided to see a psychiatrist to see if medicine would help.
13145,"I guess I just want to hear other people's experiences with lorazepam for an anti-anxiety medicine, good or bad."
13146,"My hugest stressors right now are: Work, anxiety, discomfort (generally speaking), money, medication, sleep (or lack thereof), and it all originates from my god damn head."
13147,is marijuana.
13148,It keeps me from having panic attacks and calms me down when I am stressed or upset.
13149,It bring me down from a really frantic horrible state of mind and makes me functional.
13150,Smoking before doing my homework has improved my grades and kept me from dropping out of college.
13151,When I smoke I'm also a lot more patient.
13152,"When I'm really frantic and I smoke just a little, I don't get confrontational or angry with people that don't deserve it like my parents or my friends."
13153,Marijuana has done a lot to improve the quality of my daily life.
13154,"The thing is, trees are the only thing that really work for me."
13155,I've tried prescription medications and they all give me really bad side effects and make me sick.
13156,"Plus they make me hazy, so I can't concentrate on anything and usually end up going to sleep."
13157,"My mom was addicted to Xanax for a long time, so on top of being really sensitive and reacting badly to these pills, I have anxiety about taking the pills because I have the gene for addiction on both sides of my family."
13158,The reason I'm telling you this is not because I want everyone to chuck their pills and be stoned all day.
13159,I only smoke a small amount for anxiety relief (I smoke larger amounts recreationally) and really all it does it keep away the racing thoughts and constant worry.
13160,"Its a delicate balance, if I smoke too much when I'm already feeling really down it just makes me unmotivated and I feel worse."
13161,"If I just enough before I start to feel bad or panicky, it keeps me from spiraling and helps me to focus."
13162,I stopped smoking for a while (for several reasons) and found that within a day or two I was constantly panicked and couldn't get anything done.
13163,"I was worrying about everything, things that didn't make sense to worry about, getting panic attacks about things that didn't matter."
13164,"This is what my life had been every day before I found what worked for me, and I never want to go back there again."
13165,"Anxiety is a mental illness, which means it can be treated, and more importantly, its NOT YOUR FAULT."
13166,"Finding a solution to my anxiety and depression problems made me feel like myself again, happy and fulfilled and calm, when for YEARS I was sure that I would feel horrible for the rest of my life."
13167,Marijuana is what works for me.
13168,It might be what works for you.
13169,It might not be.
13170,It took a while for me to work with my therapist to figure out when and how much I should smoke to gain the right effects.
13171,I also smoke certain strains that I know help more than hinder me.
13172,Just keep pushing!
13173,"Looking for an answer and knowing that a happy you is waiting just beneath all the worry, fear and sadness you may feel right now."
13174,Things will get better.
13175,"As someone who was where many of you are a few months ago, I can tell you it sure as hell is worth the fight."
13176,I want to avoid medication if possible.
13177,"I'm a 24 year old male with a history of shaky relationships were I had problems with commitment (especially my current one), self destructive behavior, was on medication from the ages of 12-15 for depression and high levels of anxiety, and I believe it's all from the loss of my father at the age of 12."
13178,Often times I start sweating when around people and my head will start to feel tense and warm.
13179,I've also had a fair share of muscle twitches and spasms and today it was more obnoxious then usual.
13180,"The twitching is something I never really hear people talk about, am I out of the ordinary?"
13181,I don't take any medications nor have I tried any.
13182,I've been diagnosed clinically with GAD for nearly a year.
13183,"So far, had changed medications from SSRI [Escitalopram] to Agomelatine [Valdoxan]."
13184,I'm a graduated entry medical student and currently in my 3rd year.
13185,Struggled a lot throughout med school and I even failed my USMLE Step 1.
13186,Have to retake next year in May.
13187,I come with depression since then.
13188,No one to talk to.
13189,Not even to my family because they are easily fall into depression too.
13190,"I'm asking my fellow reddits, what are your solutions to taking things into hands in daily life?"
13191,What's the coping mechanism?
13192,I started to lose faith and hope to everything since failing my exam and feel very inferior towards everyone.
13193,"Right before he left, I had a full blown migraine (which required a trip to the ER for meds) which resulted in feeling anxious for nearly the whole month he was gone."
13194,"I wasn't on any meds, just dealing with it through a little therapy (that was pretty useless)."
13195,"When I became incredibly depressed and suicidal (with no intentions of following through) in the first couple weeks of my medication, I called my doctor and ended up getting his assistant."
13196,Is it the smoking causing this or the medication?
13197,"I feel like if the medication was actually working, I wouldn't have panic attacks no matter what the situation was."
13198,My doctor upped the dosage of my medication the other day.
13199,I saw my doctor last Monday for a refill on my anxiety meds (Clonazepam) and she said I need to see a mental healthcare professional so I can talk about the stuff that is out of control.
13200,First post here.
13201,"I've been suffering from anxiety and panic attacks for a little while now, and it's new to me."
13202,I'm 22 years old and get anxiety when I hear about health conditions.
13203,"I'm 100% healthy, and have no genetic predispositions to diseases or illnesses."
13204,"Yet, whenever I read about people having heart attacks, seizures, bipolar disorder strokes, etc., I feel the start of a panic attack."
13205,"I usually push the attack away with my mind, but the looming anxiety and attack possibility is always there."
13206,"I have a lot of stress in my life, and it doesn't help that I work in a hospital, where medical issues surround me."
13207,"I just moved 2,000 miles away from home to a new city away from my family and friends."
13208,I don't know if that's causing it because it happened a few weeks after I moved here and started my job.
13209,Please help me.
13210,How can I treat this?
13211,"(no medications, prefferably)."
13212,I want to change the way I think.
13213,I don't want these medical issues to scare me.
13214,"And it's not a conscious fear, it's just always there in the back if my head."
13215,"Just typing out the words ""heart attack"" makes my heart race and I can't swallow."
13216,I explained the situation to her and she prescribed some medication to help me get over my anxiety issues.
13217,"The medication is called Cipralex and after doing some research, I decided against taking the medication as I believe that the anxiety issue in my case is not so strong that I must take the medication to help me cope with it."
13218,"I'm on meds, but they can't help me get past my base fears of negative change."
13219,"Now that I'm on medication, I almost never want sex."
13220,"I don't know how to fix this, but without the medication I'm a nervous wreck."
13221,"I have noticed that the anxiety gets a lot better when I take some of my leftover hyperthyroid meds, such as atenolol or trazodone."
13222,"Gallbladder is fine, stomach is fine, acid issue is being dealt with by the meds."
13223,In an ideal world (ha) I would be on NO medication but I don't know how to not have panic all the time without it.
13224,"My counselor suggested I might be a person who has to be on medication forever which makes me want to say ""no thanks""."
13225,"Original post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1wu2d9/meds_klonopin_has_turned_my_anxiety_around/

I wish I had never started on benzos."
13226,"Some backround: I'm 28 years old, didn't have the greatest of childhoods and I've dealt with some depression in the past (which I didn't see anyone or get any meds for)."
13227,"In 2013, I started seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed me SSRIs/antipsychotics over a period of a year to try and find out what would help me best (Lexapro, Luvox, Paxil, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Risperdal, Xanax XR, etc...) At the end of the year, ultimately I felt highly cognitively impaired, put on insane weight, and felt completely lucid and decided to quit cold turkey because it was entirely too much of a social burden to continue to see him or anyone in public for that matter and ween off the medication."
13228,So I just now decided to try meds yet again and am reluctant.
13229,"This time around, the psychiatrist I am seeing has unexpectedly theorized that I might have untreated ADHD that when treated with meds, may also inadvertently cure my other issues."
13230,I am still not adapting to a functioning life and NEED advice on common and easy to access coping mechanisms so I can continue making progress and not be so reliant on medication.
13231,"I've always had terrible anxiety, and for the past four or five years I've tried to stay completely off medication for it."
13232,"Well, I'm in college and it's been getting harder and harder to move forward as I get closer and closer to my degree."
13233,"Last semester I received a C in an English class, and although it was challenging, that's not me."
13234,"No matter what life events may spring up, I get that fucking A."
13235,"This past semester, however, I spiraled out of control and lost myself."
13236,I really felt hopeless.
13237,The anxiety was causing depression and I couldn't function anymore.
13238,"So, what did I do?"
13239,I went to the doctor and explained my symptoms.
13240,"I've taken biology and psychology, I know a little about medications, how they work, and most importantly I can identify my symptoms as abnormal and seek help."
13241,"So, after a week of being zonked out on this medication, it's finally begun to kick in."
13242,This week has been much better.
13243,I can shower without wanting to give up halfway through.
13244,I wake up without that ball of anxiousness that always seemed to be right in the center of my chest.
13245,"You guys - today I signed up for one fall class, and I'll be signing up for another tomorrow."
13246,"This, for me, is progress."
13247,"It means I'm coming out of my safe place, that haunting place I retreat to when my world is dark and desperate."
13248,"It's hard for me to face the real world when I'm scared and confused, but slowly, I'm coming back!"
13249,"No one held my hand and guided me to the light, instead, I took care of myself."
13250,"I am powerful, bright, and passionate!"
13251,"No matter how, or how often, life hands me shit - I WILL succeed."
13252,This is MY life.
13253,Around 2 weeks or so of the medication I started to notice less loving feelings and it progressed to numbness to all things at the 75mg dose.
13254,Is it normal for medicine to cause some anxiety attacks before it starts working?
13255,"I'm anxious (ha ha) to start taking some type of meds, but I'm married and my anxiety has taken a toll on my relationship and general life and I'm starting to think it might be worth it."
13256,"I'm concerned about side effects, addiction and other issues with the meds."
13257,Should I continue taking this medicine- is it normal to have increased attacks in the beginning?
13258,I am on no medication and have yet to consult a doctor as I don't think I have enough information to give to a professional in order for them to help.
13259,"Part of me was really excited to finally have some relief from anxiety, but the other part was concerned because I've never taken any kind of prescription medication before (except very mild pain-killers after I got my wisdom teeth out)."
13260,"My mom is very against prescription medication because she's very wary of side effects, and was really concerned when I told her it was something I've been considering."
13261,"I was told my thyroid levels were really low (I have Graves Disease and was already on levothyroxine), and they changed my medicine and put me on a low-level beta blocker."
13262,My doctor put me on a blood pressure medicine with a diuretic (I don't have any idea why) and it dehydrated me and made me sicker within 4 days time.
13263,Did you take meds?
13264,I want to point out that my GP said my Anxiety MAY have been caused by medication I had taken earlier Christmas day for bronchial irritation that I was prescribed.
13265,She said it may take up to 6 months for the medicine to fully leave my system.
13266,"This is the medicine I took right here FYI: 

http://www.drugs.com/sfx/azithromycin-side-effects.html

&gt; Psychiatric side effects have included aggressive reaction and anxiety during postmarketing experience."
13267,"Or should I try to go all out and tackle my anxiety to the fullest and try to stop it before it picks up any steam via medicine, therapy, etc?"
13268,"But - if I move, I won't have insurance to cover the meds I take for my anxiety."
13269,"He said I can live with him rent free till I find a job, I'd just need money for food and personal expenses,  but meds are expensive without insurance."
13270,"I walked the dog, gave her all her medicine, got dressed (not as extravagantly as yesterday), fed the cat, and cleaned the cat litter pan all within the first hour of waking up."
13271,"The things my therapist suggested doing to block out the racing thoughts aren't working, my new meds haven't started working yet so I'm having a drink to shut my head up."
13272,"I was hoping this day would  come because being with him causes as much anxiety as being without him, but I was hoping it would happen once I got on the right meds and got them working."
13273,"I've never taken any psychiatric medication before, and I was told this one could have a sedative effect."
13274,"And then went to the doctor for new meds to help with my ""can't breathe problem""."
13275,"She claims that she doesn't want to be a ""zombie"" on medication (she gets mad ad me for even suggesting this route), and that talking her issues out to some sort of therapist or counselor is ""stupid"" and ""pointless""."
13276,"i have been taking meds for anxiety for a couple years now, a few times on and off thinking i could deal without them."
13277,"I started taking meds for depression at first, and the problem went away (i could not focus on my breathing for long enough, meds luckily brought on their own form of a.d.d.)."
13278,"Stopped taking the meds after a year, breathing problem came back."
13279,"Went back to school, needed meds again but now properly dosed towards anxiety, problem went away again."
13280,i want to get off the meds for good.
13281,Recently my therapist suggested seeing a psychiatrist to evaluate possible medication and he urged me to try as he thought my problems had lasted for too long while only getting worse instead of better.
13282,"I was wondering how you dealt with starting medication, when it wouldn't work for you or when the side effect were very severe."
13283,"The medication I've been perscribed is Lexapro, or escitalopram."
13284,- did you switch meds or how did you fix the situation?
13285,I was previously on celexa for about 3 years but it stopped being effective and I went off of meds completely for a while.
13286,Now I'm on meds and therapy but I soil have really bad days.
13287,I think I'd be a wreck without meds.
13288,I hear about people getting off meds.
13289,I started taking medication for anxiety 2 weeks and I haven't really noticed a difference.
13290,This wouldn't be such a huge problem if I didn't have to get an OK from her to have my prescription renewed.
13291,"I currently have 1 and 1/4 25 MG Zoloft tablets, as I cut one into fourths to conserve it until I could get my prescription which I figured would take 2 days at the most to be made and ready for pick up, but that certainly won't be the case..."
13292,"I previously made a post saying school was starting soon, and it starts on the 21 so I'm completely freaking out."
13293,"I know there are over the counter anxiety medications, but I'm hesitant to try them."
13294,Help?
13295,"Lately I have been having panic attacks in the mornings.I refused they were panic attacks and thought I was just getting nauseous.There were other symptoms I just linked to nauseua that I later read were linked to panic wttacks.Anyeay,im finally accelting these as panic attacks because 1) my primary care provider said it was ""above him"" when I went into an appointment and experienced an attack.I suppose it was because I paced to keep my mind off of ythe subje...And 2)I experienced it in the afternoon during a weekend.This is a sign to me the issue is getting worse.Heres the backstory:
Im in my first year of high school,and did not experience this until near the beginning of september.I wake up and feel nauseous,like having to throw up.I get shortness of breath and feel like I cant breathe.Ive tried to take deep breaths but this turned to be counter productive because it dried out my throat.There is constantly ""flem"" in my throat,presumably due to allergies as diagnosed by my doctor but allergy meds nevef worked,I simpy cope.This made me feel like I was choking on the flem bassically.Other symptoms include my fingertipz,feet,and teeth starting to go numb and burping.I have no conclusive link as to why it happened during the weekend,but I assume it is because I was in an area that reminded me of the school.I was in a store,and mainly it was the cold temlerature."
13296,"I am asking for help here because I do not want to use medication,and need sel help tips."
13297,I have a lifetime history of mental disorders and medication starting with PTSD and Zoloft at 16.
13298,When I was 21 I had a depressive episode and was misdiagnosed as bipolar2 and put on heavy meds Seroquel and Effexor for 1yr.
13299,I changed states and changed mental health providers and after 6months they believed I was misdiagnosed and I was withdrawn from meds.
13300,The medication was amazing and my anxiety was gone.
13301,After 18months on medication I spoke with my GP and I decided I was better and could handle myself without medication now.
13302,I started slowly weaning off meds and now I am 2 months free from Paroxetine.
13303,I feel like a failure and I feel like I don't want to be on medication for the rest of my life.
13304,Are there other people here who just function better on medication and are resigned to taking it for the long haul?
13305,HI everybody!
13306,I've been out of town and away from stress and getting my mental health back.
13307,"I was having a lot of pain problems, still do, but they have decreased tremendously!"
13308,"My question is, has anyone ever just kept getting random stomach drop feelings?"
13309,"I keep getting those occasionally, only downside of living at home is that I have to travel a ton."
13310,"It's usually on the road that I get them, my grandma and mom are older and they like to go to the casino (super high stress for me) and I get them there too."
13311,How do I control these without medications!
13312,"I don't get them often, but when I do they can be very painful and discouraging!"
13313,Anyway thanks in advance!
13314,He has spoken to several doctors who have each given him a different medication.
13315,He refuses to take any of these meds because he looks them up online and sees the possible side effects and becomes afraid of them.
13316,"I try to understand so I haven't nagged him to take the meds, I am trying to help him cope without medicine."
13317,"I have begged him to take his meds, or to go see a therapist because of all this but he refuses."
13318,"There are certain days he tells me he's ready to take his meds and get better, but he never follows through with it."
13319,"So for the short term, what meds would you guys recommend?"
13320,"Around the time this started up for me, my bipolar girlfriend was yanked off of a medication and is now extremely unstable."
13321,"I also have horrible year round allergies and now that I know to control my anxiety and triggers, I've noticed most allergy meds trigger it for me."
13322,So to anyone who may be put off by the medication at first please comminicate with your dr. regarding any concerns typically things do get better.
13323,"Current meds I'm on are Venlafaxine (225mg/day), Quetiapine (300mg/day) and Gabapentin (900mg/day)."
13324,That didn’t help at all and the meds they put me on made me very moody and even more depressed than I already was.
13325,"A few years ago, I tried it, and it helped, but I was paranoid I would become dependent on medication, so I tapered off and returned to my normal state of anxiety."
13326,I've just briefly mentioned anxiety to my doctor but she is against putting me on medication.
13327,"I lost 65 pounds, cleaned up my act, got on meds for my bipolar, feeling pretty good."
13328,I'm considering biting the bullet and getting some meds.
13329,"As soon as I can, I'm going to get on meds."
13330,"Last week, we took a medication math test."
13331,Am I doomed to be on meds forever and have to send my husband to the store because I'm scared?
13332,"Either way, it was annoying that I was on meds to help out with those random social anxiety episodes and it was still going on."
13333,"It seems as though with the meds, I was able to keep my mind at least in control, I did get anxious some times, however I don't remember it being as annoying as this."
13334,"Because I believe that the meds have essentially out of my system the first two weeks, I will remain off them to see if this wave of anxiety passes, or if I can control it."
13335,"If within a month I am feeling worse, or this anxiety remains at this level I will go back onto meds."
13336,I'm not on any medication but I do take melatonin occasionaly because it usually helps but this is the first time it isn't helping and it's making me freak out more.
13337,I had medication for a week and my anxiety went away so I got off of it but then it came back the next time I started my period and its been only at night since then.
13338,Does anyone have experience with going off of their meds?
13339,"Should I try medicine, or should I just give up?"
13340,I don't know if my meds are not working anymore or if I'm just going NUTS.
13341,"I feel like the walls are closing in, my mind is racing a million miles an hour and I left my medication at home, a 30 minute commute."
13342,"Hello, I'd really just appreciate any opinions in terms of my current medications."
13343,"I understand you are not my doctors,  but i would respect/appreciate any thoughts."
13344,"A tiny bit of info, i am currently off work as directed by my dr for 16 weeks (currently in the middle) to figure out what medications can help."
13345,"I was having extreme anxiety attacks and panic attacks, extreme mood swings, self harm, flashbacks etc."
13346,We started  off with 25 mg zoloft and 25mg of seroquel in may.
13347,I am now at 75 mg seroquel and 200 mg zoloft (which he doesn't want to increase).
13348,I am currently waiting to see a psychiatrist to be diagnosed from her and see if she has any recommendations for different medications.
13349,I was being treated for bipolar in the past but my dr now is treating me for depression and anxiety/panic attacks.
13350,"The psychiatrist i am waiting to see specializes in PTSD, and my counselor feels confident this will be a good match for me and figuring out meds."
13351,Soo...sorry to have gone on so long.
13352,But basically i am wondering if anyone is on / has been on the current medication im on or similar dose and how they were feeling?
13353,Any improvements?
13354,"I ask because while i have felt  improvements in the amount of anxiety attacks a day i get, they still occur, along with the mood swings, can't leave the house, anxious thoughts that lead to almost paranoid thoughts."
13355,"So, i am curious since i see my dr in about a week if we should increase either of my meds until i see the psychiatrist, or keep things the way they are until then?"
13356,I am so sorry if this was long or confusing.
13357,Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated :) thank you!
13358,Either way I want to go to the doctor and get medication.
13359,I was wondering if I should go to the GP and in your experiences do they put you on meds immediately or no?
13360,I feel more in control than I did as a zombie on the meds.
13361,"I am currently taking a new medicine for my anxiety disorder (just started Bupropion SR 150 mg, twice daily) after taking Venlafaxine for over a year."
13362,"Anyway, I’m a senior in college and I have been having libido problems with previous medication, hence the switching."
13363,"In hopes to get me better by the time break was over, I took the Venlafaxine every other day for a week while taking the new Bupropion, and then completely stopped the Venlafaxine and switched to my new medication."
13364,"Thank you

TL:DR Basically stopped Venlafaxine (an Effexor) cold turkey and switched to a new medication (Bupropion)."
13365,That would get me on the plane without medication.
13366,Hey everyone.
13367,I'm just getting back from the psychiatrist and I was inspired to write a quick few notes to people who are thinking about trying to get medication or are maybe a bit scared of taking it and are looking for others' opinions.
13368,"When I first was considering it and when I was first prescribed, I checked the anxiety/depression reddits to see other peoples' experiences."
13369,"The first thing you have to realize here is that **antidepressants affect everyone differently, and other peoples' experiences may not mirror your own**."
13370,"When I was first prescribed Lexapro, I was anxious about taking it due to bad experiences I had seen here, and with a fair amount of upvotes relatively, at that."
13371,"An important thing to notice is that **the sample you're** (partially) **basing your medication ideas off of is biased** (being /r/anxiety and /r/depression or related subreddits):

* People are more likely to post about something if it has affected them negatively."
13372,"A small (but very real) percentage does worsen from medications, but this is not representative of the population."
13373,"* People still browsing/subscribed to this subreddit (and related) are likely to still be afflicted by these conditions, and thus have less-than-favorable experiences with medication."
13374,I really hope it doesn't seem like I'm bashing this and other subreddits.
13375,I just want to try and help people who may be unsure about medication (like me before I started taking it).
13376,"Stay strong, everyone."
13377,"I don't want to go on medication, and I don't use any sort of substance (like marijuana)."
13378,"I am not on medication or in therapy right now because I have no health insurance whatsoever, am poor, and live in a country far from my family or other people who could help."
13379,I noticed huge improvements a week in on the meds and have had only a few minor side effects.
13380,Most notably stomach pains in the morning if I do not eat anything with my meds.
13381,"Lately, I have been noticing that I am very antsy, even though I don't feel any real ""anxiety"" symptoms like I was prior to taking the meds."
13382,"I feel like it might be a combination of the meds, and my constant seeking of information that never lets my brain stop."
13383,"I feel afraid to do things like make a phone call, take a shower, or clean my room, or even read a book or watch TV."
13384,"There are times when I'm able to just push myself through it and do tasks anyway, and I fulfill my basic duties (I'm unemployed, but both of my parents are currently disabled, so I housekeep and cook for them, take care of the pets, rebandage my dad's wound, etc.)"
13385,but sometimes I literally feel like I can't do anything of my own.
13386,"I feel ashamed, and I feel lazy."
13387,"I know I'm just wasting my life away because I'm in constant fear, and I hate it."
13388,"I'm seeing a psychiatrist, and we found a good medication for my mood swings... but it doesn't appear to be helping the constant feeling of dread."
13389,"I have another appointment coming up soon, but I really don't like being on medications if I can avoid it."
13390,Am I the only one who feels so terrified of everyday things?
13391,Does anyone have advice for getting past the invisible wall?
13392,Is it possible to overcome or should I just resign to living high on meds for the rest of my life ?
13393,I've been doing exceptionally well on my medicine the past few months and just noticed this small regression lately.
13394,"This year was very bad for me, because it took almost all year for me to get on the right medicine and stop having panic attacks and depression."
13395,"He flat out told me that it sounds like I did and that he doesn't know what to do since I'm on the highest levels of medication(1mg Alprazolam, 150mg Effexor) but to change my medication and see him often."
13396,"I have read that this is a common side effect of the medicine, but I am wondering if this is actually causing any real damage to my body."
13397,The medicine is great otherwise.
13398,"Someone already suggested L-Theanine, and I'm just wondering what other meds exist and what your experience has been."
13399,"I'm going to start seeing a new therapist and want to talk to him/her about medication options, and I want to be informed."
13400,"My new doctor, who I saw for the first time ever today, was really great though and told me what I needed to look for and said I'd probably be a little nauseous for the first 5-7 days of starting the meds."
13401,This is my very first medication to treat anxiety so I'm pretty nervous.
13402,"Since then, I've been able to manage my anxiety through medication (Paxil, once a day) and therapy, which I still attend sometimes."
13403,My question is directed at those who also take medication to control symptoms.
13404,"I am aware that the drug is probably still in my body, but I am experiencing psychological symptoms and cannot access my medication right now."
13405,So far it hasn't been SO bad with proper medication and breathing exercises I am getting through it.
13406,"I am also at this dilemma now, because I just drank, and if anything would still happen, I cannot resource to my helpful anxiety medication."
13407,He's tried therapy and medication in the past and is resistant to trying them again because he believes they won't work.
13408,I'm gonna try to distract myself for a little bit and then take my sleeping aid medication.
13409,So I did the only thing besides medication that's been helping: I went into the bathroom and cried.
13410,I go to therapy but don't take meds.
13411,"female, not on meds, really horrible anxiety and OCD problems according to a therapist I had once."
13412,For all I know is the difference between the last two is the ability to prescribe medication.
13413,"Besides medication, that is."
13414,"I have anxiety and depression, and just recently started taking medicine for it (roughly three weeks ago)."
13415,"The medicine was helping a lot, but I now I'm feeling crazy again."
13416,"However, when I started the medicine, I began to feel so much better (generic Lexapro, 10mg)."
13417,"The anxiety is tough - the medicine is still working, so it flares up and then goes away, but I just hate the medicine, and the anxiety too."
13418,"After a summer of hell I finally sought help, and today I was supposed to meet with my therapist for our first session where we would begin CBT and medication."
13419,I'm currently not seeing a therapist or talking meds because I'm too nervous to.
13420,"Furthermore,  his depression went on, eventually got into therapy and on meds, which has made him more of an asshole now than normal."
13421,They stopped me from leaving home for a week until I started a medication called Sertraline.
13422,"No meds for anxiety, as my shrink has believed for the past 6 years that treating my bipolar will also treat my anxiety."
13423,I want to talk to my psychiatrist about putting me on Xanax since I'm looking for a job and I feel that they'd really improve the problem.
13424,"I'm on Cymbalta, Hydroxyzine, and Lorazepam and I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, agoraphobia, social/generalized anxiety, and depression."
13425,"I'm scared to ask my doctor specifically for Xanax because he seems unwilling to place me on any other benzodiazepines after the failure of Klonopin and now the Lorazepam losing its effectiveness, and honestly I like the Lorazepam but it's not a high enough dose to fix my panic attacks and anxiety."
13426,"My Hydroxyzine isn't working well either, it makes me moody when it works."
13427,I'm at my wits end.
13428,"This is the second round of medications I'm on, the former being Paxil, Topamax [had to stop because of bad side effects], and Klonopin [didn't work at all]."
13429,TL;DR How can I convince my psychiatrist to put me on Xanax because I feel it'd be the most effective treatment for my disorders?
13430,It turned out that my medication (paxil 20mg) wasn't working anymore.
13431,I took a lorazapam 1mg about 10 minutes ago to try to suppress the attack but I need a way to control it without resorting to cutting or meds.
13432,I can't tell if the medication isn't working or if it's just all this stress.
13433,"I'm a year and a bit into this now, medication free."
13434,"History: I have had anxiety to some degree for as long as I can remember, but only about a year ago decided to seek medication."
13435,"I'm always leery of new medication, and I don't like stimulant effects like energy drinks or caffein."
13436,"They've gotten worse but whatever, I'm extremely happy to be off of medication."
13437,"Since I want to stay far away from meds, I was wondering what natural or homeopathic products or any techniques or resources you guys have in your arsenal."
13438,So I'm a Computer Science major in my last semester of college.
13439,"Yesterday, I completely bombed my ""midterm"" (yes, in mid-April), and I mean *bombed*."
13440,"I had been studying since Saturday, but was paranoid that I wasn't reviewing effectively."
13441,"(I've never been very good at studying; I have a lot of trouble picking out what's most important, etc.)"
13442,"When I got the exam, I realized I was totally right."
13443,I couldn't remember how to do even the simplest problems.
13444,"I  tried to keep it together, but went into total panic mode about halfway through and only ended up answering maybe 30 points worth of problems (out of 100)."
13445,"The problem is, I've really been struggling this semester."
13446,"My anxiety has been extremely high all school year, but it's just gotten worse since I accepted a job offer around March."
13447,"I'm very excited for it, especially because it's in Tokyo, and I've always wanted to try working in Japan."
13448,(I studied abroad there last spring and it was honestly the most amazing experience of my life.)
13449,"You'd think this would make me feel a little calmer, since I don't have to worry about what I'm doing post-grad."
13450,"Instead, it's put so much more pressure on me, because now if I can't graduate on time, I'm 99% sure I will lose this job (since I need my diploma for the visa)."
13451,It feels like all of my future happiness in hinging on this.
13452,"So, my grades have been pretty poor all this semester."
13453,"My workload is probably heavier than it's ever been before, and I'm less equipped than usual to deal with it."
13454,"I've managed to keep myself *around* a passing grade in all my classes despite multiple mental breakdowns, but I couldn't afford this kind of failure."
13455,So now I'm totally at a loss.
13456,"Everything feels pointless; even if I manage to get 100's on everything here on out (which will never happen), I've got less than a C, which is what I need for credit."
13457,I'm not a bad student.
13458,"I've never failed a class (even if I've had to drop a couple) or even received less than a B-, and my GPA is about a 3.6, with a major GPA of about 3.3."
13459,"It feels so unfair that I could lose everything just because of this one awful semester, but I don't know what to do."
13460,"My doctor told me I should talk to my professor, and I managed to summon the courage to e-mail him last night, but he hasn't replied."
13461,"(This is really making me anxious, because he's normally very good about answering his e-mails during the week, and I've seen that he's answered questions on the student forum today.)"
13462,What can I do to salvage things and make sure I graduate this May?
13463,*Is* there anything I can do?
13464,**EDIT:** Some background info.
13465,"I've been on regular medication for anxiety/depression about 8-9 years (alternating between Effexor and Pristiq, with varying doses)."
13466,"After having several breakdowns last semester, I finally accepted that these medications were not working for me (if they ever really were)."
13467,I'm seeing a new doctor this semester who is helping me transition to Lexapro.
13468,"I'm also scared of being prescribed medication, because my father has been prescribed a ton, and he's pretty much a zombie."
13469,I've never been on any medication for anxiety but it just dawned on me that I might have a mild case.
13470,The bigger problem is that I'm not sure my medication is helping the actual problem.
13471,"Does this sound like a medication problem, or something else?"
13472,I'm not sure if there are any other anti-anxiety meds I'm interested in testing.
13473,I absolutely hate meds.
13474,"TL;DR: After a successful month of reducing anxiety and panic attacks, without meds just changing diet, positive thinking, and talking it out to many support resources, catastrophic thinking comes back the day after seeing the psychiatrist and I'm having trouble sleeping, staying calm, and focusing."
13475,"Many say medication may not work for everyone, and it's true."
13476,"Even though I've been taking my meds, and took them before surgery, and went in feeling just slightly nervous (a miracle, I thought!)"
13477,"I was off my meds for a couple days ( due to being broke and not being able to pay for my prescription) and I didnt grind my teeth or clench my jaw 90% of the time, and my joints barely hurt..I didn't have any anxiety and I was fine aside from the withdrawl symptoms of dizziness and  my eyes spazzing out."
13478,Put on anxiety medication.
13479,"But when i'm mid-anxiety attack (right now), or curiously, when I'm taking anti-anxiety medication (the worst for it was buspirone) I have just... insane dreams."
13480,"I have never been diagnosed with anxiety disorder, nor taken any medication for it."
13481,Was on several meds up until I was about 15 and my therapist and psych weaned me off of them over time.
13482,"Which brings me to the medication issue: I used to take Lunesta, but when I switched pain meds (now Dilaudid and Methadone) I had to stop taking anything of the sort."
13483,"I see a therapist and psychiatrist, and take antianxiety meds."
13484,Sometimes anxiety disorders are really convoluted.
13485,I've done untold amount of illegal and dangerous things and I have never bat an eye to it.
13486,I hold my cool and do what I want.
13487,But socializing with people (in a non-business setting) and being in intimate relationships?
13488,Gives me the jitters so bad that a cup of weak coffee sends me into a panic attack.
13489,"I've avoided relationships my entire life (and I'm gay so it was easy) and the only way I could gain ""experience"" was by being under the influence of narcotics."
13490,Do I like him more than he likes me?
13491,Am I too inexperienced and thus too much baggage?
13492,What if he finds out about my psychiatric issues?
13493,"A lot of thoughts that course through my mind and each one has the potential to wound me emotionally, something that threatens to de-stabilize my already fragile psychological state."
13494,"I avoid dating and relationships and as a result feel lonesome and rather unhappy, but fuck, avoiding the anxiety trumps being unhappy for the rest of my life."
13495,The other week I finally spent time with someone and didn't become anxious or had to resort to drugs.
13496,"He lives in another state and normally I don't ever attempt long-distance things, but somehow this person is different (someone I know mutually for years) and at the behest of my friends and therapist, I am going to pursue it, whatever the consequences."
13497,So I sent him a short email (just an email!)
13498,and I'm already agonizing over the above details.
13499,He's probably busy but the wait for the reply is tearing me up.
13500,"It's irrational, I know this, but the anxiety and its physical effects are unbearable."
13501,For the first time I have hope that I can both be involved with someone and not be in a drug stupor and/or constant state of anxiety.
13502,"The possibility of this hope being dashed is a huge source of anxiety and, naturally, devolves into depression."
13503,I don't want to fuck this up.
13504,"I see a therapist, I take medications, I meditate and although I really should be calling my therapist, I just need to write this out and see if anyone has any similar experiences."
13505,"I meditated for nearly an hour today already and usually that helps but this time, I just can't make it stop."
13506,"It's a matter of exposure, ultimately, and I need to take things slow otherwise it'll overwhelm me."
13507,I'm not on any anxiety meds btw.
13508,"So after years without feeling any abnormal anxiety without medication, i experienced some of the horrors again."
13509,Glad that I'm okay now and don't need any meds while staying at home.
13510,"The past two years have been filled with psychiatric visits and trials of more medication than I can count, before two months ago, when I decided to go off all of my meds and fight this with my own power."
13511,Is there any safe short term meds I can get that will calm me down but not make me obviously drugged?
13512,"So I started my first round of medication,  20mg fluoxetine."
13513,"Im paranoid about this medication now, im not sure if I want to take any more"
13514,I'm just very new to the meds world (only nearly two months) and I appreciate all of the feedback that I can get from experienced people.
13515,I was about 2-3 hours late for taking my meds but I don't think that caused it?
13516,"Hi guys, I don't know where to start..."
13517,I take medication to help control my anxiety/depression.
13518,The problem is that I have to continually increase the dosage as I adjust to it.
13519,"I was on 30mg of Lexapro and a year ago it worked great, but now it doesn't."
13520,"I have started the process of trying different medications about 3 months ago, after having my second child."
13521,But the stress and anxiety of daily life were still burning like a flame in my mind.
13522,"I felt like it was eating me alive, and I had brief thoughts of hurting myself or ending it."
13523,I have now been laid off from work (yay?)
13524,and trying to find a new job.
13525,"Everyone kept saying ""this might be a blessing in disguise"" and I heard it so often that it became aggravating."
13526,"Truth be told, it probably was."
13527,I couldn't continue the way I was.
13528,"However, being laid off has shattered my confidence, and I have changed medications and/or dosages 3 times now in 3 months...and this week has just been really hard."
13529,"THe latest dosage change hasn't had time to kick in yet, I expect another week at least."
13530,"The last 2 days, instead of applying for jobs, I've been taking my girls to daycare, going home and sleeping until noon because everything, EVERYTHING was just too much."
13531,Then I would guilt myself out of bed and talk myself through basic simple tasks (i.e.
13532,"wash the dishes, don't think about what comes next, just do the dishes)."
13533,"My husband is away on a business trip and is supposed to be home tonight, but his flight has been delayed."
13534,He is a constant and wonderful support person for me.
13535,"Some of my friends know about my problem, but they don't understand."
13536,I want the me back from a year ago.
13537,I was there!
13538,I had made it!
13539,And now...I am again captive to my brain chemistry; I know what part of me is missing.
13540,Job searching like this is useless.
13541,I have to be charming and able and...
13542,I think I just need to go back to washing the dishes.
13543,Thank you for listening
13544,"With how long it takes for medication to work, will the medication even help me before the end of the semester, anyway?"
13545,"I haven’t gone to my last two therapy appointments because I just don’t feel that I can leave the house (thank goodness my school offers some of their classes online) and I have cancelled on my psychiatrist (just gives me meds) twice, as well."
13546,"As for medicine, I currently have a few .5 mg Ativan from a previous doctor that I take in extreme emergencies and I have .5 mg of Klonopin and Celexa from my psychiatrist."
13547,I have been on it for three days now and it's my first time taking a medication like this.
13548,The topic of meds comes up between my therapist and I once in a while.
13549,"To paraphrase her: I take daily multivitamins, the majority of which likely won't even be absorbed into my body, but I won't consider meds which could help me a great deal."
13550,I realize that reading up on individuals' experiences with the meds themselves won't help much since our chemistries are all so darn different.
13551,"I really don't want to go on long-term medicine, because I already take a lot of pills for my physical health."
13552,"Hey everyone, I've got a question for you guys."
13553,I started taking Lexapro in January of 2015 and have noticed in the last month I have started to experience the dreaded weight gain.
13554,"I've been doing my research and saw that switching medications can help curb this, but in the meantime I've decided to add exercise into my daily routine (I eat pretty clean as it is...which is why the weight gain is so infuriating)."
13555,"So, my question is this: has anyone managed to beat the weight gain WITHOUT changing medication?"
13556,Or was switching the only way to help it?
13557,"I feel like going to my doctor and saying I want to change medicine because I gained some weight sounds weak, but if it comes to that I'm willing."
13558,Thanks all.
13559,"I'm supposed to be starting medication, Wellbutrin, to be exact, but the first day I took it I was so nauseous all day that I haven't taken it since."
13560,I am soon to be 28 have been on meds since about 22.
13561,First zoloft and klonopin which ultimately side effects were too much went through a-z different meds and ultimately was on lexapro 20mg and 1mg xanax for attacks for about 4-5 years.
13562,I weaned myself off my medication at the beginning of highschool and didn't have any major attacks till I left for college.
13563,"With medication, it's really a flip of the coin."
13564,Who else is going through this without medication?
13565,"I'm a little nervous about taking it, as I have never been on medication before."
13566,I'm always blown away when I hear about things like this knowing if I hadn't gone in I would never have been told or realized that maybe my out of control anxiety is being worsened by the very medicine I take to make it better.
13567,He is going to have me try out zoloft in addition to other medicine and I'll stop taking Xanax and see how it goes.
13568,"Since then, it generally only got bad enough to require medication once or twice a month, though it's been kinda bad these last couple days."
13569,"So, I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and have been on medication and coping with it for about 5 years now."
13570,"Her senior year in high school, we had a heart-to-heart about how she was struggling to feel motivated and appreciate life, and I shared how my own experiences led me to believe that medication wasn't a bad thing in situations like this."
13571,"My mom is taking her to the doctor to get another opinion and look into medication options, based on the school counselor's recommendation."
13572,I found out that he was given medication at a doctors appointment that day...I guess he decided there wasn't enough time for it to work.
13573,Luckily a doctor gave me medicine and it worked for me.
13574,"I'm afraid of meds, but so far calming exercises aren't working."
13575,"It is as simple as believing you are okay
If you are scared of something do not let that stop you from doing it, FEAR IS NOT REAL, Most fear that stems from anxiety comes from a fear of the unknown or the nonphysical so why worry about something that is essentially nothing
It does go away, and you don't need to tell yourself it won't, that's extremely counter-productive

Anxiety is something we as ALL humans have evolved to have, it helps us when the situation arises, right now your brain is just fritzing and stressing about every little thought ""would a crazy person think this"" ""Why am I acting this way"" ""will I ever go back to normal"" Guess what guys, you are already normal, you don't need meds or even a therapist."
13576,"My doctor also told me to get a new job, as my current job is the main source of my anxiety and depression and told me ""there's medication... medication that can help you out, but you don't want to take these things just to make your boss' and coworkers' behaviour more tolerable..."" and then I realised it..."
13577,"I don't want to feel nuts every day, I don't want to end up taking medication just cause somebody else is treating me bad, I just can avoid it by quitting there and I bet I'd be more happier washing toilets somewhere without constant stress and being treated like crap even though I have an important office job."
13578,"I've been lurking in this subreddit for quite a while and i wanted to share my experiences with all the people who have tried medication and it didn't work, people who are skeptical about meds or just all the people who are considering taking them."
13579,A bit of backstory first.
13580,Roughly one and a half years ago i was going through a lot of stress at work and home.
13581,60 hour work weeks and constant stress outside of work.
13582,"At the time i thought i was handling it quite well, until i just couldn't anymore."
13583,There was a day where i just was too anxious and scared to leave the house.
13584,"I thought it had something to do with high blood pressure, which runs in the family, so i just got a stronger medication for that."
13585,"Of course that didn't work and all the wonderful things that usually help, like going for a long walk, curling up in front of the TV with some delicious chocolate and other feel-good things didn't work."
13586,"It got progressively worse every day, but after the two weeks i had to go back to work."
13587,"I told myself that i could handle it, but then the panic attacks came."
13588,The worst thing is that they came at totally random times and i still can't figure out which triggers set them off.
13589,"Sometimes it was just somebody who looked at me in a strange way, a certain feeling that just came over me or just a random thought."
13590,After an attack i was basically done for the day.
13591,They drain the life right out of you.
13592,Panic attacks are fucking horrible and i wouldn't wish them on anyone.
13593,With the attacks came depression about being anxious all the time and even more anxiety and just unbelievable fear.
13594,"After numerous panic attacks i finally went to the doctor and tried to talk about the whole thing, but he just wasn't the right person for it."
13595,So i switched doctors a bunch of times until i found someone that really took me seriously and actually took the time to listen to me about the whole thing.
13596,"That sounds pretty fast and easy, but it actually took quite a while until i found the right doctor."
13597,What a relief though!
13598,My doctor said that i should try medication to help me with the anxiety.
13599,At the time i was still skeptical about taking medication.
13600,For some reason i had the stupid opinion that medication that helps with anxiety/depression and related issues turns you into a grinning zombie version of yourself and just changes who you are.
13601,It took quite a while until my doc convinced me otherwise.
13602,I wish i could smack my younger self for thinking such a stupid thing.
13603,"So, after some reluctance i agreed to try some meds for a few weeks."
13604,"I don't remember the name of them, but they didn't work at all."
13605,The side effects were terrible and the anxiety stayed.
13606,"My doctor reassured me that this could happen and that there are more medications out there, so he gave me 20mg Citalopram, which i take to this day."
13607,It took about three weeks until they started to work and the side effects were pretty terrible at first.
13608,"Intense fatigue for a couple of hours after taking them, almost being unable to reach an orgasm, light headaches and some other things."
13609,These nasty effects faded away pretty quickly though.
13610,The anxiety is also pretty much gone and there are no more panic attacks.
13611,"There are one or two days each month where i steel feel pretty anxious or even scared about just about everything, but it's manageable."
13612,The rest of the month i feel better than ever.
13613,"I'm still my regular old introverted self, but without feeling anxious or fearful all the time and therefore slightly more cheerful."
13614,For the first few weeks of taking Citalopram my doctor also prescribed me some Lorazepam for emergencies.
13615,They're a type of Benzodiazepines and quite powerful.
13616,"A few days into taking my meds i felt a huge panic attack coming on, so i took one of them and they helped me within a minute."
13617,"No panic attack and no more anxiety, but you're pretty ""high"" and muddle-headed."
13618,I was pretty amazed that they worked so quickly.
13619,You can get addicted to them though and the withdrawal can apparently end in death.
13620,So they're definitely not intended for daily use.
13621,That feeling of knowing that i have something that could help me in emergency cases was wonderful though.
13622,"Whenever i felt that all too familiar feeling of an attack building up i just reached into my pocket and knew that i could stop it, if it got worse."
13623,"As soon as i thought about having these emergency pills with me though, the panic and anxiety went away and i calmed myself down."
13624,"The one Lorazepam was still the only one i ever had to take, since the Citalopram made the attacks go away completely."
13625,"Because of the great progress with Citalopram, my doctor suggested that we reduce the dosage from 20mg to 10mg each day and monitor the progress."
13626,"I have to check in with him every couple of days if i notice any changes, but so far there are none."
13627,"He even said that we might be able to get me off the meds in 2014, if the positive progress continues like that, but we'll see."
13628,"Sooo, what's the point of all this babbling?"
13629,I just wanted to share my story with all the people who may still be on the fence about taking medication.
13630,"It's not a magical solution that helps everyone, but you should at least give it a shot."
13631,Don't be like me and just flat out think that meds are terrible and refuse them.
13632,"If you're having problems with anxiety that you can't handle by yourself anymore, then try to find a professional that cares about you and takes you seriously."
13633,"If that person suggests that you should try some meds, then do it!"
13634,It might help and change your life for the better!
13635,Thanks for reading and i hope you feel better :).
13636,So I've got social/general anxiety disorder and I've been on prozac for about 4 years.
13637,"It worked just fine up until recently when after explaining to my doctor that I felt it may not be working as well, I was put on a higher dose (from 20mg to 40mg)."
13638,And I ended up having a bad reaction and getting very depressed and agitated and not sleeping at all so I went back down.
13639,Ever since I have not really come out of that depressed/agitated mood aside from being in an okay mood sometimes.
13640,So I talked to a psychologist who prescribed me 50mg of Seroquel to take with my Prozac.
13641,"The Seroquel did help with my sleep problems and a bit of my anxiety but my mood has gotten far worse, I have high cholesterol and triglycerides (which may or may not be caused by the seroquel) but normal insulin levels, and I just feel really upset."
13642,I'm not as anxious as usual but I feel that the side effects of these medications are not worth the slight lowering of anxiety.
13643,I am also worried because I've taken to compulsively scratching sewing needles on my arm when I'm upset and I've never done something like that in the past but now I feel as though I have to when I'm upset with myself.
13644,I don't want it to escalate.
13645,I don't know.
13646,Sorry for the rant.
13647,"But when you're taking meds, getting pregnant is a risk you shouldn't take."
13648,"So if you're taking psychotropic meds, and you're getting a little frisky, wrap it up!"
13649,"If you do want to get pregnant, or just plain don't want to use a rubber, let your psychiatrist know so s/he can put you on one of the meds that doesn't cause birth defects."
13650,"I won't go into detail on my anxiety issues, but this is the first anti anxiety medicine I've ever been prescribed."
13651,"I guess Tramadol doesn't mix well with a ton of different anti anxiety meds, so he said we'd start here."
13652,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently going off all my meds for depression and anxiety on the advice of my doctor."
13653,"Just as a disclaimer, I have not been diagnosed with IBS, but have begun to experience most of they symptoms associated with IBS in direct correlation with the intensity of my anxiety and depression."
13654,"Symptoms include, but are not limited to:

- Irregularity
- Abdominal cramping/pain
- Diarrhea 
- Constipation
- Soar rectum (that was fun to share)
- Bloating
- Gas (or lack thereof for extended periods of time)
- Painful movements 

Am I alone in these experiences or is it common among anxiety sufferers?"
13655,"If so, what helps?"
13656,"If not, then I'm happy for you."
13657,They seem to subside when my anxiety does and no doctor's visit has changed the symptoms quite like my everyday self-help techniques.
13658,"I've tried a cocktail of medications, some of which make it worse and others have had little to no effect."
13659,"Metamucil seems to help with irregularity, but I believe that's more or less related to my poor diet."
13660,"unrelated rant:

Anxiety symptoms have been severe."
13661,I've noticed a disconnect from all of my friends and family.
13662,"I only leave my room for food, water or to use the bathroom and sometimes it's so overwhelmingly bad that I've gone for days without eating."
13663,I'm ashamed and embarrassed to admit that I've pissed in bottles before to avoid social interaction with family and other people who are here often.
13664,"It's fucking miserable and the upcoming holiday is making things much, much worse."
13665,I contemplate suicide nearly constantly but have only reached the point of attempting it a handful of times and I fear I'm nearing that stage again.
13666,I can't bear to go through the process of failing and having to hide myself from everyone and everything out of shame and embarrassment.
13667,I feel like I'm completely fucked at this point.
13668,"If anyone has any kind words, techniques to share or advice in general, I would greatly appreciate it."
13669,Thanks.
13670,Sending you all the few positive vibes I can conjure.
13671,I dont want to take medicine because I know it is not good to take antidepressants.
13672,"So, I was really afraid to take a medication prescribed to me by a doctor I am not so trusting of."
13673,"I have Absence and nocturnal seizures on top of cardiac arrhythmia, fibromyalgia and anxiety."
13674,"I saw my psychologist yesterday and he basically said that yes, side effects are scary with any medication."
13675,"Maybe I should take a low dose, try it for three days and if I have a bad reaction within that 72 hour window, don't continue."
13676,"He said that my fear was rational based on my personal history with medications either not working or giving me really bad side effects, that this one sounded super scary."
13677,He told me that it was up to me to decide if I wanted to take the risk of trying something that might help me.
13678,This morning I woke up and said fuck it.
13679,I broke the pill in half so I could take a lower dose.
13680,It's been exactly 4 hours and I haven't had any adverse reaction.
13681,"I feel it working, but I am not as afraid of it as I was."
13682,Two more days to go before I decide to continue.
13683,I'm just glad that I told my fear to shut up and made the choice to try something I was afraid of.
13684,Sorry for the cryptic and chaotic wording.
13685,Update #1: It's been 48 hours and I'm tolerating the medicine.
13686,Only side effect is a bit of joint pain and tiredness which I can handle.
13687,We'll see how day three goes.
13688,*Fingers crossed*
13689,"My questions are:

Has anyone experienced anxiety spikes after the effects of their ADD medication wears off?"
13690,Hey so for almost 2 years Ive been faced with constant nonsituational anxiety and moderate to severe nonsituational depression.
13691,I have no control over it at all.
13692,"I workout daily, hydrate, eat right, and Ive been through 3 medicines and absolutely nothing."
13693,Its gotten worse as time has gone on.
13694,"My vision is starred, not nearly as interested in things, im irritable, and much more."
13695,Ive smoked a solid amount of trees and have taken breaks so I k law that doesn't cause it and definitely seems to help.
13696,Does anyone else have nonsituational?
13697,It seems everywhere I can only find where someone lost their dog and went into a spiraling anxiety hole
13698,"Over the past few years I've been dealing with my anxiety on my own, but this past year for some reason the attacks have gotten worse."
13699,"I'll get heart palpilations and feel as if I'm having a heart attack, or I'm about to seize."
13700,"Throughout all of this, my mind races and I can't seem to get it to slow down."
13701,"I really, really would appreciate some advice on calming techniques."
13702,"I've been trying to avoid medications, but if this gets much worse I think I'm going to seek help."
13703,Spent 2.5 years happy and medicine free.
13704,"Took medicine, thought nothing of it, went on about my day."
13705,I've been given tons of medicine to try and beat it.
13706,I feel defeated that I may have to be on medicine.
13707,TL:DR I'm either gonna die or I need medicine for panic/anxiety again.
13708,"I have noticed that my anxiety, even with medication and therapy, has been higher than it's been in well over a decade."
13709,Does it make you feel fantastic to know that i'm 20 years old and already on medication because of the anxiety i've developed because of you?
13710,"It was starting to get really bad, and about a month and a half ago i started my medication."
13711,I'm worried since I've tried anxiety medication and antidepressants that this could be the end of my quest to get better.
13712,":( But my brother stole them all when he was on his idiotic ""Let's swallow everyone's medication for my own special high"" phase."
13713,"Don't really want to take an SSRI either.. tbh, I don't like taking meds."
13714,"Taking a new medication has always been a massive trigger for me, especially ones that have noticeable effects."
13715,A big trigger for me is not feeling like myself which is why I stopped doing all drugs and am wary of new medication since I developed anxiety.
13716,"Dear reddit,

I have always had big issues during public speaking."
13717,"Usually I am stressed, i shake uncontrollably, loose my voice and sweat a lot."
13718,This has happened to me during my whole life and I have never been able to control it.
13719,"It doesn't matter whether it is a big speech, in front of a small audience etc etc."
13720,Now I have an even bigger problem.
13721,Next month I will be accepting an award from work and everyone I know will be there.
13722,"The acceptance speech must include details from my work, acknowledgements etc etc... My coworkers will be there, the CEO of the company (whom I have met only twice during my past 5 years at the company) as well as my immediate family."
13723,I am desperate.
13724,I have even been thinking to take medications but I do not know what to take :( What are your tips?
13725,P.S.
13726,I read that Propranolol would be a good medication that would solve this issue?
13727,I am unfortunately off medication due to my parents wishes (that's another topic I can talk about) and a lot of other little panic attacks are popping up for certain stuff.
13728,Is this common for this type of medication?
13729,I don't know what kind(s) of medication to ask for though.
13730,"TL:DR; Newly diagnosed, unsure of where to start as far as holistic self-help and medication."
13731,I've never taken any medication for anxiety but it seems to become more of an option every day...
13732,My only consolation are my family my dog and my meds.
13733,I have never been on anxiety medication.
13734,So I started therapy and medication and am feeling much better about day to day stuff and feel like I could actually handle a relationship now.
13735,"To make matters more complicated, I am against medication."
13736,"I have been off of my meds (300mg Wellbutrin XL + .25mg generic Xanax) for almost a year due to a very supportive boyfriend and normal, healthy relationship."
13737,i have panic attacks and chronic anxiety about health issues.
13738,never been officially diagnosed but i believe i have hypochondria.
13739,i can feel physical symptoms of whatever i'm terrified of at the time.
13740,"it usually involves heart issues, like heart attacks or irregular beats."
13741,"i've been to the ER many times POSITIVE that something was going to happen, just to be told nothing is wrong."
13742,"i now have anxiety about going to the hospital for anything, thinking it might be a waste; it might just be anxiety."
13743,i can't figure out if physical symptoms are real or not anymore.
13744,"i've tried zoloft, and i didn't like it."
13745,"at the time, i wasn't getting enough anxiety or panic attacks to feel motivated to take something every day."
13746,"i took it for a few weeks, started to feel off and just stopped."
13747,my other option was xanax.
13748,"my brother admitted to being hooked on xanax for quite a while, and as far as i know, still could be."
13749,he says to stay away.
13750,i have a friend who used to take it but stopped once she discovered weed.
13751,i have another friend who used to do it to get high all the time.
13752,i'm trying to focus on controlling my thoughts and using my mind to get over anxiety.
13753,"if i take medication, i will become dependent and won't be able to control it myself."
13754,"i've gotten pretty good at it, but i had such crippling anxiety this weekend that i had to call out of work."
13755,i was so sure i was going to die.
13756,i need something for the days i can't do it myself.
13757,my question is: have you guys tried xanax?
13758,did it help?
13759,what about other anti-anxiety medications?
13760,"i am nervous about going and asking, and i want to pick the best option."
13761,maybe an SSRI is worth trying again since my anxiety has gotten worse.
13762,"please give me your stories about any anxiety medications, and anything about hypochondria as well."
13763,I was put on a mix of the two medications.
13764,"I was wondering what people have experienced, side effects, or anything else that might be helpful."
13765,I don't mind if you just take one or the other or both.
13766,I would just like some more insight to these medications.
13767,"Hey folks, so I was put on Paxil about 2 months ago for my mild depression/anxiety."
13768,"So far so good, but I literally eat everything in sight."
13769,I've gained around 30 lbs in 2 months.
13770,I don't know if its just a side effect from the paxil or is it a combination of quitting smoking on top of the medication and just generally trying to be healthy.
13771,It's kind of concerning me though as to how much i am eating.
13772,"It is literally all day, and at the rate I'm going I can't exercise enough to keep the weight off."
13773,Has anyone else experienced this?
13774,Are there other medications I could try?
13775,"My point is this: whether it be the medicine or the techniques or something else, looking forward to something really helps."
13776,He also struggles from anxiety himself and is on medication/sees a psychologist.
13777,"It should only take a couple days until my medication is in my hands, and subsequently, in my system."
13778,"One of my cousins tried meds, and they just didn't really work for her."
13779,"4 blood tests, 1 urine test, 3 MRIs, about 14 X-rays, 1 bladder function analysis, 2 sleep oximeter tests, a neurologist appointment, an ophthalmologist appointment, a neuro-ophthalmologist appointment, 3 internal medicine appointments, a consult with endocrinology, a consult with rheumatology and a 6 hour blood pressure test all in one week."
13780,So i diagnosed myself with minor GAD (haven't been to a doctor yet and honestly i don't want to (i've read so much about pills people can't get away from that i really dont see that taking medicine is an option)).
13781,Quick intro...
13782,I'm 25 and female.
13783,"Not currently taking any medications, but have been on antidepressants and mild anti-anxiety meds in the past."
13784,"Because of my new insurance, which does not cover pre-existing conditions, I am not able to be seen by a doctor and get on meds again, so I'm trying like crazy to deal with things on my own right now."
13785,For those of you that journal in any way to deal with your anxiety/learn about triggers/etc.... What types of things do you write about on a daily basis?
13786,Dreams?
13787,How you slept?
13788,Meals?
13789,Events throughout the day?
13790,"I know what some of my anxiety triggers are, but I feel like I could have a lot better handle on things if I wrote stuff down."
13791,"I also feel like it would be more beneficial when I talk to people (counselors/trusted friends) about my anxiety if I had sort of written ""proof"" of certain things?"
13792,Frankly it makes me overly anxious just thinking about everything I could write and how I could potentially not write about something important.
13793,I just want some ideas/input from others that have been in a similar position.
13794,I am thinking I need to go back on medication because I'm finding myself panic stricken more often than not.
13795,Anyone have experience with medication (SSRI's) that do not cause weight gain?
13796,My meds seem to wear off as soon as I get home and I usually end up doing little to no homework.
13797,"He's not currently on any medication, although he does acknowledge that it has helped in the past."
13798,"So, I had to reschedule my medicine check up, because my dad has cancer, so I told my therapist etc, about how I would run out of medicine before the next one."
13799,"Then, I was told to tell the people at the front desk because, they would contact the person who prescribes my medicine."
13800,"Then today, I called them four times, trying to get them to let me talk to someone, and they just kept telling me to leave a message for some nurse who doesn't prescribe my medicine."
13801,"I'm sad that I didn't appreciate the good times, and I'm sad that everyone around me gets through life just OK - as I'm dependent on all types of medicine just to get through the day."
13802,"**I know this is a question for my psychiatrist and I'm going to call him later today**, but I just wanted to hear from some other people too."
13803,I've been on Pristiq (an SNRI) and propranolol (a beta blocker) for my GAD and mild depression for about 11 days and I stopped taking Brintellix 5 days ago after lowering the dose per my doctor's orders.
13804,I was only diagnosed with GAD on January 2nd so this is all new to me.
13805,"So far I've been having a lot of highs and lows, whereas before, I was either mostly a bit below neutral or pretty low."
13806,Yesterday was really rough for me.
13807,"I started spiraling into an episode, and pretty soon I was sobbing for what seemed like a long time and I felt like I had so much pressure built up inside me."
13808,"I used to have problems with self harm years ago and stopped, but yesterday I just had that same urge to do it again."
13809,"I didn't hurt myself, but I felt extremely tempted to, and I kept having thoughts of... not death or suicide, but simply not existing."
13810,I had to call in sick to work.
13811,It was just a bad day.
13812,"On the other hand, sometimes I almost feel slightly manic, like I have energy but no drive to do anything, and I feel like my depression has worsened."
13813,Sometimes I feel like I'm talking too much!
13814,My anxiety does seem better sometimes though.
13815,"It was tough, but I admitted to my husband that I had been having the self harm thoughts last night, and he said that I should call my doctor."
13816,"He says I seem very up and down lately too... 

**I just want to know, has anyone else had experiences like this and they get better if you stick with the medicine?"
13817,Does PMS affect you worse with your medications?
13818,Is this a sign that a medicine is wrong for you?
13819,**
13820,"After I started taking meds, I found that I was less creative, less motivated, and felt a 'flattening' of emotions."
13821,I am currently not on any medication for my anxiety apart from the odd lorazepam.
13822,"I tried to avoid the meds, I even started having sessions (once per week) with a psychologist but 2 months later, yeah I could cope with some stuff but not everything and well, it got to the point where my therapist said ""You anxiety is out of control""."
13823,Because I really know meds are only part of the solution.
13824,This is more related to the medicine than to sex itself which is why I posted here.
13825,"Ok, so I see this psychiatrist for 20 minutes once a month."
13826,"She is mildly physically attractive, but I am a good looking 20 year old guy and can pick up women pretty well."
13827,"Anyways, I don't know what happened, maybe that the last time I was there she gave me personal advice about how to deal with being compared to my siblings."
13828,"She always tells me how smart I am and how that affects my mental problems, and it makes me feel good."
13829,"Anyways, I realized last night that I was somewhat erotically attracted to her."
13830,"I realize that I am not attracted to her logically, but just the feeling that she is a source of infinite wisdom (she is VERY well trained and knows all about all the medications and in 20 minutes perfectly diagnosed me."
13831,"I realize that this is transference, and I am going to ask for a recommendation for a psychologist to deal with obsessive thoughts, and the transference issue."
13832,Does this happen a lot?
13833,I only hear about it from women with men psychiatrists that see them for an hour.
13834,"Anyways, I was hoping someone could give me some reassuring words that she will not think that it is weird, especially if I refer to it as transference, and don't ask her on a date or anything like that."
13835,:/
13836,Wednesday during the day I really started to notice some changes from the medication.
13837,I told her I was terrified to take any more medication and asked if it would give me headaches as intense as the ones I had on the Lexapro.
13838,"Sometimes I take it when I know I'm going to have an anxious day(idk if that makes sense) This it's my first medication to ""help"" my anxiety."
13839,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEU97niHvjk

I NEVER thought I could deal with my anxiety without medication."
13840,I'm not sure I need medication as it doesn't affect me regularly- just when I get an ache and I think 'oh that's the HIV' I have had a few symptoms that could be linked to seroconversion- but in any normal person I think they would be passed off as normal.
13841,"we can just go get diagnosed, get seizure meds, and everything will be better!"
13842,No more struggling to find a doctor who will prescribe anxiety meds!
13843,medication?
13844,She told me to try to get back on medication so I made an appointment with a psychiatrist.
13845,"I myself am on 1mg Ativan, and it just seems like everyone thinks that someone who is legitimately prescribed medication for an anxiety disorder is some kind of weirdo."
13846,"Normally I would self medicate with booze or chewing tobacco, but seeing as everything under the sun hurts me that I've tried to get temporary relief (marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, fibro meds) just ends up exacerbating things."
13847,I've been taking my meds but I don't feel like they are helping me at all.
13848,I quit my previous medication because of horrible sleep problems.
13849,"TL;DR - on my medication, Sleep has gotten worse, but social phobia is COMPLETELY gone."
13850,"I may be able to afford different help besides just medication in the future, but right now I can't."
13851,"I'm not comfortable with increasing my medication dose, because right now it causes me to occasionally become overly excited."
13852,"I've had pretty bad anxiety for quite a while, and finally got put on medication over the summer (mostly thanks to the support of my family and my wonderful boyfriend)."
13853,I'm very hesitant to tell my family or what friends I have about getting medication (started on Escitalopram).
13854,"i had anxiety for years, and it would last for days and weeks, tried every pill on the market, all didn't work, until a decent doctor prescribed Anafranil sr 75 for me, its a tricyclic antidepressants, really old, the patent has long ran out, so big companies and doctors don't publicizes it cause they don't make money on it, its been years and haven't had a single panic attack, here is a good website to look at what patients think about different medications:

http://www.askapatient.com/

and here is a link to anxiety/depression meds page

http://www.askapatient.com/comparedrugs.asp?Class=ANTIDEPRESSANTS&amp;SortBy=AvgOfSatisfaction&amp;SortOrder=DESC"
13855,"I'm getting all of the side effects in the book, and I've only been on it for a few days."
13856,I informed my Dr. who recommended splitting the pills to only take half the dose.
13857,"I started on 10mg and from googling and reading around here, it seems like that's where most people start with some starting down at 5mg."
13858,if I continue with the 10mg am I likely to get over the side effects more quickly?
13859,Does it work that way?
13860,"The way I feel sucks, but if I can get through it faster by continuing with the higher dose, I'd rather do that."
13861,"I can deal with this for a few days, but not long term."
13862,My Dr. was very good about asking me if I wanted to switch medications.
13863,"He let me know that if I take it for much longer there would be a tapering process before I could stop, and I should make that decision in the next day or two."
13864,"When I asked him if another drug would be better, he was honest and said they basically all suck at first."
13865,"He said if it were him, he wouldn't give up the few days I've already put in to try it all over again and probably have the same issue."
13866,Should I keep with the 10mg to just get it over with?
13867,"Also, when I say ""all the side effects in the book"" I mean all the ""non-serious"" ones."
13868,"I'm not suicidal, nor am I having an allergic reaction or anything like that."
13869,"I AM nauseated, dizzy, light-headed, have a headache, unsteady on my feet, and easily disoriented."
13870,It's basically the flu without the respiratory symptoms.
13871,The Dr. did a blood test to rule out being sick.
13872,He said my white blood cell count wasn't high enough and ALL of my symptoms fit into the side effects.
13873,I also don't have a fever.
13874,I've seen a therapist and a psychiatrist once for a consult about medication.
13875,"My concern is that I won't be able to drink as much, or if I do drink as much as I normally do, I'll be doing more harm than good with the meds."
13876,And really the worst part if I'm on meds that are supposed to help.
13877,"I really think I need some medication or something to help me out, but I have no idea how I could get that."
13878,Anybody have a similar experience with this medication?
13879,I've been on meds when my anxiety was REALLY affecting my life.
13880,"My anxiety was gone and I was having the time of my life, fast forward to last week and I came to realize that these two drugs are fucking my life up (I'm usually a B+ A- kind of student and now I'm failing 2 classes) I was suffering from memory problems that i found out was related to the klonopin so I threw the medicine away and quit cold turkey."
13881,"However, I feel like I need to start treating my social anxiety disorder first because I'm starting university in less than a month (where I'll start by pursuing a bachelor's degree in biomedicine) and even the thought of having to meet new people and having to give presentations (etc) in the future freaks me out so much a part of my brain tells me to not go to university at all."
13882,When the medication started to work I felt really bubbly and confident.
13883,I do not like the way this medication makes me feel.
13884,I've searched and read all over this sub wherein people have said that you have to stick with it and give it a month to see if it's the right medicine.
13885,I don't think I have the wherewithal to keep going through these crappy side effects with the hope that this medicine may work out for me.
13886,"In the interim, I do not want to be on this or any medication."
13887,My anxiety has been catastrophically higher than ever since I started this medicine.
13888,"My primary care physician thinks that I should be fine to stop taking this medicine cold turkey, since I've only taken six doses."
13889,"Everything I've read says that you have to taper off this medicine, but I've never seen anything that mentions whether it matters how long you've been taking the medication before the need to taper becomes necessary."
13890,"Today I was driving to work and had a panic attack (while driving), I took my medication and after about 45 minutes I was, for the most part, calmed down."
13891,It was extremely bizarre and this has never happened to me on this medication.
13892,"I started seeing a doctor/psych 10 years ago, went on meds, off meds, worked out, changed my diet, quit caffeine, started drinking it again."
13893,"I don't know what to do anymore, I don't think that going to the psychologist again will help me, should I got to a psychiatrist to get some meds?"
13894,I never took meds before.
13895,"I've always been the type to put off the doctor for many reasons, mostly because I don't like to admit theres a problem."
13896,Anxiety and panic attacks have been plaguing my life for the past 2 months or so.
13897,I've lost several nights of important sleep before big days.
13898,I didn't want to think I had a problem.
13899,It started affecting me physically.
13900,"Severe exhaustion, heart palpitations, uncontrolled vomiting, dizziness and so on."
13901,I finally just went to see a doctor (no specialist) who ran some simple tests but more or less asked me a ton of questions (the tests were to put my mind at ease because I thought every symptom was me having a more serious underlying issue which only furthered my anxiety and resulted in serious panic attacks.
13902,"Just going to the doctor and talking to them and hearing my heart was healthy, this and that, made me feel loads better."
13903,I was given a script for two medications and had my first night of REAL sleep.
13904,This morning I feel great and I hope this is the start to feeling better longterm.
13905,"So, if you don't know what to do, go get some professional help."
13906,Doctors won't judge you and I've been open to my friends about my problems/symptoms and they've all been very understanding.
13907,"Turns out, some of them have been going through the same things and had no idea what to do."
13908,She has stated that she's going to find a therapist and consider going on medication.
13909,"(All about 7 years old)

And the current meds I'm taking are: Wellbutrin XL 300mg, Abilify 2mg(down from 5mg/day), Klonopin 1mg 2x/day (up from 1.5mg/day), BusPar 10mg 2x/day (new), MS Contin 30mg 1-2x/day, Norco 10/325 1-3x/day, Soma 350mg 1-3x/day, and Lisinopril 40mg."
13910,"(I know it's a big cocktail which sucks, and I try to take as few pain meds as possible)

I'm only 3 doses in with the slightly higher K-pin dosage and the BusPar, but I think I'm doing better."
13911,"I DO feel like I currently need it on a daily basis, as demonstrated by the fact that I avoided going to a psych for medication for YEARS before finally agreeing with my therapist it was probably needed."
13912,"ETA: I am posting primarily because it took me a long time to accept I need meds, and now I feel like the internet is telling me I'm using the wrong one, even though it's currently helping me greatly."
13913,They want me to go from once a week to once every other week and they wonder when I can get off my medication.
13914,My therapist wants me to continue making progress and wants to see me once a week while staying on my medication (a small dose anti-depressant which has really helped with my anxiety).
13915,"I hate being dependent on medication, but my own weakness combined with a major lack of support (both personal and psychiatric) makes this feel impossible to overcome."
13916,Has anyone else experienced a change in side effects after restarting meds?
13917,How do you know when to take something - obviously it'll look odd if you mid-speech reach out for meds?
13918,"How do you decide when it's the right time, and aren't you afraid of getting hooked on the meds?"
13919,Hi Everyone.
13920,I'm new to reddit and was actually inspired to join because I wanted to share something that has helped me.
13921,"I posted something similar on r/depression as I suffer from both anxiety and depression, but no one's seemed interested so far =)."
13922,I see so many posts about different medications (and I have been on sooo many over the last 10 years) and they've helped me tremendously.
13923,I don't know where I'd be without them.
13924,But I'd like to have a baby so I have been working on trying to either reduce or get off them over the last 6 months.
13925,It's been a nightmare.
13926,Some days I couldn't get out of bed.
13927,My anxiety at work was so bad I couldn't concentrate so I had to keep going back up to my regular dosage.
13928,I'm very luck to have a very forward thinking doctor and he suggested that I try CES.
13929,"It's a small machine (little bigger than a cell phone) that you attach to your earlobes, wear some glasses and put on a headset."
13930,"You start a program and the light, sound and small (non painful) electrical pulses to your ears all pulse in rhythms to regulate your brain waves."
13931,There are actually a lot of studies on it and it's considered a safe alternative therapy for anxiety and depression.
13932,"I don't know if everyone responds well to it (I was the guinea pig for my doctor; he's now trying it on all his patients) but my mood is better, I have energy and drive and I can go to work without teetering on the edge of a panic attack."
13933,And this is with reduced meds!
13934,"Anyway, I hope this doesn't come off as an advertisement."
13935,My response to it has just been so drastic and it's helped me so much that I want to make sure people are at least aware of its existence.
13936,"It's not cheap (my unit cost about $400) and you should have a doctor who is familiar with it to guide you, but, for me at least, it has been amazing."
13937,"I had pretty much given up on the idea of a baby since I figured I was stuck on the medication, but now I have hope again."
13938,"If anyone has any questions, please post."
13939,I'm happy to share my story and more details about CES if anyone has any interest.
13940,I've read all the studies I could find =).
13941,Best of luck to everyone here!
13942,"I want to get rid of it, but I don't want to take medication."
13943,About a year ago I was seeing a therapist about my problem and taking meds.
13944,"I quit my meds and stopped seeing the shrink, and I still felt fine."
13945,"I have been prescribed Clonazepam (to be taken 2-4 times daily as needed), and Zoloft, with a check-up in two weeks to determine if I'm going to be placed on a heart medication and/or switched to zanax/vallium, depending on how current medication is working by then."
13946,"I've dealt with extreme anxiety attacks and sometimes the meds work, sometimes a shot of whiskey works."
13947,"The downside is that I also cant fix my car, go to my doc (and i'm running out of medication), buy food, and most importantly pay rent."
13948,"No drugs, meds, only social drinking."
13949,I feel like all I can do is to take medication that will make me tired so I can sleep the rest of the day away.
13950,"Several years ago I was diagnosed with general anxiety and depression, and I'm on medication for it."
13951,I had my doctor give me some meds because I KNEW I would need them during this time because an attack was bound to happen.
13952,Anyone else have any problems with eating after taking their meds?
13953,"Hi there, 

I have suffered from severe generalized anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember and have been taking medication and receiving therapy for a few years now."
13954,What medications are available to treat anxiety besides the standard antidepressants and benzodiazepines?
13955,"I've tried sertraline (SSRI) and Effexor (SNRI) and although they both worked, I experienced side effects I was simply unwilling to tolerate."
13956,"I'm prescribed Klonopin .5mg, twice per day, but I only take that on days I need it (working in chemical health, I've seen firsthand what benzodiazepine addiction/withdrawal looks like; no thank you)."
13957,"I've tried many of the non-prescription medications, but the only ones that had much success were the more dangerous (e.g., phenibut and etizolam) or cost-prohibitive (selank and N-acetyl selank) and those still turned out to be less effective than Klonopin."
13958,I'm really not interested in trying an MAOI.
13959,"Already workout daily, get adequate sleep (thanks to diphenhydramine), semi-regularly practice mindfulness/meditation, and eat pretty well."
13960,Just wondering what else is out there.
13961,"I've read about some people using gabapentin and pregabalin to treat anxiety, but have never personally met anyone that has tried these."
13962,"EDIT: I should clarify the SSRI/SNRI side effect that made me say ""no more"" is inability to ejaculate and it's, as expected, extremely frustrating."
13963,"they told me I'm required to continue counseling to stay on my meds, and I have to go to a monthly med check to stay on them, but the counseling centers are closed during the summer."
13964,"She's never seen a professional about it, had any medicine, or anything like that."
13965,Tonight.
13966,Tonight has been one of the worst I've had in such a long time.
13967,My anxiety has been bad the past few days.
13968,"I've been having, on average, about three panic attacks a day."
13969,Tonight it has peaked so high.
13970,My chest is killing me.
13971,"My throat is so tight, it's hard to breathe and swallow."
13972,"When it gets this bad, everything, every feeling that has to do with the past, come rushing back, and is put on top of what I'm already feeling."
13973,I don't know how to safely deal with it.
13974,"I try and let it pass, but nothing helps."
13975,"Nothing sane, anyways."
13976,"I've been on so many different medications over the past 14 years, but nothing really helps."
13977,"All that they have done is intensify the anxiety, or completely kill my personality and make me feel dead inside."
13978,"Hell, maybe I should take feeling nothing than feeling so much pain in my chest."
13979,It's really hard for me to feel worthwhile I guess.
13980,"It's terrible, but I need someone to tell me that I'm worth being here."
13981,That it will all get better.
13982,Someone that will understand-and none of my close friends do.
13983,None of them seem to understand when I've talked to them about my anxiety and stress.
13984,I just wish I knew how to turn it off.
13985,I just wish I didn't ever have to feel like this.
13986,"I always try and talk to people when they seem down, when they reach out, but I can't do the same."
13987,I feel like such a burden.
13988,Right now-my chest just feels like it's burning.
13989,So badly.
13990,I just wish it would go away.
13991,I just want to be....okay.
13992,I'm not interested in using drugs because I've seen people get in cycles of taking more and more medicine when it stops working but never fixing the problem.
13993,"Alcohol and Benadryl are my friends... 

My blood pressure wasn't high enough to need meds to treat it."
13994,I also have a bad cold and the cold medicine I have seems to be making the withdrawal symptoms more noticable.
13995,I measured my heart rate at over 110 bpm and took my medicine.
13996,So my wife is suffering from anxiety.
13997,It has built up from episodes that were few and far between to something more debilitating.
13998,It is much more frequent and she has confessed to me that is has progressed to a daily struggle.
13999,She has gone to see a couple of therapists (non Dr.) recently and hasn't gotten any guidance on medication.
14000,They suggested possibly talking to our GP or a Psychiatrist that they could refer us to.
14001,So we don't know what are good medication recommendations for someone first trying pharma remedies to help ease the burden.
14002,I have seen alot of names here but don't know what is a good entry level medication for managing this.
14003,My wife is anti-drug because she has a bad history with side effects.
14004,She is going tomorrow to see our GP but can anyone provide guidance on what medications to possible stay away from or those suggest?
14005,"Also, as a husband of someone dealing with this, what can I do?"
14006,Outside of the obvious support her how she needs is there anything I can do?
14007,I have a hard time understanding what she is dealing with because I dont understand it.
14008,Thanks for any feedback
14009,Do family doctors prescribe medicine or diagnose?
14010,"I want to get the medical attention I need so I can pursue a job and school, but my fear of vomiting  and nausea over powers my want for medication."
14011,My therapist mentioned a medication that wouldn't make me sick six years ago but I stopped going to that particular office and google hasn't been much help.
14012,I started taking meds for anxiety almost a year ago.
14013,"Info: I'm 22, live in Okinawa since my husband is active duty, and therefore have military insurance, I was taking medication but stopped, I know I need to see someone but can't."
14014,"I've tried everything, but I just can't go back on the meds.."
14015,"Anything but the meds, dear god.."
14016,In the last six months I've finally gotten on meds and started counseling.
14017,"So my question, do I try to find a medication to take when I feel a panic attack coming on until I can get over this breakup or do I just deal with it and hope it goes away on its own."
14018,Any tips on how to overcome these persistent feelings of loneliness and sadness (without medication preferably?)
14019,"Everyone here knows the ups and downs when starting a new medication - six months of varying side effects, no sex drive, feeling like a failure."
14020,I also don't want to become dependent on medication if possible.
14021,"And I hate always bringing up that she needs to see a therapist or medication, because it was leads to her saying, I can’t take that medicine because it gives you parkinsons, and I can’t take that one it has this side effect and that one."
14022,Does anyone have any recommendations for a good medication that wont make me a zombie?
14023,"I live in a state with atrocious mental health care, and after a nervous breakdown and insurance mess ups that left me without my medication I finally got everything headed in the right direction (or so I thought)."
14024,"I'm back on my meds, and waited three months to see my therapist."
14025,"I honestly feel like i can't take it anymore, I have been doing so well from September until now , I haven't had a major panic attack in months and stopped all meds , suddenly today after so long , panic attacks are back , feeling of constant anxiety and a little depression because of them , I feel like nobody understands and that I am totally alone and it is killing me inside , upon all that I have heart palpitations which I'm freaking about and I think I'm going into heart failure any minute now."
14026,I have an irrational fear of overdosing on medication so even taking Ativan makes me anxious and it's a fight within to take it.
14027,But the doctor asked me lots of questions calmly and gave me two options; psychotherapy or medication.
14028,I opted for medication at this point due to my problem with social anxiety.
14029,"First time posting on here, I'm 21/F, have had anxiety forever but recently it's been unbearable so for the first time I'm considering medication."
14030,"Problem is, I don't have a usual doctor, so I don't even know where to go, and even if I do, I'm broke as hell so I'm not even positive I could afford any meds or whatever else."
14031,"By mid-May I was feeling a LOT better, I continued CBT, and continued taking my medicine and whatnot and it was awesome, I had a great May-June, towards the end of June I started feeling a bit sad/depressed but it turned around one day and I felt even better than before, it literally felt like I was pretty much over my major panic attacks and anxiety!"
14032,I explained this to my parents and they're contacting my doctor at home to see about my meds and whatnot.
14033,"After I stopped taking them, the withdrawals made me realize the extent to which the medication was affecting me, and I was terrified."
14034,"This year has been the worst I've had, and it's making me consider medication again."
14035,"I know my bad experience in the past was just because that wasn't the right pill for me, but I can't help but worry that medication will turn me into a different person."
14036,"So, what made you decide to/not to take medication?"
14037,I've never been on medication or seen a therapist.
14038,"I'm starting to feel like I can really benefit from returning to therapy and medication, but being untreated, I'm very, very anxious about returning, largely because I left without notice last time."
14039,Hey guys I need help my little sister started texting me tonight from her room which in itself was weird she called me in and talked about how she was not feeling right and didn't know what to do and that she thought she may need medication.
14040,"I am on 80mg, and for the last few months I have had the WORST heartburn after taking my meds."
14041,"I was trying to take them in the morning after brushing my teeth, cause I forget if I don't, but a half hour later, I am suffering re-flux and tasting the medication."
14042,"Other than the heartburn, the meds are working well - so I would hate to change..."
14043,But I also don't want to be dependent on this medication... What would one of you do in this situation?
14044,"Also trying to figure out meds for hypothyroidism (might be a contributing factor, we'll see)."
14045,I'm skeptical about the relation however since I only experienced immediate physical anxiety symptoms (in absence of any anxious thoughts) for a day or two after beginning meds.
14046,I am considering medication and trying to figure out how to fix this.
14047,"I should say that I do have medication: I take 150mg venlafaxine daily for depression, and I do have prescriptions for 25mg hydroxyzine and 0.5mg clonazepam that I take as needed for my anxiety."
14048,"Talk to a psych doctor at the hospital, wanted me to start medication but also wanted me to come to the mental health clinic for in-house help (7-10 days)."
14049,"I have gone to see my primary care doctor and she put me on some new medication about 3 weeks ago, and told me to just wait it out."
14050,"I was very hesitant to get on medication, I'm on Prozac and I take hydroxyzine as needed."
14051,"Today I told a friend how I've been on meds for a month and they said ""yeah they work now but good luck functioning without them in the future""."
14052,I don't want to be on medication forever and I don't want to have horrible withdrawal symptoms when I get off it.
14053,"He was able to stabilise through therapy and medication, and has been developing coping strategies since."
14054,"About a year ago, he stopped taking medication (it made him feel dissociative all the time) and has been controlling his anxiety mainly through exercise and thoughts strategies he picked up during therapy."
14055,"Arguments with my husband, a new medication that I'm trying to adjust to, prescribed time off of work with lost wages, water damage, one of the worst panic attacks I've ever experienced."
14056,"**

Lastly, I have the option of medicine."
14057,"She had a friend who went on medication for depression, and it decreased her efficiency at work, and changed her personality."
14058,"She also has a sister who went on medication for depression, too, and says that her sister is dependent on the medication, and slower because of it."
14059,**Should I not take medicine?
14060,I don't want to fucking go on medication!
14061,I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for a few years now I was able to handle up until I finished university during my final year I just seemed to have had a melt down and ended up having to go to the doctors for medication and then ended up having counselling as well.
14062,"I started learning to drive when I was a teenager, but a lot of awful things happened and I developed full-blown symptoms of PTSD, which took me off the road for a few years due to medication side effects and so on."
14063,For the majority of my life I've had my medications prescribed by my general medical practitioner.
14064,I've also gone to Psychologist from time to time to work on cognitive behavioral therapy.
14065,"Currently I'm towards the higher level of medication that my doctor normally prescribes, and I'm doing my best to practice the things I've learned in therapy, but I'm still having some anxiety, and now depression."
14066,I guess I'm just curious which specialist I should consider for my next step.
14067,Thanks in advance.
14068,Just calmed myself down from a panic attack without my medicine.
14069,Just wanted to share because I'm proud of myself for not having to take my meds to calm me down.
14070,"I am back on my *own* meds, and the oxy is now in another room to avoid future mistakes, but it was interesting getting a taste of cold turkey."
14071,"- If you were able to conquer this with the assistance of medication, what are you taking, and why specifically (what is it used to combat)?"
14072,"I'm cutting again, I've stopped taking my meds..."
14073,"I got my meds and immediately i panicked about taking them, even though I've done it plenty of times before and everything turned out okay."
14074,I feel like this when I take medicine of any kind actually.
14075,"my medicine, i forgot yesterday and chose not to take today."
14076,Should I look into medication?
14077,"I was fine at first, but good lawd, hell hath no fury like a body without its usual meds."
14078,"The doctors didn't actually put me on any medication until after the surgery, (lexapro and xanax) for long standing ""anticipatory anxiety"", meaning that even now almost 4 years later I still have problems eating, or even looking at food."
14079,"I can't afford to see a shrink, I can barely afford the medication."
14080,"Im wondering If anyone on here has tried exercise regularly with medication to help there anxiety and or depression, and im wondering how its worked for you."
14081,My friends believe I have anxiety and could benefit from meds and/or therapy.
14082,I've been diagnosed with bad anxiety disorder and have been in and out of therapy and on meds for years.
14083,I'm seeing my doctor at some point this week because my current anti anxiety medication isn't effective.
14084,"I know anti anxiety meds tend to make you drowsy as a side effect, so the less drowsy the medication the better for me (I do a lot of physical stuff and work requires me to be alert)."
14085,"I know one of the major meds known as Xanax is supposed to be less drowsy, which is a plus."
14086,Has anyone else experienced this during an anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medication switch?
14087,"I found out quickly I failed to do my vocabulary, and went to a place that only dealt with medication and not a place where I could sit and talk my problems out."
14088,"I was called in after taking my drug test and was in front of a woman who asked me a list of questions and the whole time I was doing my best to be 100% honest because I didn't want to be that guy who faked it, I was so afraid I would get medication and not actually need it because I really was just a pansy on the inside."
14089,This was completely opposite from what I had expected (ADHD) but I guess the medication is the same for both.
14090,"I began getting tired again about 3 months into my medication and was upped to 3 pills a day, and have felt no effects."
14091,"I did however run out for about a week, and for the first time felt the difference the medication made for my Anxiety, I literally teared up in my car and begged my insurance company to allow me to get some meds due to the attack I was having."
14092,"At this point, stopping the attacks is all the meds are doing, which is enough for me to want to keep taking it, but I miss the energy, I was happy for 3 months and it has faded and I don't know how to get it back."
14093,"This is the main reason I can't go to any psychiatrists/psychologists or get medication or anything of that sort, because my parents refuse to believe I have an issues."
14094,My meds don't do squat for anxiety or obsessive thoughts.
14095,"I was diagnosed, but never took any meds for it."
14096,"I went out of state a few ays ago and brought my wellbutrin with me, i took it as directed every single day and had only mild anxiety, but when i got back I discovered they lost my baggage, which had my medication (and only debit card) in it."
14097,"Hello there, I suffer from Anxiety but I don't think it is so bad that I need to be put on medications so I heard about Herbal Supplements, I was wondering if any of you has used it?"
14098,does it work and if it does can you recommend a supplement?
14099,thank you
14100,"I'm bipolar, and recently just got taken off all my medicines for health reasons, but they kept me on an anxiety medication since that has been a huge problem for me, and it's not working."
14101,My anxiety is at an all time high.
14102,I can't even control it.
14103,I fidget all the time.
14104,"I'm always constantly worrying about something, and it consumes me..."
14105,It consumes me so much that the insomnia I've had under control for years has returned.
14106,My mom has noticed the anxiety.
14107,"Which is new to me because she never notices things like that, like my mood changes and stuff like that."
14108,I've had several panic attacks which left me like crippled and useless for an entire day.
14109,"I couldn't bounce back or recover from them for hours, like the next day."
14110,I wanted to sleep after them but still couldn't even though I was beyond exhausted.
14111,I couldn't even speak after the last one I had.
14112,"I actually lost my voice... And then I had to go to work, it was horrible."
14113,I also lost consciousness.
14114,Does anyone have any tips on how to control the anxiety so I'm at least able to sleep at night?
14115,Or how to calm myself down in the event that I feel a panic attack coming...
14116,So over the last few weeks I've been coming off my of anti-depressants and anxiety medication.
14117,I'm freaking out about asking my prof for an extension on a paper.
14118,"I've been in the midst of midterms and so stressed out, so I haven't even got around to reading the book I have to write this paper on."
14119,"I was in the middle of changing medications as well during all this, so I've been a complete and total wreck."
14120,Does anyone have any suggestions for how to ask the prof for an extension?
14121,I have the email open and my brain is blanking.
14122,I don't know how to say it or what to say and just panicking.
14123,I have so many things to do and I don't want to half-ass everything.
14124,"I manage to deal with my random dizzy spells, throat tightness, or panic attacks pretty well and am currently not on meds."
14125,or should I try going on some sort of anxiety medication?
14126,I've been on and off anti-anxiety medication.
14127,I'm just curious as to anyone else out there.....were you able to take medication during the pregnancy?
14128,Maybe without meds or talking with a therapist.
14129,I would love to be able to have meds to cure it and make me more relaxed so I can make it to the interviews but it's not possible right now.
14130,"On the thyroid medication, I felt apathetic and very very relaxed."
14131,I finally reduced my dosage of thyroid medication on doctor's advice.
14132,Between the slowing thyroid meds and now the hyper anxiety I find it almost impossible to do the process properly.
14133,"), but not if the medication stalls or worsens the weight."
14134,I'm starting to work myself up into fearing my panic disorder returning or the medication not working any more.
14135,"** I've tried Celexa, Effexor, Wellbutrin, and a whole lot of everything else, and I'm more or less convinced meds aren't my answer."
14136,No way in hell do I want to end up on meds when I'm older.
14137,I never had an issue with this before taking the medicine.
14138,Does anyone have any experience with this side effect and does anybody know if it will go away once I get used to the medicine?
14139,Ive made massive improvement and had just 2 days where 1 was i changed medication and got to experience the lovely side effects.
14140,"What i didn't do (But can still work for you):

* Meditate 
* Take meds (Saw the stories)
* Therapy

It was pretty bad i would wake up thinking ""oh i'm not anxious hopfully i'm not later"" Then i would cling on to that thought so hard that it made me anxious if i thought anything else then panic sets in."
14141,Never been on any meds.
14142,"Everyone tells her to take antianxiety meds, including her therapist, but she is incredibly against taking meds."
14143,I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and live in a northern climate.
14144,"Every December-February is typically harder for me, in terms of anxiety leading to depressive or intrusive thoughts."
14145,Right now I am unmedicated but feeling very symptomatic.
14146,"At the same time, I am trying to conceive a baby via donor sperm and want to maximize my chances, as donor sperm costs a LOT of money per attempt."
14147,What are medications that are safe to take while one is trying to conceive?
14148,"Ladies with anxiety, how did getting pregnant or being pregnant work with or without meds?"
14149,"Someone recently asked me what the relief from anxiety felt like, getting to have medication."
14150,Taking my meds is like the prison finally letting me out into the courtyard.
14151,Was waiting for my medicine to kick in.
14152,"I've only ever had two panic attacks, one about a year and a half ago and one a month or so ago and I was like 'surely I don't have anxiety, it's just fresher nerves' but it's got to the point where I have been back to my doctor several times about it and been put on the waiting list for therapy and been prescribed meds and I'm scared."
14153,"Right now i'm going through a lot, i just moved to a new place (Denver), with some friends from the internet, i acquired a welding job paying $13 an hour, i had the interview less than 3 hours before i was supposed to depart to my hometown out of state."
14154,"I have had an extremely good time since I came here, however my anxiety and OCD issues are coming back."
14155,"one OCD to mention is kleptomania, and I already had an event a week ago."
14156,"I'm feeling really guilty, to the point of wanting to leave the place."
14157,"Everyday since then I've been getting a heaviness in my chest, an inability to converse like a normal person when going through a mild attack."
14158,"The guy I'm staying with also has OCD, and I feel like things are starting to clash a bit."
14159,"As far as the kleptomania, I really need to say something to him about it, a part of me thinks he'd understand perfectly, but can't seem to bring myself to say anything about it."
14160,"I came close, but today I feel like time is running out as far as having a place to stay."
14161,"This could be all in my head, for someone dealing with anxiety, most things are."
14162,"I haven't identified any triggers for my anxiety yet, it seems to just happen out of nowhere."
14163,"I've come a long way, but as far as the kleptomania issue, it's the most dangerous one in my honest opinion."
14164,I've been doing my research on it recently and I feel like might be able to man up and confess.
14165,however I'm very worried on how he'll react.
14166,"I am male, 24, and I've never been to a doctor for any mental health issues though I feel like I should see one."
14167,I'm not on any medications however i used to take Xanax recreationally and had a pretty bad time when i stopped.
14168,"I have no way of getting any medication because I haven't needed it in a long time, so I didn't stock up."
14169,Let me preface this with the fact that my medication regimen has kind of been messed up so I am having high anxiety.
14170,"Whenever I see posts on this sub regarding anxiety attacks, medication and seriously crippling conditions, I just feel bad for wanting to talk about myself on here."
14171,"These are side effects I don't want to experience, so I have not began taking the meds."
14172,I am at my wit's end because nothing seems to help and I really don't want to be on medication that could possibly make my anxiety worse.
14173,TL;DR **I'm posting to ask for advice on my situation (if you were patient enough to read my post) as well as your opinions on anti-anxiety meds.
14174,How did you get used to the medication and how has it affected your life?
14175,They said that the other adult is there to talk about what they have seen as far as my behavior and to be there in case any medicine is prescribed.
14176,He knows that I've been on medicine before and a lot of the not-so-great details of my past treatment but there are still some things I'd like to keep to myself.
14177,Cue new meds for him.
14178,"It's frustrating because I have had so much time to get over this, and I've been doing all the right things (therapy, meds, exercise, diet, work, etc), but I feel like I'm exactly where I was when I was with him."
14179,Would prefer those not we requiring medication :)
14180,.The doctor is lowering me from 112 mcg of medication to 100mcg.
14181,"TL;DR How will .5mg, possibly 1mg of Lorazepam affect a 21 year-old male, currently not on any medication, that has to give 4 class presentations, but gets very anxious?"
14182,"Even if I'm sick with just a common cold, I can't take any cold medication."
14183,So no more medicine ever again unless administered by a doctor.
14184,Another reason for my nervous breakdown was that I was put on medication and my doctor didn't tell me what the sideffects were.
14185,"I spoke to my doctor about my anxiety nearly a year ago, and she prescribed me some medication for my condition (cipralex, 10mg/day)."
14186,"I'm also on anti-anxiety meds, so this is just one other step I've taken to help my anxiety"
14187,"I'm on a medication that took away all the severe symptoms like that, but everything just seems like it's too much and I can't do it."
14188,At what point do I ask for an up-dose of meds?
14189,Now physiatrist have put me on meds and I’ve been going on Zoloft for about four weeks.
14190,"I’m getting worse and while I know it can take longer for the meds to kick in, I’m starting to feel discouraged."
14191,"The fact that darkness does depress me is why I started on meds in the first place, and I’m scared we won’t have time to start another medicine before I’m practically unable to get out of bed."
14192,"When I first started therapy we briefly touched on the subject of some medications, nothing in particular just basically that it can affect libido but that it sometimes is a necessary boost to important chemicals within the brain."
14193,I've had several months of therapy now and had made a little progress but some recent challenges have had me fall back into my old ways of severe procrastination  and rapidly declining self esteem.
14194,I have an appointment with my therapist on Thursday and I think we are going to explore some options for medication.
14195,"Anyways I just was hoping to hear from some people who have been using medication, both positive and negative experiences would be appreciated."
14196,"If it helps any of you to relate closer to me when referencing what you did here are some of my anxiety symptoms:

Severe procrastination (School, paying bills, etc)
Mild social anxiety (Higher in crowded places like malls/university)
Overheating/sweating (Always leads to more panic)
Low Self Esteem
General exhaustion from over thinking EVERYTHING

Thanks so much!"
14197,"I wasn't keen on taking any medication, so I declined.)"
14198,"I hate meds, I tried to take celexa and some other meds."
14199,"I haven't done anything about it either, I've been introverted because it's all related to university, I don't want meds that will go on my record..."
14200,"Everything kind of turned black (im sure you guys know what im talking about) and while it seems like that could be because of 1)new meds 2)not much eating and 3)headphones, it freaked me out and gave me a panic attack."
14201,I hate using the word crazy.
14202,"I really do, but I feel like I'm going to lose it."
14203,Like I don't even know what to do.
14204,I need an outlet but I can't find one that works for me.
14205,I am tired of sleepless nights because of my incessant worrying.
14206,I've given myself ulcers over the anxiety I've felt.
14207,I just want someone to talk to...
14208,"I am an 18 year old, introverted female with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression."
14209,I've taken medications before but they make me feel detached and emotionless so I am not taking them at the moment.
14210,My life is a clusterfuck of shit.
14211,"I know that I should talk about it, but I don't want people to think I'm being a crybaby."
14212,"I'm not I just want someone to know my whole story, the whole entire truth."
14213,Would someone please talk to me?
14214,I'm feeling lost.
14215,"Other than that, I do not take medication and don't plan to because I am sure that I can control this with a bit of reluctant therapy."
14216,Hiya.
14217,I'm 29/M and I've struggled a long time with really bad anxiety and depression.
14218,I can't stop thinking about traumatizing events.
14219,"""Traumatizing"" makes it sound like something horrible happened in my life, but that's not necessarily the case."
14220,"It's mostly me making a mountain out of a molehill times 1000, which is pretty much what anxiety is, after all."
14221,"The ""trauma"" is people who were mean to me, said something very hurtful, or wronged me in some way that was really stressful to deal with."
14222,"Instead of being able to forget about those jerks/bad times and being able to move on, I go to bed, and lay there constantly thinking about those moments/people."
14223,"It's even worse when waking up, I immediately have a rush of anxiety when waking up and again thinking about those horrible times in my life."
14224,"Then it leads to bad depression where I constantly think about the world is mostly filled with awful/ignorant people, most of them in positions of power, and how I don't understand the world or the people in it."
14225,"Not a good way to start each day, and that depression hangs over me all the time."
14226,"Even worse, I end up being mean toward the people around me whom I care about the most, people who are usually nothing but great to me, I bring them down with me, just because I'm always sad and angry."
14227,BLUH.
14228,I hate living like this.
14229,"I don't know what do, it's been like this for so long."
14230,I've tried so many medications and I'm bad at therapy.
14231,I just can't stop obsessing over the worst things in life.
14232,"He was insensitive, and made me feel pressured to stop taking the medication, despite my recent self-harm and thoughts of suicide."
14233,"I'm almost afraid that my brain is simply refusing to be ""fooled"" by the medication if that makes sense."
14234,That and social anxiety mixed in makes me wonder what kind of medication might actually work for me...(Oh and apparently I can't take antidepressants because I likely have low-level bipolar?)
14235,No meds needed.
14236,I apologize in advance if this doesn't seem very focused.
14237,My wife and I met playing World of Warcraft a little over 5 years ago.
14238,She was in a bad marriage with another guy she married pretty much straight out of high school.
14239,She has had a lot of bad experiences with men through her life.
14240,Practically been raped by them on multiple occasions.
14241,I helped her through the divorce and eventually we met in person.
14242,We only spent about 2 weeks together before she had to move back to her parents to get her life back on track after her divorce.
14243,Those 2 weeks were some of the best of my life though.
14244,We kept in touch playing WoW together and after a few months decided we would try living together.
14245,Everything was amazing for about 3 years following that.
14246,Obviously it wasn't perfect but we were both extremely happy.
14247,After we had been living together for about 3 years we decided to get married.
14248,I've always believed marriage is unnecessary and only has value to religious people so I was never excited about getting married or anything.
14249,Together is together either way to me but she wanted to be married so I married her.
14250,"She always takes it personally that I ""never wanted to marry her"" when in reality I already had every intention of spending my life with her..."
14251,I feel like our problems started because of this though.
14252,After we got married she didn't work for 6 months and that caused a lot of strain to us financially for a while.
14253,She got a job delivering pizzas after that and things were better until she got robbed at gunpoint.
14254,She has always suffered from depression and been on medication from it.
14255,She is also an insulin dependent diabetic in poor control of her blood sugars.
14256,She has stopped taking her medications several times recently and I have noticed how badly it has affected her mental health.
14257,I have always needed to help her at her doctor appointments because she has difficulty asking for things or handling things that don't go quite as planned.
14258,She also needed surgery recently for carpal tunnel syndrome and basically hasn't worked much since the robbery due to the surgery and anxiety from the aftermath of the robbery.
14259,She has slowly been spending less and less time with me since the robbery and recently I told her I don't feel like she cares about me any more.
14260,She tells me I treat her like she is 5 years old because I try to make sure she takes care of herself properly when she doesn't.
14261,I asked her if she could make an effort to spend some time with me since we haven't much in a couple weeks and since that she has done nothing but play warcraft after a 3 year break from it.
14262,Literally nothing but play warcraft.
14263,She rarely even sleeps.
14264,I can't express my concern or she closes herself off to me... She met a guy on there the same day she started playing again and has been on skype with him every minute of every day for about a week straight.
14265,She says he helps with her anxiety and she is just trying to figure everything out so me and her can be happy again... We have always spent pretty much all of our free time together so this is very strange to me.
14266,She refuses to spend time with me without being on skype with him and refuses to let me listen to both sides of the skype call to try to better understand whats going on...
14267,It just seems like a repeat of what happened with me and her years ago when i helped her through her divorce except this time i feel like i will be the ex husband.
14268,She hasn't threatened to kill herself exactly but she has told me on more than one occasion that I am the only reason she is able to keep living and that just makes this even more difficult... She tried to kill herself in the previous marriage before she met me too.
14269,I am just all around lost and confused on what I should do.
14270,I love her so much and don't want it to end like this.
14271,"I probably missed a bunch of important information...

TL:DR My wife has crippling anxiety and depression caused by being robbed at gunpoint recently and a lifetime of poor physical health."
14272,Lack of communication has become worse than ever.
14273,Last week I told her I rarely feel like she loves me any more and she has barely talked to me since...
14274,I've apologized and told her I know its from her anxiety and depression but it doesn't seem to help and I don't know what to do anymore.
14275,I can't lose her.
14276,We both need each other.
14277,Not sure if Zoloft or any medication at all is right for me since the common side-effects scare me shitless.
14278,"I told her I wasn't sure if I wanted to commit to medication on the long term, like you're meant to do with this drug, which she understood."
14279,"It's not very difficult for me to speak openly about my issues, but my therapist said it would probably be beneficial for me to start taking some kind of medication so I could get a break from the anxiety while I start sorting through my issues in therapy."
14280,Should I try and overcome my fear of SSRI side-effects and take the drug; rely on therapy alone; or discuss other types of medication with my doctor?
14281,I have been experiencing an increased level of anxiety for the past month or so.
14282,"I didn't change anything as far as medications (besides increasing my xanax dose, which helped to an extent) around the time I noticed an increase in anxiety symptoms, frequency, and severity."
14283,"Since then, I have changed my medication regimen almost entirely."
14284,"Currently, I am taking the following meds:
Dextroamphetamine - 40mg every morning and 20mg at noon
Effexor XR - 37.5mg (In the process of discontinuing)
Xanax - 4-6mg/day (usually in doses of 2mg at a time)
Remeron - 15mg (Although I'm not sure if I want to stay on this)

I was wondering if anyone has had any luck with medications that affect glutamate activity."
14285,I'm sort of out of options at this point.
14286,Any reply would be greatly appreciated.
14287,"I also don't like taking meds, they helped but they made me so sleepy and lazy that it's almost the same as being dead."
14288,"I've always been resistant to medication, I was prescribed some anti-depressants (SSRIs) in the summer of 2012 but never took them."
14289,So I've decided I have to stop resisting it and go on medication.
14290,"I don't know how to tell them I'm not better, I want to go back into therapy this summer, and go on medication, and continue to work on my mental health."
14291,I'm on meds and usually feel fine.
14292,"I know meds should be a last resort, and I'm not even sure if medication can help with something so weird, but I'm looking for anything to help me get rid of this - even if it's for an hour or two."
14293,"She's too afraid of medication to take anything to knock her out to sleep (nyquil used to help), and I just don't know what to do."
14294,"After that I saw several therapists, was put on medication (Xanax and several others), and was generally miserable."
14295,During the time I was on medication I had many angry outbursts and was very unstable emotionally.
14296,After a year of the medication I refused to take it any longer because I felt as if I was not in control of myself anymore.
14297,A few months after I went off the medication my parents did something that made me never trust them again.
14298,I guess it is a side effect of the medicine I've never had but I just can't control it anymore.
14299,Even now after the meds are over I am focusing on something odd I feel in my tooth and wondering if it's a piece of food that is going to get infected despite it being there for at least a week or two or who knows how long.
14300,"I am open to the idea of medication, though that frightens me too."
14301,"We sought help for her together, as far as the meds part of it."
14302,But I saw her progression and how the meds helped her stabilize.
14303,I've always had anxiety issues and was diagnosed with PTSD at a pretty young age and I was taking meds for it before my mother stopped me (she saw somewhere that someone committed suicide while taking them and she took the liberty of making the decision to stop me).
14304,"I'm almost out of medication and need to go to the doctors to get some more, and my dad usually rings to make the appointment for me, but this time he wants me to do it."
14305,What if they don't have any appointments before my medication runs out?
14306,"Last appointment the doctor said come back after [something mumbled] month/s and I've left it two months because that is how much medication I've had, what if he actually said one month?"
14307,"But my anxiety has gotten bad enough I need medication again, and while this worked with some obvious side effects, I wasn't sure if anyone else had any luck with it, maybe at a different dose or anything."
14308,"The most recent psychiatrist I saw told me ""it's okay that you sometimes don't want to get out of bed, you don't need medication"" and I've been pill-free for about 7 years now."
14309,"But a few years ago, I decided to stop taking medication."
14310,"Hello Reddit, I've come to you in search of medical help, assistance, and information regarding my father."
14311,I live in the New York area in the county of Westchester.
14312,I've recently encountered a problem.
14313,My father is suffering from some serious anxiety issues where his panic attacks seem to be a lot more frequent then usual.
14314,i myself am not comfortable with this issue at all so to speak.
14315,i really would like anything involving your help or information as to what i can do to help him prevent these panic attacks.
14316,if they're any medications that he can take and so on and fourth.
14317,As of right now he takes Adapin 1MG.
14318,What I'd really love to know is if there is a daily extended version to help prevent such a threat as these panic attacks any input will be greatly appreciated and again thank you Reddit I'd really appreciate this i love my Father more than anything in this world and i hate to see him go through this hes basically all i have left.
14319,Thank you.
14320,"Currently I'm on my parents insurance (full time student with part time job) and they believe I dont need medication, despite what I have been told by professionals."
14321,I do take medication but it does not help much.
14322,"I don't smoke, drink or take drugs and I'm not on any prescription medication."
14323,"So, I've known this person for 2 years and him and I have been dating for 4 months."
14324,We love each other and we're very similar people with pretty much all of the same values.
14325,"The problem is, my anxieties and insecurities have really been getting in the way at times."
14326,"As happy as I am to be with him, when anything even slightly goes wrong I start having all of these repetitive anxious thoughts and I don't know how to work through it."
14327,I struggle to be assertive as it is so it's hard for me to always tell him when something he does bothers me but the problem is that I get so anxious thinking about it that I usually start shutting him out because I don't want him to see me that anxious and in such a bad state.
14328,I want to talk to him rationally.
14329,Have any of you guys ever experienced this?
14330,Is there anything that helps?
14331,I am in therapy but I just started with a new person and I'm still getting to know her so it hasn't helped much just yet.
14332,Plus I can't take anti-anxiety medications.
14333,My boyfriend knows I have anxiety and I sometimes get very nervous when we're together.
14334,He usually gives me a hug or holds me for a while and it makes me feel much better.
14335,"But when I get into these sorts of ""melt-down"" states, I really don't want him to be subjected to it."
14336,I want to work through it so he doesn't have to carry that burden and I also want to work through it so I can effectively communicate things to him that bother me.
14337,As there are sometimes legitimate issues but my anxiety just makes it so hard to deal with.
14338,Does anyone else have repetitive thoughts?
14339,What has helped?
14340,"Also, part of why these repetitive thoughts start occurring is because he lives an hour away from me and is currently working full time for the summer so I can't talk things out with him right away."
14341,So it starts to fester and I start to freak out.
14342,"-_-

tl;dr I have racing and repetitive thoughts because of my anxiety and I'm worried it's going to affect the relationship."
14343,I am already in therapy but is there anything else I can do?
14344,Anyone else experienced this?
14345,"I stopped using my medication, as well as exercising and because I was up all night asleep all day my schedule fell apart."
14346,"Finally after a month I quit, but I feel like a let my Mom down who has been paying for my meds and therapy."
14347,I'v just been look blankly at my meds wondering to myself what's the point of even trying again?
14348,"i went to a shrink once a month, occasionally took meds."
14349,"She continues to suffer from depression among other things, although she will not allow herself to get help or medication."
14350,"However, I was diagnosed on several occasions growing up as having social anxiety disorder and/or moderate GAD, which can become rather severe due to hormonal fluctuations, and I cannot afford my medication anymore."
14351,"So I'm going to ask my doctor to prescribe me a Benzo, it's the only medication I think is going to have an effect on my anxiety."
14352,And if you want to share about any other medication for anxiety that has worked for you I'd love to hear about it.
14353,"I'm on the verge of getting myself a knife to protect myself (that's so absurd, I know) or getting off my medication."
14354,I really need some advice on this issue because I don't want this new medication to affect my ability to hang out with my friends on the weekends.
14355,I'm having my gallbladder removed at the end of July.
14356,I've done everything I can to stack the deck in my favor.
14357,"I live in a large city, and chose a hospital nationally known for its quality with a laparoscopic surgeon that comes highly recommended both popularly and by people within the hospital."
14358,"Genetically, my mother had to have hers out and had no related digestive issues over the course of her life."
14359,"Plus, my gallbladder ultrasound showed a contracted gallbladder even after fasting, which to me suggests it's not been doing its ""storage"" job for a while, which means I think my system could already be ""used to"" my gallbladder not being part of the picture ... and my surgeon agrees."
14360,"Unlike many gallbladder patients, I seem to be able to eat fatty foods at the moment and have not had an excruciatingly painful attack such as some people have described."
14361,"I did have an attack in late March after eating a very fatty dinner, and have had twinges and pain since then (and predating then, I suspect)."
14362,The surgeon says the CT scan and ultrasound of the area also demonstrate it's time for the organ to be removed.
14363,"I've done way too much reading about this surgery, and while I know a great deal about the surgery, I've also read far too many posts from people who don't feel well after the surgery."
14364,"Now, I know there's a bunch of biases here."
14365,"There's the [availability heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic), and [misleading vividness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misleading_vividness), and the mere fact that nine times out of 10, people who recover fine don't go to the Internet to proclaim that things went well, whereas people for whom it went poorly almost always go to the Internet (which is [sampling bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias), I think)."
14366,"Supposedly 700,000 new people have this surgery every year, and there can't be 700,000 new people every year in permanent gastric misery for the rest of their lives, or, hell, not even 70,000 (10%), right?"
14367,"I also fear that I'm going to deal with clueless medical professionals - I trust who I've picked for the surgery for the most part, but why, for example, would [not a single one of the this lady's doctors](http://www.thespectrum.com/story/life/features/mesquite/2014/06/22/back-pain-improves-rest/11238405/) know about bile acid sequestrants like Questran or Welchol when they're effing gastroenterologists?"

14369,"I had pilonidal cyst surgery in 2001, and I was certain I'd keep getting new ones."
14370,I didn't.
14371,"I had a bedbug infestation in 2005, and I was certain they'd keep coming and I'd never get rid of them."
14372,I left them behind.
14373,"I lost my job in 2008, and was certain I'd never find work and my life would be ruined."
14374,I found work (after over a year of looking).
14375,You'd think that my perennial certainty in doomsdays would've been shaken by now.

14380,I'm very scared.
14381,"**tl;dr** Hard to tl;dr this, but if you really won't read the above, stacked the deck as much as I could in my favor for a gallbladder surgery, and have many reasons to think it will turn out well, but still stark raving terrified that I'll be one of the people who develop long-term or lifelong digestive system complications from the gallbladder removal."
14382,"I have gone through the a-z in therapists and therapy, i've done bio and nuero feedback I take medication and finally landed my first job."
14383,I had Monday-Tuesday off was suppose to go in yesterday but called out and went to my doctors and he proscribed me medicine.
14384,Alright reddit..
14385,This is my first ever post so bear with me here.
14386,I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for almost three years now.
14387,Tried the medications (9 of them) when this all started and was admitted to a hospital from all of the fucked up thoughts i endured from the medications.
14388,"So i'm currently not medicated, but lately it seems that everything sets me off."
14389,"Commotion, crouds, dim lights, background noise, and even my own children :(."
14390,"For some reason when they're around, i'm instantly upset and have absolutely no patience with them."
14391,I don't enjoy my time around them and i'd much rather be alone 24/7.
14392,"That's horrible to say, because i love them both with my entirety, i just can't find it in myself how to relax and let things go."
14393,I've talk to a few therapists and tell them about the horrible experiences i've had with the medications and that i refuse to take them.
14394,"At first, they were all fine with just talking to me, but they all ended up at the same place which was ""i want you to see my psychiatrist to get a low dose of medicine."""
14395,I can't even take tylenol or my daily vitamin anymore because my mind just instantly remembers those horrible intrusive thoughts.
14396,So.. Is this just a stage of my anxiety?
14397,Am i alone on these feelings?
14398,"I don't know what to do anymore, and my kids are only 1 and 2."
14399,They need their daddy 😕😕😕
14400,"I have been managing this for all my life, I was always and anxious child, but I have personally not been open to trying medication as a treatment."
14401,No medication or professional help.
14402,"I keep it fairly under control most of the time now, thanks to therapy and medication, but there are moments of intense anxiety that I still experience."
14403,"im running out of my meds, plus i wanted to change a second medication im taking."
14404,looks like im gonna go back on benzos as thats the only thing my GP(s) (yes i have two cause i was hoping one would understand mental health medication) want to give me.
14405,i am not on any other medication.
14406,"Often when I have a sports match, tennis, soccer, basketball etc I get very anxious."
14407,My palms start sweating and start being nervous.
14408,On August 17 I have a match that don't want this anxiety messing me up.
14409,Is there anything I can start doing to prepare myself?
14410,I read something about meditation and maybe some natural herbs?
14411,Not sure if I want medications like pills.
14412,I have been in therapy and on medication for a long time and thought I had it pretty well under control.
14413,Started taking medication for it (~6mo ago) which have really helped with the panic attacks.
14414,Have been on medication twice for brief periods of time (Buspirone &amp; Lexapro.)
14415,Vomited and took meds because I was so worked up.
14416,Is there anything I can do besides meds to help this?
14417,I eventually took myself off of the medication in college because It was so reliable that I could cope pretty easily by just forcing myself to make it through the really rough days.
14418,During my first pregnancy I asked to be put back on the medication because I was having problems.
14419,"I waited a long time to talk to my doctor about it, thinking that I really couldn't possibly be depressed because I was already on medication."
14420,"Again, like the time before, I hesitated to discuss it with my doctor because I was already on a medication."
14421,I frequently tell people that being on the wrong medication (or the wrong dose) is worse than being on nothing at all.
14422,I had severe anxiety that the medication did not seem to be touching.
14423,"I was also breastfeeding, meaning I was not able to take any kind of medication to assist with the short term symptoms when the attacks came on."
14424,But I'm totally freaked out about starting different meds.
14425,tl;dr: I don't think I'm on the right medication but trying to find the right medication/dose can be torture and I'm not sure I'm ready to go through that again.
14426,"After being on Celexa for almost a year, I think I'm ready to try and be off meds for a little while -- or at least try a new/better anti-anxiety med."
14427,I was on effexor 75mg for anxiety and lunesta for trouble sleeping (which has gotten worse since I started the effexor).
14428,Neither were really effective.
14429,My doctor is very... conservative and didn't want me on two medications so she told me to stop both (cold turkey- she said my dose is low enough) and started me on trazodone to help both issues.
14430,Does anyone have any experiences with trazodone?
14431,How effective is it at managing anxiety?
14432,Any side effects?
14433,"I have found myself in a bit of a catch-22: My anxiety is so high that my therapist strongly recommends medication so that I can effectively engage in therapy, however my anxiety is so high that I'm afraid of starting a new medication."
14434,"My side effects were so bad that I didn't make it through the first week (constant nausea and diarrhea, with increased anxiety) and I am absolutely terrified that this new medication (Zoloft generic) will make me feel the same way I felt on Prozac."
14435,"Pros of going on medication:
-It fixes the problem
-Maybe I really need it
-The reason why they invented medication is to help people like me

Cons of going on medication:
-Dependent on them for the rest of my life?"
14436,"-It's just a quick fix
-I'll be an unemotional zombie
-There is a chance they could make the disorder worse

Here's my dilemma, Reddit:
Do I go on medication and accept that I need them forever?"
14437,I know mixing medicine with alcohol isn't the best thing but I feel like if I take the half pill at 10 then skip the 7oclock pill then go out to drink around 9 then I should be fine.
14438,"I cry constantly, I sleep more than I ever have, I've been missing work, I even got my medication adjusted because I was scaring myself with how upset I've been."
14439,Hello all...
14440,So after trying to face down my anxiety mano el mano for 2 months I've decided to start taking my medication.
14441,I'm really scared/nervous/anxious about it.
14442,I've been prescribed Paxil and Klonopin.
14443,"I'm scared that these medications will turn me into someone I don't want to be, I'm honestly kind of afraid to confront my non-anxious self after 2 months (of what feels like) transformative anxiety."
14444,The reason I'm finally taking it is that it has seriously interfered with my relationship.
14445,"I love my fiance more than life itself, but the constant crying and just ""brokenness"" of me in my anxious state has created distance between us."
14446,"Today that came to a head and I spent the whole morning convinced that our relationship was going to end, doubting my love for him, and all around just puking and feeling awful."
14447,"I know that to get better I need to actually take the steps I need to, but what if once I'm on medication I realize that I don't want to be in this relationship???"
14448,I'm terrified of that prospect.
14449,I know that I love Nick and I KNOW I want to be with him...I'm just really scared.
14450,This is my first time taking medication so any advice/support/love would be much appreciated.
14451,**TL;DR I'm going on medication for the first time.
14452,My anxiety has seeped into my relationship and that's where I draw the line.
14453,Scared medication will change me/make me fall out of love with my fiance.
14454,I need support ya'll**
14455,i went on medication and the next few years were actually some of the best years of my life.
14456,i knew the meds changed my life but i thought i was in control now.
14457,I went of the medication.
14458,the few months after going off the meds were smooth sailing.
14459,I went back on my meds ASAP.
14460,I am not on any medication and I am worried to tell my mom to let me see someone.
14461,I have a bad past with anxiety/depression and medication.
14462,I don't know if I should get a stronger acid reflux medicine or try an anxiety medicine.
14463,"There's a lot of different things I guess it could be, but I'm just worried that the alcohol might be having an adverse effect with my medication."
14464,Can it be myself or the meds changing my perspective on life?
14465,"Hi everyone, I’m hoping to get some advice (this is my second reddit account for posts like these)."
14466,I suffer from severe social anxiety/anxiety in general for a few years now (just like you guys :P).
14467,"It’s the racing thoughts, fear of what others see/think of me, etc."
14468,etc.
14469,"that leads to isolation, which leads to depression, repeat."
14470,A vicious cycle.
14471,"My anxiety prevents me from socializing, which is the one part of my life that NEEDS to change."
14472,"It’s driving me insane…

I’m currently on a few medications: lamictal 100mg, 30mg Adderall, 10mg viibyrd (just started a few days ago) and was prescribed klonopin on Thursday (today is Monday) .5mg."
14473,"i didn’t take the klonopin 2 days out of the 4 and have been breaking the .5mg into halves most of the times, except for night I took 1.125mg, which I shouldn’t have done, but I was incredibly anxious."
14474,"Also, I smoke pot at night to calm my nerves, before bed."
14475,"Anyway, I have been provided with such great relief from the klonopin."
14476,"I’ve been waking up very refreshed, even if I’m tired with a long day ahead of me, I’m not zombie-like, anxious, or irritable so far."
14477,I took .125mg last night for sleep.
14478,"I’m trying to keep the dose low &amp; take it only as needed since I don’t want to build a tolerance because I need this medication to work when attempting to socialize…
Can anyone give me their experiences with klonopin &amp; how they handle their anxiety/social anxiety?"
14479,And answer a few of these questions I have regarding klonopin?
14480,: how fast does one build a tolerance?
14481,When should I take it &amp; how long does it last?
14482,I know the half-life is very long… does that mean its effects will last for as long as the half life?
14483,"Also, for those who take it only as needed, has that worked so far for you?"
14484,Thank you guys.
14485,I’ve been trying to gather as much info/advice as I can about it since I don’t want to be dependent on it.
14486,Basically the only reason I live anymore is for my fiancee.
14487,I've been trying my hardest to get myself ready to go back to work after 1 and 1/2 year break.
14488,"Some days for a brief moment, I think it is possible, but 99% of the time, the thought of sitting there 9-5 every day drives me crazy (did it for 7 years)."
14489,I even made a decent wage 45+ an hour.
14490,"But I don't care about money, I only care about being free to do what I want from day to day."
14491,"I take 2 antidepressants, I have taken several anxiety medications that don't help and I am currently taking propanol."
14492,I have  only a few months left in savings and I can't even get myself to apply for jobs this time.
14493,"How do you deal with the extreme urge to non exist, but at the same time not hurt the one closest to you?"
14494,I applied for disability but I doubt it will go through and I'll be homeless by the time it does.
14495,I feel like I am lazy but most of it is extreme anxiety.
14496,"I wouldn't consider myself suicidal as I have suicidal thoughts constantly all my life and never acted upon them, but if someone else could kill me or some circumstance would lead to my death I would feel relieved."
14497,Been in therapy too but no real breakthroughs.
14498,My brain always pushes myself towards suicidal thoughts at the sign of any difficulty.
14499,"He doesn't deserve that kind of responsibility, and I'm doing CBT to help, but I still kind of need the crutch of meds."
14500,recently went off my meds due to my docs advice.
14501,I constantly feel the physical symptoms of GAD and I am actively trying therapy and medicine however I'm wondering what it is doing for my health.
14502,"I'm waiting on an appointment to see a psychiatrist to potentially get on some meds, but until then, I feel like i'm losing all hope."
14503,"I'm asking because I used to take only ssri's for a combo of anxiety and depression, then went off them for a couple years when I was doing well, but now my anxiety is becoming a problem again, but I don't feel like I'm slipping back into depression, so I'm thinking of trying just anti-anxiety meds, but I don't have any experience with them."
14504,"Through therapy and meds I got through that, began to believe I was invincible and over the next 4 years I went to college and then University, my life was on the up, I made great friends and fell in love."
14505,"I got meds, Citalopram and Propranonol, and within days I was feeling better, the feelings of dread and panic were subsiding, although I still didn't venture from the house except for doctor appointments, things were somehow looking up."
14506,She asked me what meds I was taking.
14507,I told I would happily tame meds except every therapist so far has said no.
14508,I really don't want to take the meds.
14509,I also get very panicky on meds (afraid of side effects - yay OCD).
14510,I'm not taking any meds for anxiety but I have Inositol (which I've been forgetting to take the past few months).
14511,I have been struggling now for 10 years and am finally ready to take a step towards medication.
14512,I use to hate the thought of meds and was 100% against them but now my body is damaged and I need to heal it.
14513,"I am asking for help because my fear stems from throwing up, I would like to try and find a medication with minimal side effects especially minimal nausea."
14514,"I also know everyone is different, so what was your experience like on meds?"
14515,"He's gotten a lot better and is only on one medication, plus his monthly therapist visits."
14516,I want these episodes to stop so I can function normally but I fear seeing a doctor will immediately mean he prescribes me medication and write me off.
14517,And medication of any sort is no substitute for therapy or making changes to current thinking patterns/behavioral patterns.
14518,I was crying out of fear that anxiety gives you and I decided to go to my primary care doctor to maybe get an increase on my Clomipramine (my primary took over my medication management since the psychiatrist was getting expensive).
14519,"That is, before I take my daily medication, I am in a fog of anxiety."
14520,"Once I take them, I can feel as the meds hit my head and the anxiety dissipates like a massive wave of relaxation."
14521,Last year she started having bad anxiety and depression and her GP took her off Lexapro and tried several different meds.
14522,"Update: called my doctor, was advised to stop taking the meds and drink lots of water to get it out of my system."
14523,"I'm not on medication yet but I soon might be, so any advice for dealing with the first week or so?"
14524,"(Also, I'm not an any medication except Xanax, which I take as needed.)"
14525,I'm going to start off by explaining my purpose for posting this.
14526,"I really need some advice or input, and I would really appreciate it if anybody who has experienced something similar to me could help me out."
14527,"When I was younger and life was more simple, I was able to ""sweep my problems under the rug"" so to speak, but as I've gotten older and my life has become more demanding, I feel like my mind simply isn't compatible for living in this society."
14528,"I've posted bits and pieces of my issues before, but never my whole story."
14529,I really want to just get everything off of my chest and hopefully someone can offer some help.
14530,"I know this is going to be long, but it would *really* mean a lot to me if you could read it."
14531,Ever since I was very young I've always exhibited signs of someone with anxiety and depression.
14532,"I was *very* shy, and extremely self conscious."
14533,"I started having avoidance behaviors around pre-school, where I began avoiding a few camps or activities that I didn't want to participate in."
14534,"Looking back I was always pretty nervous, but I didn't understand that it wasn't normal."
14535,"I was also always extremely sensitive to sensations I would experience in my body (nausea, dizziness, etc.)."
14536,At this point my parents just assumed that I was a typical annoying little kid.
14537,The next thing that I think is significant to recount is when in 3rd grade I vomited on the playground during recess.
14538,"I was running around fine one minute, and the next minute I felt sick to my stomach and layed down and threw up."
14539,"The playground clerks brought me to the nurse, and my third grade teacher came into the nurses office clearly pretty angry, demanding that I explain to her where I threw up so they could clean it up."
14540,(keep in mind I was very shy and sensitive).
14541,I was so embarrassed that I didn't know what to say.
14542,"I'm not 100 percent sure if this is relevant, just including details."
14543,"The next event was in fourth grade, when I got a lead role in the school musical that everyone participated in."
14544,"Before the big show, I was at home and I felt super ill."
14545,"I now realize this was basically a panic attack, but at the time I thought it was the flu or something."
14546,"I was dizzy, sweating, and very nauseous."
14547,I think I even threw up in my toilet.
14548,I was deathly afraid I would vomit in front of my whole class and the audience.
14549,I was crying and my parents almost called my teacher and told them I couldn't make it.
14550,I managed to suffer through it but it was mentally painful and terrifying.
14551,Every second was torture to me.
14552,"Next, a few different things began to happen."
14553,"The summer before fifth grade was an extremely hot summer, and I vomited a handful of times due to heat."
14554,"I would also begin to feel super nauseous if i ate until I was full (this wouldn't happen at home), and after I ate in a restaurant I would need to go outside for fresh air, sometimes I even threw up."
14555,"Also, I would be car sick occasionally."
14556,"If a friend asked me to go somewhere that required a car ride, I would be super anxious."
14557,I would even need to bring a plastic bag in pocket... just in case.
14558,Now comes fifth grade.
14559,The first day of fifth grade I was extremely anxious.
14560,"I was never nervous about school before, but this day I was."
14561,I suffered through the entire day feeling panicky and anxious (much like I did during my school musical).
14562,The morning before the second day is when I had my first definite panic attack.
14563,Nothing you could do could force me onto that school bus.
14564,I couldn't breathe.
14565,My heart was racing and I felt completely sick to my stomach.
14566,My mom brought me to the hospital and I was prescribed some anti nausea medicine (wish I would remember the name) and a benzodiazepine.
14567,"I was able to return to school (still with a lot of anxiety, but I made it.)"
14568,"Once middle school came around, another factor began to come into play besides just vomiting."
14569,I was always uncomfortable at sleepover due to being sensitive etc.
14570,"My best childhood friend was one year older than me, and a bit more mature."
14571,"He was always pressuring me to do things I wasn't comfortable with (not sexually or anything like that, just like sneaking out and drinking alcohol.)"
14572,"I would also always wake up way before my friends, and lay awake for hours waiting for them to wake up."
14573,Often when I would wake up I would feel anxious and sick from lack of sleep.
14574,This led to me hating sleepovers from an early age.
14575,As I got older I began to avoid more and more social opportunities to my anxiety.
14576,"I avoided sleepovers, overnight camps and stuff like that."
14577,My avoidance just got worse and worse.
14578,Throughout this time I was seeing many different counselors/psychiatrists and I also tried different medicines and stuff like that.
14579,"During high school I wasn't able to get my license because I would get to nervous, and in turn I was unable to get a job."
14580,I still didn't have sleepovers.
14581,"All of my peers were driving/working a job, and I did neither."
14582,"I was getting good grades, however, so I was able to convince myself everything would be ok."
14583,"Unfortunately, because of how far I was behind my peers, I began to develop pretty bad depression."
14584,I thought of suicide often and slept all the time.
14585,"I was able to get into the college of my choice, and after talking with the school I was able to secure a single dorm room."
14586,"I thought I would be able to go, but deep down I was worried my anxiety would get int the way."
14587,If I couldn't have sleepovers how could I move away?
14588,"I managed to get an orientation date that didn't require the overnight component that most of the dates did, but even then I was incredibly anxious and panicking throughout the entire thing."
14589,At this time I realized that I wouldn't be able to go.
14590,And withdrew my admission.
14591,I decided I would spend a semester catching up with my peers and do a semester at a community college and then transfer back.
14592,I was finally able to get my license.
14593,But that was it.
14594,So that brings us to where we are now.
14595,"I start community college in a week or two and I'm not to nervous about that, but despite seeing two therapists during these weeks that I haven't been at school, I still haven't been able to have sleepovers."
14596,I still feel super anxious/panicky/nauseous in situations in which i'm not comfortable or farmiliar.
14597,I'm missing out on so much of life that my friends are enjoying and it's killing.
14598,I would be lying if I said I didn't think about suicide almost every day.
14599,I just want to be able to enjoy life and not be held back like this.
14600,"Eventually I'm going to need a job and face life, and I just don't know if this will be possible."
14601,**TL;DR:** anxiety my whole life.
14602,Mostly centering around vomiting.
14603,I can't have sleepovers and this led to a lot of depression.
14604,Any responses would mean the world to me.
14605,"I've been dealing with some severe anxiety and depression for a while now, after being on disability for about a year now I have recently made a return to work."
14606,"While everything is going well there, I had to call in today due to anxiety being too much for me to deal with today."
14607,"Now my issue is that I have these constant thoughts of feeling guilty about not being able to go in, and can't quite get it out of my mind, how do you guys deal with these feelings?"
14608,"As a side note I am taking medications and seeing a therapist, and they are helping me wonderfully."
14609,Just today was one of those days where my mind did not want me to do anything today.
14610,Is it common for those who have made great progress with overcoming anxiety and depression to just have bad days?
14611,"In the 3 days before this one, I will be blunt when I say this: I wanted to die so badly, I was in no risk of killing myself, I was afraid of living but also afraid of dying even more and now every morning as soon as I wake up I'm anxious, I take my Prozac and anti-anxiety medication, my anti anxiety medication sedates me and makes me so tired that I could pass out if I wanted to, but its better than driving myself up the wall with my anxiety."
14612,"Even with my medication in me, I still feel so scared, scared that I will want to end it all one day, or that I won't survive another anxiety attack and I know my fears are irrational, I know that these mental illnesses lie through their teeth and I am still so scared that I will break again, so in my junior year of high school after I couldn't take the pressure anymore after I was stressing myself, I just stopped going and my mom agreed, if I could tell you my whole story behind all this: all you have to do is ask."
14613,"I've been on meds for around two years now, taking prozac, lexapro, and now currently taking zoloft - all low doses."
14614,"I'm not depressed, never had any anxiety, or taken any medication for mental health."
14615,"I have been off the therapist's couch for years now, and off my meds for the same - I thought I was better."
14616,I am not yet on medication.
14617,I've been avoiding the medication route for a while and I've been thinking of going back to therapy but I just find it odd that I can feel fine for an hour or so and all of a sudden I'm flooded with a few seconds of anxiety and panic.
14618,EDIT: Sounds like not unethical but probably too weird-alternative-medicine-y and not normal-medicine-y enough for me.
14619,I've been avoiding medication because I'm afraid it will impact my performance running or exercising.
14620,I scheduled an appointment with my doctor for Monday because I may just give in and start medication and therapy like he suggested.
14621,You might need meds If you are so worked up (like I was) that you can't function or think straight you got to get your anxiety to a point were you can function so you can help yourself.
14622,I have tried all kinds to cure my anxiety and get off meds you name it I probably tried it.
14623,"It cost me over $100 to go see her, I just got a bill in the mail for 88 for the labs and my remaining balance, AND I have the emergency room bill to deal with from when I took the meds she prescribed me and (of course) had a panic attack because I felt weird after taking them."
14624,My psychologist says that medicine and therapy are not needed anymore in my case which I am thankful for.
14625,I have struggled with anxiety all of my life and dealt with panic attacks since age 14 (I'm now 26).
14626,"I began medicinal therapy with a psychiatrist about a year ago, and I am prescribed Paxil, Ativan and Clonazepam."
14627,"Clinically speaking, I have ""chronic severe anxiety"" and ""panic disorder."""
14628,"If anything, it seems as though the medications make the anxiety worse."
14629,I am constantly worried about the meds that I am taking.
14630,"They make me dull and depressed, when I have never struggled with depression before."
14631,"I know a lot of you will suggest ""take different meds,""  maybe ""find a new therapist,"" and of course, I will stop taking these things safely and under supervision... 

What I am really looking for are ways/techniques you might have for lessening severe anxiety?"
14632,"Working out daily helps me, but I know it won't be enough."
14633,Thank you so much for your help with this!
14634,"Edit:  I just graduated law school and I am working for a law firm, so any sort of ""coping at work"" methods would be appreciated greatly."
14635,"For some, medication is a great way to get a handle on it, for others, it may be some sort of therapy."
14636,im not taking any meds nor am i seeing any kind of doctor.
14637,"On a note I never looked for doctor's help, not on meds either."
14638,"I read this subreddit, depression and getmotivated daily, that is my medication."
14639,I will be taking sleeping medication tonight so tomorrow I will feel slightly better but at this point in time I feel like I'm going to puke.
14640,Am I going to have to increase my meds?
14641,I wish I had known this before I started medication.
14642,"For the past couple of days my tongue has been going numb, usually right after taking my meds."
14643,"I'm not interested in medication, but I've wanted to start mediating with my roommate."
14644,"Latuda is also a very new (last two years) medication on the market, so I just think its a strange route to take for just anxiety."
14645,I've been on a ton of meds and none of them have ever done anything to help.
14646,I switched up my medication a few months ago from 3 meds to 2 because I didn't want to be on so many prescriptions.
14647,I have had many fears and now been on different meds.
14648,I want to start journaling my medication usage since it is as needed.
14649,"Background: I've been doing the anxiety/depression tango for about 10 years, with meds &amp; therapy &amp; the whole shebang, &amp; as of about a year ago I felt like I got to a good place."
14650,"I've taken meds for it that have only put me into a fake, hazy life which leaves me feeling empty and has ruined relationships."
14651,I have quit all meds and my depression (also been dealing with since childhood wtf?)
14652,So I am now almost 2 months off Pristiq (100mg each day for 2 years) and completely off all Anti-Anxiety meds for almost the same amount of time.
14653,None of my doctors or the Psychiatrists ever suggested this could be a side-effect and it was always treated with additional medication or therapy.
14654,"Not that I didnt feel like I needed help, but for me the side effects ended up more harmful than not taking the meds."
14655,"I dont think it will ever go away or be cured, but I want to learn to live without needing to rely or meds to survive."
14656,"I had a really bad allergic reaction to some of the medication a few days ago which labored my breathing, but now it's all good."
14657,Its been really bad for the past few days.
14658,"It feels like my mind is all hazy, my thoughts are empty, I cant feel emotion."
14659,I just feel completely absent minded and dumbed down from whatever is going on inside.
14660,"Meditation sorta helps, but it can be really hard to do in this state."
14661,"I choose not to take pills, ive taken them before later rebelling against psychiatry due to not getting the proper support while seeing a psychiatrist."
14662,Ok so this may turn into more of a rant...
14663,I was on meds for anxiety for a year.
14664,"It was a very strong med, an a-typical antipsychotic called Zyprexa to be precise."
14665,The drug really really effected my mind in a negative way for the year I was on it.
14666,"It basically took a smart brain, and turned it too mush."
14667,My thinking has not been the same since.
14668,I went off that drug after deciding to go the naturalistic approach.
14669,Vitamins and  Minerals fully dosed.
14670,"As you all or most of you probably know, medications have withdrawals."
14671,"Well I have been off that drug since June 25th, 2011."
14672,"Things sort of gradually got better, and my anxiety is not as constant."
14673,But I have been left with these symptoms that come and go.
14674,Symptoms being chest anxiety and BRAIN FOG!
14675,which I believe the mental confusion now causes these physical anxiety symptoms.
14676,I have been through hell.
14677,"That withdrawal felt like an eternity, it went on for over a year, and I may still be experiencing it on and off."
14678,All I know is things have settled down drastically.
14679,"No one really knows how hard it was, I was basically living a near constant panic attack with all these crazy withdrawal symptoms to boot, I would get these weird head aches leaving me in bed for a week!"
14680,"Anyway over the past 3 months or so my mind has been clearing up more often, I just started reading books because I now my anxiety hasnt been so bad."
14681,"But this brain fog keep coming back, and when I start googling what it is I get my self all anxious over it."
14682,"I have tried diets and all sorts of things, the most clairity I had was like a week of light brain fog a month ago."
14683,"It filled me with hope, but then not feeling that well for a couple weeks now, just kind of brings me down and makes me unhappy :(."
14684,"Has anyone here experienced this brain fog, and if so have you ever found a way out?"
14685,Edit:I guess my main anxiety is that I dont know if I will function normally ever again.
14686,i've never been on meds for my anxiety/depression before but with full time uni and work i don't have the time or the energy to do all the stuff my last shrink wanted me to do.
14687,i'm hoping with anti anxiety meds or sedatives the trich will subside.
14688,any advice on if this is a good idea or if any meds are better than others?
14689,"I took Sertraline, 2 anti psych meds and a sleeping medication for 3 years."
14690,"Even my mother (a nurse), couldn't find anything in her reading that really supported using this medicine for something as severe as what I'm experiencing."
14691,"That being said (and since knowledge exists beyond our two brains), I've done the Googling and only found a few in depth accounts of people using this medication to aid their anxiety."
14692,"How should I handle this, when I don't want to take any medication?"
14693,Is there a difference to how someone with ADHD would respond to the meds?
14694,I don't want to switch meds since this is working so well but I can't live with the stomach ache.
14695,"I have always had problems with anxiety but decide to try to hide them and subdue them as best as possible, in order to avoid any medication or my mother forcing some other weird juju on me."
14696,I've gotten medication but it works here and there and want to try something different.
14697,"I heard medication should be the last choice but at this point, I feel like I need the help to be able to function in society."
14698,So she switched my meds.
14699,I wanted off all my meds.
14700,"My SO told me something along the lines of ""You need those meds to function, you can never get off of them, you need them""."
14701,"(which of course didn't help any of the neurological symptoms, because its NOT anxiety)

I'm starting to not even want to tell these doctors that I'm on an anti-anxiety medication, every time I do they automatically blame things on my anxiety."
14702,She takes medication for both.
14703,"I've mostly been able to deal with, if not control my anxiety without medication since I left its grip in my 20s."
14704,"I'm starting to wonder, is it time I seek medication?"
14705,"I don't want to be on Zoloft, I don't need another medication that if I don't take it I'll be a nervous wreck."
14706,"(GF is on Zoloft, when she misses her meds she gets in horrible moods.)"
14707,"Yet I remember her just 6/7 years ago when she was *perfectly fine* and since there was no major trigger, it's obvious the problem is biological (heavy history for that on one side of her family, with a trend of issues popping up mid-20s) and that the meds aren't getting the work done."
14708,"It can't be behavioral therapy because frankly that option has been exhausted, just as commonly prescribed medication has been."
14709,"I've been on anti-depressants before, which is why we decided against trying that route but maybe it'll be different now that I'm on other meds as well?"
14710,I've been on 200 mg of zoloft for awhile with no help.
14711,Then saw a sleep doctor that thought I might be bi polar because of my ability to be able to say up for a few days if I don't take ambien and lots of anxiety.
14712,So when I told my psychiatrist she hesitantly gave me a sample of 20mg of latuda because she didn't think I have bipolar but thought it would help my anxiety and sleep but instead on day two caused me to have a seizure.
14713,A few years ago I had a seizure from Tramadol and so now I'm going to be seeing a neurologist on Thursday to see if I have siezure issues and it wasn't the medication.
14714,I have a new dr now and he double my ambien dosage to 20 mg which in all honestly I'd much rather have something else since I've been taking it for years and it doesn't seem to work but two psychiatrists haven't wanted to take me off it.
14715,I've been switched off latuda to fetzima 20 mg for two days then 40 mg and will see how that does.
14716,"Current Medications:



Morning:

Minocycline 100mg

Clindamycin benzoyl peroxide gel

Sertraline HCL 200mg

Zophran 4mg as needed

Hydrocodon acetaminophen 7.5/ 325 mg as needed

Rabeprazole 20mg
 
Soma 350 mg three times a day because of the muscle pain from my seizure

Evening:

Melentonin 5mg

Durolax 5mg

Super b complex

Ambian 10mg just got uped to 20 mg today

Minocycline 100mg

Rabeprazole 20mg got taken off this because of weight gain and put onto Fetzima 20mg first two days then to 40 mg

Failed medications in the past:

Amitriptyline- gained a lot of weight

Clonidine .01mg

Clonasepan .5 mg

Citalopram 20mg-am

Hydroxyzine hcl 50mg x2/day

All of the meds because of my stomach / anxiety issues."
14717,pyschiatrists/GI specialist have given me tons of medications over the years I honestly haven't even noticed much of a difference.
14718,I looked up these and a lot of them are for things other than anxiety/stomach.
14719,"Even heavy narcotic pills such as ambien, hydro, soma seem to not effect me anymore."
14720,I take like 15 pills a day and feel like its way too much for a 20 year old.
14721,Rant over.
14722,"stomach problems (gastroparesis) stomach pains, acid reflux, throwing up, ect."
14723,"I know this sounds silly, but I worry that the doctor will think I am making everything up and won't help me or consider putting me on medication."
14724,"Hopefully this question is allowed, if not I apologize &amp; please delete."
14725,"I have severe depression &amp; anxiety, for over 10-12 years now."
14726,"I've tried all the depression medications... Zoloft, Wellbutrin, you name it."
14727,"After being their test monkey they finally put me on Klonopin and later Xanax &amp; for the first time in my life I could function like a normal person, my attacks where at a minimum."
14728,"A few years later I had an Opioid addiction, however I eventually decided to get my shit together, found what seemed to be a caring doctor, not a shady cash one or anything."
14729,He put me on Suboxone.
14730,"This is when it was fairly new or they simply didn't know much about it, even the legit ones where OK with it, OK combining it with a Benzodiazepine."
14731,"I was on three, 8mg strips/tabs of Suboxone a day along with three 1mg of Klonopin a day as well then eventually it was Xanax."
14732,"All was fine just up until a few years ago, then doctors everywhere said the combination was too dangerous, etc."
14733,So they cut me of the Xanax cold turkey and kept me on the Suboxone.
14734,"Then he has tried non-Benzodiazepines like Risperdal, Neurontin &amp; Trazodone mixed to try and curb my anxiety/depression."
14735,"It was a nightmare, I'd wake up a zombie."
14736,"I have a family, I have to be alert, functional."
14737,My psychiatrist wanted to make me so tired my anxiety would supposedly decrease.
14738,That's how I saw it.
14739,I tried his method for a long time and just up until recently.
14740,I've been to the ER numerous times with panic attacks.
14741,"I barely leave the house, get racing thoughts, I could go on."
14742,It's not a fun way to live.
14743,Now to the point of all this.
14744,My current psychiatrist will not give me any Benzo (anymore) even though he did for years.
14745,I even offered to go down on my Suboxone dosage drastically.
14746,"He said no Benzos but I'll increase your Suboxone :(  I didn't want to do that, so I had to make a choice, keep suffering or find a way to get back on my Klonopin/Xanax."
14747,I called my PCP and he gave me a script to help me get by.
14748,"However, I told him I was no longer on the Suboxone, I was nervous if I told him I was, that he would not give me Xanax."
14749,"I see my psychiatrist aka ""Suboxone doctor"" this week."
14750,"When I go in to see him, will he be able to look at his computer, maybe a universal program and be able to see that I had a prescription of Xanax filled just a few days ago?"
14751,"I went to a different pharmacy for the Xanax but they used my insurance, same insurance used to fill my Sub script."
14752,So will my insurance see that I filled Suboxone last month and then the Xanax just recently.
14753,I will be drug tested when I go and the Benzos will show up in my system.
14754,I was simply just going to tell him I had some left from my previous ER visit (panic attacks) which is true.
14755,The whole insurance debacle is what concerns me.
14756,When I go in this week will he be able to see that I got a Benzo prescription filled from a different doctor (PCP)?
14757,Or can he only see what he has been giving me over the years?
14758,I'm guessing my insurance will eventually call my psychiatrist to make sure he was OK with the PCP filling a Xanax script?
14759,It sucks I had to do it this way but he was just not willing to work with me and I can't suffer any longer.
14760,I've never abused Benzos just and wasn't some hardcore drug addict.
14761,What do you guys thinks?
14762,I go to regular therapy and take daily medication for all of this but I'm still just overwhelmed.
14763,I'm diagnosed bipolar but in between meds.
14764,"I get a thought... usually about my ex or like an intrusive thought and my heart races and my chest is tight and something feels so very very wrong and I just can't handle anything anymore

I'm seeing a counselor, but I have to see her for like 6 weeks before I can see a psychiatrist for medication, and I'm only on like week 3... fuck

None of my usual coping mechanisms are working, I can't afford cigarettes, I can't sleep..."
14765,"I’ve been on medication for my anxiety before, but I've learnt that all anxiety medication achieves is what's called the “band-aid” effect."
14766,"As long as you take it, it might work for you, but go off it and your anxiety will just start right up again, most often even worse than before you went on the meds."
14767,Coming off my medication caused the worst withdrawal symptoms and it’s not something I will ever put myself through again.
14768,"I told my doctor that I didn't want an SSRI medication, because I didn't want to take something every day."
14769,Where you're looking for somewhat of a longer term anxiety medication that you can take as needed?
14770,That's something that I can't change with medication; I'm going to just have to deal with having trouble with processing for the rest of my life.
14771,"I've recently been switched to new medication (long story short, old psychiatrist pushed a lot of supplements that weren't doing anything rather than taking me off Lexapro) so I really don't know what to expect of myself."
14772,I feel like I need to take that first big step and speak to my GP about medication.
14773,Do you suggest I should see a psychiatrist to potentially get medication?
14774,"I would like to try medication but I'm too afraid to even make an appointment with my doctor, I feel like as soon as I tell them I've been having panic attacks I'm going to trigger one."
14775,Thought this might be of some use to those of you considering/starting medication.
14776,I went about a year with no medicine but then a lot of change happened all at once and I found myself slipping back into a bad anxiety/depression state.
14777,"Granted, it takes time for meds to balance out and become effective."
14778,Any suggestions on medication or therapy?
14779,"I don't have any personal or family history of mental health conditions, other than maybe some very minor attention deficit which I've been able to motivate myself through without medication or therapy."
14780,I'm not opposed to taking medication; in fact I think that short term anxiety prescriptions might be exactly what I need as I think my case is relatively mild compared to what others are experiencing.
14781,How was the first few hours/ days on your meds for the first time?
14782,"I was on three different meds and I felt ok, but I think the thing that made me happiest was my summer trip to the mountains."
14783,Sometime between freshmen and end of sophomore year I had stopped going to the doctor and I stopped taking my meds.
14784,"I was still off meds and therapy, but surprisingly it didn't effect me like it should have."
14785,I couldn't stand taking the meds so I stopped going and taking them all together.
14786,"Thanks to Google, I have read that a few people feel a ""faux"" anxiety attack after taking decongestant medication due to the levels of caffeine and other, for lack of a better word, heart-racing drugs."
14787,"Does anyone else feel this way after they take certain medications for cold/flu/sinus and any advice on how to feel better without feeling ""worse""?"
14788,"I suppose this can go under meds or help, but it's a bit of a rant too."
14789,I'm 22.
14790,About 6 months ago I started having problems with my thyroid that led to increased anxiety.
14791,"Shortly after I had a couple of full blown panic attacks that pretty much controlled my life for a couple of months, as I had to stop going to a couple of classes."
14792,"I went on Lexapro and Clonazepam, which helped a bit, and thought I was fine."
14793,"However, now it's 4 months later."
14794,"My thyroid is fine, but I still have the anxiety."
14795,"I've been constantly nauseous for the last four months or so, and have tried multiple medications for that which haven't worked."
14796,"The nausea has basically been in my chest and throat, which makes me think it might be anxiety related instead of a GERD, but I'd still hope that the anti-nausea medication would help."
14797,"Now, I'm having panic attacks again, which unsurprisingly coincide with the end of my school semester (I have to give presentations and have awful speech anxiety)."
14798,My psychiatrist put me on Brintellix and Clonazepam again after about 5 minutes of listening to me (no idea how he could make a diagnosis that quickly).
14799,"I've tried therapy, but all my therapist did was try to get me to do CBT, breathing exercises, and rationalize my anxiety, all of which I already do without it helping (part of what makes me anxious is that I DO realize it's irrational and still can't do anything about it."
14800,"Basically, I have no idea where to go from here."
14801,"I have no idea how to get rid of the nausea, or how to figure out what's causing it (I can't tell if it's the anxiety, and unfortunately Brintellix can cause nausea)."
14802,I have no idea how to get rid of the anxiety without becoming dependent on Clonazepam (will Brintellix alone do that?).
14803,I have no idea if I'm getting adequate medical care.
14804,"I have no idea if this is something that could be helped with therapy, or even where I'd go to find a therapist."
14805,"Basically, I'm lost, and have no idea where to go from here."
14806,I can feel myself slipping back through the cracks.
14807,i sleep maybe 3/7 days a week.
14808,my body is used to it/can handle it but the mental pain i get from not sleeping and the anxiety and OCD is beginning to take such a toll on me.
14809,"My Family and friends are so worried about me  let alone do i see them anymore (im usually asleep all day,when they are awake all day and asleep when im awake )

ive gone from seeing my closest friend every single day without fail to having not seen her since july/august '14 which has been so tough as we are like twins joined at the hip usually 

my Mum is an insomniac like me - if anything growing up watching my mother go through this is definitely a trigger and reason im like this."
14810,i cant handle it anymore.My  OCD is pulling my mind in every SINGLE GOD DAMN direction constantly and its getting to much.
14811,i refuse pills/ medications due to trying to overdose a few times because it gets to the point where i feel thats i all have as a choice!
14812,i dont know why i cant just switch my mind off like everyone else and fall asleep  but i cant.
14813,its like my switch is broken its just go..go..go all the time .
14814,"i feel myself on the edge of a mental breakdown where il either, not come back from it or end up in Hospital again,



why wont it stop"
14815,I've never taken any medication.
14816,Are you on medication?
14817,i've finally realized i can't control my anxiety through willpower any longer and i want to pursue medication.
14818,or should i just see my GP and tell him about my issues and my desire to start medication?
14819,"Now, I am not taking any medication for it."
14820,Anyway I'm very averse to using medication and try to do things in a more natural way.
14821,Can this be used as a long term medication?
14822,I don't know why but I just stopped taking all my meds and lived my life as a somewhat normal kid.
14823,Can I go about without the medication?
14824,"I tried a different medicine, and after taking it for around a month, it's really kicked in and today I actually went to the store and bought myself something and had no anxiety!"
14825,"It did take 3-4 weeks for the medicine to really kick in though, but it was worth it."
14826,He does have some beta blockers (very low dosage) that he takes every day and also some type of medication that is very similar to xanex that they gave him 10 of that is supposed to last 4 months.
14827,I'm majorly concerned about starting such a medication.
14828,I'm no way doubting my Dr. but why wouldn't therapy be recommended first over medication?
14829,"I was always really against meds, I avoided them at all costs, so I went to see a mindfulness coach."
14830,I got talking on break one day at work about mental illness and one of my co-workers confessed that she suffered and was on meds.
14831,She said that through meditation and prayer she came to peace that medication was the right move for her.
14832,After that day I thought about meds all the time.
14833,"Anyway it's been a week now on the meds and they haven't kicked in, which is expected, but I really feel as if I am finally going to get better."
14834,"Thing is, I want to get the hell off these meds."
14835,"I really want to know what its like to not be on drugs, maybe trying some holistic medicine."
14836,I am starting meds in the next week to help with my anxiety and phobia...so Anxiety and obsessive thoughts is what Im hearing I'll be treated with.
14837,"I ended up taking medication, worked with a psychologist to understand the anxiety instead of just fear it, and can now after a long hard journey say I'm proud and thankful to be for the most part on the other side of the most difficult experience of my life."
14838,Changing meds to target my anxiety problems as opposed to the depression issues.
14839,After being too afraid to try any new meds (in fear that it would trigger more panic) I finally decided to switch to Lexapro...slowly.
14840,"For instance Right now we are currently fighting again, and tonight after i had the first anxiety attack in my life, i had her tell me the only people in her life she wants to stay in her life are her kids, and the reason was because the doctor prescribed her a medicine that is only going to make things worse, and she is fearful she will never get better."
14841,I was diagnosed with social phobia/social anxiety disorder a while back and the anxiety medication only helps to a certain extent.
14842,Is this not a semi quantifiable way to show your improvement (albiet without medication) in your anxiety and depression?
14843,"My girlfriend and her mom really think that I should be on some sort of medication (Xanax or something of the like, my girlfriend has ADHD and takes Concerta for it and she said it changed her life), and my parents don't really want that to happen and they don't really seem to fully understand my problem."
14844,"All I want right now is a game plan, specifically to get some meds to calm down this long-duration panic attack, but since this had to happen on Christmas Eve/Christmas day, there's not any way to even contact someone to begin getting help."
14845,"The side effects however, became more and more pronounced as the months wore on -- excessive sweating and debilitated short-term memory being the two most exasperating ones, which almost could not justify taking medication long term."
14846,"After about two years on Zoloft and Lexapro at any one time, I consulted another psychologist, this time a more therapy-oriented one than the previous doctor who told me that because anxiety/depression is caused by chemical imbalances, it should be rectified using medication."
14847,"I've been on a really low dose these past few months (25mg a day, was 50mg a day for awhile), since I've been pretty intent on stopping medication altogether in the near future."
14848,"Ever since I started medication three years ago, I never really had much problems with nausea if I were on a steady dose."
14849,I know very little about the side effects or success rates of a variety of anxiety medications.
14850,"One of my main concerns is sexual side effects--I have been on anti-depressants (Prozac and Celexa, specifically) in the past and I honestly feel that I have never completely rebounded from their negative sexual side effects."
14851,I really don't want to go down that road again.
14852,"As I only have my own past experiences with two anti-depressants, I think it would be valuable to hear about your personal experiences (good and bad; more good, I hope!)"
14853,with anxiety medications.
14854,I'm pretty anxious about my appointment and coming in with some more background information than what I have (AKA nothing) would leave me in a sounder state of mind.
14855,Thank you!
14856,I am not sure if my anxiety is coming from my work procrastination (I've always had a degree of ADD and struggle to concentrate on things) and I need to resort to a ADD medication such as Adderall to keep myself on task or if my anxiety is causing my procrastination and I need to seek help professionally.
14857,"[Help] I've been on medication before, but of course once things start working I think all's well and go cold turkey on everything (I know this is a bad idea but have never suffered withdrawal symptoms)."
14858,The last time I was on medication was a little over 2 years ago.
14859,This time around I have a new doctor who prescribed klonopin twice daily and I was a little surprised.
14860,I've never thought of klonopin as a drug to take every day- but rather as needed for panic attacks and whatnot.
14861,Can anyone shed some light on your experiences with medications (basically any benzodiazepines) and how I should really be using them?
14862,Can I really take this and go about my life (alcohol included)?
14863,!
14864,"BTW: I refuse to take meds, I took prozac for 2 days and felt completely fucked."
14865,So the past five days I've been having a pretty much continuous anxiety/panic attack.
14866,"Or at least, a constant state of anxiousness with intermittent panic attacks throughout the day (worse at night and in the mornings)."
14867,The center of my panic attacks seem to focus around how sudden and unexpectedly they began.
14868,"In my mind, there was no apparent trigger."
14869,"The night in question that it started, I received the news my grandfather had prostate cancer (he'll be ok though) and it did upset me slightly, but I was more or less optimistic about it."
14870,"That same night my brother and I had a deep life-conversation about things which I already knew or thought about before, but we just hashed them out between us."
14871,"I didn't feel particularly unsettled by either of these things, more about the fact that we had to go visit my grandparents the next day (I have a general anxiety about going out places, and going to my grandparents in particular..."
14872,I just don't like it) but it wasn't anything I hadn't felt/dealt with before.
14873,"That night I kind of thought myself into a panic attack, and started having weird physical symptoms so I freaked out and woke my brother up at 5am."
14874,When I woke up the next morning is when it really began.
14875,I woke up with a sense of fear in the center of my chest that would just no go away.
14876,"I took a crumb of suboxone that my brother had left-over, and it eventually helped me revert back to ""normal""."
14877,I was alright more or less the next day or so until I woke up one morning and had another panic attack.
14878,From then on I've had the same pit of fear in my chest that will not go away no matter what.
14879,It's causing me physical symptoms like nausea and diarrhea and headaches.
14880,I have small to medium panic attacks throughout the day (once again worse at night/in the morning).
14881,I went to the emergency room on Saturday and took a dose of seroquel and zoloft.
14882,I had also gotten a single pill of..some anti-anxiety medicine from my uncle xylo..zensi something I don't remember.
14883,It pretty much just knocked me out.
14884,"However, I woke up the next morning in full-on panic attack."
14885,My body felt like it was on fire and I was just spazzing out.
14886,"I went with my mother to see a general health physician earlier today (it's 3am now for me) and she told me to keep taking the seroquel, zoloft."
14887,She also prescribed metformin and vitam-D because I am overweight and have PCOS.
14888,"However, we were not able to afford the $400 prescription for seroquel, and I have no insurance."
14889,"So she told me to just not take that, but to take everything else."
14890,The pharmacy was out of vitamin-d so pretty much all i had to cope with tonight was a single zoloft.
14891,I had a few medium panic attacks before bed until I was finally able to conk myself out at around 10:30ish.
14892,I woke in panic at around 2am and it's almost like my body just senses it's in danger and won't stop reacting like I'm in danger 24/7.
14893,"I feel like my head is going to break, and I'm just going to go fucking insane every time I let myself think that this isn't going to stop and I'm going to have to live like this forever."
14894,"When I can redirect my thoughts, I'm more or less just a zombie."
14895,Not enjoying anything or wanting to do anything.
14896,I can't bring myself to laugh or even cry when I'm panicking.
14897,"At first I felt like I just wanted to sleep it away, but now I'm even anxious about sleeping because I'm afraid I'll wake up to a panic attack."
14898,"I guess I'm here just to try and calm myself down some more by talking it out, and researching a bit."
14899,It's helped for now even though I have that ever-present anxious knot in my chest/stomach.
14900,"I know medicines effect people differently but, does anyone have anything good to say about Zoloft?"
14901,I know it increases nervousness and anxiety for a bit when you start taking it (hurray?..)
14902,but it's supposed to eventually help you to cope.
14903,I'm pretty much just pissed and frustrated and scared.
14904,This has never happened to me before..
14905,"I mean I've had little anxiety that had reasons, and one panic attack that also had a reason years ago."
14906,This just came out of nowhere and is powerful enough to make me think im going coocoo.
14907,"I try not to think of this that much since no matter how it started or why, it's here now and I need to find a way to make it through."
14908,I was on a medication for it for a while but my symptoms regressed for a while and I stopped taking it.
14909,"I never took any medication for it, but I do take a ton other medication for Crohn's that I was diagnosed with last year."
14910,I'm just wondering if there is anyone else like me who doesn't want to take meds for their anxiety?
14911,TLDR is at the bottom.
14912,Hello R/Anxiety.
14913,I am a 29/M.
14914,Thank you to anyone who reads this and responds.
14915,"Let me start by saying I have been to multiple doctors; had blood work, EKG's, chest X-Rays, Stress tests, echo-cardiogram, and many other tests that I requested be done."
14916,"All coming back with ""The tests came back good."
14917,You are perfectly healthy.
14918,"It's just anxiety."""
14919,"So of course, why would I be worried right?"
14920,"I honestly have no idea but let me explain my daily experience, and i'm curious if anyone else has ever experienced this in their life...

Once I was told that I had anxiety and that it was what was causing my muscle spasms, full body muscle twitching, etc.."
14921,I was put on the generic of Zoloft (Sertraline).
14922,I started at 50MG and eventually went up to 100MG.
14923,"After months of taking it, the symptoms all seemed to go away but I couldn't decide if it was just a coincidence and or the medicine really worked."
14924,The Sertraline started to affect my relationship because either I would go for hours in the bedroom and not be able to orgasm.
14925,Or I would just get soft during sex.
14926,And it was happening all the time.
14927,"So, since i felt good and had no symptoms, I slowly tappered off the sertraline."
14928,"Once i was off of it I was hitting the gym twice a day, losing a lot of weight, eating healthy and just feeling very good about my life.. Like i had won the battle!"
14929,I was perfect for about a year and a half and then BAM.
14930,"I woke up the morning after my birthday with constant muscle spasms in my arms, legs, and even chest muscles."
14931,"I ignored it and laughed and said ""I am not letting you come back to haunt me."""
14932,"And i went about my day, no pain, no worrying, nothing."
14933,The twitches went on through out the day but chalked it up to just something that happens and would go away.
14934,"Went to sleep that night, the next day i woke up and the twitches and spasms were even worse!"
14935,"I then got chest pain, my back muscles would spasms and cause short bursts of pain shooting through my body making me freak out for like a second."
14936,"I still told my self ""This is just that anxiety again."
14937,"You will get through it."""
14938,"This went on for two weeks, everyday getting progressively worse."
14939,So I finally called my doctor and made my appointment.
14940,"The doc said I should start back up on the sertraline, I told him what it did to me in the bedroom and he said ""OH!"
14941,Well there are some anxiety meds that won't do that.
14942,"Lets try Cymbalta."""
14943,So he started me on 25MG of cymbalta.
14944,I was taking it everynight at 10pm.
14945,"But everynight i took it, i did not sleep."
14946,"The days were really bad, after no sleep, the muscle spasms and twitches were 10X's worse."
14947,After about a week of no sleep I told the doc I could not possibly make it through the side effects as I used all of my sick time at work and would lose my job if I could not be there the next week.
14948,So I stopped the medicine and three days after stopping I felt great for two days!
14949,Then it all returned.
14950,"I don't know how these muscle spasms, muscle twitching, chest pain, back pain, shortness of breath, feeling spaced out, and all other symptoms could be anxiety when I had no anxiety!"
14951,I just woke up the day after an amazing birthday with all of these body things happening.
14952,I am now three weeks without Cymbalta or any meds at all.
14953,And I do nothing but lay in my bed and go to work.
14954,I barely make it to work because i feel so crappy and like I could die any minute (I now have the anxiety but didn't feel this way the day before i got these symptoms or day of).
14955,I figured if i went long enough with out the meds and just ignoring what is happening that it will all go away...
14956,"It's almost been a month of pure torture, depression, pain, etc."
14957,"All the doctors say I am fine and healthy... Why do I have to choose between a happy sex life or feeling asolutley miserable.... Why can't I feel good and have a good sex life... Now i am just rambling and I apologize...

Has anyone found a combination of medicines that work where you can still have a decent sex life and feel normal?"
14958,I could never do cymbalta again.
14959,It was horrific.
14960,And I need to be able to go to work.
14961,The spasms are really bad today... and so is the chest and back pain.
14962,DAE experience these types of things?
14963,"TLDR: I have really bad muscle spasms and twitches all over my body, chest pain, back pain,short shots of pain in fingers and elsewhere... shortness of breath etc."
14964,Used to be on Sertraline (Zoloft) but it killed my sex life..
14965,Still not sure if my problems are anxiety related...DAE have these?
14966,DAE ever get through it and live a happy life with a good sex life?
14967,Maybe a drug combo that worked for you??
14968,I need something positive... or just help in general.
14969,"Including food, drink and medication."
14970,"My Fiance has an anxiety problem and she takes medication for it, but she still suffers a great deal."
14971,i just toke my meds 10 mins ago.
14972,"The show even has this man committed to a 1 month stay in a mental facility and suspended from his job because his ""anxiety"" caused a severe psychotic break when he went off his meds."
14973,I have been seeing a counselor and I have also seen a doctor who has prescribed me Cipralex starting at 5 mg a day for a week and then 10 mg after that a day- I'm only on day 3 of the medication.
14974,I'm on a huge waiting list for a therapist and tomorrow I'm going to call my doctor and try to get an appointment so he can put me on some meds but that's all I can do and all I want to do is talk to someone but I have no one I can talk to.
14975,I have already tried everything except therapy and medication.
14976,Take medication only if you're considering retraining your mind through CBT/meditation/exposure therapy.
14977,Would medication be of use in such a situation?
14978,"My boyfriend helps me out a lot when things like this happen, but I don’t want to have to rely on him and I don’t want to be prescribed any sort of medication either, which is why I haven’t tried to see a therapist."
14979,"Hey all, I appreciate any advice or input in advance."
14980,"I've got really bad anxiety, I put off getting treatment for a very long time(over 10 years) because it was mostly manageable."
14981,"I finally saw a psychiatrist a few months ago who I think diagnosed me(initially during the first visit, to report to my insurance company) with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, PTSD and mild social anxiety along with depression which we both believe is because of anxiety and how it negatively impacts my life."
14982,"He suggested we start with an SSRI, celexa(citalopram), which caused an awful reaction."
14983,"I only took one half of a pill, I was supposed to take a half pill every day for a week before bumping up to an entire one so I'd adjust better."
14984,"I couldn't eat or sleep for days afterwards, and I was nauseous, extremely irrationally angry at nothing, shaky, etc."
14985,I called up the office and talked to a nurse who would talk to the doctor for me.
14986,"They suggested I just keep taking it, and things would get better in a few weeks."
14987,"I told them it would be impossible, I had to take a day off work because of it and there was no way I'd make even one week on the stuff."
14988,This scared the shit out of me.
14989,How I felt was directly related to the half life of the drug and my system metabolizing it.
14990,"They then recommended I try paxil(paroxetine), another SSRI."
14991,"I told them I really was afraid I'd have a bad reaction again and pretty much said I would really like to have some type of straight anti-anxiety medication in case I had another bad reaction, so I could sleep and to take things down a notch if necessary(I've taken valium and xanax before some minor surgeries, and it helped a ton)."
14992,"I waited to take it, starting on the first day of my weekend so I wouldn't miss work again."
14993,"I again started with a half pill, and I felt a little off."
14994,I didn't take the lorazepam they gave me until day 8 when I took the full dose of the paxil.
14995,I had basically the same reaction except I wasn't angry on it.
14996,"But it made the anxiety and panic a lot worse, also couldn't sleep or eat for a few days after this even with the lorazepam."
14997,I also had a sleepwalking episode one of the first nights I took this.
14998,After the bad reaction I threw both in the garbage too.
14999,I didn't tell the doctor until the follow up appointment.
15000,"I told him about what happened, and the sleepwalking episodes which are really starting to worry me."
15001,He gave me a referral to a neurologist who specializes in sleep disorders.
15002,"I work rotating shifts and my sleep could be a whole lot better, it was bad even before I started working these shifts."
15003,"That appointment isn't for another six weeks though, and the psychiatrist thinks it'd be best to stay off all medications until after the sleep study."
15004,"The only problem is my anxiety is now out of control, I've had constant chest tightness and stomach ache for weeks now in addition to the mental stuff."
15005,I need to get on something before then.
15006,"I told him I was leery of SSRIs after the reactions to the two I tried, he said he doesn't blame me."
15007,"I don't think I can wait the six weeks, my anxiety is completely out of hand."
15008,"I'm almost positive I'll have a breakdown before then, it feels like at any moment everything it's all going to come crashing down."
15009,"It's starting to feel hopeless, even the well tolerated drugs(according to the doc) have only made things much worse."
15010,"The sleepwalking and hopelessness are really scaring me, I went and sold my guns because I don't want them around, I'm afraid I might hurt myself sleepwalking or while awake."
15011,"I'd prefer to not have to use any drugs, but I think I'm beyond the point of that being an option."
15012,I need something for now until I can work through this with therapy.
15013,"I have an appointment with a guy that does CBT and EMDR and schema therapy, but that's also not for a while and I have no idea what to do in the meantime."
15014,"I'd like my sleep stuff taken care of, but I can't wait the six weeks before the initial consultation."
15015,"This has to stop, but I don't know what to do."
15016,"I'd ask for a scrip for benzos, but don't want to be labelled a drug-seeker."
15017,"They'd help, but I don't think it's a good long term strategy to take them due to their addictive quality and relying on them for anxiety relief is probably counter-productive."
15018,But for the short term they might work.
15019,"So I'm kind of in a jam right now, and have no idea what to do."
15020,"Like I said before, any advice is greatly appreciated."
15021,Hey reddit.....
15022,"I don't know what to do an have nowhere to turn with this, but I am currently having a bit of a breakdown."
15023,"For several years, I was dominated by my anxiety."
15024,"I did not leave my apartment, did not socialize at all, I even withdrew from a semester in college."
15025,"My psychoatrist had me on xanax, lithium, zoloft, and focalin."
15026,Had panic attack multiple times a week.
15027,Would literally skip therapy because of panic attacms.
15028,"Fast forward a few months and, well, I got better..... somehow."
15029,I started working out and eating clean and weaned myself off of all of the medications.
15030,I even stopped seeing my therapist.
15031,I blame my diet and inactivity for all of those years of anxiety and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
15032,"In the past 8 months, I have not had a panic attack."
15033,"I sometimes feel down, but am quick to snap back up and there has been no indication that I would regress."
15034,"I have been socializing more, spending time around people every day."
15035,I am friendlier and more likeable.
15036,Everything has been great.
15037,Until today.
15038,"For the past two weeks, I have been feeling anxiety creeping back."
15039,"But, I would spend time around people and hide it, acting outgoing and normal."
15040,"My friends like me now, whereas before people thought I was weird or bitchy and such."
15041,"Needless to say, I don't tell them anything about the anxiety."
15042,I just have been forcing myself to just ignore this feeling I've had knotting up in my belly.
15043,"While out with a friend, though, I started having a panic attack."
15044,"Luckily she was taking me home anyways, so I just hid it and went inside."
15045,"I don't think she noticed, so that is good."
15046,"This panic attack, which lasted about 20 minutes I would guess, was like the flood gates of all these months was released."
15047,"Even after I calmed down, I just started sobbing and have been inconsolable since."
15048,I feel horrible.
15049,And I am so scared.
15050,:( I am so scared that I will go back to how I was before and I can't take that.
15051,I have come too freaking far.
15052,I thought I had gotten out of this cycle.
15053,But I guess there really is no cure.
15054,Tl; dr - First panic attack in months after thinking I'd 'cured' my anxiety.
15055,"No meds, no therapist to talk to, obviously going to a friend is not an option, but I am still upset and crying."
15056,I just needed to get this off my chest to people who would understand.
15057,"Also, i'm still very afraid that its [Serotonin Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome), since i upped medication (Venlafaxine 37.5 to 75) three weeks ago."
15058,"Yes, I'm on medication."
15059,Has anyone had success with the same issue and switching to another medication?
15060,My anxiety is not to the point where I feel that I need to see a therapist or take meds.
15061,I'm abroad for the next few months and will run out of my medication before I return home.
15062,"I've already tired alternating days of not taking my medication to ween myself off of it, but I end up feeling very blue and emotional when I don't take my pill."
15063,"I would give anything in the world not to have to feel like this, the constant worrying &amp; indecision is driving me nuts but at the same time I feel like a counselor wouldn't be able to help and medication would just mask the problem."
15064,"This is hopefully the start of a good thing, with a medication that will actually help."
15065,I guess I'd just love some advice from others who have had to switch medication and if I'm honest a little bit of comfort.
15066,"Let me start by providing my general information based on the ""guidelines and rules"" section of this subreddit: I am 18, female, social anxiety and just anxiety in general."
15067,"I don't have specific triggers, it's just that sometimes I will be sitting there or standing there or sitting at a friend's house, and I will realize I feel really weird and then it turns into a panic attack."
15068,"I'm on antidepressants but no anti-anxiety medicines, I live in the US and I have insurance."
15069,"Anyways, for example right now my head feels weird."
15070,"Not in pain, not lightheaded."
15071,I don't really know how to explain it.
15072,I just have a strange feeling in my head.
15073,I'm wondering if it's a panic attack.
15074,"I have a bottle of water right next to me, but drinking some isn't really helping."
15075,I've eaten plenty today.
15076,"Like I explained above, I have anxiety just in general and social anxiety."
15077,"I ended up going to online school for the last half of my senior year in high school because I just didn't want to go to public school, didn't want to interact."
15078,It made me feel anxious.
15079,"And also, like explained above, my anxiety attacks are strange."
15080,"I'll be sitting there and realize that I feel weird, normally my head has a strange feeling."
15081,"Then I'll start panicking because I feel weird, and it's a whole cycle."
15082,"Also, I'm wondering if I have that thing (I forget what it's called) where I make myself sick because of anxiety or stress."
15083,I just learned about it and it sounds like something that could happen to me.
15084,"Thanks so much for everything, what advice can you give to me about simply calming down?"
15085,"I've gotten a lot better dealing with my anxiety since it caused me to basically drop out of school two years ago, but now I'm on the right medication and have a lot going for me."
15086,Does anyone have experience with swapping meds and the side effects?
15087,"Final question: I have a decent amount of anxiety with taking medication, especially new medication."
15088,I have ADHD and I'm on medication again but my OCD and other problems have been coming into play.
15089,I do take medication at the moment (I don't remember what it is called though :P) but it seems to be doing diddly-squat in my opinion.
15090,He's saying that he wants to kill himself and threatening that he's going to kill himself by overdosing on medication.
15091,"She refuses to take medication, but at this point Reddit, I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this."
15092,"I'm not on medication, and have had these feelings since I was 11 (I'm 16), but this is a whole new beast."
15093,I'm not taking any other cold medicine so I'm not concerned about interactions.
15094,"I guess worst case, he could tell me what cold medication I could take that won't interact with my vyvanse and lexapro..."
15095,I have put off getting on anxiety/depression meds up to this point because I was scared to try.
15096,"I have had little to no success with pharmaceuticals like benzos or anti-depression medication (although I believe it's possible that it's because the doctors didn't really pay attention to me and just kinda threw pills at me; they have given me zoloft in the past and it affected my mood negatively, making me anger easily.)"
15097,"tldr; No luck with doctors or meds in the past, are there any other things I can try?"
15098,"My girlfriend has expressed her sadness that I ""walk around like a zombie and don't feel anything"", so I'm quitting my meds (Lexapro 20mg)."
15099,I now take medication (20mg of Prozac) and go to therapy every two weeks.
15100,"In fact, it's a worse feeling BEFORE I got into therapy and medication."
15101,"I understand its normal to have side effects from new medication, like insomnia and dizziness and nauseas (which I do have as well), but is it normal for your anxiety to increase?"
15102,So im in a bit of a pickle when it comes to my anxiety.
15103,"I guess Il start off with the way my anxiety works, then go into why its hard to combat."
15104,So I wouldn't say I have social anxiety.
15105,"Talking to people is not hard, Im just a bit why in that manner."
15106,My anxiety stems from worry.
15107,"It gets to the point where Il have a panic attack, or close to one, for small things."
15108,For instance recently I had this moderate pain in my leg.
15109,I had at one point heard about this sort of blood clot that has similar systems and I panicked.
15110,I found out the other day I simply had a minor muscle tear.
15111,I over reacted and I do this a lot.
15112,"I cant stand conflict...any chance of any sort of physical conflict and I just go into a panic..breathing really fast, nausea (oh god this is the worst part) and it takes me a while to recover."
15113,"Even now the very few conflicts i've been in sort of ""haunt"" me."
15114,I think of them often and they scare me.
15115,If I take a minute to rationalize I feel a lot better but il just remember them randomly and then Il get a pang of anxiety.
15116,Right now im moving to college and the prospect scares me and im always worrying about that but im moving with friends and I am looking forward to it so it makes it easier.
15117,However my tend to worry and over react to situations is starting to get in the way of me enjoying life and i've been shying away from doing things.
15118,I dont have a problem interacting with people..but I would say im afraid of random people.
15119,"I have no idea what someone will do or say and im constantly worrying I, or someone else, will do something that results in a conflict."
15120,I cant stand even thinking about this.
15121,Now obviously I would love to do something to relieve these feelings.
15122,Heres the problem.
15123,"I have a lot of things depending on my ability to behave normally right now, and I simply wont be able to deal with a lot of the side effects of medications right now."
15124,"To start, Im underweight for my age already..male, 19, and only 110 pounds."
15125,Im going to be trying to gain weight and I cant have medication mess with this.
15126,"In addition, like I said, im going to college and cant have medication screwing with my ability to behave normally in class, or change my sleeping schedule."
15127,Does anybody have any advise?
15128,"I dont know what a doctor will recommend, maybe if anybody knows of specific medications that can help without weight effecting side effects or wont impair my ability to focus in class."
15129,Any advise would be appreciated.
15130,We are going to be getting some money soon for doing renovations to my mom's place and I am thinking about sucking it up and paying my $50 copay and going to my doctor to get some anxiety medicine.
15131,"Normally it's totally under control,i don't need medication i can just get on with life and basically ignore it."
15132,I was wondering if anyone had any experience with ways to help ease anxiety without taking any type of medication or if there are any exercises that anyone has practiced that can help.
15133,"As some one who has shied away from medication for ANYTHING all my life, I feel vulnerable and have no idea what to expect."
15134,"While I do have the medication to stop it before it gets extremely bad (mine are crippling), it just sucks as a college student to feel kind of ostracized when I choose not to drink because I know how fucking bad it's going to be the next day."
15135,"So I told them that I wanted to wake up, but I had taken the anxiety medicine, and it made me tired and groggy, and I wanted to sleep for a while longer (not at 3pm, but the times before then)."
15136,"She told me if it was 7am, I could have woken her up to keep me company, rather than take the medicine."
15137,"She then suggested that if the medicine makes me that tired, to take it before bed every night to help me sleep."
15138,"And making me feel bad throughout the day for sleeping, or telling me I shouldn't have taken the medicine, and then snarkily telling me to take it every night when I said it makes me tired, makes me angry."
15139,"I lived with my parents for the better part of 6 months, went and talked to a counselor regularly, was prescribed meds, and basically pulled my shit together."
15140,I don't think my depression or anxiety are unmanageable without medication so it shouldn't be an issue)
15141,"Anxiety medication definitely helps, but I don't want to be drugged out on benzo's my entire time."
15142,"I have been on medication such as propanalol but it doesn't help, and been to group therapy which hasn't done anything either."
15143,"And I can't shake the thought that I should be able to deal with this on my own, without doctors or meds or emergency rooms."
15144,Yet they took my medication away and isolated me till my mum came to pick me up and told me not to come to school for at least two months.
15145,I just feel like they're punishing me for something that is out of my control and something I'm getting medication and proper help for.
15146,"He has been trying to find the right anxiety medicine this semester, and is currently on his third medication."
15147,I have a vomiting phobia and hate being dizzy/feeling like I'm not in control (so sleeping meds don't feel nice to me).
15148,At the time I didn't understand what it meant and it never directly affected our relationship until he decided to stop his meds overnight.
15149,I am not sure if stopping his meds played a role in what happened next but within a week he started having panic attacks with me.
15150,"I've been dealing with anxiety for a couple years now, and probably one of the worst things for me is that any sort of medication, even ""safe"" OTC stuff, I need to take makes me have a huge panic attack because I think I'll have side effects associated with it."
15151,"It seems like every medication has ""trouble breathing"" in the side effects or ""heart attack and stroke"" and that's about all I need to see to set me off."
15152,"This happens with just about everything, and it is the main reason I decided not to take the meds my doctor prescribed me for anxiety."
15153,I'm currently in my second week of zoloft and I'm wondering whether anyone has had bladder issues taking the medication.
15154,The only thing I could think causing this problem is the medication.
15155,"(29/Male/USA/United Healthcare/No meds currently)

I'm doing some research on therapists in my area (NW Chicago 'burbs) as I've finally reached the point at which I feel it is necessary to address some matters causing me extreme amounts of distress."
15156,"-Whatever meds I may or may not end up on, I would use as a backup plan while focusing on CBT to try to overcome it as best I can."
15157,I don't have any medication as i haven't found a new psychiatrist in this state yet.
15158,"I know it is common while your body adjusts to the medication, but it is getting annoying."
15159,"Ive had many anxiety attacks, Ive taken medication and talked to therapists."
15160,Yesterday was a wonderful day.
15161,"I woke up feeling fine, was happy, not much anxiety to speak of."
15162,"Had a great day of work, was very productive and then worked out after I got home and had dinner."
15163,I went to sleep a little later than normal (11pm) and woke up a little earlier than normal (6:30am).
15164,None of these things are red flags to me and usually don't impact my anxiety well-being.
15165,A little back-story...
15166,"I used to be a healthy, no-anxiety-having athlete."
15167,"I ran half and full marathons, and triathlons."
15168,I weighed 30 pounds less than I do now (180 vs 210).
15169,I was very pleased with my health and felt great overall... couldn't really complain!
15170,This was the fall of 2011.
15171,"Then I started eating crap, drinking soda and in general taking bad care of myself."
15172,I went from working out 5+ times a week to maybe once a week.
15173,"Over the next few years, my fast food, soda, and crap-food intake skyrocketed and my exercise plummeted."
15174,I started putting on weight like it was going out of style.
15175,I started getting winded just climbing a flight of stairs.
15176,Then its fall of 2013...
15177,I had a good summer.
15178,"I got back into running mostly because I had a thing for my female coworker that also wanted to run, and run with me."
15179,She made me happy and I loved spending time with her.
15180,But the problems: she was married and I sat right next to her at work.
15181,"After weeks of agonizing over never being able to tell her how I felt, she opened up to me that she felt the same way, and hasn't been happy in her marriage for at least 2 years."
15182,She ended up getting separated and we started dating pretty seriously.
15183,"From the first second it felt so right, but something also told me it wasn't."
15184,I don't know what that something was.
15185,I started getting increasingly nervous and worried more about things I had never worried about.
15186,"After fall, I stopped running, started eating crap again and gained weight again."
15187,"Things were great in my relationship, but something always felt wrong."
15188,"We started getting intimate, and I was having trouble letting go and totally enjoying it."
15189,"We ended up having sex, it was not good and I started down a spiral of anxiety and worry."
15190,"I had my first full-blown panic attack on January 13th, 2014."
15191,"I went to a doctor, she put me on my medications and gave me a prescription for Xanax in case I had more panic attacks."
15192,"I broke it off with my girlfriend, told her I needed a break and needed to sort things out."
15193,I was a total mess.
15194,"My parents drove over 600 miles to help me cope, so that I had someone close by."
15195,They watched me go through some of the most gut-wrenching torment I've ever had to experience and helped me get through it.
15196,I started going to therapy.
15197,"I didn't like my therapist, but she was at least helping me improve."
15198,After a few visits I started to manage my issues enough to be able to go back to work.
15199,"During this period, my mom cooked."
15200,I ate real food and didn't drink soda.
15201,I started feeling back to normal.
15202,"Then once normal happened, I started back into the habit of crap food and soda."
15203,"I went through 2014 with some of the most stress I've ever had at work, but I was drinking 3-4 20-oz coca colas a day."
15204,"Somehow, I didn't have much, if any, anxiety during this period."
15205,"Then I switched to Coke Zero, thinking I was doing something good for myself, and I also went down to 1-2, occasionally 3 sodas a day."
15206,"I had some caffeine withdrawal, but I could manage."
15207,"After a few months of that, I made a new years resolution to quit drinking soda completely and never have the crap ever again."
15208,"I've had some ups and downs, but I kept drinking on average, the same amount of Coke Zero."
15209,"I read into aspartame and decided I'd cut it out of my diet completely, and I did that Tuesday (my last aspartame was Tuesday morning)."
15210,I switched to a different soda without aspartame and slightly less caffeine.
15211,"I have a plan to wean myself off it by March, and off soda by mid-March."
15212,"That said, I don't know why I'm such a wreck today!"
15213,"I felt great yesterday, I did healthy things and took care of myself and I woke up today feeling miserable."
15214,It's been non-stop anxiety all day today and I'm getting exhausted just having to try to manage it and not let it take over my life.
15215,"Are these just withdrawal symptoms possibly, or is my anxiety worse than I originally thought?"
15216,Is it possible that caffeine made it easier for me to cope with anxiety?
15217,Sorry for the wall of text.
15218,I just want to go back to feeling normal.
15219,tldr; I think my anxiety is mostly fueled by caffeine and aspartame.
15220,"When I was a kid, my parents said sugar free gum really messed with my mood."
15221,Is there anyone else that has had similar behavior/mood changes when drinking diet/no sugar soda or gum?

--------------------------------------

I haven't had a good childhood (physical abuse by dad and emotional abuse by foster parents)
I became severely depressed last year (and still am although I'm taking steps to becoming better) - I'm on SSRI medication (citalopram) and receiving counselling sessions from university (on my third one currently)

I have a lot of anxiety - I feel like I am going to be sick every single day, a feeling in my chest and throat - should I try to force myself to be sick?"
15223,I just read an AMA on someone with panic disorder and someone referred her to here...I think this subreddit is great.
15224,I am 20 years old and in college with Panic Disorder.
15225,I started using xanax .5 instant releases but now I'm on ER Xanax treatment (5-7mg a day).
15226,I haven't had a panic attack in weeks!
15227,"It's amazing what medicines are out there that can help...Be careful with it though, it will be hell to taper off my Rx, it's super addictive."
15228,"Personally (lexapro, kpin, and xanax) have helped me immensely."
15229,Basically I just wanted to say hey.
15230,I might have a few posts coming up as school is usually my trigger for excessive anxiety / panic attacks.
15231,EDIT: It's my reddit birthday!
15232,2 years woo (and yet also sad heh)
15233,"My past experiences have mixed my panic with actual, very real, medical problems -- so it's just so difficult for me to separate reality from anxiety, from medication side effects."
15234,"I know it takes close to a month for the ssri's to kick in, but will talk therapy and the meds help make me normal?"
15235,So the last couple days have been a little stressful and I ended up missing meds a couple days.
15236,I never feel anything when I'm in this medicine.
15237,":(


Now because I skipped meds I feel like shit and my birth control is all messed up I have had like a 3 week long period."
15238,"I feel so trapped in my body, trapped by my gender, by my meds."
15239,If you are finding your medication unhelpful or you can't get a benzo script for emergencies for whatever reason perhaps you could bring up Mirtazapine with your doctor and see what they think.
15240,I feel like meds are my best option to have normal levels of anxiety and not freak out and go back into that hole.
15241,"I was diagnosed with all kinds of clinical shit at 14, but was never on any meds."
15242,Is it possible to completely treat it with meds within a month.
15243,"I know that with anxiety and depression meds, you can sometimes feel numb."
15244,I'm so afraid that I'm ruining his life.
15245,I don't tell him anything about what I go through with the anxiety because he doesn't seem to understand and I don't want to scare him.
15246,I am currently seeking another therapist and was just prescribed new medications.
15247,I can't help thinking about trying to break it off now so that he can live his life without being attached just a mess of crazy.
15248,Is it possible to be with another person who does not have anxiety?
15249,Or just be with someone at all?
15250,I talked to my doctor about coming off of my meds to see where I am without them (always consult your doctor before coming off your meds).
15251,She felt that it was a good idea and then gave me a 9 week plan.
15252,"I take Tegretol (mood stabilizer), Clonazepam (anxiety) and Zoloft (depression/anxiety)."
15253,"Right now I'm into week two, and we're getting rid of Tegretol first."
15254,"I was taking 600mg of Tegretol a day, then 400mg, and now 200mg."
15255,"I guess I'm starting to feel the effects, but I can't be sure."
15256,"I don't know if it's because I may start my period soon (I'm irregular, sorry for the tmi), if this is my low phase...I just don't know."
15257,I'm now realizing that I don't really know what to expect.
15258,I know there is an adjustment period.
15259,"I mean there's one when going on medication, why wouldn't there be one coming off?"
15260,I'm starting to worry if I made the right decision.
15261,"If anyone has any kind of experience with going off medications, could you share your experience?"
15262,"We all react differently to meds, but having some kind of insight may be helpful for me."
15263,Thank you for reading and any advice you can give.
15264,I was on medication for a few months.
15265,"Study: A Comparison of the Exercise Response in Anxiety States and Normal Controls

15266,"And I do take meds, but I'm running out and I can't even make an appointment to get more until I get my insurance card."
15267,"Oh yeah, meds."
15268,"Pretty sure he can prescribe the pain meds that I need as well, which is going to be pretty fantastic."
15269,"So I made a chart that covers 4 major categories related to my anxiety: Sleep, care, medicine, and overall outcomes."
15270,"I note:

Sleep

* Wake time
* Bed time
* Whether I had nightmares (since I have night terrors)

Care

* Meditation (# of minutes)
* Cardio exercise (# of minutes)
* Alcohol (# servings)
* Caffeine (# servings)

Medicine

* Morning medicine (whether I took it, y/n)
* Evening medicine (whether I took it, y/n)
* Ativan (whether I needed it, # taken)

Overall outcomes

* Whether I had any panic attacks (y/n)
* My level of productivity, 1-10
* General overall feelings about the day, 1-10
* Any notes (e.g., if I changed my prescription dosage)

This system is working really well for me right now for a few reasons."
15271,"And when my psych says, ""So how is the new medication working?"""
15272,A promised update on my testosterone shots.
15273,I started them 2 weeks ago this up-and-coming Friday.
15274,So far so good.
15275,I'm not as exhausted all the time and the anxiety/depression has subsided some despite the news that my company is going to transfer me back across state lines.
15276,I have started running again (because I'm not so exhausted) and I feel my overall moods improving.
15277,"Stupidly, I have stopped taking my 2 anxiety medications."
15278,"I know I'm not supposed to, but I am so sick of the way they make me feel."
15279,I believe that I'm better off with the shots and tons of exercise.
15280,I'll update again soon.
15281,Thank you for the support.
15282,"Hello community, I haven't posted here in a long while and I feel like I need to get something out."
15283,Since I came back from my christmas break I have started having more frequent anxiety attacks.
15284,My motivation is close to being completely shot when it comes to school.
15285,In turn it has made my relationship very strained.
15286,This girl has already fought to keep me around 3 times since I have let my anxiety get the better of me and tried to leave her thinking it would solve everything.
15287,I also have fairly bad relationship anxiety as I previous post of mine has stated.
15288,"I have very recently told her that I love her with a return response, but since then I have wanted to throw up."
15289,"I have 2 new medications that I started last night, they are chlordiazepoxide hcl and citalopram hbr."
15290,Can anybody give me any advice on how to handle or any sort of insight on what they think might be happening?
15291,Anybody have those medications before and did you find it helpful?
15292,Thank you for listening.
15293,"After my third, my leadership encouraged me to see a doctor, and get meds."
15294,What are some of the repercussions of taking anxiety medication?
15295,Are anxiety meds an every day regimen or can they be taken as needed?
15296,I started medication and restarted my therapy sessions back in August.
15297,Is this very common?
15298,"First of all I'm seeing a doctor later today, but I'd like some more info."
15299,Basically it feels like I have terrible circulation (I probably do I'm sitting all day).
15300,But one night not long ago I was shaking beyond my control.
15301,Even once I got my heart rate down I was unable to stop.
15302,"It was honestly parkinsons bad, not just twitching."
15303,I locked myself in the bathroom for fear of a parent seeing me and thinking I was smoking crack...it looked that bad.
15304,When deep breathing lowered my heart rate but the shaking WOULD NOT STOP I took a xanax (I have tons of spares but take less than 5-6 times a YEAR because I know its not a real solution) I was able to stop and fall asleep.
15305,"The catch 22 is that if it were a seizure or something, it still would have stopped the shaking."
15306,Since then I've had weird sensations in my right arm and leg.
15307,"I am also really really stressing out about it, so I'm 100% open to the fact that it could be anxiety."
15308,I can't handle how bad my anxiety is lately.
15309,I think about death/disease etc every day of my life without fail.
15310,Also while driving (I LOVE driving and cars etc) I always think of the worst case and feel like I'm always inches away from crashing and dying due to someone cutting me off etc.
15311,"I'm going to get bloodwork done to see if that shows any deficiency or anything first, then from there if I can rule out medical issues I can get focused on treating the anxiety."
15312,"As a kid I must have tried no less than 20 different medications for anxiety, depression, bi-polar etc."
15313,"I've just never felt good mentally, but now it feels much easier to tell it IS anxiety."
15314,Any suggestions on tests to have run while I'm there?
15315,"I'm really not happy with the idea of needing to take an SSRI daily, but at this point I will if that is my only option that will REALLY help."
15316,I want to have my bloodwork done and see if there is anything really standing out.
15317,Anything else I should have checked to help rule stuff out?
15318,"As I'm sure you all know, reading symptoms online is one of the worst ideas ever."
15319,Last night I had myself panicking that I had MS or something.
15320,I need to rule out medical stuff asap (today) so that I can at least put that out of my mind to begin my newly needed jump back into getting well.
15321,"Finally, if everything checks out and I'm just an anxious mess, are there any medications you recommend trying first?"
15322,"I'd much rather fix myself without medication, but I haven't been doing so well without it so far."
15323,I'm also going to start seeing a therapist because this just isn't something I can live with anymore.
15324,It ruins my whole life.
15325,"I take medication for it, albeit, not very strong medicine."
15326,"i can't afford meds or therapy, and i would appreciate any words of wisdom."
15327,***tl;dr*** I finally saw that my medication is working with my anxiety when I didn't freak out over dishes not being put away how I was used to.
15328,"I go to talk therapy every 2 weeks and am on meds, to include Xanax for emergencies."
15329,I'm doing all this from my phone so forgive me typos and grammatical errors please.
15330,I had my first intense panic attack/disorder episode about a year ago.
15331,It came on randomly and I was sent to the er as a result.
15332,I wasn't able to sleep for about five days in a row and began hallucinating at the worst of it.
15333,I'm not sure if it was an average panic attack as the anxiety lasted nonstop for around 10 days.
15334,It was more the fear of fear than anything else.
15335,It was the worst feeling in my life.
15336,I eventually came to after my gp told me that the medicines the er and another nurse practitioner I had seen were way too strong (seroquel) .
15337,It had actually made my attacks worse.
15338,So he said I should be on xanax instead and that it was made specifically for what I was going through.
15339,"Just hearing him say that snapped me out of my anxiety and I was more or less ""cured""."
15340,Ever since then however I'd occasionally get nighttime anxiety.
15341,Never as bad but it was always a struggle to sleep.
15342,I think I was traumatized from not being able to sleep for days and whenever I'd be dozing off I'd get a surge of adrenaline like I was about to be attacked or something and was wide awake afterward.
15343,I didn't even had to take the xanax back then.
15344,Just hearing my gp say that was like the thing I needed to hear.
15345,fastforward a year and I had another semi attack last night.
15346,I was stressed out and got that same horrible anxious knot in my stomach that still hasn't gone away.
15347,I took xanax to help me sleep and it made me tired as hell but as I tried to doze off I just felt that rush if adrenaline trying to wake me up even though the xanax was slightly dulling the feelings.
15348,Needless to say I didn't get any sleep.
15349,I took more xanax and it doesn't seem to be having any effect.
15350,I'm afraid of trying to sleep tonight.
15351,I can't go to a Dr anytime soon as we just moved cities and I'm on medicaid and it takes time.
15352,I will also have to be alone all day tomorrow as my mother has to work and can't get time off since she just started a new job.
15353,I am a social recluse with no friends to take comfort in.
15354,stuck inn a city I don't know with no vehicle and no way to see a new gp.
15355,I am at a loss.
15356,"My husband has an appointment with his MD next week, and he is open, after many conversations, to medication to manage or reduce his anxiety."
15357,"I am reaching out to you all, to gather opinions on medication for anxiety."
15358,"I mean, it's a good thing if the symptoms won't come back as soon as I stop taking the meds, but then I'll probably get stuck in a loop of taking medication until I get to see a therapist and then not being able to talk about anything etc."
15359,There are some things I want you to know about me and my condition.
15360,"I am not necessarily shy, that's not what having a panic disorder is."
15361,I am an outgoing person who often feels trapped inside a wall of fear.
15362,I get really angry sometimes because what I feel like is the real me is trapped behind my anxiety.
15363,I probably want to be affectionate and laid back and fun at any given time but you make me nervous.
15364,"It's not your fault, it's just people- it's nothing you do or did."
15365,I can only become desensitized to people by spending a lot of time with them and even then sometimes it doesn't work.
15366,"Sometimes, with some people, it works right away."
15367,I know that what I'm afraid of isn't real.
15368,"I know that the threat is an illusion and that I'm not really going to get hurt, but my body is telling me otherwise."
15369,"I try to talk myself out of it but ""fight or flight"" is one of the most basic and powerful instincts of the body, and it doesn't always listen."
15370,I am working really hard to combat my anxiety disorder.
15371,"Some days I start to give up because I've been fighting for so long and it doesn't seem to change, or I make progress and then I backslide."
15372,It's inevitable that I get depressed and may not seem to be working to help myself.
15373,Having an anxiety disorder is really hard and I promise I'm doing what I can.
15374,"Much of the fight that goes on with my condition happens inside the head, so while it might not seem like I am trying to help myself, I am."
15375,I am constantly exhausted.
15376,"If your body went through intense terror each day (or sometimes, just from time-to-time) and then crashed, you'd be exhausted too."
15377,I have to make myself move when I am crashing and sometimes I just have to sleep.
15378,"My body doesn't present that as an option; it's just an order- ""You."
15379,Sleep.
15380,"Now""."
15381,Sometimes I don't get things done because I am tired.
15382,"Please don't get mad at me if I don't always do everything I am supposed to do- it can be a real struggle to do little things that most people don't think twice about, like walking into a store, running errands, sometimes even leaving my house."
15383,Some of my behavior might seem pretty odd at times.
15384,"I might make someone go with me to places I ought to be able to go to alone because I need a ""safe"" person there."
15385,"I might come off as clingy and dependent on others, but my reasoning is not what you might assume- ""safe"" people are our anchors to sanity."
15386,"Real or not, we assume we can count on them to help us if we become terrified, and that can make the difference between fleeing a place or being able to stick it out."
15387,"We develop triggers in specific places and that place, as innocuous as it might seem to you, scares me to death."
15388,"I don't want to feel that way; it's embarrassing, but I do."
15389,How would you feel if you were terrified out of your mind in a place or around a person you know is harmless in your heart?
15390,I try many things to combat my anxiety.
15391,"If you've heard about a technique, I've probably heard about it."
15392,"I've tried meditation, yoga, acupuncture, keeping active, positive self-talk, cognitive behavioral therapy, regular therapy, and medication, among things."
15393,I've probably tried lots of different medication.
15394,"Anxiety disorder (and depression, since the two are linked- you'd be depressed if you had an anxiety disorder) often get treated with strong medication, and strong medication has side-effects."
15395,"When I am trying new medications I might be ""off"" and irrational."
15396,"Please forgive me, it's not me, it's the meds."
15397,"Also, some meds make me extra tired or dizzy or any number of other things that aren't my normal or desired state."
15398,"Most medication used to treat anxiety is something the body becomes immune to over time, so the dosage must be increased."
15399,"So, occasionally I may relapse when I am not expecting it."
15400,I don't necessarily know the cause.
15401,Please don't make fun of me when I am experiencing a panic attack- it's horrible enough without you ridiculing me.
15402,You wouldn't be laughing if you were the one whose body was revolting in fear.
15403,"I'm not making anything up, I'm not trying to use panic attacks as an excuse not to do things, and I surely don't want to be a burden on you or effect your life negatively."
15404,Knowing I sometimes am and sometimes do adds to the misery of the condition.
15405,"What I really need is for you to let me hold your hand or your arm tightly at times, and to humor me and just tell me it isn't real and I don't have to be scared, even if it's the millionth time you've said it."
15406,"Tell me you'll protect me and I might just believe you, because I want to so badly."
15407,"I want to be tough and independent and in control, but something (psychological and chemical) inside of me won't let me be free."
15408,"Panic disorders are almost always genetic and are chemically related, though they're often triggered by a traumatic event."
15409,"Before realizing what is happening to us, most panic disorder sufferers go through a terrible period of thinking that we're dying when we're having a panic attack, or that something terrible is about to happen to us, etc."
15410,"It's impossible to understand when it first happens, unless someone is there to warn you."
15411,There usually isn't.
15412,"Many of us live in terror of letting other people know we're freaking out, so while we might seem normal, in control, and calm, our insides are often a different story."
15413,It's ok to tell us we seem stabler or more confident- we'll appreciate you noticing.
15414,"Just know that sometimes it might be an illusion, sometimes true one day but not the next."
15415,"Acting like it's a result of something we didn't do is a double-blow, the first one being our own senses of failure for not being able to just ""tough it out"", ""grin and bear it"" etc."
15416,"Sometimes, just walking into a room by ourselves is the accomplishment of the day."
15417,"Sometimes, we could lead a parade."
15418,"Please, give us the credit for living with something so tough and managing to do anything."
15419,"Please, just support us and help us, and listen to us."
15420,"It's natural to get annoyed sometimes, but if you're annoyed, we're probably beating ourselves up because we're a self-critical lot."
15421,"That's part of how we got this way, by being too self-aware."
15422,"We are trying to win the battle, but some days we just want to give up."
15423,She completely believes it would be more helpful if I ate a piece of tree bark than try some medicine.
15424,"She self diagnosed herself through a combination of Google and WebMD, and won't take medicine for it because that hurts her as well."
15425,"While crying, she begins to say that my anxiety is only because I won't let God and love into my heart, that there is nothing but just the devil trying to trick me into taking meds."
15426,He also suggested what I'm experiencing could be GERD and prescribed a medication to deal with that.
15427,I was in a bad place a few months ago I was constatly going to the bathroom every 15-20 mins but some meds ( amitriptyline) has helped me take control of my life kinda.
15428,I have heard complete horror stories about withdraws from this medication.
15429,In general I've wanted to avoid medication to deal with anxiety right now.
15430,"I'm going to address this question with my therapist next week but for the time being I'd like to ask you because I am desperate for good sleep:

**Tl;dr: Have you taken medication to aid in sleep?"
15431,"I've tried other meds, such as Cymbalta, and they only worked short-term and then made me nutty."
15432,"So, I was wondering if I could ask my doctor at my physical today for my old good meds again."
15433,"I've been off-meds for about a year since they were making me feel numb, and had almost *no* anxiety."
15434,My friend has been on medication for a while and it seems to have helped him.
15435,"I had my medication on me most of the night (it's prescribed twice a day so I took it at the end of dinner) and just having it in my pocket made me feel better because I knew if I felt anxious at any time I had some relief to look forward to 
4."
15436,A bit of background here...
15437,I've been dealing with anxiety for roughly 4-5 years now.
15438,"Nothing too severe, but it made university pretty uncomfortable and affected my participation in class and general social life quite a bit."
15439,"I went to a doctor and was offered medications (ativan, i think), but turned them down because I was told it was dangerous to drink on them and generally didn't want to be on meds."
15440,"I was suggested CBT and tried it for a few months, but it didn't really do anything."
15441,Fast forward to today.
15442,"I've got a great new job, but a big part of it is presenting and I'm afraid my anxiety is going to affect my ability to communicate with clients and coworkers."
15443,"My symptoms are pretty typical, i think...trembling voice, lightheaded/dizziness, increased heart rate, etc."
15444,I'm now considering giving meds a shot.
15445,"Here's what I'm curious about:

* Do I have to take them every day, or could I just take them at specific times when I know I'll need them?"
15446,* Have any of you experienced a change in personality?
15447,"I'm generally happy with who I am, I just don't want to be nervous all the time."
15448,My fear is that I'll become subdued or passive or something.
15449,* Does anyone have any experience drinking on meds?
15450,Is it safe?
15451,I'm suspicious that the doctor's recommendation not to drink was just a precautionary answer.
15452,"I understand this subreddit might be reluctant to provide information regarding meds for ethical reasons, but please know that I'll be consulting a doctor should I decide to take this route, and that I'm just asking for insight into personal experiences to help make this decision."
15453,Any info helps.
15454,Thanks!
15455,"Is there anyone out there with severe anxiety that got onto meds, then dealt with their issues in therapy and were able to return to a normal lifestyle?"
15456,"ie, no meds, no therapy."
15457,"I already have a good few health problems and I don't want something else to be wrong with me, and I definitely don't want to be on medication."
15458,"Seeing a doctor, psychiatrist, and being on 2 meds (Celexa, Xanax) allowed me to barely get by."
15459,"Its been 6 months since the move and I am off all meds, not currently seeing a counselor, and started my own business to keep me focused."
15460,"So I've been seeing a psychiatrist for a couple of months now to treat my adhd, which as been going great."
15461,I don't get anxiety daily anymore but I still have some and my psychiatrist knows this.
15462,"Anyway, while I know my anxiety isn't nearly as bad as a lot of people it is  impacting me in a very scary way."
15463,I get very bad anxiety when I'm being watched.
15464,"I know that's not really unusual, but it's very crippling."
15465,It completely blocks my ability to think and I start panicking.
15466,The last time this happened was when I was doing a driving lesson with my instructor.
15467,I managed to get through the hour without killing us but it was *terrifying*.
15468,"I just felt so nervous and my mind just became blocked, all while I was trying to drive."
15469,"This happens in other situations as well, when I'm expected to do a certain thing and I don't want to fail."
15470,I've had anxiety for years but this is the first time I've felt like it's become a danger to my life.
15471,"Anyway, I'm not really sure if I should bother talking to my psychiatrist about it and just try to suffer through it."
15472,"At first benzos sounded like they would be perfect for me, but after reading more, they sound more terrifying than helpful."
15473,"I know there are other anti-anxiety medications available, but if I'm correct, the ones I know of are all long-acting and take weeks to build up, which I really don't want to do."
15474,The last time I tried a long-acting medication (Intuniv) it was awful and gave me very bad headaches all day.
15475,I know not all would be like that but I'm still turned off by the idea of the medicine being built up in my brain permanently.
15476,"I like being able to know exactly what medication is doing to me, which requires comparing how I feel without it with how I feel on it frequently."
15477,"But if I'm never off it, I couldn't do that."
15478,"Ugh, so I don't know."
15479,Any help would be appreciated
15480,"I have been pushed, and pushed myself to avoid treatment and medication for a very long time, part of that is due to guilt."
15481,"I (19/f) have been dealing with anxiety for quite a few years now, and it can get pretty severe when life gets extra challenging."
15482,"Recently I've had to deal with a lot of family issues (divorce, money probs, etc.)"
15483,and I've been having attacks more often.
15484,"Tonight though I experienced a strange feeling in my upper chest, arms, and head."
15485,"It was a burning sensation like my skin was on fire and at one point felt so hot that it was cold, and then it passed after about a minute."
15486,I'm not sure if this could be a symptom/effect of my anxiety.
15487,After it passed I felt my anxiety flare up but it didn't lead to an attack.
15488,I am not on any medications that would cause this either.
15489,Has anyone else experienced this burning sensation?
15490,?
15491,"For a short time, I was on prescribed medication, which helped."
15492,"for one, my anxiety makes my stomach hurt really bad, so when i leave the house, i take a bunch of diarrhea medicine out of fear of having bathroom problems, and then i take 2 klonopin pills."
15493,"ive also tried depression meds too, like all the basic ones and nothing worked."
15494,I'm going to ask my psychiatrist for a stronger anti-anxiety medicine.
15495,She is very weary to prescribe me any because people with depression tend to abuse anxiety medication.
15496,What medicine or technique do you think would help me get through this?
15497,Is taking medication giving up?
15498,"I don’t medicate myself, because all of the meds leave me extremely drowsy."
15499,"I worry about my Mom, because she has GAD, and has similar allergies to meds too."
15500,"just thought i'd share some of my experiences with therapy, for those of you who are still hesitant to get help."
15501,"this is what the last year has been like, and a little backstory:

**(ages 16-22)**

I've always known I've had problems other than the regular 'angsty teenager/twenty-something' stuff."
15502,"i had a lot of issues surrounding my relationships with almost everyone, especially my girlfriend."
15503,"problems came and went, as did friends along with it."
15504,it was around the time that had my first real job-job that the daily anxiety/erratic behavior started getting worse and more frequent.
15505,"i started counting everything a lot more, paying attention to the way i was walking, the things i touched and organized."
15506,"I had always sorta had the OCD thought in the back of my mind, knowing that a lot of my issues fit into the OCD checklist."
15507,"**(january 2013, age 22)**

I decided to make an appointment to see a psychiatrist."
15508,"I did not really want anything to do with therapy, as i really didn't know much about it and thought all of my problems could be solved by drugs alone."
15509,"I was somewhat scared to have to open up to a stranger about my problems, but also somewhat excited to tell my story free of judgement and to somebody who has dealt with this kind of stuff."
15510,"my first appointment was not what i was expecting at all, it was very formal and the questions were asked somewhat bluntly."
15511,i expected to get some feedback and not be prescribed anything.
15512,i was immediately put on ativan and remeron to help curb anxiety and depression.
15513,"she wanted to put me onto an SSRI but i did not want to at the time, as i was aware of all the side effects."
15514,"**(april 2013)**

things went well for a while, i was finally sleeping well, my anxiety was definitely lower initially."
15515,"i was officially diagnosed with OCD, MDD, and GAD at this point."
15516,after a couple months of this i had a very serious encounter with my boss at work.
15517,i felt drowsy one morning and she had said in a room full of people 'you look like you're on drugs'.
15518,i lost all control of everything.
15519,"i was having rolling panic attacks, i stopped going to work, and the 'sorta ocd things' went into overdrive."
15520,"i stayed up all that night looking through the peep-hole in my door, locking and unlocking the door."
15521,locking...unlocking...locking...unlocking...locking...unlocking.
15522,i had a deathly fear somebody was going to break into my apartment and stab me with a hypodermic needle and rape my girlfriend.
15523,that was when i had enough.
15524,"i went to the doctor the next day, started on an SSRI, and signed up for Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy."
15525,"I wanted CBT because i wanted more ways to cope with what was going on, rather than the 'touchy-feely' stuff i had painted therapy to be."
15526,"Things weren't immediately better, it probably took 2 or 3 months before the following events took place."
15527,"**(june 2013)**

all of a sudden, one day, i thought to myself 'did i just go up the stairs without thinking about it?'."
15528,"I went into my apartment, saw the (what i consider) mess that my girlfriend had left."
15529,"instead of hopping into cleaning mode, i walked to the living room, sat on the couch and almost broke into tears of happiness."
15530,this was it.
15531,this is how things are supposed to be.
15532,I cherished this time deeply as the best time of my life.
15533,"**(august 2013)**

i was out to dinner with my girlfriend and her mom when i get a text from a friend, who i knew was having issues with depression, drugs, his girlfriend, his family."
15534,"his dad had killed himself earlier in the year, and his girlfriend had broken up with him the day before."
15535,the texts read as a 'goodbye'.
15536,I immediately left the dinner and went to his town in search of him.
15537,i drove for an hour (its a small town) before i started going through the woods near his house.
15538,"i found him, barely conscious, pupils were pinpricks."
15539,"he had (supposedly, he was high so i'll never know) taken 300mg of methadone and 20mg of klonopin(this part i know is kinda iffy but that was his claim)."
15540,I convince him that we should go to the hospital.
15541,he says he wants to go to his house first to get clothes and i oblige.
15542,"while he's searching his house i see him put a LARGE ziplock bag into his backpack, i knew this was more drugs."
15543,"during all of this he increasingly becomes belligerent and eventually refuses to go to the hospital, saying he will live on the streets instead."
15544,"i make one of the hardest decisions i've had to make at that point, i call an ambulance, knowing he will be placed on a 5150 hold."
15545,"his backpack loaded in my car, the cops ask for his stuff."
15546,"already feeling like i betrayed him, i take the drugs out and hide them in my car before handing over the bag."
15547,"i leave his house and finally get a look at the bag, there was mushrooms, cocaine, and what i'm sure was heroine (none of us knew he was this deep in drugs)."
15548,i throw the bag into the first garbage can i can find.
15549,"fastfoward a few days later, i get a phone call from him saying 'where the fuck are my drugs?'"
15550,i tell him i threw them away.
15551,"'that was a thousand dollars worth of drugs, you either better pay up or i'm coming for you'."
15552,"nevermind that he weighs less than a hundred pounds, this threw me for a loop."
15553,"i didn't leave my apartment for days, i started locking and unlocking the door again."
15554,i was so upset with myself because i thought i had lost all of my progress.
15555,i amazingly bounced back fairly quickly.
15556,"he stopped caring about the money or drugs, and we never spoke again."
15557,i was still winning the battle with myself.
15558,"**(december 2013)**

around november i started having problems after i briefly went up in dosage on zoloft, i initially went up because i was somewhat depressed, but had problems with bruxism(jaw clenching)."
15559,"once i went back down i still had the problems and they seemed to be worsening, both depression and jaw clenching."
15560,i felt like i wasn't getting the attention i needed and became fixated that kaiser was sick of me and brushed these problems off.
15561,i decided to try to take things into my own hands and drove myself to the emergency room.
15562,i was seen by a psychologist who somewhat berated me and i didn't really talk to him at all.
15563,i was released a couple hours later with no results.
15564,"the rest of the month was filled with a lot of drama amongst my group of friends, at one point i believe that every friend i had had called me an asshole in all seriousness."
15565,"my depression deepened as i felt more and more alone, less and less loved."
15566,"**(december 31st 2013)**

i tell my psychiatrist about my worsening depressions, somewhat suicidal thoughts and fears of being alone, she suggested i go see the on call psychologist."
15567,I go in and she's very pleasant.
15568,things went well until i felt like she was asking me questions trying to trap me into saying that i was suicidal/a danger to myself.
15569,"i told her i knew what she was doing, and that she was trying to decide if she should put me on a 5150 hold, but i continued to talk to her."
15570,eventually it gets to the point where i ask her 'is there any way i'm leaving on my own fruition today?'.
15571,her pleasant demeanor suddenly got very solemn and the look her face was all i needed to know the answer.
15572,no.
15573,i told her i wasn't going anywhere unless i spoke to my primary psychologist or psychiatrist.
15574,my primary psychologist had 30 minutes before her next appointment and came into the office.
15575,"i was told i should invite my girlfriend in, who was sitting in the car, and she would let her know whats going on."
15576,the two psychologists left the room to fill out the paperwork.
15577,i took 2mg of xanax to prepare me for what was to come next.
15578,the ambulance arrived shortly and i was taken to the emergency room.
15579,i slept in the emergency room for god knows how long(probably a 2 or 3 hours) until i was told i was being transferred to another 'healthcare' facility.
15580,what?
15581,you mean i'm not staying in the hospital until this is over?
15582,i was transferred to a 'psychiatric healthcare center'.
15583,"it was late at night and i was put into a room by myself, after they took my shoes, belt, and the string out of my hoodie."
15584,"although pretty medicated i had a hard time sleeping with all the yelling, crashing, and whatever else was going on in the other rooms."
15585,I woke up in the morning and immediately realized that i did not belong there.
15586,it was exactly like the movie 'manic' (the modern one flew over the cuckoos nest).
15587,i spent the next 2 days begging every person there to let me go home until i was finally released.
15588,"**(january 2nd and on)**

after dealing with all the fallout amongst my family and friends with me being hospitalized, things started to stabilize."
15589,i got back on correct medications and i started feeling better.
15590,"here we are, i still am working on trying to get myself to where i was over the summer or hopefully better."
15591,"i'm not quite there yet, but my psychologist has said i've mad enough progress that i don't need to see her as often anymore, and that's an accomplishment enough for me."
15592,to go as low as i've ever been before to now.
15593,2013 was quite the strange year.
15594,"i left my teeth mark on the barrel of the gun, but i lived through it, and with this post i'm not going to look back at it in any other way than 'i endured and came out a winner'."
15595,"I've been thinking about going to see someone, maybe trying medication.. but I'm afraid because I don't know what to expect."
15596,"I was on medication when I was younger, but my parents took me off it because it made things worse."
15597,I don't want to take any medicine again because of it.
15598,And to see if I can get better allergy medicine.
15599,"I'll be going to my psychiatrist next week to discuss but I would love to hear from you if you experienced similar side effects, or any side effects at all when first starting a medication that then stopped."
15600,"Hey everyone,

I've been a reader of Reddit for a long time and have read many posts like this, never once thinking that I would actually write one myself."
15601,"The Reddit community is incredible, so I figured it was well worth my time to reach out to you fine people."
15602,"Before I begin, here's a quick background."
15603,"I'm 22 year old male, and a rising senior in college."
15604,"As far as medications are concerned, I have been on Lexepro for just over a year now, and am in the middle of a transition to a dosage of 15 mg, up from 10 mg. 

My anxiety started with a panic attack of sorts that I had regarding my mom."
15605,"I was on my way to work one day, my head still in a fuzz of sorts from just waking up."
15606,"This event happened just over a month ago (which gives you an idea of how long I have been dealing with this), but from what I remember, I was extremely annoyed/pissed at running late for work, so I wasn't in the best mood."
15607,"My thoughts went to my mom, and I thought to myself that I didnt love her."
15608,"Naturally, there was strong mental pushback on my part, and this spun itself off to a full blown anxiety attack of sorts."
15609,"Fast forward 1 month and here is my life today:

I consistently wonder if I love my family members each and every time I am around one of them

Being around my mom and dad makes me horribly anxious

In order to get these thoughts out of my brain, my mind forces me to conclude that I don't love my family members."
15610,"My questions that I have to anyone out there reading this, is what is going on with me?"
15611,Is this a new normal that I will be saddled with for a long time?
15612,"Any advice, insight is helpful."
15613,Thanks guys.
15614,tl;dr: Relationship anxiety has caused me to distance myself from my family.
15615,Edit: Grammar
15616,"I REALLY want to try medication but the last time i did, it sent my anxiety through the roof, almost to the point of suicide so i dont really want to take that route again...

thanks"
15617,"Anyway, I'm starting my first meds tomorrow."
15618,"I've done all of the ""normal"" stuff... medication, therapy, etc and while it's definitely helped, I'd still constantly have anxiety and panic attacks, although not as severe."
15619,"I started on Hydroxyzine about two weeks ago, I'm supposed to take it ""as needed"" which for me is about twice a week, sometimes more."
15620,"Since it's ""as needed"" I figured it would be the type of medication that is supposed to help me when I need it."
15621,"In other words, I take it the days that I am feeling anxiety."
15622,"Maybe I haven't tried it long enough, but so far I have had one day where I had very bad anxiety to the point where I almost had a panic attack again, and this was just about an hour after I had taken another pill."
15623,(I had also taken one that morning).
15624,"I am about to go into the class that I get incredible anxiety in, and I took it this morning as well to see if it helps."
15625,I also don't like that it makes me sleepy on it.
15626,"I noticed it also makes my breathing a bit labored, or my heart, it's weird."
15627,So I was just wondering what you guys take for anxiety.
15628,I'm specifically interested in daily medications.
15629,"I think that would help me out much more than just being on something ""as needed"", unless it's something that actually works, but maybe I haven't tried out Hydroxyzine long enough."
15630,Tips?
15631,Advice?
15632,"fuck, when i first went off the meds after withdrawals i was scared to sit in the living room."
15633,"anyways if you trying to figure out if xanax or medication is for you, please for the love of anything, do research or try and tough it out!"
15634,I am in between changing medications and am having serious anxiety attacks.
15635,I have had a long time history with this but these times are worse and I fear it may be ruining my marriage.
15636,I have no self esteem due to this and just feel like it's only a matter of time before my wife leaves me.
15637,What makes things worse is that she has a guy friend of the family who is a normal person (ie.
15638,no anxiety).
15639,I'm afraid she looks at him and thinks what life could be like with a normal man.
15640,I have talked to my wife and she assured me she has no plans on leaving me.
15641,It is difficult to deal with sometimes but I'm her husband and she wants to support me getting help.
15642,I suppose this is just irrational thoughts caused by the anxiety.
15643,I am currently on Buspar and the occasional klonopin(trying to come off).
15644,On top of all this I developed erection problems.
15645,Fuck me this sucks.
15646,I suppose life could be much worse.
15647,"I know I would like to see a therapist, but should I get any sort of medication?"
15648,"I don't take any medication whatsoever for anything and I've never seen a therapist, but I'm heavily considering it."
15649,I think I'm just too embarrassed to tell her it's because of medication I'm taking.
15650,"   So I have been suffering from severe anxiety, and ocd since I was 17."
15651,"I have always had anxiety, but it all started to get worse tords the end of highschool."
15652,"I had a breakdown when I was 18 , severre ocd rituals etc."
15653,"I have now conqured the Ocd, but have anxiety."
15654,"I am now 21 years of age, and deeply interested into getting into College."
15655,People tell me that I am brilliant and can do very well in life.
15656,"The problem is, is no matter what happens I can not overcome my illness."
15657,"I have tried 10 medications (all of which didnt help, and caused me to be sleepy, or unmotivated)."
15658,"I have also tried therapy, as well as different approaches to conquere my anxiety: Like, Meditation, Breathing excercises, Healthy Eating, and lots of working out and running, none of which has worked."
15659,"I usually hold down jobs for a few months at a time, and these are non-customer service jobs like landscaping."
15660,"I cant focus, cant talk to people, feel spaced out, physically ill (from anxiety, all day."
15661,"I am a very hard worker and everyone tells me that, but people talk to me like I am a child, just because I look like it, because of all the anxiety in my head."
15662,I just dont know what I am going to do anymore.
15663,"I want to have a fulfilling future and the life of my dreams, but cant even get it."
15664,I see all my friends who have basically left me and have become succesful.
15665,"I guess they view me as an embarrasment so they dont want to hang out with me, but why would they?"
15666,"Maybe Im just rambling on and no one can help me, but is there anything im missing that would help me?"
15667,What am I doing wrong?
15668,"I push myself on a daily basis to just get through the day and try, try,try yet I fail."
15669,"I am highly motivated, yet when I am in a group setting like work or school, my anxiety gets so bad I walk out."
15670,I am deeply interested in the natural sciences like Biology and have memerized complete books on the subject.
15671,I know if I beat this anxiety I will be very succesfull.
15672,Its just that its a brick wall.
15673,"I have thought about careers I could do at home, like amazon, etc."
15674,"But I want to be able to live in the ""real world"" and have a life like everyone else."
15675,The medication I take makes me anxious on top of my already bad anxiety.
15676,Like stronger than i've ever had before taking the medication.
15677,I wanna get off the meds and just looking for people with similar symptoms to hear there ways of coping.
15678,IT also has some sexual and shakyness side effects that are making me consider switching but I don't know how to explain why I want to try a new medication to my parents or my doctor.
15679,I've recently started taking anti depressants and anxiety medication though I don't think it's working.
15680,"I stopped taking medication for a while, and now I am going to try it once more as a last-ditch effort."
15681,What meds have you tried?
15682,I've tried most everything but ADD meds/stimulants and I'm curious if they would work for me.
15683,"My brain reacts differently to stimulants, for example cold medicine with sudafed makes me sleepy."
15684,I'll probably see a doctor about it again soon and see if this new information can help him/her figure out what's wrong or I might just straight up ask to give meds a shot and stop if they don't work.
15685,I kinda feel like I'm circling around a pit viper on this.
15686,"I've got a long history of depression and anxiety issues (15+ years) which I've used a couple different methods, but I reached a point a few years back where I didn't have insurance and the cost to treat with prescriptions or talk therapy was just too expensive and I wasn't poor enough to qualify for income based programs."
15687,"I experienced some withdraw effects that really turned me off the idea of returning to medication-based treatment, so the past 5 years I've done a lot of self management."
15688,"But lately I'm noticing that I'm having cycles of panic attacks that degrade into several weeks of depression, even with vigilant watch for triggers."
15689,"Now that I've got insurance again (thank you, ACA) I'm looking at what I need to better take care of myself."
15690,"I've already spoken with my Doctor about the concerns I have with medications again, but their opinion is that there needs to be continual, long-term management in place."
15691,Which is only aggravating me into another fit of anxiety about taking the damn pills to begin with.
15692,"I've been on and off medications (Effexor for 9+ years, Wellbutrin and Trazadone for about 6 months, another round of Effexor after that for a month before I stopped medicating all together) enough to know that when (not if) I come off the next script I'm most likely going to experience side effects."
15693,"Long term or short term, it's just how my body works, it apparently likes the ""brain candy"" too much."
15694,"I've also tried working through extended taper periods, but it doesn't seem to matter how long I take to taper down."
15695,"The last time had been awful enough, my opinion was it outweighed any benefit I found from taking the meds in the first place."
15696,"When I look at the most recent 3 weeks of oral treatment and the 6+ months of ""brain zap"" insanity, I seriously questioned the decision to go for oral meds at that time, or for any time in the subsequent future."
15697,"I hated how I felt, I hated how limited the withdraw effects kept me (because God forbid I turn my head too far, or look a little too far up, or sneeze, or, or, or...) and I hated that when I would think I was clear of the effects it'd crop up out of nowhere again."
15698,"The last thing I promised myself was to never feel like that again, and that's a promise I dearly want to keep."
15699,"I've got a script for Prozac, which is something I haven't tried before, so I don't know how I'll actually take to it."
15700,But the info I'm finding for withdraw effects are conflicting with my Doctor's opinion.
15701,"Drug files say that there can be, Doctor says there is no withdraw effect."
15702,"I know not everyone reacts the same to medications, but there seems to be a rift on the matter."
15703,"I'm fearful that I'll need to change out to something else in the next couple of weeks and I'll have to deal with withdraw for trial and error, or that life is going to up and give me double deuces again and I'll have to pick between meds or rent."
15704,"I'm looking for people who have been, or are in, a similar position to weigh in."
15705,"I figure this has already been asked before, which I'm still sifting through other posts, but I thought maybe there might be some new voices to this."
15706,"- For those who were apprehensive about trying something different after having some bad experiences, what were the point(s) that helped you decide to take, or not take, a script?"
15707,"- For those who have taken Effexor and Prozac, what were your opinions in comparing between the two?"
15708,Either one better or less effective in long term use?
15709,- Any side effects that aren't noted for either script that was a red flag for you?
15710,- Any self-directed questions that helped in your decision?
15711,"Before, it was easier to go along with a script since I was in the middle of a crisis period and I didn't care what happened so long as it won me some kind of reprieve."
15712,"But now that I'm looking at this from a more stable mindset, it's giving me much more to think about since I'm not in immediate need."
15713,"Thanks for commentary, or even just for reading."
15714,"And I don't want to be on a medication, though I've never tried it."
15715,I tell myself that I should be strong enough to fix this inside my own mind and meds are cheating.
15716,"I've been on and off meds for a while, pretty low dose."
15717,I've been able to overcome a lot and now it's time for me to ween off of the medication.
15718,I went to the doctor the next morning because I was feeling the same and all they gave me was medicine to lower blood pressure and sent me on my way.
15719,"The medicine helped bring everything down, but i still had slight chest pains and a dazed feeling."
15720,"Later that night, I was laying down and all of a sudden I had more intense chest pains and my heart rate spiked up, even though I had just taken medication."
15721,when i go outside with my mum i am so ashamed i feel like everyone can tell that she abuses meds and is laughing at her.
15722,Is there anything I should remember to mention or check/ask for when talking about medication?
15723,My therapist suggested these two pills to help with my anxiety and depression.
15724,So I started taking them today.
15725,"No other medications have helped in the past and I've been on Prozac, Zoloft, celexa, a few more and I felt nothing."
15726,6 years of this shit I'm just so done with it.
15727,I'm really hoping these help.
15728,Has any one else taken these before and did they help?
15729,How did they help or did you get bad side effects or anything?
15730,Also I'm a little confused about the dosages.
15731,My doctor is against prescribing medication.
15732,Last night i took 2 instead of 3 because i don't have many pills left and i need to get off this medication because i can't afford to get more.
15733,"Gal just totally made me feel brushed off and ""too sensitive"") or misdiagnose me or offer medication without actually putting their full critical thought into it (so basically I fear them just being on auto-pilot or otherwise not caring or thinking that I am just being dramatic and being lazy with me as a result) or just seeing me as a inconvenient set of boxes to check off."
15734,"I've tried some medication for anxiety and depression (Zoloft, Celexa, Lamictal) but it barely helps."
15735,So I have a friend in high school and she is 17.
15736,She has severe anxiety (social anxiety) and I don't know what to do.
15737,She has had anxiety for a long time but the last 2 years have been very difficult for her.
15738,She skips all her classes.
15739,For weeks.
15740,Sometimes months.
15741,Does not even show up for her exams.
15742,"All of her teachers, the principal and her parents are very worried."
15743,She is very smart and I know she will do so well but her anxiety gets in the way.
15744,I feel bad for her.
15745,She is avoiding everything.
15746,She says she's worried that she won't get all her credits and won't graduate with her fellow peers.
15747,She has failed 4 classes.
15748,She wants to start attending her classes again but she says that as she has rarely been there it's hard for her to go back.
15749,She is really depressed.
15750,"I think she was taking some medicines for it, but she said she stopped taking them because they were getting really expensive."
15751,I don't know how she feels so I don't know what advice to give her.
15752,Please help me out here.
15753,"Also, this is the first Christmas party I've attended that I've actually been on medication for my anxiety and panic - I'm on 20mg of Cipralex and I've been told to take two 0.5mg of Clonazepam a day."
15754,I know that alcohol isn't supposed to be good for mixing medication and anxiety... but is it safe?
15755,"I stopped for awhile, out of sheer willpower, but it's started up again recently because of life changes/situations and my medication starting to lose effectiveness."
15756,"My psychiatrist had me up the dosage of the medication (buspirone), which seems to be helping but now the skin biting is back in full force."
15757,"I take a drug that has a rare side effect
	They tell me it will help me sleep through the night
	They tell me that it will calm me down
	They tell me that it will all be okay
		Just take your medicine
	I walk when I am feeling low
	Just to a park around the corner
		It doesn't attract a lot of people
			There are corners I can hide in
				I write there."
15758,"I have tried various forms of self medication and nothing works, Iwould like your advice on what to do so that I may accomplish this task."
15759,"We agreed to try therapy alone first, and that if it wasn't helping she would refer me to someone to talk about medication."
15760,I mention this because I've seen some people here are often worried that getting help means you are going to be put on meds.
15761,"Meds are incredibly helpful for some people, but the worry about having to take meds should not keep you from asking for help!"
15762,"I've taken meds, I've had therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and who knows what else."
15763,anyone ever increase their dose on their meds and have it work for 2 weeks then feel like you are slipping back to your anxiety/depression?
15764,"I believe these drugs like SSRIs are VERY serious medications that should only be used if you're forced into a mental health hospital, literally on the verge of suicide, or after all other forms of healthier treatments have been tried."
15765,Doctors hand these drugs out like candy for any little emotional problem someone has and they fail to tell you that these drugs can cause permanent side effects.
15766,"Honestly, I think SSRIs cause permanent brain changes."
15767,"They erase all your emotions and sexuality, sometimes permanently even after a few doses (it happened to me)."
15768,All from a 15 second conversation I had with a general practitioner asking about mild anxiety.
15769,"In fact, why are general practitioners allowed to prescribe psych meds?"
15770,That should be illegal.
15771,"I only had anxiety before and was never depressed, but I am now."
15772,Mind blowing how something called an anti-depressant caused my depression.
15773,I don't like that name for these medications.
15774,I know some people say they love their anti-depressant and they should if they really absolutely needed it.
15775,Those are the people that should get them.
15776,"I feel like SSRIs can sometimes take away depression, sadness, and anxiety, but can they also take away your happiness."
15777,"I think people on these drugs ""think"" they are happy only because they don't experience lows anymore."
15778,Which I suppose that can be a fair trade off if all you experience are lows.
15779,"Now, this is just my opinion."
15780,I'm not against these drugs completely.
15781,"I believe they have their uses, but only in much rarer cases than they are now."
15782,I'm amazed at how many people I've met personally that have been on an anti-depressant.
15783,I wonder how many of them really were depressed or anxious enough to get on medication.
15784,"SSRIs are way over prescribed and advertised as being mild, better, less addicting alternatives to Benzodiazepines."
15785,"Yes, Benzos can have withdrawal, but SSRI withdrawal can be just as bad if not worse."
15786,"SSRIs can take away sadness and anxiety yes, but they can also take away love, happiness, motivation, and sex drive permanently."
15787,These pills can make you a functioning zombie.
15788,Like a chemical lobotomy in some cases.
15789,They can delete your humanity.
15790,Its like some people on these medications don't realize whats happened to them and the meds have made it to where they don't really care.
15791,For some its like they don't care about anything anymore.
15792,"Its like these medications are being so over prescribed, that the world may one day be like a dystopian sci-fi novel such as The Giver or the movie Equilibrium."
15793,"Except at least in a move like Equilibrium, once people stopped the medication they got their emotions back."
15794,"For me, I only took a couple of these pills and had a horrible reaction to them 3 years ago."
15795,I have never felt the same since.
15796,"My mind is cloudy, I no longer can feel pleasure anymore, and I have been permanently castrated."
15797,"My brain, body, and genitals all feel numb."
15798,A touch from a woman used to be heavenly and now I feel nothing from it.
15799,I feel distant in conversations and can't connect with people like I used to.
15800,"Alcohol used to give me a happy euphoric feeling, but now I feel nothing from it."
15801,Days go by like a blur it seems now.
15802,Life's littlest pleasures are no longer there anymore.
15803,I can't believe I've lost the beauty of life because of one pill.
15804,I can't believe how happy I was before all this.
15805,It makes me want to cry.
15806,I pray every night that I will some how one day recover.
15807,I blame myself for this.
15808,I sort of asked to be prescribed something.
15809,"And when I was prescribed an SSRI, I should have read up on the it first before taking it, but I believed my doctor when she told me it was a mild medication that takes weeks to notice any effects."
15810,Why wasn't I recommended talk therapy first or just prescribed a low dose benzo?
15811,"Oh yeah, because benzos are ""too harsh and addicting""."
15812,"Which hey they can be, but only if you abuse them."
15813,"For me though, I have regretted that day I took the pill ever since."
15814,I'm wondering if I should write a letter to the FDA requesting that they put more warnings on SSRI medication.
15815,None of the warnings say anything about chances of side effects being permanent.
15816,People need to know this.
15817,I wish I knew this.
15818,The FDA needs to put more control on SSRI distribution.
15819,These meds should not be available to the public from general practitioners and only be available from psychiatrists.
15820,AND only used as last resort treatments!
15821,I expect that pharma companies will not like this and probably pay off the right people to make sure these meds will always be easily accessible for anyone who wants them.
15822,And they will continue to tell doctors and the world that these meds are safe and relatively side effect free.
15823,"I beg if anyone is considering trying an SSRI anti-depressant for anxiety or depression, please try other methods first."
15824,Please.
15825,Try talk therapy.
15826,Try exercise.
15827,Try supplements.
15828,Medication should be your absolute last resort for your depression or anxiety.
15829,"Yes, an SSRI could save your life from depression or anxiety, but be prepared to be changed as a person."
15830,Possibly forever.
15831,"If you're someone with only anxiety, stay away from an SSRI if you can."
15832,Try any of the methods mentioned above first before any medication.
15833,Maybe a try benzo as a last resort before the SSRI last resort.
15834,BUT always ask a doctor before you do anything!
15835,"Also, ask a doctor for things you can try before resorting to medication."
15836,A doctor will absolutely help you with that.
15837,*edit sorry for rant.
15838,I stopped and it took about a week for the meds to wear off and I felt fine.
15839,"We've been spending a lot more time together since I've been on the meds, mostly because I am texting/calling her much more often."
15840,"I hate the idea of going on long-term medication, especially since my depression originally started as situational depression that was made infinitely worse with no reprieve over the course of several months, and became more permanent."
15841,"I was given medication in early middle school, but that's about it."
15842,I went to the doctor this past Monday for help with my high anxiety and panic attacks.
15843,"I talked to her a bit and she suggested therapy, specifically one that specializes in PTSD and social anxiety."
15844,She also suggested a short-term treatment plan and prescribed me Buspirone and Xanax.
15845,It had never occurred to me that I may be suffering from PTSD.
15846,The social anxiety comes to no surprise as I have had problems with this since my youth.
15847,"Though, I have been reading more into it since this came to light and it seems to makes sense."
15848,"Almost exactly eight years ago, post surgery, I developed an infected golf ball sized blood clot in my pelvic region."
15849,I was in the hospital for nearly a month on a host of medications including Morphine drips and Coumadin injections.
15850,"I was given my last rites and told to make a living will, though I was so high on the morphine that I had difficulties even perceiving the severity of the matter."
15851,"Luckily, I had family members who were coherent enough to speak with the hospital staff on my behalf."
15852,They also convinced the hospital to release me to a home nurse.
15853,The doctors decided to insert a PICC Line in my arm which ran to a portable IV pump before I was released.
15854,This ordeal lasted a few more months outside of the hospital before my Hematologist finally released me.
15855,This is also when I ran out of my last prescription of pain medications and it had finally dawned on me what had occurred.
15856,I believe this is the time that the PTSD begin.
15857,"I believe that we all harbor some small degree of thanatophobia in the back of our minds, as it is the great unknown."
15858,"Though, my fear of death is immense, as I had felt it, I tasted it."
15859,"I may sound crazy for this, but as I was lying alone in the post surgery room, before anyone had known that something was awry, this overwhelming feeling suddenly came over me."
15860,"It felt as though there was a high powered magnet hanging over me, my bones were made of metal and were being pulled out of my body at great force."
15861,I remember the nurses panicking when they came back into the room.
15862,"That is all I remember, unfortunately, and I do not know if there is any medical or scientific explanation for what happened as I have never spoken to anyone about it."
15863,"What I do know is that I do not want to feel that feeling again for a very long time, it was absolutely terrifying."
15864,Over the next 8 years I slowly withdrew from everyone that was ever close to me and had great difficulty developing new relationships if it didn't involve alcohol.
15865,I had this heightened sense of awareness of myself and my surroundings.
15866,Any small pain or twitch sent me into full panic mode.
15867,"Anything that just didn't feel ""right"" about my surroundings triggered my ""fight or flight"" instinct."
15868,I also lived with this fear that my blood clot was still there or that it would come back elsewhere.
15869,"Even though a DNA test had proven that it was not hereditary, it was known to have been caused by the surgery."
15870,"It takes so much out of me to even go on a plane trip, I worry that a blood clot is going to travel to my brain or lungs and I will die."
15871,This mixed with my social anxiety condition made for a complete wreck.
15872,"So now, as I sit here with my prescription, I am again in full panic mode."
15873,"I know it is rare to have severe adverse effects from Buspirone, I can't help but stress that I may be one of those rare cases."
15874,"I also worry that it will change me ""too much."""
15875,"Though, after suffering a nervous breakdown about a year ago, my anxiety has been an uncontrollable everyday occurrence."
15876,This has caused me to be a near recluse and fortunately it finally dawned on me that I can no longer go on living in this manner.
15877,I have lost many friends and family members over this and I refuse to let it control me anymore.
15878,My greatest regret is that I had not gotten help sooner.
15879,"I just want myself back, that's all."
15880,"I don't want to be perfect, I just want balance."
15881,"I can only move forward with the hope that this is the beginning of something good, so here goes nothing!"
15882,"Edit: Okay, so I finally decided to take a Xanax tonight while I was in the midst of a full blown panic attack."
15883,"I was prescribed a low dose, 0.25 mg, and I must say it definitely helped calm me down."
15884,"It's not overpowering either, which is exactly what I was looking for."
15885,"Honestly, I have felt way more out of it from a single Benadryl than this."
15886,I just feel very mellow and I'm no longer on edge.
15887,"One thing I have noticed is that I have really bad cottonmouth, but that's no big deal."
15888,"I'm still weary about taking the Buspirone, though."
15889,Still want to do some more research on it and read more personal experiences.
15890,I am also battling a cold so perhaps the cold medicine has an interference?
15891,Bupropion is the ONLY medication out of several that I've tried that have helped me in any way.
15892,No throwaway because really fuck it.
15893,"*All of this is going to be a huge wall of text that will probably be an unfettered stream of thoughts, so the tl;dr is basically I'm anxious about college."
15894,"* 


It's 7:55 am."
15895,I've slept for 14-17 hours of the last 24.
15896,"In almost exactly two weeks, I'll be heading off to college."
15897,"That's how it always has been and always will be, at least as I can see it."
15898,"I will be separated from my family, the one house I've lived in, and my one and only close friend (I would say I have 3 in total, having already lost two others this summer due to one flat out ignoring me for no apparent reason, and another just drifting apart.)"
15899,It's pretty much this or I become a NEET for god knows how long.
15900,"It's not that you can't be successful without college, it's just that this is a fork in the road and those are *my* two options."
15901,"Having received access to my personal bank account two months back I've basically been buying stuff, I think to try to give myself something I can hold onto as I transition into college."
15902,"I've spent $400 of the nearly $3000 of personal, non-college allocated funds."
15903,"I don't know if that's a whole lot or not, the way I look at it if I have a problem or not I've pretty much run out of things I would conceivably want to buy."
15904,"I am on medications, venlafaxine and two pills relating to high blood pressure partially because I like to eat and partially because it's one of the many family curses plaguing my family."
15905,"Having been on a number of meds for anxiety and depression I can say with a lot of certainty that for me the best I'm likely to get is something that'll take the edge off, and this current one seems to do that much."
15906,"I've always been pretty highly suicidal with too low initiative to bother doing anything about it, which is something I've kept from my therapist because I find it difficult to trust anyone I consider 'adult' because of my mother's unintended but very real hover parent nature

I'm generally not happy with myself, my family and the world but I also realize there isn't much I'm entitled to complain about having never bothered to make much of a difference myself."
15907,I think my problem is that I flat out refuse to do anything to better the situations I am in and do not honestly plan to.
15908,I'd like to be able to call myself stoic but that wouldn't be the truth as I tend to start cracking under intense pressure and have a deep love of complaining while never really doing anything about it.
15909,I just look at most of my life as a series of occasionally ironic but generally fairly cruel jokes.
15910,I'm a person obsessed with science so naturally I'd be talented at verbal comprehension and pretty average in mathematics and spatial comprehension.
15911,Or that I'd be born given every chance in life and would grow into a depressive person who thinks it's not good enough.
15912,"It's now 8:23, and I've been listening to the same song for three quarters of an hour and writing this for a half hour."
15913,I'm pretty acutely aware of the fact I've now written a 3000 word non-sequitur that fails to tell a story or really make a point regarding why I posted here in the first place.
15914,"**EDIT: Two things, I guess this is probably more depression than anxiety and I think I do myself a disservice in writing the way I do but every time I try to vent I overly verbose, and in turn overly critical of the fact I'm verbose."
15915,It's turtles all the way down**
15916,I take Zoloft but am not quite sure if I should up my medicine.
15917,"But vicoding makes me think clear, no ache, have motivation, pleasant to be around, I talk to people and smile, I can control food impulses, I can exercise, my mind is CLEAR not FOGGY like other meds, and i actually have a desire to be around people, and my legs dont feel like lead."
15918,Why cant there be an APPROVED medication that does what vicodin does.
15919,"
I have GAD and am a chronic worrier (most likely genetic)."
15920,My anxiety is severe.
15921,I was prescribed medication but I refuse to take it because of its horrible side effects.
15922,The medication prescribed was clonazepam and it has terrible side effects and horrible withdrawal effects.
15923,"Even though it has great ratings, I just spent a year and a half on meds and I don't want to be on them anymore."
15924,"I've tried many natural treatments such as: 

- Mindfulness Meditation (Anxiety is too severe) 

- Passionflower (ineffective) 

- Breathing exercises (Don't help a lot) 

- CBT (ineffective) 

- Exercise (helpful in relaxation but I still have muscle tension.)"
15925,What I am looking for is something natural that I can consume that would help my severe anxiety.
15926,I'm still on the meds but almost off them and I can only consume the natural alternative once I no longer take any meds.
15927,"Note; About Kava, I have seem to have a liver problem that the medications have caused over a year and a half but there is still some bloodwork to be done."
15928,"Since Kava is related to liver problems, I'd like to avoid it as much as possible."
15929,"Lastly, I'm looking for natural cures to severe anxiety/worry."
15930,"Anything that is mild probably won't work, and since it had and is having detrimental effects on my life."
15931,Thanks in advance for any suggestions!
15932,:)
15933,"I started medication a few months ago, and I'm still working on finding what's right for me."
15934,"I have had trouble with OCD symptoms and anxiety for my entire life, but I went off my meds in August and things have gotten much worse."
15935,"I started taking my meds again in October, but I'm still having more trouble with my OCD and anxiety than I've had since before I started taking meds 11 years ago."
15936,I've been taking the new meds for almost a month and haven't noticed a change in my sleep patterns.
15937,Don't be afraid of medication.
15938,She left to go to the store at around 8pm.
15939,It is now 12:15pm (4hours past).
15940,She only went to get a couple things from the store.
15941,Her phone is dead.
15942,Should I be worried?
15943,"I have no medications left,, I am worried."
15944,"I'm not on any medication, but now I wish I was."
15945,"My mom called the doctors and scheduled  an appointment to look into some medication, but I'm not sure how much i can get considering I'm 17.

so all of this leads me to my question, does it get better?"
15946,Has medication helped manage the anxiety.
15947,"I had taken some pain medication, because my back was hurting."
15948,"My dog and I each just started anxiety medication - Zoloft for me, Prozac for him."
15949,"I want to see a doctor about it and maybe get put on some sort of medication to help prevent attacks, but my mother believes that anxiety is just a call for attention."
15950,"She also thinks that no one needs to be put on medication because ""medication is the government trying to turn the country into zombies."""
15951,"I'd go myself, but being 17, I'd need parental consent for any medication the doctor would want to put me on."
15952,**TL;DR: WoW addicted mother thinks anxiety is for attention whores and medication is actually government mind control.
15953,I'd like to start by giving you an example of what happens to me when it comes to my anxiety issues and what medication I have been given by the doctor.
15954,I was wondering if anyone out there takes medication for their Depression and/or Anxiety and how it made them feel and whether they had to be placed on a stronger or weaker dosage?
15955,This one prompted me to go to the ER and finally have been diagnosed and been given medicine (Clonazepam and Paxil).
15956,"I thought I was doing well...I've only been on meds since September and I thought I was improving, I really did."
15957,I thought I'd be fine with the meds.
15958,My wife thinks it's her fault even though I've sat down and explained to her it's the meds not her but I digress.
15959,"Also is there another medication for Anxiety besides benzos that won't cause sexual dysfunction like SSRI's

Thanks in advance guys and gals."
15960,I have read about medication for those with social anxiety.
15961,"If I could see a doctor, do you think they would prescribe me medication?"
15962,Has anyone with social anxiety taken medication and has it worked for them?
15963,The only thing that has ever worked was medication [SSRI] that keep my serotonin amount on a  more or less 'normal' level.
15964,"I know that the first 6-8 weeks can be hard and I will kill myself if I can't get my life back, and I'm trying to stay on this medication for at least two months to see if this helps."
15965,I guess this medication is the right fit for me and maybe I don't need any other kind of pill ... but is it really okay for me to just be okay?
15966,"it's almost like I want to fight this ""being okay facade"" i guess i'd like to call it .. and stop taking the meds again to feel the panic ... but thats just crazy right?"
15967,"I take medication everyday, and I also take Klonopin as needed."
15968,I'm also really scared that I'll be trapped somewhere without my medication and end up doing something harmful.
15969,"I remember that before I was on my medication I would be paranoid all the time, and every time I would enter a dark room, I would be worried that the moment I turned the lights on, something bad would happen."
15970,I am on medication now and I no longer think those things.
15971,"I am really scared, and this still scares me now even though I am on medication and am doing better."
15972,"**tl;dr: benzos were the only thing that worked, but they made me stupid and sad."
15973,is there anything new that is fast-acting with few cognitive side-effects?
15974,"**  

So throughout high school and much of college, I tried various medications:  SSRI's, mood stabilizers, benzos, and tranquilizers."
15975,I had absolutely no luck with anything except for the benzos.
15976,"The problem being that the cognitive effects prevented me from doing math or anything logic-related for about 3 days after taking a pill, which was more important than it may first sound because that's what I was studying in school."
15977,"Even if I just took one as needed, there was still that cloud of incompetence(and depression)."
15978,"So now I battle it with diet and exercise, which works rather well for the most part."
15979,I'm fine just about anywhere except for casual/informal settings where there's a risk of small talk.
15980,"While most situations are getting better, those small-talk settings are getting increasingly worse."
15981,"And to compound the issue, within the last 3 years, i've also moved to a new country where Im having to learn the language, which means having to learn how to socialize all over again."
15982,another problem is that when I'm having a panic attack I don't look like im panicking.
15983,"I look like a combination of being pissed off and uninterested, or in other words, like an arrogant ass."
15984,"With the language barrier on top of it all, to be honest, it's just really fucking frustrating, and I'm sick of being like this."
15985,"So yea, that's my situation."
15986,"And here are my questions:

* What are they giving the kids nowadays?"
15987,* Have there been any advances that lessen the cognitive side-effects of benzos?
15988,* Are there are new categories of drugs to consider?
15989,"* If none of the above, what are the least impairing benzodiazepines?"
15990,"Of this family I've tried diazepam, clonazepam, and alprazolam

Any other tips or suggestions would be appreciated too."
15991,thanks in advance.
15992,Has anyone found any other forms of coping with their anxiety that worked and didn't involve medication?
15993,I'm looking to avoid taking medications if I can.
15994,The antianxiety part of the meds isnt enough to counteract the drowsiness it causes.
15995,My mom is the one paying for my meds and that makes me even more anxious.
15996,"The circumstances of my life are so brutal right now that just the thought of certain ideas or concepts, like families, education, thoughts that shouldn't riddle you with fear but I am basically in a constant state of panic."
15997,I wish everything just sucked...everything IS TERRIFYING!
15998,The world is going to shit.
15999,I don't feel like I'm gonna make it without help from benzos.
16000,"It's not even close to recreation at this point, there is no fun to be had I need to straighten out my life but I'm constantly afraid of rejection and failure."
16001,"Some days I can function, most I cannot."
16002,"It's been closer to two years of trying different medications, a lot of bad ideas of course imo...mostly antidepressants, an antihistamine, and buspirone which helped until I got so used to it that it lost it's anxiolytic effects."
16003,"I've been prescribed alprazolam a few times in the past during emergencies, should I bring that paperwork since I just saw it and have it or is that too ""gimme the drugs!""-status?"
16004,The appointment is at 3:15pm pacific time and my normal doctor just left recently so this is my first appointment with this doc...NO idea what to expect.
16005,"I've tried therapy (CBT - really didn't work for me, considering ACT/mindfulness) medication (on lamictal which usually for bipolar, and has helped the depression but not the anxiety), meditation, exercise, diet, reframing etc etc."
16006,I don't have access to medication because I dont have insurance yet.
16007,"Background info:

 - I met this person when I started high school."
16008,"He was (and is) staff at said school, and we became very close over the years."
16009,"Given that timeline, we've known each other for roughly 4.5 years."
16010,"I've cried in front of him more times than I care to admit, and he's opened up to me a lot as well."
16011,- Even when my parents mistreated me and were not supportive of me (i.e.
16012,"most of the time), he was there to listen and give advice."
16013,I owe a lot to him because of this.
16014,- Right now I'm in my first year of university in the same city where I grew up and where he lives/works.
16015,"Because of our schedules, we unfortunately don't see each other much."
16016,"Every couple of months, we manage to carve out time to see each other, and our dynamic hasn't deteriorated."
16017,"- I go to individual therapy, group therapy, and a meditation class regularly."
16018,No medications.
16019,"I've noticed some positive changes, but I'm not sure of my ability to cope with this new situation."
16020,"- Because of past traumas, I had/have very few friends, and he's the person I'm closest to."
16021,He knows this.
16022,"I'm trying to build a network of people I can trust here at my university, and it's coming along, but obviously they can't replace this person."
16023,"The other day he told me, in person, that he was seriously considering moving to the opposite coast."
16024,"(This is the US, so this is a *huge* distance.)"
16025,"I'm glad that this didn't happen while I was still in high school, because back then I didn't have any other places/people to turn to."
16026,"Still, for the past few days I haven't been able to concentrate on much."
16027,"I don't want to do my schoolwork, I don't want to see my friends, I don't want to eat anything."
16028,All I want is to watch Netflix in bed and drink a ton of water.
16029,I feel horrible.
16030,"The move isn't going to happen for at least another year, so that's a bit comforting."
16031,"We talked about it for a bit the other day, and he told me these things up front:

- He hopes to always be a part of my life."
16032,- He hopes that we can remain in touch even after he leaves.
16033,"- Whenever he's back in town, he will make a point of seeing me."
16034,"(I also want to visit him, and have the means to do so.)"
16035,"Despite the above, my fears are the following:

- We'll just stop talking to each other."
16036,"He's bad at emailing–his ""email personality"" is incredibly taciturn, but he's really sweet in person–so that wouldn't be the best option."
16037,Skype/FaceTime/Hangouts is way better IMO.
16038,"He rarely initiates contact, which I think we need to discuss before he leaves."
16039,- We won't make the most of our last year together.
16040,"His workload decreases dramatically once summer starts, and though I'll be working almost full-time as well, I hope that we can do things together before he leaves–on the weekends, and after work, and things like that."
16041,"This might not happen, and I think we'd both regret that later on, so we've got to make plans."
16042,- *How do people even have discussions about this sort of thing?
16043,"*

tl;dr: longtime mentor is moving away next year at the earliest; I'm trying to cope but have no idea what to do."
16044,Please help!
16045,[edited for clearer formatting]
16046,"What's worse is I have medicine ""for emergencies"" but I'm too afraid to take it."
16047,"I want to live with a clear head, and without medication."
16048,I plan on bringing this up with my doctor soon but I just didn't know if it was 'normal' for feelings to start up again after taking medication.
16049,and the experiences I had with different therapies and meds.
16050,Just wondering if anyone else here is on blood pressure medicine because of whenever they go to the dr. when they take the blood pressure reading it is really high because of the anxiety.
16051,"**NOTE: This phobia developed when I was 12, and actually had an allergic reaction to a medication and had to go to the ER - even though the reaction was very mild, one of the symptoms was my throat feeling tight**"
16052,"But I've been learning how to manage it without meds, but recently had a relapse and feel the need to take a small dosage -- 25mg or even half that -- of my meds (Zoloft)."
16053,"I don't like to rely on meds, but it sure does take the edge off and makes me a happier person (quality of life)."
16054,But this is medicine.
16055,"I know it would be best to be off of the meds, but if I'm mentally dealing with anxiety and panic attacks then I might have trouble getting pregnant."
16056,"I've been medication-free for 4 months now, but have to deal with my constant anxiety."
16057,"My medication takes care of it day to day, but it's still there."
16058,So I've had a complete meltdown about 2 months ago and I've since started taking meds to get better.
16059,I am very afraid to take the medication.
16060,Hello guys.
16061,"I've had anxiety for years, I think."
16062,"It started when I first encountered heartburn in college, when I was up late writing a final paper (of course, it was due the next morning)."
16063,"Subsequently, I sometimes feared I was having a heart attack, even though I later learned it was nothing but acid reflux."
16064,"Despite having my heart checked (everything looked great), earlier this year I would have horrible episodes where I would have tingling in my arms, pressure in my chest, and more fear of a heart attack."
16065,I even called 911 once because my arms were going numb and my hands closing.
16066,I've subsequently had everything rechecked and it was just a panic attack.
16067,"However, later on in that same semester, during a particularly stressful finals week, I felt an odd feeling (probably more heartburn), and suddenly started having an anxiety attack."
16068,"I felt lost, like I didn't care about what I was doing, like everything was so meaningless, and I feared, very intensely, that I was ""going crazy."""
16069,"I managed to get through that day, but in the roughly six months since, I've on and off suffered with intermittent anxiety (I think it's anxiety), not sure whether I'm feeling anxious, depressed, or both, but usually afraid that I'm ""going crazy,"" or going to be terribly depressed."
16070,Sometimes guilt triggers it.
16071,"Random guilt about things in the past, how I treated some people, not spending enough time with my brother, etc."
16072,"It generally improves after a couple of hours, but it's always frightening."
16073,"I'm afraid of getting anxious if I drive somewhere, and I think ""What if I go crazy and get lost when I'm away from home?"""
16074,"When I'm out, though, and socializing, I generally don't have a problem and don't feel anxious (this can vary, of course, and I've had some anxious or depressed situations even while hanging out, but to a much lesser extent), or only feel a little anxious."
16075,"The anxiety hasn't affected my productivity or concentration, or much of anything else."
16076,"It is there basically every day though, and it is a battle."
16077,"PS, as soon as I started experiencing this new, current form of ""mental worry"" anxiety, I really have not had any fears of having heart problems subsequently (I've also been working out and getting in great shape)."
16078,"EDIT: I'm a 26 year old male, no medications, have insurance."
16079,Has anyone felt similarly?
16080,I'm so grateful there's a community here.
16081,"Oh, they're 16, androgynous (gender neutral), they don't know what type of anxiety (or even aknowledge it,) no meds, Aus."
16082,"""Successfully"" meaning getting off the medication and finding your anxiety level to be much more manageable."
16083,I'm really trying to do my homework on the medication before starting it.
16084,The idea of taking medication indefinitely scares the hell out of me.
16085,I'm not on meds or in therapy but I do have valium.
16086,I'm on meds and in therapy and everything but none of it seems to be working.
16087,"I'm on different meds for anxiety and insomnia, before I could get to bed the other night I had a mild attack thinking about work and life."
16088,When my sleep meds finally kicked in I was out and slept through two alarms.
16089,I was just put on these meds about two weeks ago because I developed anxiety from this job.
16090,Fast forward 9 years and +80 lbs (just wonderful...) I finally want to tackle this weight issue the medication has brought upon me since it has proved to be virtually impossible for me to lose weight while taking this drug and I want to try to handle my anxiety and serotonin defficiency without medication.
16091,"I feel like things have been getting better though, I've never taken meds before."
16092,"I was on medication for depression and anxiety during high school, but eventually got to a place where I did not feel that medication was the best choice for me."
16093,"I haven't been on medication in about three years, now."
16094,My last job was in October of 2004.
16095,"At first the unemployment was mostly about me being lazy and depressed, but as time went on it became more."
16096,I got stuck in a rut and didn't know how to get out of it.
16097,Then the anxiety took over.
16098,"Over a year of therapy, both individual and group, psychiatrist, medications, a week in the mental ward, and I'm still not going anywhere."
16099,"I'm a big guy, I'm in very poor shape physically, I have hyperhidrosis..."
16100,"I can't work a physically taxing job due to knees and back, retail is impossible to consider because of sweating and anxiety."
16101,"I went to college for animation but it's been over 10 years since I've done anything with it, so prospects there are dead."
16102,Looking at employment sites like workopolis.ca or monster.ca (I'm Canadian btw!)
16103,is a lesson in frustration.
16104,Entry level?
16105,How is 5+ years experience required entry level!
16106,"Ok, I've gotten into rant mode, so I'll end this."
16107,Just wanted to vent.
16108,"No idea what I will do, but it's good to write it down sometimes."
16109,"My doctor agreed with my choice and both my doctor and therapist agreed that maybe meds were not the treatment for me, as my anxiety and depression are highly situational and at a second glance, aren't the type of thing you want to treat with medication first."
16110,The meds should technically be out of my system now but I'm still so anxious.
16111,Last year I failed two classes because I had medication and health problems and failed the classes solely because of poor attendance.
16112,"And on top of all that I just had my meds bumped from 20mg to 40mg because I was starting to have all my old symptoms (heart palpitations, adrenaline rushes, dizziness, etc), but now I am falling asleep standing up and anytime I'm not at work I am laying down wherever I can and closing my eyes."
16113,They are switching meds and they two (cymbalta and prozac) are interacting to cause some awful anxiety.
16114,I don't want medication.
16115,I can't pay for therapy right now so I want some type of medication to help lift it a bit.
16116,I was on medication before but not long to where it could kick in and help do it's job.
16117,I avoid medication and stick to herbal tea and self-therapy.
16118,I am 23.
16119,I have been off and on medications since I was 11.
16120,"None of them helped and they all caused side effects, weight gain, moodiness and some of them even made me hallucinate."
16121,I am on meds now that don't help as much as they should.
16122,They don't cause me harm and I just want him to understand that I do not want fucking pills.
16123,I tell him over and over an he refuses to listen.
16124,He calls me close minded.
16125,"He tells me ""so you have taken these and so that means all pills won't work""."
16126,I keep telling him that the problems I have cannot be solved with pills.
16127,I've descended deep into agoraphobia (no outside for 1 year+) and would like to get on some meds.
16128,"I went from 50 mg of generic Zoloft (sertraline) to 100 mg, and all the awful side effects I was feeling when I first started the medication came back except worse."
16129,I feel like my psychiatrist doesn't fully understand the effects of the medicine on me and he isn't listening when I said that I really felt the side effects when I started taking the meds.
16130,"However, I have never been diagnosed because my mum has basically said ""You're not allowed to go on medication and they won't do shit else for you""."
16131,"No matter what I do, no motivation, no strategy, medicine, therapy can do to stop the other me's."
16132,"I've been suffering with anxiety for about 10 years, most of my life I've been able to handle it pretty fine without medicine."
16133,"I've suffered from mild social anxiety ever since high school, and other than a few panic attacks and avoiding many social situations, I was just fine, no meds or anything."
16134,"The pediatrician I saw prescribed me celexa once, but uhh it made my butthole bleed so after we found out that was the culprit, my mom has been hesitant to put me on any medication, and I didn't really feel I needed it anyway."
16135,I am not on any daily meds but do have an as needed benzodiazepine to take in low doses.
16136,I have nothing against medication and have seen it work well for others.
16137,"Every once and awhile I contemplate getting off of my medication to live a more ""natural"" lifestyle, then I remember how terrible life was."
16138,"I visited my psychologist (who I saw before starting the meds) to discuss my thoughts about coming off, and she was completely against it."
16139,I've been dating my boyfriend now for 6 months and I've been an open book about my medication and past anxiety throughout our relationship.
16140,Someone who didn't know me before the medication really doesn't understand or see what the function is and how it positively affects my life.
16141,How do you explain to someone the importance of a medication when they have not seen your quality of life prior?
16142,"I asked them if they wanted my medical doctor, who prescribes me my meds, or my psychologist, who makes my mental health diagnoses."
16143,"So,  I am a student at a music school."
16144,I love music and just creating with other people.
16145,"However,  I always had trouble playing by myself for others."
16146,Even in my lessons I would get corrected for things that I don't do in practice rooms nor large ensemble concerts.
16147,"When I would have to play my instrument in front of the class,  I would forget how my favorite piece of 8 years would go."
16148,I would be ashamed and think music want meant for me and I am wasting so much money for a dream that would never happen.
16149,"""But avocado,  your sound is wonderful!"
16150,"Clearly you wouldn't be at the school if you didn't deserve it! """
16151,"But I got here because of who I know,  not how I can play."
16152,So my playing got worse and worse.
16153,And everydaywould just bring something else to worry about.
16154,I had a mini crying spree when i thought my apartment was a mess and friends would be over in 3 days.
16155,"After all,  my dishes weren't even done!"
16156,So I went to my doctor.
16157,I now take a daily medication and given beta blockers for performing if I need them.
16158,I do smile more and am a lot more talkative now.
16159,"However,  I feel like the medicine has to be a secret."
16160,"People at my school talk about beta blockers like ""steroids for athletes"" and therefore ""musicians that use them are cheaters""."
16161,"I also hear conversations about how they ""get rid of that performer's edge that one needs"", and beta blockers make one an empty shell."
16162,"I have confided in some people that I take these,  and for the most part people are understanding."
16163,It just gets difficult when in the giant sea of colleagues it is almost like a dark mark to take these medicines.
16164,I am doing better mentally since talking to my doctor!
16165,But sometimes it is nice to find people in similar situations too.
16166,Also hello!
16167,:D
16168,"I emailed my doctor and she said we can talk about medication changes, and I'm going to up my trips to the talk therapy."
16169,Do you guys think based on your experience medication could help this?
16170,"I'm nervous as fuck to even start writing this, so please don't be harsh in replies."
16171,I'll give an insight on what's currently happening to me.
16172,"I've been with my boyfriend for almost 8 months now, I'm 17, soon to be 18 in July."
16173,"I've been dealing with social anxiety since I started getting a busier schedule, since I've been in high school mostly."
16174,"I overanalyze how I talk when I'm speaking to people, especially ones who have authority over me."
16175,I've told my boyfriend about it and he said it sounds like I'm too self aware.
16176,"Sometimes I'll think about it so much to the point that I stutter, and my heart pounds when I think about raising my hand in class."
16177,"I've talked to a counselor about it, he said that it has a lot to do with my confidence."
16178,"I'm not very confident, I'm a submissive person if you ask me."
16179,Everyone I've trusted in the past has broke down my barriers and ruined me.
16180,"I've been emotionally abused, and I have trouble with feeling like I'm worth something."
16181,Sometimes I don't feel like I even know myself.
16182,"And then, I went through a blow out with my old friends."
16183,"I got a job that requires me to work a lot, and being a junior in high school, that puts me in a super busy place."
16184,I'm growing up and taking on new responsibilities.
16185,"The only time I'm not working, I'm in evening college level psychology classes."
16186,"I already have my future planned out for me academically and career wise, I aspire to be a veterinarian."
16187,"I make good grades, I do really well in school, my parents are proud of me."
16188,"When I started these classes and work, I lost my old friends because they didn't understand the weight I was juggling in my life, not only that, but I realized that they weren't very good friends as well."
16189,"An ex emotionally abused me a lot in the past, and is now friends with my old friends, and basically it's like a whole team of resentment towards me."
16190,"Anyway, I had to get my phone number changed from harassment from my ex, and random numbers who would belittle and degrade me."
16191,Now they're trying to send things to my boyfriend to make him leave me.
16192,"The thought that he might wake up one day and tell himself he doesn't need to deal with the bullshit runs through my mind endlessly, daily."
16193,"I'm losing weight, (I'm only 86lbs as it is) its getting harder to focus in school, I wake up randomly at night in fear that my boyfriend has sent a text questioning our relationship."
16194,"I get shakes, feeling nauseous, I can't take this anymore."
16195,"I feel helpless, like I'm stuck in a pit and there's no way out."
16196,I don't know what to do anymore.
16197,"I don't want medications for anxiety, I have a friend that takes meds for it and is a complete zombie without a personality."
16198,Who would want that?
16199,I don't know.
16200,I guess I just feel alone and I need some advice and pointers.
16201,I've been a long time lurker and a lot of things posted here have helped me.
16202,"Thank you if you've read this far, it's taken a lot out of me to post this."
16203,Hey there.
16204,"I deal with a good bit of anxiety, depression that comes and goes, and just all around have little motivation or drive on top of a mess of other little biting issues."
16205,"I received my prescription for Wellbutrin SR today, and I'd like to probe those that have taken it or similar medications for things I need to be on the lookout for."
16206,"So far I've researched and found it may increase my already crazy heavy libido, and that drinking with it is bad."
16207,"I drink a little whiskey from time to time, so I'm wondering if a shot every now and again will cause any issues that I need to be wary of."
16208,"Also, is there anything else I need to be on the lookout for- interactions, side effects?"
16209,"On another note, I just stopped taking Tramadol (Ultram) last week after a month of having it."
16210,"I read that Tramadol and Wellbutrin don't mix well, so will it be safe for me to start taking the Wellbutrin now that I'm no longer taking the Ultram?"
16211,"I'm simply wondering, because I'm pretty certain I'm experiencing some degree of withdrawals (Sleep is out of whack, major headaches, irritation.)"
16212,"I'm hoping this medication can help me sort of balance out, I'm looking forward to supporting a better daily life."
16213,:)
16214,"I'm 22 and have been seeing doctors for my bipolar/anxiety/dysthymia/depression or whatever it is since age 14 or 13, so almost 9 years of treatment now."
16215,"I've run the gamut of doctors and medications so I have a very long paper trail, so to speak, of varied diagnoses."
16216,I applied for SSI a few months ago.
16217,"I've quit about 20 different jobs in the past 5 years because of anxiety, and flunked out of college after 3 semesters when I was a straight A gifted student in high school."
16218,has anyone done the SSI interview?
16219,I am expecting a routine psych-eval but both of my parents are state workers and they tell me that the SSI people will try to prove you're faking or lying.
16220,"I don't do well under pressure and I can't break down in front of doctors - I have this weird complex where I must show decorum in front of professionals, so whenever I am pleasant and cordial to any doctor naturally they suspect."
16221,my anxiety is severe to the point where I can't drive or hardly even go outside.
16222,if people look at me I get upset.
16223,I don't sleep at night because I see horrible things.
16224,I haven't had a job in almost 2 years now.
16225,but my anxiety is not the only reason I'm applying.
16226,"I have endometriosis and PCOS, had two surgeries last year, and that sparked a chronic pain condition (possibly fibromyalgia, haven't been able to see a specialist yet, money is pretty tight even with great insurance) so I am in severe pain every day."
16227,"I don't know when I will be able to work again and I hate myself for it, but I need to get the SSI money (it's $600 a month, I think) to pay for my student loans ($3,000+ even though I flunked) and then start helping my parents with my medical bills."
16228,I don't want the money just to have money or use on dumb shit.
16229,"my parents had to refinance their house because of my medical bills and it makes me want to fucking cry because they're both 60 and they need money for retirement.. they don't guilt trip me at all, but now they can't go on their bucket list vacation to the Grand Canyon this summer that they already had planned and I know it's because of me."
16230,"TL;DR: I have legitimate conditions, does anyone know what to expect or how to do well on an SSI psych eval?"
16231,I am so nervous and afraid.
16232,I really need the money to pay medical &amp;amp; my other bills to help my parents.
16233,I just finished up day 9 on strattera.
16234,"started on 18 mg, up to 25 so far, target dose for me is 60mg."
16235,"It's probably too early to tell, but so far strattera is actually working really well."
16236,I noticed hours after the first dose and it's been working consistently since.
16237,"It's amazing, I just don't feel anxious or ridiculously stressed out, despite having many of my normal triggers come up."
16238,I'm not constantly in agony about the future.
16239,"But I don't feel numb, or reckless, or euphoric- just mostly calm."
16240,I imagine this is what a normal person feels like.
16241,"I'm pretty sure this is not just the placebo effect because I've never felt this way before in my life, and I've already been through two other medicines that I can compare it to."
16242,"Prozac-made me completely unable to feel fear or have any sort of startle response, and wellbutrin-made me super emotional and cry a lot."
16243,No side effects EXCEPT alcohol no longer has any positive effect on me.
16244,"Really strange, because alcohol had a 100% guarantee of making me feel super calm and happy, until now."
16245,It's worth it though.
16246,"Online I've mostly seen negative reviews of strattera and that it makes anxiety worse, I guess I just got lucky and it happened to work well with my brain chemistry."
16247,"Therapy (I have an amazing therapist) and meds (Zoloft, 25 mg starting dose and now 50mg) have brought me from point A to point B:

Point A: Crying for sometimes 6+ hours, couldn't eat, cried in the bathroom at work, stopped working altogether, relationship with fiance severely strained, losing weight, sleeping for 2 - 4 hours per night, constant fog and depersonalization, intense depression and hopelessness, feelings of dread/phobia regarding work, constantly triggered by almost everything


Point B: Able to attend social events, returned to work and ended the year on a great note (I am a teacher), went to the bar with colleagues, excited to plan my wedding and day trips with fiance/friends, eating full meals and no anxiety about food, sleeping 8+ hours nightly, hope for the future, desire to help others and excitement for my upcoming school year, very few triggers and able to calm down when I am triggered."
16248,This all changed in a matter of weeks due to therapy and meds.
16249,"Seek therapy, possibly meds, don't let yourself needlessly suffer."
16250,This was because I went to the hospital for endometroisis pain and I had a bad reaction to a medication they gave me for the pain.
16251,"Anxious about the future, starting new meds, and coming to terms with my diagnosis."
16252,I would like to eventually be independent of SSRIs and other meds and I think that this device seems to be the most promising way.
16253,"I don't know what to try next, but I have an appointment today to discuss next steps for medication."
16254,I also deal with severe hypochondria (which is somewhat justified as I have a chronic illness and was a very sick child) so over thanksgiving break I asked my psychiatrist to increase my meds.
16255,"I have no issue with medication, just terrified of gaining weight."
16256,"I honestly don't care about helping myself, and I think it's because I've been doing it for so long."
16257,"I'm fed up with trying to get better, fed up with switching medications in order to feel better, so fed up that I would rather give in to depression than fight it."
16258,I am getting more and more used to the idea of just having my life fall to the way side.
16259,"I dont want to help myself, I want to suffer more, and fall down more and i cant explain why."
16260,I want things to spiral more out of control and I dont want to do anything to help myself.
16261,what is wrong with me?
16262,"I'm trying to figure out if I have it or not, so I can consider moving forward with some form of medication if possible."
16263,"Doctors keep trying medicine on me that ""may or may not work"" or ""takes months to be effective"" and I feel like I don't have control over anything in my life anymore."
16264,I was prescribed citalopram teva for a few years in my youth but stopped taking it because somehow i thought i could power through this and that i was weak if i needed medication for it.
16265,"She does not know i have been on medication or anything, except she knows im very  shy in social settings but i doubt she knows the full extent of this."
16266,The last time i had like a 10 min talk with my doctor and he just prescribed some meds but i feel like that didnt work very well.
16267,"My anxiety seemed to set in about 5 years ago, after a very difficult relationship/break-up."
16268,"I get very nervous, my body starts to ache and get clammy, and I 'zone out'."
16269,"This tends to happen when it comes to more personal relationships (I have a lot of friends, but I barely speak to them, even when hanging out with them) and also issues with confronting people when problems arise."
16270,"It wasn't until recently, after blood tests, examinations, ect."
16271,"coming back clean that I've realized I don't have some strange disease making me hurt everywhere, and that anxiety could very well be the issue."
16272,"Also discussed it with my mom, who I recently found out is on medicine for anxiety and is fairly against me being medicated."
16273,At this point I'm torn on what to do.
16274,"I want to get help, but even typing this is making me tear up."
16275,"I've gone to a therapist once, but just got frustrated over her questioning for no apparent reason."
16276,"Of course while talking to her, I started crying and couldn't focus on the session."
16277,"So far, I've tried a few different methods for calming myself down."
16278,"I can't seem to hold interest in meditation, but on occasions I could, I felt fantastic."
16279,Walking has also been a great help.
16280,"So far, the best cure has been cannabis, which is decriminalized but still illegal in my state."
16281,"Because of this I can't get a consistent strain, therefore it helps only if the strain is right."
16282,"It helps for the most part, but socializing is still an issue."
16283,"So, those of you with similar anxiety, what works best for you?"
16284,Have there been any medications you've taken that help?
16285,Have any of you gotten over your anxiety and become more social?
16286,"I got stressed that I wouldn't be able to get medication, but called the doctor, he immediately sent in a new script, and everything was fine....

Two days ago I went back, on day 14 of the newest cycle, to refill...."
16287,I will have gone 48+ hours with zero medication...
16288,"What if she's right, and I really have to start taking several-day lapses in medication before they'll refill?"
16289,"While this medicine relieved the attacks, I feel like I was a zombie for those two years."
16290,I'm still just as anxious as I was before the medication.
16291,"My mom told me the psychiatrist doesn't prescribe medication on the first visit, but thats really the reason I am visiting."
16292,"My question is, if anxiety is a chemical imbalance which isn't really testable is there anything you can just say to get them to prescribe the medication faster?"
16293,And in that case can't anyone go see the doctor and say the right thing to get medication since they don't know what happens in your private life outside of what you tell them?
16294,The last couple of nights I've taken meds to sleep which normally work but my anxiety is running so high I've just lay there for hours panicking and not being able to sleep.
16295,TL;DR: Would like suggested meds similar to/or benzodiazepines which work very quickly and are quite strong.
16296,I went to my doctor yestarday after 3 months of bad anxiety and I was finally able to get some medication.
16297,"As I'm only 17, the only meds I could get were fluoxetine."
16298,My wife often suffers from depression and anxiety seems to be one of the most problematic results.
16299,"When she's down, she permanently worries about things that happened in the past, greatly interfering with her everyday tasks, work and sleep."
16300,What should have been a five-minute task often takes more than an hour in when this happens.
16301,"Some days/weeks are better than others, but I would say she has some problems almost 50% of the days."
16302,"Although she has always suffered from depression to some extent, it has become far worse because we are struggling with infertility."
16303,This is something we are working on (IVF) but we can't expect a quick fix for this root problem.
16304,"I know the best course of action would be to encourage her to go see a therapist and/or get medications, but due to her experiences with them far in the past (before I knew her) there is no way I can get her to do so."
16305,"In addition, one of her recurrent fears is that her medical files from the past were not properly destroyed and may come back to haunt her."
16306,"Therefore, she's almost certainly going to be afraid anything she tells a doctor may get out."
16307,So basically it's just me trying to ease her fears.
16308,Most of them are related to the past and people she feels have wronged her.
16309,"Most are irrational in that the things she fears are almost certainly not the case and even if there were, there is no way they could possibly affect her current and future life."
16310,My question is: what is the best way to respond to help her deal with this?
16311,Neither (carefully) pointing out the irrationality of her fears and the fact that they could never affect her seems to work.
16312,"I'm unsure what approach to take to make this clear to her, so I hope that maybe your experiences will help."
16313,"I'm also unsure when/whether/how to bring up the issue in situations where I know she's having problems (for example, when making the bed takes over an hour) but she isn't talking to me about it."
16314,Thanks in advance for any ideas.
16315,"I have visited several health professionals and have tried different meds for the past 2-3 years (I'm currently on [Strattera](http://www.rxlist.com/strattera-drug.htm) 40mg), but nothing seems to work for me so far."
16316,"I'm 17, male, and what I want to get out of this is some sort of medication, something I can step off onto and go into the right direction."
16317,"-.-'

What are the chances I'll be prescribed any medication?"
16318,"Hey Reddit, my dad has pretty bad anxiety and was prescribed meds for it but doesn't take it so it could run in the family."
16319,Does anyone know of a non-benzo way to deal with the feeling of having your chest tight?
16320,Is it adrenaline?
16321,Is it blood pressure?
16322,Could a doctor prescribe me a non-psychiatric medication to deal with this physical symptom of tightness in the chest?
16323,Im already on AD's and anxiety medications  but i dont want to take a lorezepam or alprazolam every time my chest gets all tight.
16324,It happens all the time and it makes me more anxious...if i could get that physical feeling to go away i could relax!
16325,"Im only 22, i dont have heart problems and ive had EKGs to confirm that."
16326,But id love a non psychiatric medication to make my chest tightness go away!
16327,Anyone know of anything like this?
16328,Charlie already has end of life problems and requires medication for the remainder of his life.
16329,The most common seems to be combined therapy and medication.
16330,My issue is that prescriptive medication is a trigger for me.
16331,"I am fearful all the time I'm gone, even with medicine."
16332,"I've always wondered if I ever took medicine if it would help me and my moods or thoughts at all, I used to see a counselor that has known me since I was 8, and has said I might need medicine but didn't see if there was any push for it yet."
16333,The brain fog is probably one of the main reasons why I started medication because it was starting to really impede on my success in school and in life in general.
16334,I think this is a concern that many people who start medication have: am I going to be a totally different person if this is effective?
16335,"Short story: I took fluoxetine a while ago (20y.o atm), but didn;t really find it very helpful."
16336,"Recently, however, my mood swings became less bearable again, so I'm considering Zoloft for the 1st time."
16337,"The trick is - most of my anxiety and sadness is connected with physical appearance, and these medications have a reputation of making people weight more."
16338,"In essence, I can either hope I will somehow overcome these problems, either through being able to work on myself (after all these years this sounds unreal) or risk worsening the situation to the point of despair."
16339,Any thoughts?
16340,Perhaps someone had similar problems?
16341,"*EDIT: BTW, I'm on meds, seen doctors, etc"
16342,"From the beginning of my history of anxiety and panic attacks, I have always held firm to not taking medication and trying to beat it naturally."
16343,When I went to my doctor to discuss medication he was adamant I should be trying Citalopram.
16344,Within 20 minutes of talking to the psychiatrist she was already talking medication and offering to prescribe it to me.
16345,(i was taken aback about how quickly she'd offered medication as a solution) but i guess that's what doctors do?
16346,an anti-depressant.. she advised however that it can be used as an antianxiety medication.
16347,gabapentin on the other hand is a seizure medicine that also treats restless leg syndrome...
16348,-what is your experience on this medication?
16349,"I call bullshit, these meds are incredibly addictive."
16350,I was prescribed xanax and ended up abusing them for a few months so medication isn't something I'm comfortable with.
16351,"I had a girlfriend, who actually was on anti-anxiety medication herself, but that was years ago."
16352,"I do not take medication, have never taken drugs, and I do not have PTSD (I'm fortunate in that nothing that bad has happened to me)."
16353,I've decided to see how I feel without medication for the first time in 5 years.
16354,"I've tried a bunch of different meds but always experienced intolerable digestive side effects, which seem to negate any positive emotional benefit I may have gotten from them."
16355,Anyway-- I'm curious to hear how others who have tried medication and gone off of it have dealt with it.
16356,Have you found that it's possible to manage your anxiety without the aid of meds?
16357,I've been taking my anxiety medication but I don't want to overdo it.
16358,"Even girls laugh at me idk why, Why people laugh at me and give me verbal abuses, i go insane thinking about it, can't sleep at night, I've only dated one girl and even that relationship was difficult, I've been to a shrink he listened to my problems and put me on meds but he couldn't tell why People laugh at me, why girls are mean to my face, I hate myself for even being alive."
16359,I'm not looking for help or sympathy.
16360,I just want to get this off my chest.
16361,I'm having a particularly tough go and I just want to get it out so I can go back to fighting it.
16362,I've had severe anxiety since I was little.
16363,In grade one I would gave the be dragged to school screaming and crying.
16364,I was misunderstood and undiagnosed until my mid teens.
16365,I was depressed all through it.
16366,Being punished for not wanting to go to school.
16367,I felt like a failure.
16368,"Everyone else can go outside and tall to people just fine, why couldn't I?"
16369,After several therapists and several medications things got a little better.
16370,I was able to actually attend school in grade 10.
16371,In grade 12 it changed.
16372,It manifested in different ways.
16373,It would jeep me up all night.
16374,Make me physically ill.
16375,But I didn't get the same anxiety attacks.
16376,"I adapted to it, so it adapted to me."
16377,I dropped out in my last semester of school.
16378,It was a painful thing to do.
16379,"I was capable of being top of the class, but only if I could make it there."
16380,Two years went by.
16381,I vegetated.
16382,I was a failure.
16383,But then it started to receed.
16384,I was able to see friends again.
16385,I met a girl.
16386,We've been together 3 years now.
16387,I got my high school credits from a community college with honors.
16388,Enrolled in university.
16389,I was ecstatic.
16390,Life was great.
16391,"Its now second semester, first year engineering."
16392,I haven't made a single class.
16393,"I started procrastinating, putting off everything."
16394,Everything is starting to make me anxious.
16395,I can't look at my school email or class schedules without being fear stricken.
16396,I haven't needed to be on regular meds in a while so all I have to help is some low dose ativan.
16397,I have to take more and more for every attack I get.
16398,I feel like everything I've worked towards the past 3 years is all crashing down.
16399,I'm going to faill my classes.
16400,I'm funded by loans.
16401,I don't believe I will be funded to come back if I utterly fail this year.
16402,If I have a 0 in everything why would they fund me?
16403,I tried to reach out to my professors for advice.
16404,Most didn't respond.
16405,One told me unsympathetically to quit.
16406,One offered to help me make up work.
16407,"Even if I can make up some work in one class, I will fail everything else."
16408,I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and I hope I can get on something to restore balance.
16409,I hate that this illness can come and go as it pleases and destroy everything in its path.
16410,"My only close friend anymore is my SO, and she has a hard time dealing with it."
16411,I won't give up.
16412,I won't let this thing ruin me.
16413,It can beat me down and leave me broken but I won't let it win.
16414,I will fight this thing until it kills me.
16415,I'm at war with myself and neither side will ever stop.
16416,Please excuse any typos.
16417,This was typed on a phone.
16418,"The problem is that resorting to treating though medication  feels like losing to it, as if it's giving up in a sense."
16419,I'd just like to know your experiences with starting medication and which drug is more effective when using it PRN.
16420,So I am curious: what do some of you personally do to manage your anxiety without prescription medication?
16421,"I'm also going back to school in a few weeks, and I want to start some treatment (medication, therapy, or something) before I go back."
16422,"I took my medication maybe an hour ago or so, and I'm feeling nauseous."
16423,I don't want to be on this medication for the rest of my life as a crutch.
16424,I scared myself by looking up what happens if you vomit right after taking your medication.
16425,What I found instead were the withdrawal symptoms from this medication.
16426,"I am on medication for Bipolar Disorder [type 1, rapid-cycling], I was diagnosed a couple of years ago."
16427,"I just started a new medication a couple of weeks ago, so far things are going fine with that."
16428,"I'll try to make a long story short here:

-Anxiety like crazy since 2005ish, worsening pains in neck
-Stubborn about going to docs, finally went years later after it got bad
-Many medications tried, lorezepam, xanax, stuff that felt nauseating and weird
-Eventually go to new doctor, get a neck adjustment like chiropractors do, given muscle relaxers and steroid for a week
-Feel ok for around 2 months, symptoms return in full, return to new doc
-Another adjustment, after 5 days things feel even worse
-Get prescribed a weeks worth of Valium."
16429,"During that week I was on valium (diazepam), I felt NORMAL."
16430,"FINALLY, for first time in years."
16431,"I could think, I was relaxed, and I tried a few days without it and it had no drug pull."
16432,I had none of the crazy side effects I did with xanax or lorezapam.
16433,Well after that I went back in and told my Doctor that it had really successful results.
16434,He decided to have me keep a supply of muscle relaxers around instead to combat it.
16435,"They work ok, but I get so neurotic that after a few weeks in it's not doing the job."
16436,I was kind of hoping for Valium and I want to know if that's a bad thing.
16437,I avoid pills as much as possible and I don't want to seem like a drug seeker either.
16438,"I want to know if it's ok to ask for Valium specifically, or if its long term use is linked with problems?"
16439,I'm pretty paranoid about pills and I barely even take aspirin but I never had such success with any other medication as with valium.
16440,Any opinions would be really appreciated~  Thanks!
16441,I have been doing a workbook that focuses on this therapy and have been seeing a therapist bi weekly to help with it.
16442,That however has been so far more focused on dealing with the past week and dealing with those and not really the CBT.
16443,"I am on zoloft 50 mg a day, I will be starting xanax or one of the drugs in that family soon, my question is, with all those medications, would this interfer with my ability to properly do CBT?"
16444,"What they do,besides medication, that has helps them with anxiety."
16445,"After that episode, I got back on the meds, but after 2 months, I think they've stopped working for me."
16446,I have already made the appointment with my doc to discuss the next step as far as meds go.
16447,"I'm in the process of meeting with a psychologist, but finding the right one for me will take time as well as finding a medication that works, so any tips and tricks that aren't the same thing I'd find with a simple google search?"
16448,"I had gone off of Celexa by myself about six months ago, so it wasn't a wean off/wean on of meds."
16449,"I have been suffering from very bad health anxiety ever since  my father died last year and have been to therapy which didn't help an awful lot, but I have decided to engage in the process again possibly in combination with a medication."
16450,I have always been scared of taking meds.
16451,I am also scared of missing out on some aspects of the college experience due to being on medication.
16452,Can you give some advice to a person that needs medication but to scared to take it.
16453,"I feel like I'll never get better (can barely afford seeing a doctor and buying meds, can't afford to see a therapist at the moment)."
16454,"Thinking I had flu symptoms, I go into RiteAid and buy some Theraflu, again struggling to even walk around without shaking really badly and breathing hard, but I made it home, took the medicine and laid down for an hour."
16455,This includes behavior modifying medicine.
16456,My stepfather has been diagnosed with depression and is regularly seeing a psychologist and is taking medication.
16457,"I'm also afraid to take the medicine perscribed me, paroxin."
16458,"I'm worried that this is going to lead to becoming dependent on alcohol, so I'm starting to consider going to a doctor and getting medication for my anxiety."
16459,"Is it okay for me to tell them I think I may have anxiety/OCD and think medicine may help, or will this make it look like I'm just drug seeking?"
16460,"The medication made me very lethargic, made me gain weight, and made me feel emotionless."
16461,"yeah so the past week or so i've been feeling great but i've had intermittant periods of feeling awful, how do i go about telling my new therapist my symptoms and how resistant should i be to medication?"
16462,I barely know anyone and today is my first day after all summer I've taken my meds for ADHD.
16463,When I finally forced myself to go to the doctor and admit I needed help I was put on medication that gave me WILD mood swings and seriously messed up my thinking.
16464,I took myself off the medication and went back to the doctor only to almost be committed to a hospital.
16465,I went to a different doctor and was given a mild medication for depression.
16466,In August I was off the medication and doing well.
16467,"Hi all,

I've experienced moderate to severe anxiety and severe agoraphobia for a few years now."
16468,"The last few months, I've been working with my physician to try to find a medication that will work for me."
16469,"I've tried Lexapro, Valium, and Welbutrin."
16470,I'm very sensitive to these medications and they all ended up making me feel physically very uncomfortable.
16471,"Xanax has been the best medication I've tried so far for controlling the feeling of an oncoming panic attack, although it always felt like it didn't do much for my 'mental' anxiety."
16472,I've also been trying herbal/traditional remedies for anxiety.
16473,"I've been taking theanine, magnolia bark, amur cork, kava, and holy basil, all in tablet form, on a consistent daily basis."
16474,"There might be a slight placebo effect from these, but for the most part, I can't notice if these are effective at all."
16475,"I would still feel just as anxious, and further, I wouldn't really notice my anxiety was any worse on days that I didn't take these tablets."
16476,"Today, I tried a kava tincture that my boss provided to me ( I sent an email out this morning that I was feeling very anxious and may head home early)."
16477,"Within 15 minutes, I felt immensely better."
16478,"It did taste awful, like a mouthful of dirt."
16479,It also made my tongue numb.
16480,"I'll have to keep trying it in the next few weeks to see if the effects are compatible with my anxiety, but so far so good."
16481,The tincture strength says 1:2 on the label.
16482,"I'm generally skeptical of herbal remedies but at least for today, I feel like this has made a significant difference."
16483,Can someone recommend me medication I could take for this?
16484,"When I was 18, with the help of medication and some cbt, I realised I wanted to go to university so I needed to get myself there, and made massive progress."
16485,"I'm nowhere near cured yet, I'm still on high dose medication but I'm getting there for myself."
16486,"I see a therapist, take meds, and exercise, but I'm finding it difficult to resolve these negativities, or at least make progress up the hill which at times feels like Mt."
16487,She's seen a doctor and she's starting counselling and probably going to start taking meds.
16488,I'm hesitant to get on medication because of a lack of understanding by my family (i'm on their insurance) and a fear of addiction.
16489,I was on meds like Clonazepam but it made me drowsy.
16490,"I wasn't panicky, I wasn't obsessing about stuff, I felt normal, and I was so proud of myself for bring able to feel good without medication."
16491,I guess I'm wondering if I should go back on my meds.
16492,I was so afraid of getting on medication (what if there are horrible side effects?
16493,I'm not on any meds by the way but I'm seeing a psychiatrist on friday
16494,"So for 2 years now, I've been trying several anxiety medications off and on, and for about a year now, I've been getting progressively worse electric shocks in my head."
16495,I went researching and found a lot on it being a withdrawal symptom of SSRI's so at first I didn't think anything of it.
16496,"Unfortunately, regardless of medicine, the progression of the shocks in my head are only getting worse."
16497,"I tried reintroducing sertraline 4 months ago but while I was on it, the symptoms still only got worse."
16498,"It is accompanied by fatigue, memory loss, muscle weakness, heart palpitations among other things."
16499,"Now reading about this withdrawal symptom, it sounded like the medicine should at least have an effect on it, which it doesn't for me."
16500,"When I went off of it more than a month ago, it still consistently got worse."
16501,"A month later, today, it is as bad as it has ever been and my psychiatrist has no idea what to do."
16502,"My question is, am I right to assume that this is NOT that symptom and possibly something neurological?"
16503,I've been trying to find something on it and not much comes up.
16504,"I have an appt with a neurologist on friday, but until then I don't feel like I can make it through each day."
16505,"The flashes are down to every 10 seconds, never turning off and never letting up unless I sit very still."
16506,I'd appreciate any help with this as I'm feeling impatient about waiting another week to figure something out.
16507,Thanks in advance.
16508,Edit: My anxiety is somewhat minimal a lot of the time so I don't feel like that has an immense effect on it either.
16509,I'm guessing I have a mild sort of anxiety and I'm not taking any meds.
16510,"Anyways, I was going to a doctor and was on a waiting list for a therapist, I’ve been through plenty of meds for depression and anxiety, my last prescription I’ve taken was a generic clonazepam, or k-pin."
16511,I’ve never driven in my life and I’ve only had one job in my life and that was through college when I was going and taking my medication.
16512,"The thing is, they are psychologists and not medical doctors so they will not be able to prescribe me any medication."
16513,"I have pretty bad anxiety &amp; even though I'm on medication for it, I'm super super jittery &amp; scared &amp; jumpy right now."
16514,"Hi, I've never posted here before."
16515,I suffer with generalized anxiety disorder and I finished a round of counselling to help with this a few months ago.
16516,I am currently on a waiting list for further sessions and at the minute I can feel my anxiety creeping back up on me.
16517,The hardest part I'm struggling with at the moment is the random feelings of guilt which develop when my heart starts racing too fast.
16518,"It feels like a heavy feeling in my chest, incredibly similar to guilt, although I have nothing to feel guilty about (rationally)."
16519,From there I start getting really disorganised negative thoughts and unbearable internal chatter and worry.
16520,"My anxiety seems to be getting triggered when I notice that my heart's beating noticeably fast, it's feeling heavy, and my anxiety spirals out of control from there."
16521,"I'm not sure what to do while I'm waiting to get back into counselling, rational thinking doesn't help because the negative thoughts and feelings just keep seeping back in."
16522,"I can barely sleep, I have no-one to talk to at the moment and I cannot control my thoughts."
16523,"Has anyone got any advice on how I can stop the cycle in the mean time, I've hit a really low point in my depression."
16524,"I used to take Propranolol which helped a lot for physical symptoms such as the racing heart, but I started to develop chest pain after taking it which would last for prolonged periods of time, so I stopped."
16525,Is there any other useful medications or things I can do to combat any of this?
16526,I appreciate any help.
16527,"Sorry if some of it isn't making much sense i'm really struggling to concentrate, and I can clarify if needed."
16528,Thank you!
16529,"Recently though I've been taking medication, and been using a bi-pap to combat narcolepsy, and sleep apnea."
16530,i just want to be normal and get rid of my anxiety by a more natural way without medication.
16531,"Let me mention I'm 4'11 and 96 pounds so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with how my body takes meds...anyways...I've been suffering with anxiety/ mostly social anxiety, paranoia and depression for years but progressively got worse these past few months."
16532,Went to my doctor and he decided Zoloft was the best bet for me to start on.
16533,"I took it last night around 4am before I went to bed (my sleep schedule is screwed I know) I woke up around 8am and started having really bad heartburn and nausea, I ran to the bathroom and started vomiting vile and this persisted for the next 2 hours."
16534,I was so miserable and my heart was beating really fast.
16535,My grandma thought maybe I got the flu or something and it's a coincedence but I read on the side effects and those seem to be them.
16536,"After I vomited, I wound up sleeping all day and just woke up, I just felt REALLY fatigue."
16537,The medications I take currently alongside Zoloft is Biotin pills for my hair and Ortho Tri cyclen Birth control.
16538,I don't take them all at the same time.
16539,"I was thinking 50mg might be too much for myself, and was thinking of cutting it down to 25mg?"
16540,Also was wondering what anyones experience with Zoloft was?
16541,"I'm willing to fight through these side effects if they only last a few days, but not if this is long lasting."
16542,"I have had a lot of anxiety over the years, I was diagnosed with GAD, depression, and PTSD and have been managing it with meds, RCBT, and stuff like that, and I feel bad for putting this on here because there are people with real problems."
16543,"I spent some time doing nothing, sulking, and then I lost my health insurance and had to stop the anti-anxiety meds cold turkey."
16544,"I know I still have a long way to go because my triggers still scare me and I want to avoid them, but I think meds are working for me so far and getting me out of crisis mode of non-stop panic/depression."
16545,I'm not currently on any medication and I really don't feel comfortable starting.
16546,Did you find meds that worked for you?
16547,"I haven't been in therapy for almost 15 years, and I'm terrified to go back (I had a bad experience with one in my teens, and it's just compounded in my mind that they're all going to be like that), but I know that I'm at the point with my anxiety/depression/ED that I need professional help other than medication."
16548,"That made me loss nearly every bit of self-confidence I had and I was regressed back to the level of a child, receiving medicine on a schedule from my father as I cried on my parents' sofa about how afraid I was and what a failure I was."
16549,I don't want to see a therapist because i know all they are going to do is recommend some sort of medication and i'd rather not become addicted to pills.
16550,"We don't talk about those things where I'm from, and we respect people less who need or think they need meds."
16551,"Hey guys, I need some help because I can see that things are getting really bad and I can't seem to stop it."
16552,"My anxiety and panic attacks started last November, I've tried different medications, only switching to the current one about a month ago."
16553,"I felt better at first, around Jan /Feb I felt much better."
16554,"Since then, I've gained almost 20lbs due partly to the meds and partly to me feeling like shit and eating to cover it up."
16555,"I've started a new job, which is OK, the people are nice and I've not had any issues with the work but I'm finding it extremely hard to cover the anxiety."
16556,It makes me feel physically sick and I'm not connecting to anyone anymore.
16557,"I'm talking to my friends less and less, I'm avoiding  going out and social situations."
16558,I feel fat and hopeless.
16559,"Over the past weekend I felt so low, my SO got worried and we had a talk about him helping me around the house more, especially now that we're both working, to maybe ease some pressure."
16560,"Nothings working, nothing is making me feel better."
16561,I'm just pretending that everything is OK when I feel like a black hole sucking the fun out of everyone around me.
16562,I don't know what to do anymore.
16563,"My Journey With Anxiety And Tips To Help You
Let me start by saying I am not a doctor or nutritionist, I have no formal qualifications to advise on anxiety, I simply speak from experience as one who has dealt with the issue my entire life."
16564,"So the most common pre-requisite I've found to suffering from anxiety and related illnesses is genetics, even if others in your family claim they have never suffered from ""panic attacks"" as such, look a little deeper and eventually someone will admit they were a little hesitant or quick to jump to negative conclusions."
16565,"For example, my mother, who knows of my condition has never once admitted she suffered from anxiety as a child or throughout her life, yet she openly admits to having a fear of taking tablets due to an incident were a whistle was caught in her throat and a fear of choking came about."
16566,She also shrugs off thoughts when she was younger about wondering if her heart would suddenly stop and typical anxiety related behaviour which is a clear indication that I'm predisposed to the illness.
16567,"I admit, this may not always be the case and secondly the previous generation didn't talk about such illnesses, it was almost taboo and anyone coming out asking for help was simply told to ""man up"" and move on."
16568,I'm going to start from the very beginning as I'm sure there will be manly similarities with my story and others.
16569,"I was born in a single mother environment, immediately a lack of a father figure impacts your mental upbringing, without the male sense of outgoing-ness children in a fatherless family tend to inherit more feminine qualities and thought patterns."
16570,"Such things as being over cautious are a textbook behaviour passed down, unknowingly from the female figure, without the presence of a male character a childs mind can only learn from example of their mother."
16571,"While having a nervous and cautious child may seem like nothing to worry about, eventually it sets the child up for a host of problems into their adult life."
16572,"Not only does the cautiousness turn into phobias and fears, the negative energy put on the body takes its toll on mental and physical development."
16573,"Accompany this with possible other life issues, personal, family, bullying, relationships, school and the individual from a mental perspective even if unknowingly is already in trouble and corrective behaviour and thought treatment needs to be used otherwise the rest is a quick and narrow decent into more serious issues such as: OCD, Phobias, Social Phobia, Excess Sweating, Yeast overgrowth."
16574,"Once some behaviour patterns become set and ideals are created, changing these thought patterns are extremely difficult."
16575,"Your body is simply a lifeless vessel that comes to life by our mind, if the mind is not healthy and giving off positive energy we cannot operate correctly or feel the world as it's supposed to be felt."
16576,"Next is the path most eventually arrive at which is the simple questions ""why am I here"" and ""why do I have to die""."
16577,"Granted these questions can be asked by any individual, the difference being someone with OCD or anxiety asking these questions cannot accept the lack of explanations to the question."
16578,Very quickly this can turn into obsessive thinking about certain issues that consumes both energy and brain capacity available to everyday life.
16579,"Hopefully I'm resonating with some people and by just reading this they don't have to feel alone or crazy, the truth is we don't know why we are here and we may never really know."
16580,"We could spend an eternity wasting our life worry about a question that cannot be answered, only to find ourselves in old age wishing we'd spent the time more wisely, well it's not too late!"
16581,"Here are few basic steps I've used to ""control"" my anxiety, OCD, phobia and so on."
16582,"Note, in my opinion we are genetically predisposed to this illness or at the least have had certain thoughts or ideas cemented into our thought patterns and as such, may never completely ""cure"" the illness."
16583,"We also have to remember ""fear"" and the fight or flight response is a natural human response, it's activated constantly and for the wrong reasons in individuals with anxiety."
16584,1.
16585,"Take a good sugarless multi-vitamin every day (if you have phobias of new medicines or foods, take half and sit outside the hospital or at the doctors)

2."
16586,Exercise!
16587,"(Once again, if you're anxious about your heart of your blood circulation when exercising, start very slow... e.g."
16588,"walking just for a few minutes to start) 

3."
16589,"Try to avoid listening or reading the news (media thrives on selling fear, you're only going to add to your anxiety by watching it, or even worse develop near phobias)

4."
16590,"Limit the types of video games or shows you watch (we have very active minds and a lot of this data is processed while we sleep and manifests as dreams)

5."
16591,"Set aside some time every day to just sit, close your eyes and imagine moving the negative fearful thoughts in your head to a box that cannot be re-opened."
16592,"(You could call this, meditation, it is also scientifically proven by projecting thoughts on a regular basis you gradually become more attuned."
16593,6.
16594,Face your fears!
16595,"(I know this is very hard to do, start small with what you'd categorize as a smaller fear or phobia, once you can prove to yourself it's safe and nothing will happen to you, the fear will start to fade)

7."
16596,"Talking about your anxiety or mental illness to someone

8."
16597,"Have friends that you can relate to and want to live the same type of life you want (I've had friends that life the ""drink like youre going to die tomorrow"" attitude, this is very self-destructive and puts negative strain on you""

9."
16598,"Get yourself a pet

10."
16599,"Go to the beach, the sun in moderation is good for your body (if you have a fear of the water you don't have to swim, if you are scared or the sand of what's in it, simply wear shoes)

Once you start getting more comfortable with doing what you fear, it gets easier and easier and your health will dramatically improve."
16600,"We aren't supposed to be on constant red alert, the stress this puts on our adrenal glands is huge, and this is why sometimes when we have a panic attack we feel buzzed or over-sensitive."
16601,"Should you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to leave a comment."
16602,"I take meds for my stress, seen psychologists my whole life, but as much as I'd like to deny it, I feel like I'm at a dead end."
16603,Within the last 6 months I've gotten some weird symptoms happening to me.
16604,"I have these episodes, and in the last 6 months they have happened probably about 5-7 times."
16605,What happens is my surrounding become unfamiliar.
16606,I know what they are and I can name things such as the buildings so obviously I am recognizing my surrounding despite being unfamiliar with them.
16607,However the big thing is I completely lose the ability to figure out how to navigate.
16608,"I can't remember where anything is or how to get anywhere, even the entrance to a store."
16609,An example: I was leaving a store one time with my girlfriend.
16610,We get in the car and I have to ask her how to get out of the parking lot.
16611,Then I had to have her tell me not only which direction home was but step-by-step direction on how to get back home.
16612,"She tried pointing and say ""This way, take that street."""
16613,but I was unable to comprehend it.
16614,"She had to be more exact with ""Go right at the next intersection with lights."""
16615,"Even ""Go towards the McDonalds"" was too much for me understand."
16616,During these I am described as being incredibly irritable and angry.
16617,I also don't really remember most of them.
16618,I can only recall 2 or 3 of them that I actually remember and it was my girlfriend that made me aware that it was closer to 5-7 times.
16619,"It has happened on campus, while driving, and in stores."
16620,I've had to be led to the exit or cashiers in a store a few times.
16621,We haven't noticed any triggers.
16622,Though we did note that I have a lot of trouble remembering how to get around in my hometown.
16623,I've had to relearn how to get around and frequently have to ask people for directions.
16624,Episode length varies but generally I get to my destination through the help of others before it ends.
16625,I take Zoloft and Abilify and have been on both for roughly 5 years without issue.
16626,I haven't taken any anti-anxiety medications such as Ativan for almost 2 years.
16627,My depression and anxiety is at an all time low and practically non-existent and has been for the most part for the last couple years.
16628,"I saw a counselor 2 months ago because I thought I was experiencing a depression flair-up since I was becoming lethargic, de-motivated, and having trouble sleeping."
16629,I was a bit stressed about my major and declining grades in my classes but after we got that sorted out all of those symptoms disappeared.
16630,The counselor didn't see any other issues.
16631,We met a few more times to make sure and we struggled to find any issues to discuss.
16632,I saw my primary care physician about my current issues and they said it is just anxiety and that I could go and see a psychiatrist to get my medications tweaked.
16633,I'm going to see my old psychiatrist but it may be several months before I can get in.
16634,I'm having trouble agreeing with my doctor that my issue is just anxiety but since I don't have a medical degree I figured I should ask if anyone has had similar problems with anxiety or their medications?
16635,I heard that Paxil has some really bad side affects when you try to get off of the medication.
16636,"Recently, I've thought about going to the doctor to try to get some type of medication for the anxiety, but I just don't have the guts to speak up for myself every time I go to the doctor."
16637,"I have ADHD and GAD, lately due to life stresses and school my anxiety is as bad as it's ever been."
16638,"My doc has highlighted two medications, Prozac and Inderal as possible treatment options."
16639,I'm tentative about Prozac because it's an SSRI and I fear the negative side effects might outweigh the good.
16640,I've recently heard a lot a bad things about long term SSRI use.
16641,"From my research Inderal seems awesome for performance anxiety, but fails to treat the mental symptoms (which I suffer from)."
16642,Right now I'm not sure if either of these medications are right for me and I'm open to exploring alternative medications.
16643,"I realise everyone benefits from different treatments, but what are some recommend meds for GAD and social anxiety?"
16644,"Bear with me, it's long:

There were no refills left on my anti-anxiety medication so I had the pharmacy contact my doctor for more refills."
16645,I made it very clear to her that I was completely out of medication and needed it immediately.
16646,"This is of course the medication that kicks out extremely quickly out of the 3 I'm on so I'm already having withdrawal symptoms-- headache, tired, irritable, nausea, diarrhea, and if this goes on longer I know I'll have other symptoms too because this happened once before."
16647,"I have some friends who are going through really, *really* shitty times, and it basically consumes my thoughts."
16648,I think I worry about their situation more than even they do.
16649,I'm always there for them when they need to talk but it actually just makes me even more anxious after the fact.
16650,"I've tried distracting myself: playing games, listening to music, exercising... nothing works."
16651,I can't even enjoy those things anymore.
16652,At this point I even worry about them in my dreams.
16653,"I have a Xanax prescription, but I only take it when I have full-on panic attacks, which isn't happening right now."
16654,I'll make it through tonight okay.
16655,But it is definitely affecting my quality of life at this point.
16656,"It's also worth noting that I guess you could say I'm in between therapists right now; the last one and I disagreed on some pretty fundamental things, but I'm working on getting a new one."
16657,I'm also planning on making another appointment with my psychiatrist to see if maybe any medications need to be changed as well.
16658,"Again, I'll make it through tonight okay, and I'm making sure to tell myself that as well."
16659,But I could really use some advice to work through this in general.
16660,I really don't know how much longer I can function in a constant state of obsessive worry like this.
16661,"Thank you to:

1) Anyone who responds."
16662,"2) Whoever put that note at the top that says ""Breathe."
16663,"Everything's going to end up fine."""
16664,It sounds silly and trivial but it helped me type this post up coherently.
16665,EDIT: I was wrong.
16666,I'm not making it through okay.
16667,I swear I can *feel* all the pain others go through.
16668,"All the suffering I read about, all the pain my friends go through."
16669,"And then I feel guilty because I know all these people are worse off than I am, which makes me feel even worse, and so on..."
16670,"I've posted here, r/depression, and other places and just... it doesn't get better."
16671,This won't go away.
16672,"I can't keep doing this, I can't eat, I can't sleep."
16673,I'm a train wreck.
16674,"I've been trying to take it one step at a time and get better, go to therapy, take my meds, try to breath."
16675,"Lately I have had overwhelming anxiety, and I have had pretty severe anxiety on and off for the past 8-9 years."
16676,"It's getting to the point where I need to do something about it, and I think I can greatly benefit from medication."
16677,I've tried therapy in the past and it really didn't work.
16678,"I'm a generally logical, optimistic person, I just can't control my fear sometimes, and that occasional overwhelming sense of fear can be best controlled by medication I think."
16679,I live in Washington state where it was recently legalized and I know that cannabis has been used for treating anxiety.
16680,"My experiences with cannabis have been mostly negative, most likely because I took it in combination with alcohol most of the time."
16681,"I am more willing to try using cannabis as a treatment alternative to prescription medications, which I know can have severe side effects."
16682,I tried Lorazepam in the past and I hated how I felt on it - it was like being drunk all the time and it gave me severe short term memory loss.
16683,Occasionally when I have smoked 1 hit of marijuana I have had a good feeling/sense of well being for a while.
16684,"My question is, have any of you used cannabis to treat your anxiety with success?"
16685,If so how did you use it?
16686,I have a good naturopath who prescribes medical cannabis and could ask her for a consultation.
16687,"I am on Zoloft, and I stepped down from the 200 mg to 150 mg dosage a few months back (this medicine has been impact my memory to an extent, and I have been trying to scale it back to regain some of it)."
16688,"I really want to explore some alternatives to upping my medication, because it has really depleted my short term memory for some reason (it use to be airtight years ago, now I am forgetting things (I am not sure if it is anxiety/depression/OCD invisibly manifesting in the time prior to working at the theatre, or due to long term use of Zoloft))."
16689,"Before anyone asks, Yes I'm on medicine (Celexa), yes I'm going to see a therapist."
16690,"I don't even know and I'm trying to think it through and these meds are making me feel weird as fuck and I just don't know, just as I get a bit of happiness in my life I doubt it."
16691,I was on meds for over a year and after seeing significant improvement my doctor recommended we stop the treatment and see how i would do without them.
16692,"I want somebody who I can talk to long enough to get a proper diagnosis (where a GP failed a few years ago), but I also want them to be able to prescribe medication."
16693,"on meds, off meds, in therapy, out of therapy."
16694,I feel like utter shit and I don't want to do a 4 hour round trip for my meds.
16695,"I struggled at the beginning but with medication, meditation and help from some friends I have made it until now."
16696,"So now naturally I'm just sitting here, worried that I have cancer or kidney disease or a terminal illness that i could have caught in time if I had gotten blood work before but now it is terminal..

Also I have had high blood pressure for about 3 years, so am afraid that i have an underlying disorder like diabetes or something else that is making it high, especially since my medication has had to be raised recently."
16697,"I've done it all to stop being so anxious-- medication, mindful meditation, therapy (found an amazing therapist through the International OCD Foundation that knows what he's talking about!"
16698,I'm scared to death that they might give me the wrong medicine because I read that bipolar disorder and depression are usually diagnosed wrong and if someone with bipolar disorder takes antidepressants it gets worst...
16699,It was amazing to see the change in her just adding a medication.
16700,"My question is to those of you on meds now or have been on meds, what do you recommend?"
16701,"I have pretty bad anxiety when it comes to social interactions, occasionally panic attacks as well, and I know that if I see someone about it, there's some medications out there to make it better."
16702,"However, I'm not very close with my parents, and I don't really tell them anything big, because they either pick fun, as most parents do, or don't take it seriously."
16703,"I know I need to tell them, but just how do I go about it?"
16704,"I have always been a pretty anxious person, but about two years ago it started getting worse and began causing me some personal issues."
16705,"I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with GAD and tried several medicines, many of which did not work and were antidepressants (some were lexapro, wellbutrin, paxil, and even hydroxyzine)."
16706,Last year everything started getting even worse than before and I was diagnosed with panic disorder.
16707,I was also put on several new antidepressants (Prozac among a few others) as well as .5 mg of xanax 3x daily.
16708,I started counseling at this point also because things still weren't working out with the antidepressants and xanax causes me to become sleepy and I am in school &amp; also work and being tired just isn't an option for me.
16709,(I still took the xanax when I could afford to be tired and usually just half of a .5 mg pill).
16710,I have now been in counseling at least biweekly and it has really been helping me with my personal life but not my anxiety and panic disorders.
16711,I need to know wtf to do.
16712,I am hoping that someone here has found something that works for them.
16713,"I do my best to keep myself occupied and relaxed when possible, I play video games, take hot baths, breath deeply, read, try to think about positive things, etc."
16714,"But I still get in these anxious ""moods."""
16715,"I have a terribly foreboding feeling, I get down, feel sad and I just feel nauseous from all of the adrenaline."
16716,"I get headaches, I panic, hyperventilate, feel like everything is completely hopeless, and I am so irritable and my emotions are a bit erratic during these times (I get really sad and emotional about certain things)."
16717,I am pretty scared of medications which is partially why I haven't taken some of the ones prescribed to me for long periods of time.
16718,I felt safe with xanax every now and then more than anything else simply because my dad takes it for the same thing and he is fine...but it just isn't doing the trick.
16719,I can't deal with being tired when I need to concentrate.
16720,"I am also overweight (Female, 5'10 &amp; 220 lb), which I've heard can impact mental health."
16721,"I beat myself up about it often, but I'm a compulsive eater at times and I have a hard time stopping myself."
16722,I believe it is linked to my anxiety.
16723,I lost 30 lbs a few months back but fell off of the bandwagon.
16724,I haven't found the motivation I had since.
16725,I am trying to use this anxiety to motivate myself...to use it for good and all.
16726,I usually have panic attacks after eating and while trying to fall asleep.
16727,My anxious moods can last an entire day though.
16728,"I've heard exercise is a great release, but I am so worn out from my physically and mentally exhausting job (+school) that it is hard for me to feel up to going to the gym."
16729,I also have a serious loss of motivation to do anything but sleep and eat (other than what is absolutely necessary like work and school).
16730,Can anyone give me some advice?
16731,Thanks Reddit.
16732,(:
16733,"I can't go to bars or clubs and talk to and meet people because of the anxiety (and that was true even before the last 15 months), not that I could drink anyway with the anxiety medication, and I have no idea how else to meet people (I've looked at meetup.com, nothing interesting by me)."
16734,"I'm new posting here, although I've been following on and off for years."
16735,I'm looking for some alternatives to daily medications for my anxiety.
16736,A little background: I'm 26 and I've suffered from anxiety attacks most of my life.
16737,Mine have at times even caused me to pass out.
16738,I have tried lexapro and cymbalta - both helped but the side effects were horrible.
16739,"I was then put on Zoloft which made me extremely depressed, which was scary because I have never been."
16740,I then weaned myself off of everything over a year ago.
16741,"I felt none of my doctors really cared or were helping much, especially when I mentioned repeatedly that I did not feel well on any of these meds."
16742,"I was doing very well until about a month ago, and now I'm really looking for new, natural alternatives."
16743,Thank you for any help you can offer.
16744,"My doctor was kind enough to call in refills every two months since then and CVS has a plan where both my meds are only $40 per month total, but I ran out of Klonopin on Tuesday and I'm going insane."
16745,"I've fallen back into drinking on my meds (did it last time I was on meds, five years ago, and it ruined me)."
16746,Does anyone else have experience with these two meds?
16747,What's been a good combination of meds that's worked for you?
16748,"I take 3 kinds of medication, morning: Fluoxetin 60 mg and Lyrica 100 mg (I should be taking 75 mg, but doc said I should try to see if I feel any effects from the meds when I raise/lower the dosage, as I've been complaining that they don't feel like they help any more *inhale*), evening: Mirtazapin 45 mg and Lyrica 75 mg."
16749,I'm also guessing it's related to medication as it's happened more often since I increased Lyrica with 25 mg.
16750,I'm really freaked out about what all this medication does to my brain.
16751,"Since then, I haven't had any appetite, even after being on meds."
16752,I've been on anti-depressants and other medication to manage severe panic attacks since it happened a year ago.
16753,"I'm not on medication right now, I was for about five or six years and slowly got off it."
16754,"I have the panic attacks under control, and am off meds."
16755,What worries me most is the feeling of being alone and undersupported by my fellow doctors (I am a pathologist and teacher in this branch of medicine).
16756,I've tried medicine and stuff like that but it doesn't seem to work.
16757,"I constantly have anxiety attacks at school, work, at restaurants, in public, etc."
16758,"No matter if I'm with family or strangers, I can't help but freak out."
16759,"In a class room, I need to sit in the back corner of the class."
16760,"If I sit in the middle or am surrounded by students, I get sweaty, nervous, and I constantly feel like throwing up."
16761,This happens when I'm at restaurants too.
16762,I usually go to the bathroom to escape from all of this and I sit on the ground for 5 minutes to take a breather.
16763,Mainly it's me being afraid of throwing up.
16764,I once had food poisoning and was stuck on a bus trip for 4 hours and I threw up.
16765,It was the worst moment of my life.
16766,"I've noticed a lot of things have been going wrong with me lately, (memory problems, immune system sucking, all these anxiety attacks, paranoia, lack of emotion/motivation)."
16767,"It really has been troubling me, especially with my boyfriend and school."
16768,I can't concentrate on homework or i'll feel like it's not important to do homework.
16769,"With my boyfriend, I just feel lack of emotion."
16770,"I love him dearly, but I feel like I'm missing something."
16771,"I was in an abusive (physically, emotionally, financially,etc) relationship before my current boyfriend."
16772,"I broke up with my ex because I realized that I could be with a better guy, like my boyfriend."
16773,"With my ex, I suffered major depression (I wasn't diagnosed or anything), and I constantly missed school and thought about dangerous thoughts."
16774,"With my new boyfriend, I felt better and safer."
16775,"But he had a friend who I knew liked him, and he always shrugged off my concern."
16776,"It would go so far as us arguing about me being jealous of her and he'd defend her, saying that they were just friends."
16777,I knew she obviously liked him when she only invited him and none of her friends to her mothers wedding.
16778,I went through his phone one day and found messages between them.
16779,"Her saying, ""you knew i always liked you."
16780,"sorry im drunk ill stop"" and he said ""no i like these flirty conversations :]"" They confirmed my suspicions and I confronted him about it later."
16781,We broke up a few days later and we eventually got back together after 4 months because he finally realized that he messed up.
16782,He is a much better boyfriend now and I can tell he truly cares about me.
16783,It took a while for me to develop feelings for him again and I still have those hesitant/doubts/ feelings.
16784,"I know I care about him and love him deeply, but I'm confused as to why I feel this way."
16785,It honestly feels like I can't care about anyone.
16786,It's still hard to remember that time.
16787,I am shaking even thinking about it.
16788,"Sorry for the long post, but I'm trying to give as much info as I can."
16789,"Not sure where to post, but I thought that r/anxiety would be okay."
16790,":/

I haven't had therapy or taken any medications."
16791,"I'm kinda a ""no drug"" gal."
16792,"What's funny about this is I'm taking a stress relief class, and it's not really helping."
16793,:p
16794,"For as long as I can remember, my sister (we'll call her Amy for the sake of the story) has struggled with anxiety and depression."
16795,"She was a very ""difficult"" child for my parents."
16796,Amy has been on multiple medications and seen many different therapists over her life.
16797,None of it helped.
16798,"When her anxiety is at it's worst, she attacks the people around her verbally."
16799,She will say the nastiest things she can think of.
16800,She blames my parents for everything.
16801,"She says they ""screwed her up""."
16802,My father regrets that he had on more than one occasion pushed her up against the wall because of how well she was able to push his buttons.
16803,"Now, Amy focuses all of her anger him, constantly reminding him that he has ruined her life."
16804,My parents got divorced when I was in college (about 8 years ago now).
16805,"She is now 26 and still living in our childhood home with my dad, she also has a 6 year old son."
16806,The father to her son is no longer in the picture.
16807,Amy doesn't have a drivers license because she refuses to try again after she failed the first driving test she ever took.
16808,Over the last year she has become anorexic.
16809,She's had heart palpitations and other worrisome symptoms from the disease.
16810,"She has always hated what she looks like, compares herself to everyone else."
16811,She truly loathes everything about  her life right now.
16812,"Amy will constantly remind us (her family) that she is the ""screw-up"" the sibling her parents hate, the one that can't do anything right and is the ""ugliest""."
16813,"Though, despite everything she is struggling with right now, she is managing to go to school to be a radiographer, and has been doing very well with it."
16814,So that's a little background information.
16815,"Very recently Amy has begun to say things to my dad like, ""I'm going to kill myself after I write with my blood on the wall that it was all your fault"" She continues to verbally abuse my dad (all in front of her 6 year old son, he hears everything that goes on) to her, my dad can't do anything right."
16816,"He tries to talk to her about it, tries to help her and it just blows up in his face."
16817,"And, her eating disorder is getting worse."
16818,We all know that the verbal abuse is a result of her anxiety.
16819,"We have all tried to talk to her, my parents have tried everything to help her."
16820,We try and brush off the nasty comments she makes.
16821,"But, she pushes everyone away."
16822,"She is very good at manipulating other people, everyone will bend over backwards for her, because no one wants to deal with what might come out of her mouth."
16823,We also feel like we have to tread on thin ice because of her son.
16824,"For example, my dad would have tried threatening to kick her out of the house if she refuses to accept help, only he doesn't want to bring his grandson into it."
16825,We don't want to have to involve DCFS.
16826,"Long story short, we don't know how to help her."
16827,She doesn't want the help.
16828,"We have thought about having an intervention, but fear that it will have an opposite effect on her."
16829,This has gone on for so long that we are all out of ideas.
16830,"We continue to cater to her, drive her to class and other places she needs to go, in an effort to support her while she is doing so well in going to school."
16831,We would hate to see her give up on school or withdraw even more.
16832,But things are getting worse.
16833,My dad can no longer handle her on his own.
16834,Is an intervention the right thing to do?
16835,"I'm not on any medication at all and I don't have a bad/unusual medical history, no abusive childhood, nor have I done drugs or had alcohol."
16836,I went off my medication due to feeling like a robot for 2 years straight.
16837,Cuz at this point I want to stop taking the medication
16838,"I was under the impression that I would simply be talking to a psychiatrist, getting some medication for my panic, and going home."
16839,"I have multiple diagnoses such as psychosis, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and severe OCD."
16840,I have one other that I would not like to share.
16841,I haven't stuttered ever before until recently.
16842,Is this normal?
16843,Ps it is not the cause of medications.
16844,"Stomach meds were switched to generic Protonix (proton pump inhibitor, acid blockers didn't work)."
16845,"Recently I decided to finally get help and today I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Lexapro and Valium

I've been advised to take both before going to bed which should be now but all I've been doing for the last hour is sitting up comtemplating actually taking my medication or not."
16846,Should I take this medication or not?
16847,"So I've been on Cipralex for about 2 1/2 years now, and I'm worried that I might be having more serious side effects from the medication."
16848,"I'm hoping that it's something else, as this medication has been working great for me in treating my anxiety and I haven't had a serious anxiety attack since I started taking it."
16849,I really don't want to ruin my progress by having to switch to another medication which may be worse for me.
16850,Did I get a bad batch of meds or accidentally given the generic brand?
16851,I decided to make a note to take my meds in the morning.
16852,I am concerned that my mind brings me images of places I've been and randomly associates them with things I'm doing or saying.
16853,For example I will be having a conversation online and when I think back to that particular conversation a certain place completely irrelevant to the conversation will come to mind.
16854,And then if I see that place again or think of it that exact conversation will come back to mind.
16855,This happens randomly but I'm concerned it's an issue with my thought process.
16856,"In more recent years I have, during certain times, had weird images in my head for certain words or things."
16857,Like a word will have an essence to it that I can see in my head.
16858,"Also numbers or letters have an essence or color..it's hard to describe but it's nothing I visually see, just a strong mental image."
16859,I know of synesthesia and have considered I could have temporarily developed it but from what I can understand it's not something that comes and goes.
16860,I don't know if me thinking of places and subconsciously associating them with things I'm doing would be related to this ...but I'd really like to know that I'm okay.
16861,"Also in case you need to know, I am not on any medications."
16862,Thanks for your help!
16863,(posting this craziness for all to read is making me almost have a panic attack)
16864,"Would a medication be useful, and worth it?"
16865,"I have a psychiatrist so it would be easy to get medication, but I take adderall daily and wouldn't want anything to interfere with it (I should mention that the adderall doesn't make me jittery, if anything it makes me less jittery unless I take a high dose)."
16866,"I'm afraid the doctor'll judge and think my cries and pleas are just an excuse to obtain *'dem meds'*, which is all kinds of stupid, as my doctor knows just as well as I do that I'm no drug seeker, but still: I cannot shake the feeling of impending doom."
16867,I personally decided to go with the first option and forgo any form of medication.
16868,There is by no means anything wrong with taking medication for anxiety (I eventually went that route after about 2 years) I just felt at the time that the best course of action for myself personally was therapy on it's own to see how that had an effect on getting my anxiety under control.
16869,"Just give me meds, or pretend to jot down some notes and then tell me to go home and lay down?"
16870,Well even the sleep meds don't work because my sleep schedule is MESSED up now.
16871,"- **Cognitive behavioural therapy**

- **The right medication**

- **Support from those close to me**

I cannot stress enough the importance of these."
16872,The medication is also immensely helpful.
16873,"Without CBT or medication, I would not be where I am today."
16874,"Medication is not a great solution since I already spend quite a sum for my asthma, allergy and psoriasis medication."
16875,"has anyone who has been on meds for a while ever had to adjust their med dosage for short term, situational anxiety, like job stress or death of a loved one?"
16876,"I did therapy, took medication, learned meditation (ADHD, so no real results there), and started the gym (3 years in, still attending)."
16877,I lost an insane amount of weight...to the part I was frightfully skinny.....Flash forward I'm 26 on a great set of meds and I see a counselor regularly....However when I have a extended period of stress or anxiety I stop eating.....the mere sight of food makes me sick.....
16878,"Just four days ago, I started taking Welbutrin, along with some other meds my medical doctor put me on, including a water pill for blood pressure and Pepcid for reflux."
16879,"It's only 150 mg, but I've never taken any kind of anti-anxiety meds before, so I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is normal."
16880,Even if I get meds do you think that would be enough?
16881,Throwaway because it's only a matter of time until my coworker finds my reddit name if he doesn't already.
16882,I've had General Anxiety Disorder for pretty much my whole life.
16883,"That plus misophonia makes life a great time for me because certain sounds make my anxiety worse which amplifies the sounds, making the anxiety worse and so on."
16884,Usually I can keep it relatively under control.
16885,"Or at least, I can work and go out and be pretty much fine."
16886,"In the last couple of weeks, my anxiety has skyrocketed."
16887,"I'm dealing with a lot of shit at work that I know contributes to it, but I can't not deal with it."
16888,I've started having pretty major anxiety attacks every day I have to work.
16889,"I also haven't been sleeping well because I wake up freaking out about things and can't get back to sleep, which makes it all so much worse."
16890,What do I do?
16891,"I take Xanax, but I don't want to have to take it all the time, especially because it doesn't really help unless I'm taking higher dosages, and that only helps because it makes me sleep."
16892,"For other medications, I was on Effexor for a while and it was awful."
16893,Both Zoloft and Celexa did literally nothing for me; doctor thinks I metabolize them too quickly to work.
16894,All I want to do is stay home and have peace but I can't.
16895,It's not like I can meditate or do yoga or anything like that when I'm at work.
16896,I have a hard time even going out with friends lately because it's been so bad that having larger crowds near me makes me tense and anxious.
16897,"She doesn't think I need to consider medication right now, and that was a relief."
16898,"You don't have to be a total mess before you go (I actually worried that I wasn't anxious enough to warrant a therapist) you don't have to go on meds (if you don't want to), and you don't even have to commit to more than one session."

Hi everyone!"
16900,I have been dealing my anxious feelings for about 5 years now.
16901,I've been too nervous to ever go to a doctor about it.
16902,I have recently graduated and have been going on interviews.
16903,Meeting new people and stressful situations make me feel so anxious I haven't been making a good impression and it is hurting my chances.
16904,This is making me feel the extra push to go to the doctor.
16905,So I have a few questions for you all!
16906,What can I expect if I do go to the doctor?
16907,I'm worried about going on medications because new things like that scare me.
16908,Has anyone had a lot of problems with them?
16909,Did they fix your anxiety right away?
16910,I am also worried that my anxious feelings are preventing me from losing weight.
16911,It seems unclear on articles I have read.
16912,Is this a possibility?
16913,Most of my social anxiety is due to my blushing.
16914,I'll start blushing on my chest then I get embarrassed about the blushing and then it gets so much worse.
16915,"This is why I get so nervous to talk to new people, especially men around my age."
16916,I'm in a wonderful committed relationship (4 yrs long now) so it is not because of attraction.
16917,Does this happen to anyone else?
16918,any tips?
16919,Thanks so much for listening!
16920,I really appreciate it!
16921,"The class of people that experience these extremely strong physical symptoms, often get diagnosed with ""panic disorder"" and are offered CBT or various anti-anxiety medication."
16922,Will this be looked back on in 50 years as one of the most embarrassing episodes of modern medicine that a large subset of people went misdiagnosed/undiagnosed due to apathy.
16923,"I left the school, and although I haven't been medicated, I'm on my way to recovery through lifestyle changes (I don't want medication due to family members having issues with it, and because I didn't have any anxiety before that year, I'm hoping my anxiety problems will get better over time)."
16924,"This time I couldn't hide it, Because now I had developed full blown panic disorder (Random panic attacks for absolutely no reason, Different to Free floating Anxiety) My parents knew everything, They brought me to the doctor who put me on medication (Zoloft) - Worst thing to ever have happened to me."
16925,"See, As I told in a mental hospital (Will get to this part of the story in a minute), Anti-depressants should be prescribed very very carefully to someone with hypochondria, As the extreme side-effects can make things worse, As can they very medication itself cause panic attacks to get worse."
16926,I rang my doctor every day asking what the hell this medication was doing to me.
16927,"They put needles in you, they give you medicine that causes horrible side effects, they put a tube down your throat or up your ass, they drug you and they cut you up."
16928,"I have to start off saying that I am only 17, but I have had anxiety for most of my life."
16929,Only a couple of months ago did I finally muster up the courage to be seen by a doctor.
16930,"The problem is, the only doctor in my area that takes my insurance is mainly a doctor for, how should I word it, kids that are court ordered to appear before a psychologist/ psychiatrist, whatever she is."
16931,"Anyways, ever since the first appointment, I have always disliked her."
16932,"Even though I am one of the few patients of hers that comes of their own free will, her and her entire staff is nothing but suspicious every time I go in there."
16933,"I have been on two medications so far, and on my last visit when I attempted to explain that the risperidone wasn't working, she didn't actually listen to a word I said."
16934,It took me half an hour to explain to her the exact details of how I was feeling and when the side effects occurred.
16935,"After that, she seemed confused and asked me, a child with no medical training, what she should do, as if her knowledge didn't exist outside of two anxiety medications."
16936,"I am really fed up of not being heard whenever I step into her office, and I really need a new route, just not sure where to head from here."
16937,"I used the sidebar links to try and find a new doctor that maybe I could afford, but there aren't many in my area."
16938,":( Anyways, thanks for listening and any thoughts would be appreciated."
16939,TL;DR: My doctor doesn't listen and her knowledge seems very limited.
16940,"Sidebar links utilized, no other docs in my area."
16941,Thoughts appreciated.
16942,"The doctor mentioned cognitive behavioural therapy, medication, exercise, etc."
16943,"but she has suffered depression in the past but is very, very against medication and the thought of therapy quite literally scares her."
16944,"BTW: M 18 have Socialized Anxiety Disorder and Generalzied Anxiety Disorder, currently have no meds."
16945,"A note about meds/supplements: while I appreciate the suggestions, I've tried lots of different meds over the years, and sometimes they help, and sometimes they don't, and sometimes I can't take them because of the side effects."
16946,"I am not on any kind of medication for my anxiety, I have been before but then I moved to another country and have yet to go see a new therapist/doctor."
16947,"Normally I wouldn't dream of going down such a potentially shady rout, but I'm an expat in a country where my medication--Zoloft--often isn't in stock, and my prescription is running low."
16948,Not to mention my doctor has recently prescribed me medication which has an (All be it rare) chance of making asthma worse.
16949,I've finally realized that I should see a therapist and see if there is any medication I should be taking.
16950,"I was on medication for so long, but I hated all the side effects and really felt like it took away from my personality."
16951,I don't want to take medication and I don't like going to psychiatrists because they just throw pills at me.
16952,I started seeing a new doctors closer to my school last month and she put me on a new medication that's really been helping me.
16953,I left for winter break soon after and I ran out of my meds this week.
16954,I'm really nervous about all this stuff and I've only been off the meds for a couple of days and I'm already starting to feel overwhelmed.
16955,I can't take my ADHD medication without the anxiety pills so I'm not going to be able to focus on anything.
16956,"I am currently taking medication, but I still do suffer from shakiness."
16957,I'm on medication and I see a counselor once a week.
16958,They don't believe in getting therapy or medication to fix anxiety.
16959,"My boyfriend has told me that he will talk to them for me, but again, I'm too worried it'll upset them and then end up going down the road of telling me I need to grow out of this problem and there's really no medication for me to take that will help me because it's not real."
16960,Appointments were basically all about medication and that was it.
16961,I had been forgetting to take my medication and was a little crazy.
16962,"I have been on anxiety meds, but I refused to take them as I thought I could handle this on my own, but I have finally realized with everything being so new to me, that I cannot handle this on my own and my boyfriend, well, I don't wanna have him stress over it too because he worries when I am like this."
16963,"I think it's well-known that medication use alone for anxiety isn't sustainable in the long run (tolerance, side effects, etc)."
16964,"I first went to the doctor to get help for my anxiety at age 17 which I'm almost certain came from all the stay's in juvenile hall mixed in with daily wellbutrin dosing some ""kind"" doctor thinking it would help my ""depression"" which I didn't have, I just didn't know the difference between anxiety and depression when I was that young so instead of getting anxiety meds he gave me depression meds."
16965,"I don't want some form of depression medication because I'm not depressed, I need anxiety medication for the attacks I'm going to get in public once I start to open my self up to the real world again."
16966,"I liked the medication I was on before, but since then I know these drugs have been in the public a lot and I don't want to come across as some guy looking to work the doctor over."
16967,Should I talk to the GP about going on medication for my anxiety?
16968,Therapy didn't help - in the past ... is it time to go back on medication?
16969,"I  keep my meds in my purse , just incase I need it at work."
16970,"I know how many I had taken , I keep track of my meds."
16971,Why the fuck would anyone take someone's anxiety meds?
16972,"The other two I eliminated from the list of possible suspects, are friends of mine that I know really well and they know that my meds is what keeps me from being a basket case."
16973,"Hi, I'm a freshman at my university studying medicine."
16974,I suffer from social anxiety and mild depression and have decided to give medicine a try.
16975,Today it seems like I've almost come back down and I had an anxiety attack for the first time since taking the meds.
16976,"oh yeah, I was put on medication for anxiety around 2 years ago (sorry I don't remember the name but I'm sure it was for mild cases of anxiety) but it really didn't help at all so I basically stopped taking it."
16977,"**Edit 2 (sorry):** I also took an alprazolam when I picked up my meds on my lunch, so hopefully it helps."
16978,"I did a ton of things for us including seeing my doctor, getting my medication increased/adjusted, and scheduled to start seeing a therapist."
16979,I'm 25(F) years old and I'm freaking out about a new job delivering pizzas.
16980,I hate getting so nervous all the time.
16981,"Last shift I got pushed into things that I wasn't mentally prepared for, which is probably a good thing."
16982,But I just get so much anxiety because I'm worried about doing something wrong.
16983,":(

And my anxiety is probably one of the big reasons that I don't have a career by now."
16984,I have a bachelor's and was hoping to get out of customer service / retail.
16985,"And I know it will be fine once I get used to it and know everything, but I just drive myself crazy worrying about anything that I don't feel fully prepared for."
16986,I know I shouldn't worry.
16987,"Worse case scenario, I fuck something up and get fired."
16988,"Oh well, I'd find another job."
16989,And that's pretty unlikely to happen.
16990,"I was on Lexapro for a while and recently went back off it, which is probably the reason I'm regressing."
16991,I just feel like I should be able to get through my anxiety and depression without medications.
16992,I need to find a therapist that does CBT or something like that.
16993,I just wanted to write out some of my thoughts.
16994,Thanks for reading.
16995,I'm so scared to take any type of medicine.
16996,How do you help someone who is terrified of taking medicine..
16997,"I’m hoping the meds will help me somewhat, and I’m waiting for an appointment with a psychiatrist."
16998,"I decided to describe what it's like to be me, an insane man."
16999,"On the outside, I project an image to be seen by others... A front to avoid the conversations and judgments that would go along with being seen as who I am."
17000,Who I am is hard to explain but I will do my best to paint an image.
17001,"Have you ever felt like you left the stove on, door unlocked or windows unlocked after you got 30 minutes away from home?"
17002,Well that is one of the many feelings I have.
17003,"I could be sitting at home and feel like the stove was on, so I have to check and wiggle the knob then after resuming my previous activity I feel that me wiggling the knob somehow turned it back on, or me locking the front door could have wiggled it just right that the latch came undone."
17004,This process happens to me countless times EVERY single night.
17005,Over and over and over.
17006,There are countless other things that I do.
17007,This is not an O.C.D.
17008,"that has to do with numbers, it happens until my wife wakes up and I can finally rest for a few hours knowing that she is there to make sure everything is OK."
17009,Even then there are times where I can't find the will to sleep which leads me to my next wonderful issue... Schizophrenia/Psychosis call it what you will.
17010,Close your eyes imagine being in a football stadium THOUSANDS of voices screaming.
17011,"Well it's sort of like that in my head, but take away the voices and words."
17012,It's a very difficult thing to describe.
17013,"I hear voices and other things yes, but I don't hear them in the same sense, there is too much going on for me to be able to listen to any one individually."
17014,It's almost deafening.
17015,"While this is happening I have images that I can't get out of my head, sometimes atrocious things that nobody should ever see, sometimes it's shadows absorbing what they are touching making the shadows grow, shadowy figures that just watch me."
17016,There is a lot more to those that I just can't even form words to describe.
17017,"Then there is Bi-Polar, that should be obvious to anyone I have ever known and anyone reading this."
17018,I get completely random mood swings depending on what my brain is doing at that time like the flip of a switch and then I don't remember  With the things above it gives me social phobia which leads to my agoraphobia.
17019,Leaving the house for me is one of the worst thoughts to me.
17020,How can I leave my house unattended with nobody to check the stove?
17021,What if there is a spark in an outlet that sets the house on fire what if me turning off the light switch to leave produced some sort of spark that would also lead to a fire and what if the doors or windows are unlatched and someone breaks in.
17022,"Regardless of how many times I've been told that it's illogical, it is logical to me."
17023,"If I told you 1+1 = 3, you wouldn't believe it, In my mind it's the same thing."
17024,"Now with all of the above going on in my worthless mind, what do you think the last 2 issues i'm going to tell you about are?"
17025,If you guessed anxiety disorder with panic attacks you were in fact right.
17026,Who wouldn't have consistent anxiety with everything above?
17027,I think this is the most normal part about me but at the same time it makes me the craziest.
17028,I can never stop shaking my hands are so used to it I've become numb to the feeling and don't notice it anymore.
17029,All of these issues have been developing in me my whole life.
17030,It was not caused by one specific event.
17031,"So far, countless medications, therapy and psychiatry haven't been able to fix me."
17032,I accept that this is me.
17033,I'm a person living in a world that I feel would be better off without him.
17034,Why is someone who can't do anything allowed to live when so many better people have passed away.
17035,The only reason I was able to write this was because I started it.
17036,My O.C.D.
17037,"produces manic episodes that won't allow me to stop something once I've started, the only thing that pulls me away from this is to check the things listed above (quite frequently actually)."
17038,"I feel that if i don't complete it, my heart will actually stop."
17039,"I understand I have issues in my head, I mean how many people are afraid of certain fabrics?"
17040,I'm not in the dark about my issues.
17041,"I can be open about them online at least, for a little at least until the anxiety settles in."
17042,Why am I writing this all down?
17043,The answer is....just because.
17044,If you made it through this thank you for listening to my story.
17045,The only thing making me weary is that I've suspected for years that I might need medication to help manage my anxiety.
17046,So I'm also wondering if I should just bite the bullet and go to a psychiatrist or someone who can otherwise prescribe meds.
17047,"For the past 8-10 months I've been suffering from anxiety and taking a whole bunch of meds and stuff (you get the deal) and I've recently found that i find it extremely hard to talk to girls even if I've known them before and used to speak to them frequently, I'm really not sure why this has happened or what makes me so nervous about talking to them either in person or through texting/messaging I mean I'm not nervous because I'm attracted to the girls or anything like that and it even happens with girls I don't know."
17048,"8 months ago he had a catalyzing event that led to a big breakdown, a hospital stay, and finally getting some needed treatment and medicine."
17049,He's been off his meds for a month.
17050,I didn't say much but had him take his meds and told him I wasn't going anywhere.
17051,Hi.
17052,Sorry for the length.
17053,TL;DR provided below.
17054,I've struggled with anxiety and depression since middle school.
17055,I'm 22 now.
17056,I started on Zoloft and stayed on it for years until it started making my feet tingle/burn at night.
17057,Skip ahead to a couple years ago...I was in a bad relationship and my then-boyfriend decided I was bipolar (looking back I now know that I was just unhappy and afraid to leave him.
17058,"He did a good job of making me believe I could never find someone else to ""deal with my bullshit"" ...my bullshit being basically everything about me, not just my anxiety and depression) and told me I needed to talk to my doctor about it."
17059,He basically went through a checklist on the internet and then told me to mention all these things that were wrong with me to the doctor.
17060,"Once again, now I know that most of those things were only because I was unhappy with HIM and the way my life was at that point."
17061,"So I went to the doctor, told him my boyfriend thought I was bipolar because [insert checklist here] and he prescribed some meds for it, just like that."
17062,I believe the first thing I was put on was Risperdal.
17063,It was awful.
17064,It turned me into a robot-zombie-thing.
17065,I had zero emotion.
17066,Like literally.
17067,"There was no happy, sad, angry, agitated...not even content."
17068,I was simply existing in a fog.
17069,Then I started lactating and noped right the hell off that shit.
17070,Then I was switched to Welbutrin.
17071,"Let me just say, I loved it."
17072,The only issue I had with it was that it made me severely constipated.
17073,"But it kept my mood, anxiety, and weight all in check."
17074,I miss it.
17075,Around this time I started seeing the nurse practitioner at my doctor's office instead of my doctor.
17076,He switched me from Welbutrin to Lexapro.
17077,"I don't remember the issue with the Lexapro, but I was switched to Effexor after that."
17078,The effexor was HELL.
17079,It actually caused me to lose my job.
17080,"It made me kinda zombie-like, killed my sex drive, made me feel like I wasn't even real...the list goes on."
17081,"When he started to take me off the Effexor, I had AWFUL withdrawals."
17082,I would have panic attacks driving to work in the morning because I felt like I was hovering over the road in my car and I couldn't see straight.
17083,I had to call my boyfriend numerous times at 5:30am to calm me down enough to not go off the road and so I would know I was actually still existing.
17084,"I had awful balance just walking around, I got really bad brain zaps, I couldn't talk straight...I was just so screwed up."
17085,I decided on days I felt bad I would NOT risk my life and the lives of others by trying to go to work.
17086,"It wasn't safe for me to drive and I worked at a factory, so I was around flames, machinery, AND I was a licensed forklift driver...the only one in our department on our shift at that time, which meant I had to drive it."
17087,"When he started taking me off of that, he started me on Lamictal."
17088,I stopped taking it shortly after I started because I was sick of bouncing from med to med and decided I just didn't want to be on anything except the Klonopin that I take as needed.
17089,Here's the fun part.
17090,I told my therapist what medications I was on (Effexor and Lamictal) and she asked what I was put on those for.
17091,"I told her that according to the paperwork from my doctor, I was being treated for bipolar depression."
17092,"She gave me a ""wtf"" look and asked, ""Why?"
17093,"I've been seeing you for 2 years now and have never seen even a hint of bipolar in you."""
17094,Wat.
17095,I was being treated for something I don't have for over a year.
17096,My therapist said I/the doctor should be focusing on treating my anxiety/depression.
17097,"My biggest issue is anxiety, and then the depression kicks in."
17098,Right now I am going off of the Effexor.
17099,(I had to go back up to my full dose after the withdrawals and then my doctor was out for a month because he had major surgery and just got back a couple weeks ago to try to take me off more slowly this time) and I'm taking Xanax.
17100,The extended release kind.
17101,"I'm not sure if it's withdrawals from the Effexor or the Xanax isn't working or if there is another factor here, but I am a MESS."
17102,I'm obsessing again.
17103,Cleaning.
17104,"Picking my hands, face, and lips."
17105,Not being able to fall asleep at night because I'm obsessing over death.
17106,Is my mom okay?
17107,Is my dad okay?
17108,Siblings?
17109,Grandparents?
17110,I don't have any great grandparents left.
17111,That means next in line is my grandparents.
17112,Then my parents.
17113,Everyone I love is going to be gone someday.
17114,Will my dad be there to walk me down the aisle and dance with me at my wedding someday?
17115,Will my mom be there to help me pick a dress and see her only daughter on her exciting day?
17116,Then there's my cat.
17117,He takes medicine 3 times a day.
17118,He's getting older.
17119,He's my baby.
17120,My baby won't be here forever.
17121,And my boyfriend?
17122,What if he finds someone else?
17123,What if something happens to him?
17124,I need a better job.
17125,I was making money before I lost my factory job.
17126,"I was working tons, but I was making enough money to be comfortable."
17127,Now I'm just back at the pizza shop two days a week.
17128,"I want to get a second job, but I feel so overwhelmed right now."
17129,Why do I feel so overwhelmed when I have no reason to?
17130,My life is going well.
17131,I'm starting school again in the fall.
17132,I live with the love of my life and our fur babies.
17133,We aren't struggling financially.
17134,So why do I feel so overwhelmed?
17135,Why do I feel like I need a vacation?
17136,That cross country road trip my boyfriend and I plan on doing someday.
17137,Or even just a little getaway.
17138,Maybe a cabin retreat.
17139,Maybe just a weekend to go see some cool places in our state.
17140,Why do I feel like I need a break when I have basically nothing on my plate right now to begin with?
17141,Thank you for reading.
17142,I'm going to cut myself off so I can put food in my belly.
17143,"Even if nobody reads or replies, it felt good to type it all out."
17144,**TL;DR** Was being treated for bipolar depression instead of GAD.
17145,Went through tons of medications.
17146,Just started taking Xanax.
17147,Feeling anxious and overwhelmed.
17148,Just want to buy a weighted blanket and retreat to my bed with my cat and boyfriend.
17149,Sleep until it goes away.
17150,I had a panic attack for the first time about six months ago.
17151,"It was terrifying, but once I figured out what was going on I was able to sort of talk myself down."
17152,"Since then, however, I've been afraid of having another attack."
17153,And last night I did.
17154,My anxiety levels have definitely been rising over the past few months.
17155,"I've been trying not to focus on it too much, but I also knew that the more I put it off, the bigger the explosion would be if I did have another panic attack."
17156,I was right.
17157,"Last night's attack was intense, and kept coming in waves."
17158,"I'd think maybe I was starting to calm down, and another immense wave of fear would come crashing down on me."
17159,"Eventually I was able to calm down enough to distract myself with a movie, and the storm within me subsided."
17160,My grandmother suffered from anxiety.
17161,"My mother suffers from it, and has been on several different medications over the years."
17162,"I was hoping I wasn't doomed by my genes, but apparently I'm not that lucky."
17163,"I've gone to my university's counseling center in the past for other issues, and have mostly been unimpressed."
17164,"I'm worried that if I try to get help there, they won't be able to help me."
17165,I don't want to live with this.
17166,"I don't want to be afraid of having a panic attack, terrified of having one in public or while with friends or family."
17167,I don't want to be a victim of my own brain.
17168,"It is also important to note that my girlfriend has been out of the country for 2 weeks and wont be back for anothee week, and I miss her tremendously, and my mind just wanders.......

My question really is, how do I control this without medication?"
17169,"I am a 30/m with social anxiety which seems to manifest mainly as ""performance"" anxiety - activities where I am expected to be good at something and the focus is partially or all on me."
17170,"These examples might seem silly to people with other types of anxiety but here are some: 

* Playing frisbee with friends (I had so much anxiety once that I sent a frisbee into a completely different yard - definitely didn't help)
* Playing beer pong (I'll start to tremble and miss the table completely)
* Karaoke
* Introducing myself in a group

After a few beers my fear is lowered and I can perform somewhat better in these situations."
17171,I wanted to see if anyone has similar experiences and has found a way to cope - either through medication or some other method.
17172,"I am currently on Mirtazipine and Buproprion which mostly help with my depression, but my anxiety isn't helped much."
17173,**tl;dr** I get nervous when performing in social settings and want to find possible medications or methods to get over it.
17174,I havent been on any medication since.
17175,I know on basically every medication for anxiety drinking is a big no no.
17176,Anyone having good results with medications?
17177,I was diagnosed with GAD about 3 years ago by a psychologist.
17178,I filled one prescription of Ambien and it got me through a patch of insomnia.
17179,I didn't see anyone else because I thought I could deal with it on my own.
17180,But I'm suffering with crippling physical systems and chronic insomnia.
17181,about how long after taking the medicine can i know that there isn't going to be a negative side effect?
17182,I am up for taking meds if need be.
17183,"I tried it last night and it definitely helped, but I hate taking medicine and don't want to take it forever."
17184,The first medication she gave me was Celexa (citalopram) at 20mg for depression and anxiety at the same time.
17185,"However, I have had issues with health insurance for the last year so I ran out in mid-June, I did not fill my script for a while, thinking the meds would cost me quite a bit because one pharmacy said it would be more."
17186,"Whaddup kids, I recently had some irrational relationship anxiety about whether or not I was happy and it's snowballed a bit and now I'm wondering why i'm interested in what i'm interested in, have the friends i have, like what i like and listen to what i listen to.. it's all completely irrational but is there any way i can sort this out for myself, or does anybody else at least feel similarly?"
17187,"and also I was prescribed prozac and hydroxyzine for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and honestly a bit of psychosis."
17188,Will these medicines help?
17189,What have your experiences been?
17190,Thanks a lot for taking the time to answer :)
17191,So has anyone else tried this medication?
17192,"I can't stand my current one--last time I brought up anxiety to him, he basically shrugged me off, told me to breathe deeply, and that he refused to give me any sort of medicine (I never even asked for anything of course) because it would ruin my life."
17193,"I understand some of the meds can be habit forming, but I felt very judged and brushed off and not taken seriously."
17194,Please don't suggest seeing someone or getting medication because that isn't an option.
17195,I do not recall the name of the meds at this moment.
17196,"After a few visits to the psych emergency center, which resulted in a very bad reaction between the medication they prescribed me and medications they never asked me about, I've finally managed to get myself 30 xanax XR."
17197,"Today was day three taking them, and I'm doing great for the first time in a while."
17198,"I dealt well when I got mani pedis with my friend, talking with the stranger touching me like it was just normal, which is not the normal for me."
17199,"Yesterday, I even went to Target by myself and didn't freak out."
17200,"Considering I'd gotten to the point of having delivery because I was unable to leave to go grocery shopping eat into savings, this was a big step for me."
17201,I'm just feeling so happy that I'm FINALLY on a medication that helps me feel normal and able to function.
17202,I hate how difficult it can be to obtain.
17203,My psychiatrist urged me to email my professors about it and to go to the school directly and seek accomodations for my problem and that I should tell them I'm on medication and am seeing someone about my problem and that it's actually gotten me hospitalized in the past year but I'm afraid I won't be taken seriously.
17204,"I don't really have time to see a psychiatrist, so I'm hoping my visit with our family doctor will be successful in either starting a medicine or pointing me in the right direction."
17205,I've decided that I want to see a psychiatrist for medication.
17206,"Breakthrough:
I have sought out Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, again, and am seeing a psychologist, in which I just started last night."
17207,This seemed to help a bit and she caught onto that many of my major bouts with anxiety have been close to catastrophic sudden losses.
17208,"Lost my uncle suddenly to a heart attack when I was young, lost my aunt to a rare complication at 16, two close friends were brutally murdered when I was 26, lost my grandmother earlier this year...

My therapist says we'll dig deeper into that, but for now my struggle with my own mortality and injury seems very real."
17209,Very scary.
17210,"Prior to this therapist I was seeing a CBT therapist in my old city, for 2 years but the connection was never made."
17211,"Current Situation:
I am a 28 year old physically healthy male, diagnosed with GAD and OCD."
17212,Recently I was knocked unconscious after an unruly fan at a sporting event hit me while I was defenseless.
17213,"This happened a few weeks back, I was rushed to the ER ended up with stitches (cheek was split wide open) and a clear good CT scan."
17214,"However my anxiety and panic attacks are back, very strong."
17215,"Unfortunately a sinus infection has come about but to me, of course, it's brain fluid...or my brain is hemorrhaging, or an array of catastrophic events."
17216,"When I went to see the doctor (walk-in) he was sure it was a sinus infection and gave me a Z-pack, however my heart rate skyrocketed the next day after taking it which made me more nervous about taking medications."
17217,I have another doctor's appointment today with a Primary Care Physician for a follow-up to my ER visit and whatever this sinus infection may be...
17218,I am new to the area due to job move into a new state so I did not have a Primary Care Physician in this state.
17219,"Side note, another catastrophic thought:
I have contemplated selling my car, as I believe it is re-injuring my head due to its lowered ride height and the bumpy roads...but my head doesn't hurt until I think about it."
17220,"Stupid anxiety, I love my car."
17221,6 wks later he suggests trying Vibryd because I had been on the citalopram awhile and he thought this was a worthwhile medicine to try.
17222,The medication does help my anxiety but I am quite upset about the weight gain.
17223,Have any of you guys noticed any weight gain on this medication?
17224,while on this medication?
17225,"If any of you stopped taking the medication due to weight gain, how long did it take for you to come back to your pre-medication weight?"
17226,"Have any of you guys ever been afraid to take meds, what are some things that helped you get over it?"
17227,What can I do if I have a bad reaction to my meds?
17228,When i was first on the medication I avoided drinking completely as is advised on the bottle and by my doctor.
17229,"In saying that, my mom only wants me to take natural meds like Neurolink for my anxiety."
17230,"I'm open to the herbal medicine route if there's any chance it will work, but I'd much rather stay away from prescription meds if there's any alternative.. those side effects sounds nasty."
17231,I understood that the medicine needed to run its course and it didn't occur to me until later that the medicine could have been causing those episodes.
17232,See how I feel without any meds then maybe go back on it or try another.
17233,I flipped out and started crying so bad and begged them not to make me take any medicine...
17234,"At first I was completely against any more medicine, but now I'm very happy to have them."
17235,"I am on medication which helps, but it's not a perfect fix of course."
17236,I had anxiety my whole life but never thought it was enough for medication.
17237,My psych today brought up the conversation I've been avoiding; trying to bring down my dosage of my adhd medicine to a smaller amount or even ween off completely.
17238,I never really experienced anxiety until going off my meds.
17239,I'm stuck in a rut right now so I feel that meds might be my only option towards sanity but feeling that I'm throwing in the towel too soon.
17240,She prescribed me some medication (escitalopram) and honestly it's been the best month+ in my entire life.
17241,"I have been diagnosed with GERD, but don't take much medicine for it."
17242,"I was desperate for relief, alcohol makes it worse in the long run, and I currently have no medication."
17243,Is this because of the medication switch or just the food I ate?
17244,I am currently not on any meds I was on Paxil two years ago but stopped cold turkey.
17245,Today I was prescribed with Prozac and Xanax to fight my depression and crippling anxiety.
17246,I was wondering if anyone here takes these medications and how they work.
17247,with each other or separate.
17248,thanks!
17249,How did you get over it?
17250,"I was asked to make a list of pros and cons and this is what I came up with, by the way:

pros:
 - might help me feel better


cons: 
 - need to learn to take pills
 
 - need to take medicine every day

 - need to commit to whatever it will do to me for however long it will last

 - probably have to try multiple different medications to find one

 - possible side effects

 - possible withdrawals

 - feels like a crutch"
17251,"The last stuff I was on (cipralax) made me manic apparently, couldn't really sleep but at least I felt good (motivated, energetic), it just seems like any medicine I take is going to have side-effects that mess me up more than what I'm being treated for in the first place."
17252,He even asked about my medication regimen and spoke about his wife's.
17253,"I have suffered anxiety for many years now, I've been able to manage it pretty well without meds."
17254,i cannot get prescribed medication because of my history.
17255,Hello.
17256,I've just recently been lurking this subreddit so I figured I may as well post.
17257,"To give a quick summary, I developed anxiety back in high school."
17258,And they put me on Paxil.
17259,I've been taking it for about four years now.
17260,"I started on 20mg, did that for about a year or so."
17261,"Then I had to up to 40mg, and I did that for about 1-1/2 years."
17262,And finally I was able to ween myself back down to 20mg for the last 1-1/2 years.
17263,"About 2 weeks ago I had a pretty decent anxiety attack and ever since I've been in a ""fog,"" I haven't felt normal ."
17264,"So after a couple days of not feeling right, I thought I would up my Paxil to 30mg and see if helps."
17265,It's only been about a week since I've been taking the 30mg so I'm not sure if it's going to make a difference.
17266,I went to the doctor the other day to see what they thought I should do.
17267,They suggested that I try switching medications since Paxil has been the only one I've taken.
17268,He recommended Zoloft.
17269,"He also said that I don't really need to do any kind of transition from one to the other, that I should just start taking the Zoloft instead of the Paxil."
17270,"I have some hesitations about starting the Zoloft, I'm just not sure what to expect."
17271,I was just wondering if anyone on here has down the same or has any similar experience or advice that they'd be willing to share.
17272,Anything helps.
17273,Thanks.
17274,"As of tomorrow, I will be on medication for my anxiety."
17275,I have a dual diagnosis of anxiety and ADD and the psychiatrist I just started seeing wants to medicate me for the anxiety first and then add other medication in a few months.
17276,"Hello,

I (26f) am new to this subreddit and was hoping you could offer me of help."
17277,"I've been diagnosed with acute anxiety disorder, depression and late onset PTSD."
17278,"I'm in a therapy group for it and seeing a psychiatrist - however, he put me on two medications."
17279,"I am very uncomfortable with taking any sort of meds, but he said they were necessary."
17280,"1) Teva-Trazodone
2) Novo-Pranol

Has anyone had any experience with these?"
17281,Thanks for any help you can offer me.
17282,"It is supposed to be a short-term medication but it is the only thing I have found that has worked while also offering me enough clarity to function, so my Dr. and I made a conscious decision to keep me on it for as long as is necessary and then do a controlled withdrawal."
17283,I come here today to ask if maybe trying medicine to overcome or numb anxiety is helpful.
17284,so which medicine should I ask from my doc?
17285,"I do take anxiety medication (I take Zoloft everyday, and have Xanax that I use maybe once a week, if that…I try to avoid it unless I really need it…I’m wondering if I need to start taking a tiny bit ~30mins before I drive or if that would be dangerous)."
17286,I do not take medicine as it scares me.
17287,She says to hold off on going back on meds until I've pushed through.
17288,"Other than those few months when I was beginning recovery from anorexia but wasn't yet on meds, I haven't had any experience of coping without meds or the eating disorder."
17289,Or do I take the easy route and go back on meds?
17290,"I don't want to be on meds forever, so I'd eventually have to come back off them."
17291,"I've tried medication, but the first pill they gave me (mirtazapine) possibly made my symptoms worse, and i was puking every morning."
17292,I haven't been able to get myself to stick with any medication since.
17293,"Part of me wants to get medication, even though there could be side effects... it can't be worse than losing her."
17294,I only have a month of medication left and I can't decide if I should start weening myself off of it?
17295,"The medication itself is dirt cheap, but where can I find a doctor who will prescribe it to me?"
17296,I'm hesitant to take medication because I rely heavily on my brain to do my job (software development) and I don't want to take anything that could dull my ability to do my job properly - I'm doing pretty well just now and I would hate to compromise that.
17297,"Anyways, I was on the meds for about 8 months or so and when I felt strong enough and talked to my doctor about it, I weaned off and have been off meds ever since."
17298,I'm about a week and a half into taking the meds and I've only gotten worse.
17299,I know the side effects are amplified the first few weeks and it takes a minimum of 2 weeks-month for the meds to do their job but I'm at the point now where I can't sleep and can't eat without gagging.
17300,Basically I just need some encouragement that the medicine takes time and to stick with it and I will get past this terrible in between period.
17301,"I tried different meds, meditation, forcing myself into more social situations but nothing is helping."
17302,"Dad gets very annoyed by this , says it's blaming him
 
6) Going back to the ex things went to shit after coming off my meds, I started obsessing over her guy friend, the significance of his nickname 'Superman' (as in is he the ultimate Alpha Male?"
17303,"I really want to try anxiety medication but since my insurance is about to switch, I don't know where to start."
17304,"I have tried medication, meditation, CT scans, therapy, acupuncture, exercise, aromatherapy, and while a few showed limited success, nothing substantially helped."
17305,Its better to take less meds than to take more if theyre unnecessary.
17306,"I've experienced weight gain, sexual side effects, and lethargy/apathy, so I went to the doctor to get my meds adjusted or to add Wellbutrin."
17307,I went to my GP today and all he offered was medication.
17308,"I've recently started the medication shuffle and right now I'm on 112.5 mg effexor and 100 mg zoloft nightly, with the effexor scheduled to go up and the zoloft down at my next psych appointment."
17309,I'm 25 year old female and I've been suffering from anxiety since I was a child.
17310,"My grandma (who raised me) died of cancer when I was eight, and I became emetophobic after seeing her suffering through the chemotherapy."
17311,"I had my first panic attack when I was twelve, and I've been on a roller-coaster of 'better, worse' anxiety ever since."
17312,"During the past six months, my anxiety has been worse than ever before."
17313,"I got a job as a cook at a very fast paced 'in the spotlight' open kitchen, and three months into the job I had a major panic attack at work."
17314,"Then two more over the next few weeks, and finally I had to leave my job entirely."
17315,"I've always been reluctant to take medication, but I was really trying to crazy-proof myself for work, so I got a prescription for Ativan and Buspar."
17316,"Bupsar (which worked wonder for my sister, who has social anxiety issues) somehow increased my anxiety, and it got worse and worse until I stopped taking it after two months."
17317,I also started seeing a therapist (I've gone four times over the same time period).
17318,"So, I got a new job."
17319,"A really easy office job where I basically work by myself when everyone else has already gone home - super relaxed, barely any pressure EVER."
17320,"However, my anxiety is totally taking over my life."
17321,"I feel incredibly sick from the moment I wake up to when I go to sleep, I can never quite catch my breath, and I have panic attacks several times a week (always at home)."
17322,"I can't take the bus without feeling like I'm going to be sick, so my boyfriend has had to drive me to and from work since I started my job a month ago."
17323,"I can barely go outside - I feel like I'm going to collapse the moment I walk into a mall, or the grocery store."
17324,"I get so stressed out going to work that I spend all my days off crying and sleeping (during work days I can barely get any sleep, and wake up two or three hours before my alarm)."
17325,"I used to jog in the mornings, but barely do anymore because I can only go ten minutes before I start to have a panic attack."
17326,"I feel like I need to take time off everything - life, jobs, etc in order to get better."
17327,I don't even know where to start - nothing is working.
17328,"I just feel like if I quit my job, this absolutely wonderful non stressful anxiety-dream-job (and there is NO way I can get time off work, considering I've only been there for a few months) then I'm never going to be able to find anything else that even comes close."
17329,I don't know what to do - every single day is such an incredible struggle to do the easiest things.
17330,"My boyfriend is incredibly supportive, but I feel insanely guilty getting him to drive me places and do all the grocery shopping."
17331,"Agh, it's just so frustrating."
17332,"I've done extensive research on anxiety - medications, alternate treatments, nutrition and exercise therapy -- but with all of these constant physical systems, I don't feel well enough to start anything."
17333,"If anyone has been in the same place as me and has any suggestions, I'd really appreciate it."
17334,"I know as things are right now I'll probably lose my job anyway at some point, but I would really rather not."
17335,"I've had anxiety since I was young, and I've made huge strides with the help of medication but not even a month ago, I had a full blown panic attack."
17336,"I've also been kind of avoiding seeing a doctor because that's also not very *me*, and also because I don't want to be put on medication."
17337,"Hi Anxiety Reddit,

Today I had a negative social interaction with a neighbor and landlord."
17338,"In short, it involves me not getting a chance to fully clean up my mess when changing my oil, transmission fluid, and differential oil in my car since I finished late last night and wake up early for work."
17339,I was going to do it after I came home from work.
17340,"In hindsight, perhaps I should've put up a sign or note."
17341,"Anyways to fast forward, old retired female neighbor was appalled and bought kitty litter to soak up leftover residue in community car port."
17342,She's an old bitchy lady in her 80's or 90's that complains about everything.
17343,Came home from work around 7pm got bitched out by both the neighbor and landlord who are both really old ladies and had to clean up the kitty litter that was set down.
17344,I was a bit embarrassed because many people were around (e.g.
17345,"neighbors, maintenance, landlord's family, and others)m but I was like I don't really care for some strange reason!"
17346,My landlord ordered me to clean up the litter.
17347,"I did as such, and I felt 'zen' at moments and 'negative rumination' in other moments as I cleaned."
17348,"I kept wanting to ruminate regarding this event, but after a few seconds of rumination, I switch back to 'I ain't even mad' mode and back to rumination for a few quick seconds and then 'I ain't even mad' again."
17349,"Later, I went to the gym to wind down from a busy day from work and various other stresses."
17350,It's strange and weird.
17351,"It's what I've always wanted, an decrease in my perpetual rumination... but it's foreign to me."
17352,I kind of want to ruminate because I feel like I think up solutions best (though probably not really) when I do so.
17353,I guess old habits die hard.
17354,"And I don't even know what solution I would come up with, haha."
17355,I don't think there is any.
17356,Bitchy old ladies are going to be bitchy old ladies.
17357,I've been a life long worrier and anxiety sufferer.
17358,I've also have a history of depression.
17359,My achilles heal is social interactions.
17360,I've always had rumination problems after negative events and negative social interactions.
17361,It's in the realm of social anxiety says some professionals.
17362,I've also worried about the future too and adult life and many other random things.
17363,Recently I started taking 5-htp - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-Hydroxytryptophan I've been taking 100mg dose before bed time for roughly a month.
17364,"For me, it's a great sleep-aid and anti-anxiety supplement."
17365,In the past I'd stay up hours due to years plagued with insomnia and rumination before bed.
17366,I take it before bed time and I'm off to dream land really quickly.
17367,I also cut out coffee from my diet though I was never a big coffee person.
17368,"Also I love my car, yesterday I put a deep scratch on a painted plastic panel beneath the door due to not fully removing the car jack."
17369,"I was a little upset, but then I thought ehh car's can be replaced or simply that plastic panel can be replaced when I have the money and time to take care of it."
17370,It's not even that noticeable from a distance.
17371,I recommend 5-htp it to all anxiety sufferers and those who have problems with rumination that don't want to take prescription medications and/or can't afford traditional therapy (I know I can't as of right now).
17372,"Though if you kind of want to ruminate and dwell on it like me, you're SOL, haha."
17373,Though I really shouldn't ruminate on it.
17374,Water under the bridge they say.
17375,Other things that I have been doing to calm my ass down aka kick the anxiety habit.
17376,I've been practicing yoga and meditation more often.
17377,I also saged my apartment.
17378,"I'm happy to discuss anything with my fellow reddit users regarding my experience with 5-htp and other things I've experimented with (St John's Wort, Prescription Anxiety Drugs and Anti-Depressants, etc...) and the decline of my anxiety and anything that may cross your mind."
17379,I'm here to chat!
17380,"While Xanax helps me, it also makes me sad in retrospect because I know I'll probably never feel like that without the medication."
17381,"Please, anyone - I'm alone traveling right now, without my meds or the people I love who help me end the cycle of negative thoughts."
17382,This was all fallowed by a feeling of depression I have not had to endure since starting meds.
17383,A type of medication?
17384,"I guess the next thing to do is to try medication again, but last january I had such a bad reaction to Zoloft I don't know if I can do it again."
17385,I'm so freaked out by medication.
17386,"**Background**
I've never taken medicine for my anxiety."
17387,TLDR: I have a dog I love more than anything in the wrong who's sick all the time.
17388,I get HORRIBLE anxiety about it.
17389,I want to know how to cope.
17390,So I have a 3 year old yorkie who has a liver shunt condition since birth.
17391,Since getting him we've had to take him to the vets And emergency vet 20-30 times.
17392,Raking up bills well over 15k.
17393,I have anxiety and depression and have had it for at least a decade.
17394,When my dog gets sick it gets so bad (For me) that I can't even go to the ER vet with my wife.
17395,She has to go alone.
17396,I NEED 1mg of KP to just get by that day.
17397,My anxiety is so bad about worrying about my dog that it beats everything else out.
17398,I've had family members get diagnosed with cancer etc and it doesn't come close to the horrible emotions I feel with my dog.
17399,It's gotten to the point where I could basically have a full blown anxiety attack when my wife looks at my dog the wrong way (As if she thinks he may be sick or something).
17400,Full on anxiety if he throws up or looks slightly different.
17401,I just want to learn how to cope.
17402,That's all.
17403,I want to learn how to get by these situations.
17404,Hopefully learn to accept the dog for how he is and let go worrying about him dying all the time.
17405,I've already seen 3 therapists in the past and have been on all medications.
17406,Willing to read or learn to just not feel as much as I do now about him.
17407,"I feel like I should taper off the medication and deal with my anxiety in a natural way (meditation, working out, eating right again, etc.)"
17408,"That is what I wanted to do in the first place, but my mom insisted on the medication."
17409,"I'm too nervous to tell her about the suicidal thoughts, but I really just feel like I shouldn't take this medication anymore."
17410,"I am untreated (no meds), and have no access to doctors or other people due to my living situation."
17411,"Don't really want to start on meds for the panic attacks, since I got a friend and she has 5 different personalities depending on if she is sober, drunk or meds."
17412,"He is unwilling to see a new therapist, try new medication, etc, basically anything that'll allow him to cope with this."
17413,"I am not currently on any anti-anxiety medication, or anti-depression."
17414,Its killing me to wait but I don't want to be dependent on medication.
17415,A little backstory- I had been trying to ween off my medication since June with my doctor and that night was my 3rd night with no medication in my body (I have been on medication for 5 years) I wanted to stop relying on a pill to make me happy and to see what I really am without help.
17416,I hate that I need medication.
17417,But my doctor said that the panic attacks was a withdrawal symptom from my medication...didn't let me now beforehand that this would happen to me though.....
17418,So I was put back on my meds as my body is now reliant on it and she gave me another type of medication incase I get another panic attack.
17419,"And if I did get one, could I take my medication to calm me down?"
17420,Would something like anti-anxiety meds help this?
17421,My question to you guys is how do I talk to my dr about this without coming off as a nut job or seeming like I'm looking to score some anxiety meds?
17422,"Plus, I'm sleep deprived and forgot my anxiety meds at home."
17423,"I finished therapy a few weeks ago, and I've been on some medication, and I'm feeling so much better."
17424,Can your dog really sense you emotions and respond (like getting you to take medication when in panic)?
17425,Do they remind you to take your meds everyday at the same time?
17426,"So my question is, has anyone experienced the anxiety meds not working due to the anti-depressants?"
17427,My mum convinced me I needed to go to the GP and specifically request for medication seeing as therapy had done nothing for me.
17428,"I was scared to speak to her, but my then counselor had written a note explaining the problems I was dealing with and seconding my request for meds."
17429,Maybe I am just anxious about the medication or maybe it is a true side effect.
17430,Almost a year ago I quit doing drugs because they were a detriment to my mental health.
17431,"I had a breakdown, I tried to check myself into a psych ward, I was forced to go to detox for help."
17432,"I was on two medications for depression and anxiety for years, but in detox they put me on two more."
17433,I ended up going through a duel diagnosis substance abuse/mental health program for three months and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.
17434,Since then life has been difficult and wonderful in many ways.
17435,The medications and sobriety helped a lot so I stuck with the program.
17436,I had to completely uproot my life in order to stay sober and try to maintain some semblance of happiness.
17437,It has been really hard.
17438,I don't have very many friends these days.
17439,"Despite all of that, I've worked really hard at building a new sober/mentally healthy life."
17440,"I got a new job, dropped my unhealthy friends, was single for a year, do yoga, and really WORK on being happy."
17441,But then I stopped taking one of my medications (with doc approval).
17442,"Everything was okay for a few weeks, but slowly I find myself more anxious."
17443,I clench my teeth a lot and think about tons of things I can't control.
17444,"I recognize my thoughts and can attempt to divert, but it doesn't last for long."
17445,"I do not want to go back on more medication and am convinced that I can handle this with exercise, but so far haven't taken those steps."
17446,I hate this shit.
17447,When I get down I wonder what the fuck I ever did to deserve these problems.
17448,I've worked so hard and to have these feelings coming back is like a slap in the face.
17449,"I recognize that this is my life and that I need to deal with it the best that I can, but it doesn't prevent me from getting frustrated."
17450,Thanks for letting me vent.
17451,I drank a couple nights ago but it was after I had taken my medicine 12 hours prior.
17452,Today I was wanting to have a lunch margarita but usually take my medicine at about 10.
17453,"I told her everything: how I've felt alone since I started school, how I started medication but had since stopped taking it because it wasn't helping, how I was falling behind with my work but that I still wanted to be in the program."
17454,I guess when I go back I'll do that since it seems like the only thing new that doesn't involve medication.
17455,"I went to partial hospitalization two months ago, and got on a new medication."
17456,Since then I saw a second psychiatrist who agreed that I could come off meds slowly with regular checkups.
17457,"I have been completely off medication now for three months and am struggling, I am more productive at work and making far more progress with my masters and other duties but I am having such trouble sleeping, nightmares and anxieties that seem to come up the minute I lay down at night."
17458,I know I must see the psychiatrist but I so much want to be able to cope with this without going back on medication.
17459,"I do not think I am bipolar, I think I may have anxiety problems but as it is now I am wary to speak to the psychiatrist again in case she just re-diagnoses me and puts me back on the medication."
17460,I posted this here because I did not want to trigger any bipolar people to come off their medication.
17461,"It all started three years ago when I was 27, while in the midst of a brutal year long lawsuit, I got up to go to the bathroom after I was just getting ready to fall asleep."
17462,"I had a gran maul seizure, this was the first I had ever had."
17463,Epilepsy runs in my family so we just attributed it to that.
17464,We were wrong.
17465,"After a few months I started feeling different, I got in an argument with my wife I was very mad and that stress and anger caused my head to twitch violently to the left and I would actually spin in a few circles to the left before it stopped."
17466,This would happen on a regular dose of Keppra.
17467,I started on Lamotragine after two of these episodes.
17468,"These head twitches have mostly stopped but they will return if I am really tired or hungover, alcohol will cause them."
17469,"The next part of this nightmare is the worst, I started having episodes that mimicked precisely a petite mal seizure."
17470,"When one of these episodes occurs I will not lose consciousness, I lose control of my brain and body, I will stand up, walk away from where I am randomly, I fumble with my pants and pull them up, I also put my hands behind my head and take deep breaths, my nasal passages dilate fully and I breathe very deeply."
17471,"I blank out and I cannot communicate with anyone, I get nauseated and a heavy brain fog."
17472,"I got an eeg and it was negative, they continued.I was put on a litany of medications from anti depressants which hurt my stomach, to anti anxiety meds."
17473,They continued.
17474,I had an ambulatory eeg I had many of these episodes during my ambulatory but every result was negative.
17475,I have had an MRI but the results are negative.
17476,As mentioned before these episodes can get worse after I drink and don't sleep.
17477,"They will also occur when I am nervous, during pauses in conversation with people."
17478,I have social anxiety which seems to exacerbate these episodes.
17479,"Now I have seen a psychiatrist, she didnt think there was much wrong with me, im not an anxious person in general."
17480,After i was put on high doses of lamotragine and depakote at the same time to control these “absence seizures”.
17481,When it did nothing my neurologist told me there was nothing more he could do for me.
17482,"Currently I have many of these episodes a day it is a nightmare, they strike seemingly randomly I have tried to (just had one) track the food ive eaten and cannot find a correlation."
17483,Right now I think they are some sort of anxiety attack that blurs the line between anxiety attack and seizure.
17484,I have a hard time functioning in life this keeps me from wanting to do anything social because I am afraid of making a fool of myself.
17485,"I am now on Effexor and Lamotragine for seizures and anxiety, Nothing is working, I am going to stop the Efexor but continue the Lamotragine."
17486,I am not sure what to do next.
17487,It seemed that my only choice was to use medication to treat my symptoms.
17488,And then I remembered Chinese medicine.
17489,"Chinese medicine isn't a cure all, but then again, nothing really is."
17490,I understand and am fully aware that medication is  necessary for some people (I prefer you to be alive &amp; medicated than be all dead).
17491,If my symptoms weren't improved or if they worsened I definitively would have taken medication.
17492,I wanted to share my story since I know a lot of us are apprehensive about taking medication.
17493,"I am on Day 5 of taking the meds and feel worse for longer, but not as elevated during an attack."
17494,I spend a lot of time walking/running on my own to combat the symptoms or side effects of the meds.
17495,"Do I stay on this medication, and for how long?"
17496,I only take meds for ADD
17497,I'm confident that I can somehow beat this without resorting to medication.
17498,"So I'm kinda sitting here without any particular desire to do something productive and no fear of the consequences if I don't, and am curious if anyone else has dealt with the same thing and how they overcame it or if it goes away as my brain gets more used to the medication."
17499,"Between seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, and taking medication, I'm doing pretty well with my anxiety."
17500,"Since I freeze up, I can't get up and take my medication, or get a drink of water, or anything."
17501,My medication was in the SAME ROOM.
17502,"Other meds I am on: 

Propranolol 10mg 3x daily as needed (to address physical symtoms of anxiety)
Vyvanse 60mg daily (pre 11 AM, to address the massive lethargy of depression, and elevate mood) 

Recently stopped taking Abilify 5mg daily (took for a month) 

Also today is the 22nd day of sobriety from weed."
17503,"this might be a dumb question, but is there a definitive moment when i can truly know the meds are working ?"
17504,ive never taken meds before so im not sure what to expect.
17505,I am using medication to do it.
17506,"For instance, it has happened many times since I started the medication that a bee has flown around my head."
17507,My one concern that remains is that I will lose these effects when I taper off of the medication.
17508,"The dose of my medication hasn’t changed, but I continue to improve."
17509,My meds seem to wear off as soon as I get home and I usually end up doing little to no homework.
17510,I've never taken any kind of medication because I'm too scared of what they'll do to me.
17511,I have tried all sorts of therapy and I think I may have exhausted all medication options.
17512,[Bonus question: what about when I'm not able to go in to work because I'm having issues with my anxiety or meds?]
17513,I'll try to keep this short because my thoughts are racing and I want this to come off concise.
17514,"Here are the facts:

- I've had anxiety/panic disorder mixed in with depression for about 8 years now."
17515,With an increase in severity for the past 5 years.
17516,- I am 22 and have not had a job since I was 18.
17517,- A passion I have developed the past several years while battling my mental issues has been cooking with an emphasis on baking and I've actually been daydreaming of turning this into a career someday.
17518,"- I eat a plant based or ""vegan"" diet for a plethora of reasons but began with health concerns."
17519,It is also a passion of mine.
17520,- I have just moved to a large bustling city with my boyfriend to have more options in regards to getting help both mentally and physically.
17521,"- For the past 3 weeks I have been on a new SSRI (no prior medications for anxiety and depression aside from klonopin) and am currently ""interviewing"" therapists."
17522,"Now here is my dilemma:

A coveted local, organic, and vegan bakery announced they are opening a new location right next to my apartment."
17523,They are hiring part-time positions of all sorts and will not be opening until mid September.
17524,I know this bakery and LOVE this bakery.
17525,The staff are all amazingly sweet people and the atmosphere is incredibly relaxing and wonderful.
17526,"I've even seen the pastry chefs in back icing things with big, fat smiles on their faces."
17527,It truly seems like a great place to work and the trajectory of employment with this shop aligns ever so perfectly with where I have daydreamed of going in life.
17528,Even if I started washing dishes there to begin with.
17529,The trouble is my anxiety doesn't care about any of that.
17530,"Part of me is freaking out over even attempting to try, then another part of me is freaking out over potentially being interviewed, and then ANOTHER part of me is freaking out that I could get this job and screw everything up."
17531,"I keep hearing myself saying, ""You are anxious, you can't do this!"
17532,"Just take your medicine, see a therapist, and get the dream job later!"""
17533,But have any of you ever heard those million quotes about how *there is never a better time than now*?
17534,I kind of feel that way deep in my heart.
17535,Would it be reckless to apply?
17536,Should I try?
17537,Or is it more logical to keep taking the SSRI and see a therapist and just wait for it to all magically fall into place one day?
17538,I hate this.
17539,"To explain: Most of the time I have my anxiety under control, my depression not so much esp when its a pms week/s."
17540,If any of you are on bc does it help your keep your pms from making your other meds for anxiety/depression working or not working?
17541,"I wanted to see if being put on a mild bc would help with those times, but I don't know if it conflicts with antidepressants or anti-anxiety medicines."
17542,I do not want to take anti-anxiety medication for fear of what negative changes daily medication may bring about.
17543,I have seen firsthand the disgusting consequences of the daily use of mind-altering prescription medication and do not want that to be me.
17544,I lost my medication while traveling this weekend.
17545,"I'm home now and I'm starting to feel it, what do I do to get my medication back."
17546,Long time lurker here.
17547,I've been on and off medications in the past but it's been quite a few years and my memory of those times isn't too good.
17548,I went to my doctor today and she put me on the generic Lexapro for my depression and anxiety.
17549,Anyone have feedback?
17550,Edit: Spelling
17551,I stopped taking the medicine because I felt it didn't work and I didn't want to be someone who took a pill for the rest of their lives.
17552,"I've starting taking medication to curb my anxiety, but that will take a while to kick in (if it works)."
17553,My physc has put me on a different sleep med and has suggested anti-craving medication.
17554,My SO has been diagnosed with anxiety and is on medication for it (not sure on the name) and is doing Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT).
17555,"I am also a little scared they are going to try and put me on some sort of medication :/    
  
I would really like some advice on helping myself not be so stressed out; natural remedies, exercises, etc."
17556,The meds were helping but today I've had to double breath for the entire day.
17557,I took my meds to try and calm down and tried meditating/breathing/muscle relaxing exercises which helped while I was doing it.
17558,The meds did nothing except maybe relieve the shaking a little.
17559,"I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in high school, have taken medication and am currently in counseling offered through my University."
17560,Im not on any medication.
17561,But I have meds and I think I already know how to manage.
17562,I explained to her that even at the height of my panic disorder prior to medication I was not experiencing these types of headaches - I felt like my brain was itchy or stuffed with cotton balls and my eyes constantly felt crossed.
17563,I hate medication and feeling like a fucking guinea pig.
17564,So I'm looking like an idiot asking what's the difference between dental and medical insurance and why dental isn't part of medical since dental is a part of medicine.
17565,yes im taking medication and even seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist.
17566,"At the same time, I am afraid that my anxiety will become unmanageable if I'm not on medication."
17567,"I am considering talking with my primary care doctor about a nausea medication, but I feel like she's JUST going to blame it on my anxiety -- that's what my previous PCP did."
17568,Anxiety background: I have had anxiety for several years now and recently got diagnosed with adult ADHD.
17569,I am on medications now (specifically Vyvanse and Brintellix) and am working on tackling my mental health.
17570,"I have made great strides in dealing with my anxiety, but I still do have a ways to go until I am happy with my mental state."
17571,I used to not be able to go anywhere or do anything by myself but now I can do things like check the mail or go to a coffee shop or run to the store by myself.
17572,"I got a speeding ticket and am trying to fight it, so I have to go to a hearing tomorrow (7/16/14)."
17573,"And the worst part is, I have to go alone."
17574,"No one is available to go with me, and I can't ask anyone to take off work for me."
17575,I'm already taking off work myself.
17576,"Frankly, I am terrified."
17577,"I am consumed with thoughts of what am I going to say, what am I going to wear, what am I going to do, what if I get my license suspended, how do I get to the correct building, what if I burst out crying, can my coworkers cover my work properly.. etc etc

I'm just looking for a little bit of guidance as to what I should do to make this bearable."
17578,Any advice at all is appreciated.
17579,TL;DR I have anxiety and I got a little better.
17580,"Have to go to a hearing, now do not feel better at all."
17581,"I've tried medication, and I've tried cousneling, and do not have positive experiences with either."
17582,"But tensions are high on the occasion, because my dad has back problems and is on medication for seizures (I'm still traumatized, I'll explain momentarily) so he's constantly stressed out."
17583,"I fear of being put on medication and I have heard that most anxiety/depression medication can cause thoughts of suicide, or make anxiety worse, nausea, and all the other symptoms that I am trying to solve."
17584,Is there any medication that has worked for you?
17585,"Edit: some* not since

I've been living with GAD for about 5 years, I'm 27 and I don't remember the last time I went a day without feeling anxious."
17586,I also have a depression problem I should mention that I've had for my entire life.
17587,"I mean litterally speaking I can think back to before my first panic attack and remember days without anxiety, but since then is tough, there probably been a good number in 5 years, but I really don't remember my last ""good"" anxiety few day."
17588,"It rules my life, I try my best to left it not, I go to therapy, I take medications as needed, I have cbt therapy work books I use, I've even turned to religion."
17589,But nothing ever really helps.
17590,"I'm married and have a daughter, I feel neglectful to my wife, I almost missed our daughter's birth."
17591,I don't want to keep living my life like this.
17592,Has anyone ever really overcome their anxiety to never suffer from it again?
17593,"I mean I haven't gone on family vacations, or a plane in years because I'm worried about what could happen I haven't even been able to finish college or hold down a decent job."
17594,"I know what a panic attack is and that they will pass, but that didn't prevent them from coming or make them less traumatic."
17595,"I'm not sure what else to say, part of be just needed to vent and clear my head so I can hopefully get some sleep, part of me is going for any and all advice."
17596,"In the past few weeks, I elected to try medication for my anxiety."
17597,"Anyway, the night before taking the first dose of the medication, I had the worst panic attack of my life."
17598,Ok so it is a bit of a story but I will try to keep it simple and straight forward.
17599,For the past few months I seemed to have developed some sort of nasty generalized anxiety.
17600,Lets go back in time a few months.
17601,"I graduated last winter and did not have anything to do, just waiting for dental school to start in July."
17602,So I just chilled at home watching shows and not doing much of anything.
17603,Not much at all seemed to happen until April where I did a lot of driving (Seattle to San Fran) to help my mom with some paperwork she had to do there for an embassy.
17604,I noticed that during the drive and while I was down there I was really anxious.
17605,"It was like this... constant uncomfortableness, fatigue, dizziness, poor sleep, etc."
17606,One night I had a traditional anxiety attack.
17607,"High heart rate, shortness of breath, fear, and doom."
17608,Nothing seemed to trigger it though.
17609,"It just ""happened""."
17610,"I walked around a bit, collected myself, and went back to trying to sleep."
17611,So then we drove home and I wasnt feeling to well.
17612,"Light headed, dizziness, fatigued, headaches."
17613,But after a few days I went back to my regular grind of shows and computer.
17614,Things seemed to settle down a bit.
17615,"I was feeling a bit ""flat"" though, not depressed/sad, but just kinda flat."
17616,So now were are at middle/late May.
17617,I went to Thailand.
17618,"I was a bit anxious on the plane, which was unusual, but it wasnt bad."
17619,"We get there, its fine."
17620,The first week goes by without any problems.
17621,Start of second week though we start going from island to island.
17622,"Its just my friend and I, its going ok."
17623,"I dont normally drink, one night though we played this stupid park the bus game and kings cup."
17624,I lost the kings cup and ended up drinking this practically full cup of vodka redbull.
17625,I felt like death the whole night.
17626,"Throwing up, anxious, bad, awful."
17627,Eventually comes the next day.
17628,Im laying there and suddenly feel a fever.
17629,It was bad.
17630,We go to the Thai hospital and they think I have breakbone fever since it was so high.
17631,I didnt.
17632,I did though stay at the hospital for 2 days.
17633,I had a stomach infection and a blood infection.
17634,I get out of the hospital.
17635,I feel pretty good!
17636,So we go to the next island.
17637,Which has no medical care... and our hostels ac wasnt working right... My body completely crashes.
17638,"I have this constant dizziness, fatigue, headache, and this weird dull anxiety."
17639,"No racing heart rate, but still that feeling that you just want to push out but cant."
17640,"I dont sleep well for a few days, then we head out back to bangkok for the flight home."
17641,"It was awful, lots of bus riding, no sleep, and plane flight."
17642,During which time I also pick up an eye infection.
17643,We make it back to Seattle and I feel so relieved to be home.
17644,"Im tired, still sick, jet lagged, but im home."
17645,Over the next few days I visit a doctor to check up and I start getting better.
17646,I did smoke weed to try to help me just relax and mostly because I was bored.
17647,About 5 days later at night before going to bed I smoked and had this weird sensation that my hand and mouse was HUGE and my proprioception was way off.
17648,It kind of freaked me out and I got really anxious.
17649,"Got sudden diarrhea, and for the first time ever my body started shaking!"
17650,"First my legs, then torso, then arms, then jaw."
17651,I could barely talk.
17652,It really freaked me out.
17653,But my heart rate and blood pressure was fine.
17654,I walked around outside with my legs occasionally locking up but then went to bed.
17655,Here is where it starts getting bad.
17656,The following several days I felt AWFUL.
17657,"VERY dizzy, incredibly fatigued, had no desire to do anything, headaches, and had this uncomfortableness that would just not leave me alone."
17658,I stopped smoking thinking it was that.
17659,But it wasnt getting all that much better.
17660,After about a week of that hell it started to get a bit better.
17661,"I still had the uncomfortableness, fatigue, dizziness, flatness, but it was all slowly getting better."
17662,"There were also days where for about half the day I felt ""ok"" and functional."
17663,Had energy etc.
17664,"But then I would crash, or how it seemed to me."
17665,My anxiety only seemed to get worse or bad when I was tired.
17666,So then a few weeks later I help my friend move to San Fran.
17667,I took a benadryl part of the way down and it was BAD.
17668,I felt like I was going to pass out.
17669,No high heart rate.
17670,"Just this fear of passing out, hot flashes, dizziness, panic."
17671,Eventually get to sleep.
17672,Wasnt very functional next day.
17673,But over the course of a couple days we moved in.
17674,During which time I realized that wine did not help me feel better or worse.
17675,I also realized that my appetite was non existent and that I was losing a lot more weight than I thought.
17676,I finally get back to Seattle.
17677,Im feeling a bit better.
17678,Go to the my doctor again and we talk about trying lexapro.
17679,5mg.
17680,I agreed.
17681,Took it for 2 days and the side effects were not something I could tolerate.
17682,Tweaky in the evenings and morning.
17683,Really tired during the day.
17684,Thats not gonna fly in school.
17685,So we stopped lexapro.
17686,A few days later I noticed that my anxiety wasnt too bad but I am so fatigued.
17687,"My sleep is poor, im tired all day, I still have flatness, headaches, dizziness."
17688,All still there.
17689,I start my dental school orientation tomorrow... Im pretty scared that I wont be able to perform as well as I used to when I applied.
17690,"I just want to get rid of this dizziness and fatigue, I also miss enjoying food and wanting it."
17691,"I know its a lot so ill try to make a tldr

17693,"Side effects were tiredness and twitching

Triggers

None, constant."
17694,Only trigger I can think of is dizziness and fatigue.
17695,"Age 25, Male."
17696,Hello r/anxiety.
17697,A friend has been having some problems with one of her medications and I offered to post this for her on here.
17698,All replies will be forwarded to her.
17699,"&gt; So, I'm taking Amitriptyline, which is a type of antidepressant, that I have been using to help ease what may be nerve pains in my thigh."
17700,"I've been taking this medicine for awhile now, but I've begun to notice that I stutter more often than usual."
17701,"Sometimes I can't even finish sentences, or other times I would try to say a word, but as I'm looking at something I'll say what I was looking at instead of what I meant to say."
17702,"I used to be highly proficient in reading, but now I mess up on reading words aloud and the only reason I can think of this being an issue is because of the medicine."
17703,Does anyone have any similar situations or know what could be the cause of this?
17704,"I'm not really sure if stuttering is a side effect or not, but to me it has become a concerning issue."
17705,"If anyone has any advice or anything that would be helpful, it would be greatly appreciated!"
17706,Thanks!
17707,"I'm also considering taking short-term anxiety meds, but I'm absolutely terrified of that option."
17708,My mother ingrained in me to stay way from medication and I'm scared of the side effects.
17709,"My anxiety has been getting steadily worse since I graduated from college (this whole 40-hour-work-week and being-an-adult stuff is really draining), and I recently realized that I definitely need medication, because I'm miserable way more often than I ought to be."
17710,"There's not much for me to do but wait, and I'm pissed, because even once I get an appointment I expect I'll need to try a bunch of different meds till I find a good one."
17711,And this means I need outside help in the form of medication.
17712,"Thanks for reading :)

TLDR: Want meds now."
17713,"I told her my mom is against medication, but I'm allowed to take it."
17714,"The doctor told me it would take a few weeks for the meds to kick in, so my question is, is the Sertraline  actually working, or could I just  be experiencing a placebo effect?"
17715,"Ever since I have gone back on my meds back in winter (20mg Celexa and 180mg Propranolol ER) back in winter I feel like my sleep has been shitty, but as of a few months ago it's started getting worse."
17716,"Anyway, has anyone had any kind of problems like this from their meds?"
17717,"It's getting harder to feel like I have any purpose other than to burden people with my anger, sadness and in general my existence."
17718,"I should not have been born, untreated mental illness breeds the same in poverty."
17719,"I used to shake it off and find something to aspire for (I wanted to be a nurse, and I really hope one day I can get there) - despite everything...."
17720,"But I'm tired now and there's no solace in anything, only guilt and sorrow."
17721,"I'll start by saying I'm not on any medication, and I can't afford any."
17722,"I can't even see a doctor, not under the circumstance I'm in right now."
17723,"There are a lot of things going on that I've never had a chance to deal with in healthy ways, so they all feel tangled up and bound to me forever, as it is right now and for too long to give a number on it, it's heavier than I can carry anymore."
17724,"I tried talking to an old friend of whom I have very few, and he basically said I wasn't trying hard enough, which is easy with good intention, but can be cruel said to some."
17725,I've always been trying.
17726,"My mother, I love her but she's always been unwell."
17727,"She's the main reason I want to become a nurse, to help others, but I know what a joke that is if I'm unable to cope with my own life."
17728,"Schizoaffective disorder bipolar, single mother, no friends or family, in a rural community in an isolated place."
17729,"I have many problems stemming from her illness, but she could barely help herself sometimes, and as I got older it became a huge part of my life to help her seeing her having no one (good intended) in her life, I've always been heartbroken by her illness, and how lost she was in it during those times."
17730,"She was gone for long periods of time, sometimes that meant foster homes, sometimes boarding homes, and the older I got, (11 onward) I'd just be left alone."
17731,"She always wanted me to succeed in life, but could never provide the love, protection and support needed to nurture a healthy person, not when she was unwell, at least... which was often."
17732,"I turned 13, was invited out to drink with some older people, no one told me not to, so I went for it."
17733,"I was raped, I don't like to go into details and honestly hate even having to talk about it at all, but it should be said, it's too heavy not to now."
17734,I don't have a loving family outside of my mother.
17735,"My aunt never liked me and showed it, loved my half sister very much."
17736,she wanted to adopt her.
17737,"I look like my junkie dad, from what I've seen, I stick out to the other side."
17738,"Maybe she just didn't like me, for no good reason."
17739,I told her one day when my mother was in the hospital and was slowly failing out of school.
17740,She said I was lying so I didn't have to go to school.
17741,"I was doing very well before it happened, nothing special, but I would have done just fine throughout if I had more courage."
17742,"I turned 14 and things got bad again, mom was having a hard time finding stability with her medications and in general for quite some time at that point, so I ventured off to a city to find work."
17743,I did.
17744,I worked at a shady restaurant that was willing to hire a 14 year old.
17745,"The AC there didn't work, the food was a general health hazard, and it was so close to being closed down they seemed to know it and just be waiting it out."
17746,"They made me clean up a bathroom full (truly smeared everywhere) of feces, because I ""was the last person hired""."
17747,"I didn't know how wrong that was, so I did it."
17748,"At this point I was dating some guy a decade older than me, who I probably don't need to go into detail about."
17749,It's pretty self explanatory.
17750,"Fast forward through a lot more hell and moving around trying to just feel safe, working odd jobs for whoever will pay me."
17751,"I'm 27 now, and I'm in one of the only relationships where someone actually cared about me - but has no idea how to comfort me in any way."
17752,He freezes up when I'm crying and panicking.
17753,"I ask him to talk and only ""I have nothing to say"" leaves his mouth."
17754,"The last thing I want is to be left alone when I feel complete and total hopelessness to the point of.. well, wanting to try what I failed at when I was 17."
17755,"I can't get a job beyond it being cash and or under the table, and I don't know how to meet people for either of those options, and meeting/trusting people when you have nothing beyond general skills to offer, in itself can be extremely overwhelming."
17756,"I receive/recieved no money what so ever from any source, I'm being fully supported by my boyfriend, and I feel like absolute shit for it beyond what I can word."
17757,We're struggling bad.
17758,"Our neighbors are filthy and cockroaches and bedbugs become an issue every 6 months, they refuse treatment, and it always gets bad enough to see them in here despite having literally every single thing in a container staked neatly."
17759,I wouldn't eat if I had to be afraid to open a bag.
17760,I haven't been eating more than 500-700 calories a day for a while because I feel too guilty about it.
17761,"All I do is clean, and cook (for him) and work out, and making myself weak and sick from it knowing it's stupid and counterproductive."
17762,"Exercising always helps me, but I can't do it without eating."
17763,"I have no one to talk to aside from my partner (who definitely needs some space, or more not many people can take on such a heaping pile of another persons shit), my best friend died almost a decade ago, I don't know how to not scare people away."
17764,I have a hard time feeling empathy for others.
17765,"I don't like it, and I'm trying to change."
17766,"I'm exhausted trying to relay everything I have to say, and I'm sorry if it's all hard to understand or I worded anything wrong."
17767,"I'm falling apart today, I'd never normally put this out there, I just don't feel like I'm an easy person to care for because I'm so angry most of the time people probably just think I'm an asshole, and I may be without realizing it."
17768,Any advice would be appreciated.
17769,Thank you for reading.
17770,"r/anxiety, I know this is not the best place to post this but I'm not sure if posting this to the other subreddit will garner the same amount of help."
17771,I have been dating my SO for a year and a half now and we've gone through a lot together.
17772,"At first, his anxiety was crippling to the point that it was very hard for him to travel 10 minutes to come see me."
17773,I know that he suffers from agoraphobia and panic attacks since he was 12 when he was diagnosed with Celiac's disease and was too scared to leave the house because he thought he would die.
17774,"After a few months in our relationship, his anxiety started going away and he was able to go back to school and get a full time job."
17775,He's been doing amazingly until this past weekend.
17776,He got sick with the flu and has had a lot of phelgm that makes it hard for him to breathe which causes him to panic really badly.
17777,"This past Saturday, I planned a party at my house with a few of his friends and my friends."
17778,I thought it would go great because his friends would be there.
17779,"However, a few minutes into the party he had a horrible panic attack where he couldn't breathe and vomited all over my driveway and ran off."
17780,"Regardless of how I felt, I was extremely worried but I thought that that was the end of it."
17781,"However, it has gotten worse."
17782,"Today, he has had horrible anxiety just getting to In-n-out, he had to leave work early from panic attack and has had two very horrible ones since then."
17783,One on the ride home and one a few minutes ago.
17784,I know I shouldn't listen to his brain when he's in panic mode because of some of the things he says but I do feel powerless.
17785,I told him to go to his therapist tomorrow but he doesn't like medications because it makes him angry.
17786,"I wish he could try some but I'm afraid it might change him and he's afraid of that, too."
17787,All I know is that I'm drained.
17788,I want to be with him and help him because I love him.
17789,I know this isn't going to change the way I feel about him and it won't make me leave him.
17790,I just want something to end the torture.
17791,"**TL;DR r/anxiety, how do I help my boyfriend overcome agoraphobia and panic attacks?"
17792,**
17793,"Now I'm wondering if you guys think I'd be taking meds for the right reason, to basically not have to dedicate my life to preventing anxiety anymore (also hopefully subsiding the OCD.)"
17794,I think I should try another medication but I'm really worried about the withdrawals from Effexor xr.
17795,Plus worried about any side effects I might get from a new medication.
17796,I'm really afraid of meds.
17797,Are there any meds that can help with feelings like these or is it all down to some sort of psychological magic?
17798,"Just curious if anyone knows what is up, I just don't want to have the anxiety come back even while I'm on meds as then I'd really feel hopeless."
17799,I am not on any medication as I had a bad experience with it before but if this carries on I will have no choice.
17800,"I start having panic attacks and coughing fits, even while on my meds."
17801,"Then I got angry, I wanted to go up to him, get the antidepressants, my other medication and my stressball that I have to carry round with me and say ""I'm glad you find it entertaining pretending to have a mental illness and showing us all to be crazy and psychotic."
17802,"TL;DR
I just had a panic attack after several months without one
Think sudafed triggered it but I might just be paranoid
Lost all faith in medication."
17803,"(cost is also an issue, my insurance isn't great)

I guess I am hoping for a resource that can help me push through it so I can get the professional help I need rather than self medication and avoidance."
17804,**Mods:** sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this question.
17805,"Please feel free to redirect me/delete this post, but this subreddit seems like the most active anxiety-related place."
17806,I am romantically interested in someone who suffers from anxiety and panic attacks.
17807,"We are both in our early 20s, but I am hesitant to give more information just in case he is browsing (I also do not want to breach his privacy)."
17808,"He is interested as well, but somewhat reluctant to pursue anything, and one factor is his anxiety/panic attack."
17809,"Several times in a row now we were supposed to see each other, but he could not make it due to attacks."
17810,"Regardless of my romantic interest, he is someone I truly want to be able to help and comfort when he has his attacks or is anxious about another one coming, simply because I care about him."
17811,He is medicated but having issues with it until he sees his doctor again.
17812,He is deeply afraid of getting much worse.
17813,I want to be there for him as best as I can.
17814,How can I do this?
17815,How do you respond to someone when they say they feel hopeless and ruled by anxiety and medications?
17816,What have been said or done that made you feel better in times of extreme anxiety/panic?
17817,How can someone that cares about you best comfort you when you aren't doing well?
17818,"Any advice: anecdotal, informational, or otherwise would be SO appreciated."
17819,You can even tell me things that someone has done for you that DIDN'T work.
17820,"I myself suffer from moderate to extreme anxiety with an attack here and there, but no one has ever helped me through them, so I'm at a loss."
17821,"Thanks a lot for your time, and again, sorry if this is the wrong place for this kind of post!"
17822,"I'm scared to take meds, but it's coming to the last resort now."
17823,"When you say some meds made you worse, I'm scared of how much worse if they affect me negatively that it will make me."
17824,"I'm doing my best to try and accept that death is a mandatory phase in life and that I can't always know the answer to all these questions, but I want to know if there's any way I can calm down about these topics in addition to meds and therapy."
17825,How harmful is missing a few days of your medication?
17826,I'm one of those people that feel the full side effects of anxiety and depression medications.
17827,"I get the nausea, headaches, vomiting, suicidal thoughts and feelings etc."
17828,I've been on pretty much all of them and they always hurt my body while numbing my mind.
17829,There's never a good balance.
17830,"Lately I've been going through some really tough shit with my parents, in that they were constantly yelling and screaming at me."
17831,"I really want to try meds again because I find when I'm on them, I am less irritable and less sensitive."
17832,I take clonazepam as needed but I am afraid of getting addicted to that.
17833,Is anyone else really sensitive to medication?
17834,"I want to be on it to help me feel better, but I don't want to go back on anything that made me sick."
17835,I did start feeling worse without my meds.
17836,"So long story short, I had a really bad week last week anxiety and depression wise thankfully I saw my therapist/doctor on Tuesday and she changed up my meds."
17837,I had taken Cymbalta before with great results  I made the mistake of googling the two meds being taken together and I saw that taking them together can lead Serotonin Syndrome.
17838,"I know medication effect everyone differently, but I havent really found anything online about anyone taking both of them at the same time."
17839,"Hello, new to here."
17840,"First of all, I'm from the UK,  I have social anxiety, I'm 28,  I haven't worked in almost 10 years, I live at home with my dad, who cooks and does all the shopping."
17841,"For the last 10 years I have been living of the state, I smoke a lot cigarettes and drink quite a bit, mainly to cope with my anxiety."
17842,"What I'm asking here is, how do I get from where I am to somewhere where I can look after myself?"
17843,"I have been on various prescription medications for anxiety and depression, which I feel has had little beneficial effect, some even detrimental."
17844,"I hate that I drink and smoke, but feel I need both to cope with just day to day life."
17845,"I have a few GCSEs, (High School qualifications) and a couple of GNVQs (low level College qualifications)."
17846,Can anyone give me some pointers on what I can to do get out of this 10 year rut?
17847,I  have been on anxiety meds for 6 yrs and sometimes it's not enough but I have found that if I sip on a cheap energy drink like Full Throttle or Rip It is helps curb the anxiety.
17848,I'm afraid of the medicine controlling me and that I could possibly be addicted to it and I don't know what to do
17849,I'm so frustrated with myself.
17850,I've come to realize that it's the automatic thought processes that are driving my anxiety.
17851,"My fear of illness, disease, and death is consuming me entirely."
17852,"I've been having lower back pain, abdominal pain, pelvic pain for the past 5 days (initially only pelvic, but now abdominal and the lower back pain is chronic), and as I go about my day, by the evening I'm quite accepting of any symptoms that I have remaining, realizing they are likely benign."
17853,"After sleeping, the pain is the worst in the morning, my mind just calculates all the possibilities of what the symptoms can be -- cancer, referent pain from my kidneys."
17854,I'd say this all stems from my kidney condition..
17855,"I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease at 18 and although it was really bad for a year, I was put on meds and it stabilized and jumped right back to normal."
17856,"I've been stable, and the condition has been very mild according to the doctors for the past 8 years (and my kidney function is within normal range as tested 1.5 months ago), but I cant help but feel like things can drop at any moment, and I know how influential negative thinking, stress, and anxiety are on disease prognosis (especially autoimmune conditions)."
17857,"I feel like nobody can relate to me, and sympathy (""oh that sucks"", ""that must be hard"") just makes it worse because it confirms that I'm abnormal and unhealthy."
17858,"I'm under a ridiculous amount of stress right now, exam period after a nine course semester in a medical grad program (audiology), living independently on the other side of the country from my family and primary support system."
17859,"Before April of this year I forgot what it was like to experience anxiety, and had a lot of interest in medicine."
17860,"Now all I see is disease everywhere, constantly learning about disease and illness at a time where my health anxiety is at it's peak."
17861,"I know more about my condition, what tests results mean, what side effects medications have, risk factors -- the knowledge has fueled the fire for my anxiety, and I can longer just be ignorant."
17862,I hate myself for it.
17863,"I'm leaving to Japan to see my girlfriend in one week for a month, and I'm hoping that provides me the relief I have been looking for in the past 3 months."
17864,"As soon as I come home, I know I have to see the specialist, and address these physical symptoms I've been experiencing as well."
17865,I just want to cry.
17866,"I want to break down, and just let all of it out."
17867,"I'm constantly thinking about death, what it's like, what will happen when I'm gone."
17868,"I can't fathom the idea of not existing anymore, it's the most frightening thing imaginable, aside from perhaps approaching it in a state of suffering from a terminal illness."
17869,I don't know.
17870,Sometimes I just want to off myself so I can save myself the suffering and just get it over with.
17871,"I can't believe I'm even saying that, and I know I'll never do it."
17872,But living right now is miserable.
17873,"It's not just anxiety, its depression."
17874,"25 mg of Paxil is not working, and it decided to stop working in August when I upped the dose to 20 mg then 25 mg with no change."
17875,"Ativan brings me back to a normal baseline, but the effects are transient, and the last thing I need is another drug to be dependant on."
17876,"Psychiatrists are booked up here in Vancouver, and I'm only here for another week."
17877,"Meditation can help to relax me, and I've been really interested in the mind-over-body healing stuff, but the videos they have on youtube aren't always helpful - only because some of the terminology and descriptions they use just go against the science that I've learned."
17878,"I'm looking more into faith, but I'm skeptic about everything (which is why I can't even acknowledge that I'm perfectly fine), so I dont know how I would ever wholeheartedly belief in a religion."
17879,"I just want a cure, I want help."
17880,"At least to put my mind at ease, to allow me to live a normal, fulfilling life like I did for the past 8 years."
17881,"A stable mind is a stable body, I know that."
17882,But this anxiety just makes me stressed out every day and I feel like I'm just killing myself more and more because of it.
17883,"And I cant even control it...

Somebody, help me... any suggestions.."
17884,I want hope for the future again...
17885,Please...
17886,"I am not on meds because I had a little bit of an incident this January and now I am not allowed to have them, or own a gun."
17887,"Part of me wants to be on meds because they take away all the feels and I almost prefer that at this point, but I am also scared of that happening again, just to clarify I’m good now."
17888,"Good thing is I'm getting new meds, though?"
17889,I'm not on any medication and I ate what I usually eat.
17890,"I urgently need help with my anxiety but I don't know where to go, or what to do."
17891,I have suffered with this for 12 years.
17892,It's a battle every single day.
17893,"I've been on all sorts of medications, I'm no stranger to my doctor."
17894,At 30 years old this is literally crippling me.
17895,Sometimes I would rather just not be alive because dealing with this is nasty.
17896,"I've smoked cannabis for the past year, it was the only thing that worked after my meds stopped working."
17897,Previous to that I had Testicle Cancer.
17898,I became dependant on cannabis and smoke way too much.
17899,An unhealthy amount.
17900,I can spend £200+ a week on cannabis.
17901,But it helped me.
17902,Now it doesn't.
17903,"I stopped smoking it today, for good."
17904,"I had a joint earlier, but I am determined that was my last one."
17905,"I have no money for no more, and I want to ride out this storm and get my head back to normal."
17906,The past few months I have been housebound much of the time.
17907,"Content smoking weed, sitting on the bed with the laptop."
17908,But this too caused problems.
17909,I've lost weight.
17910,Non of my jeans fit me.
17911,I don't eat much when I smoke because I've had a fear of choking from birth.
17912,I feel sick a lot because anxiety causes me to suck my stomach in constantly.
17913,Today I left the house to go for a walk.
17914,I didn't feel too good before leaving.
17915,"I could feel that cement feeling in the pit of my stomach and my mind was racing thinking ""What if I need food on my walk, I have no money to buy any""."
17916,"Or ""What if I dont feel good and I'm too far from the home""."
17917,"I done the walk, but under extreme anxiety."
17918,"I had to go home towards the end, but my partner stayed with the dogs."
17919,"It causes problems in my relationship because when I'm out I sometimes don't feel good and I need to ""escape"" the situation."
17920,"The only place I feel ""safe"" is my home."
17921,When I'm out the house it's horrible for me to deal with.
17922,"I will almost always have an elevated heart rate, then the tiredness will kick in and progresses into a full panic attack."
17923,If it's hot outside then it's even harder because heat makes everything feel so much worse.
17924,"I read something about the UV rays from the sun triggering attacks, the same as florescent lights in a supermarket (which are problematic for me)."
17925,"I used to be able to hide attacks, but now they feel stronger and I can't cope with them when they happen."
17926,Except of course to go back to the house.
17927,15 minutes after being in the house I'm normal again.
17928,"Go figure :S

I've had enough of this."
17929,12 years!
17930,I'm on ESA because I can't work.
17931,I can't even build a career in my area of expertise because I find it so hard with anxiety to do anything.
17932,It feels like there is no hope.
17933,"I'm sick of feeling tiered, and sick all the time."
17934,There's only so much I can take before it starts effected everything else in life.
17935,It always ends in some horrible bout of depression.
17936,"Please, I'm seeking advice."
17937,What can I do here?
17938,"I feel alone, I feel like nobody truly understands what it feels like to be that scared of leaving your own home."
17939,And I know it's going to be even harder these coming days because I've made a decision to stop smoking cannabis (and tobacco).
17940,"I want to enjoy the last 20 years of my life (I expect to live to 50, anything more is a bonus)."
17941,"I want to see the world, with my family."
17942,"I want to get a job to support my family, and be the man of the house."
17943,It's degrading to be put in this position.
17944,Thanks for reading.
17945,(M 19).
17946,I've been suffering with anxiety and depression since I was 16.
17947,3 months ago I made my first step and I made my first appointment with a psychiatrist.
17948,"I've been pruscribed to take ""Deanxit"" twice a day."
17949,In the very few days I was feeling very weird.
17950,Deanxit kind of changed me alot.
17951,What I noticed is that i'm not capable of having / keeping an erection.
17952,When I asked the psychiatrist about this issue he replied to me that i'm more anxious then I was before I started taking the pills.
17953,Also the dose of pills has been increased from twice to 3 pills a day.
17954,I was freaking out so I stopped the medications with out asking the psychiatrist.
17955,"Now I feel depressed with no motivation for nothing , still having no erections when I should have."
17956,I think deanxit has destroyed my sex life....
17957,I don't know what to do...
17958,"The reason I am asking is not for reddit to prescribe me medication, but because of the quality of the family doctor that I am seeing."
17959,What is a good medication to stop intrusive self-defeating thoughts?
17960,"I do suffer from anxiety in social situations but it's not bad (meaning I'm not seeking therapy or medication, i just lack social skills and talking to people makes me very nervous)."
17961,"He doesn't leave the house, he feels terrible all the time, has manic episodes (rarely, he just started a new medication), and can barely sleep."
17962,"His new medication helps in some ways, but makes other aspects of his problem worse."
17963,Hey Reddit!
17964,"Some days ago, during the afternoon, I had a very light headache, nothing serious really, it was more of an annoyance that only lasted about half an hour."
17965,"That evening though, while watching TV in the dark, I moved my gaze from the TV to the wall and I saw a pretty significant white trail."
17966,"Since I developed eye floaters some months ago (they don't really concern me anymore though), I thought that maybe it was something with my vitreous detatching but I don't think it's the case."
17967,"I kept seeing the trail whenever I moved my gaze from the bright TV screen, although it disappeared very quickly (about some tenths of a second I guess)."
17968,In the last few days I noticed I have an increased amount of aterimages as well as visual trails like for example when I move my hand.
17969,"The negative afterimages don't seem to have increased, I only seem to have developed positive ones."
17970,They are quite clear for some milliseconds but fade quickly into blurred shapes and then disappear.
17971,"Is this palinopsia or not, since they only last for very little, as I said, only a fraction of a second and they're not very visible unless they're formed by a TV/computer screen?"
17972,Or could it be that the increased afterimages and visual trails could be something psychological due to the fact I saw (and still see) that trail while watching TV in the dark (although it doesn't seem the case)?
17973,Could it be the effect of stress or sleep deprivation?
17974,"I'm worried because I read palinopsia is permanent :/

I don't do drugs or take any medications beside mineral tablets for my vitreous."
17975,"TL;DR Sudden positive afterimages and visual trails after light headache, very visible in the dark with bright screens when moving gaze."
17976,Thanks in advance!
17977,"I am not on any anxiety medication at the moment, and maybe I will get back on it soon, but I wanted to know: short term, what do you guys do to calm yourselves down so you can be kinda productive?"
17978,I've been stable on my current meds since this summer but recently my panic attacks have come back full force.
17979,"Mom who is just batshit insane, and hopped up on meds."
17980,"I don't use meds, because they don't help me, only one can of beer can help me."
17981,"**[Rant] no TLDR sorry**

I have been trying to deal with my anxiety without medication for about 6 months."
17982,"I'm tired of living in constant fear of the unknown, but I'm also afraid that getting prescribed a medication will change my personality."
17983,I have seizures due to anxiety and my seizure threshold is really low and she gives me pain meds instead of my anxiety ones and says its not a big deal strait to my face.
17984,I don't know if I should take my medication tomorrow.
17985,"I used to take anxiety medication but found I didn't really need them anymore, but now I feel like I do just out of anticipation?"
17986,Feel free to tell me of your exciting success stories with meds and fighting your anxities!
17987,"Because my parents are always bailing him out of shit he caused, when I've needed help with paying for therapy and medication they've had to tell me no because they gave all their money to fucking Kevin and they can't afford to help me."
17988,"I was really expecting xanax or something similar, but I guess Paxil is more for constant anxiety where as xanax is a ""take when needed"" medicine.."
17989,Also a Side Effect to my medication is nausea and I am still scared I'll puke everywhere.
17990,I've seen her a couple times and she seems to understand what I'm trying to achieve with medication.
17991,"The thing is, I've had bad experiences with other meds in the past so taking this makes me nervous."
17992,"I've been using lorazepam as a rescue medication and that's been fine, but I feel a slight bit of a constant undercurrent of anxiety/depression."
17993,"I took the meds the first day and they seemed to help, but after than they don't seem to be working."
17994,It's amazing how many anxiety sufferers don't understand anxiety and how to properly clear it so here is a quick analogy I use.
17995,"My background is in computer science, I spent 10 years programming computers and have since left that field in favor or reprogramming subconscious minds."
17996,The key thing is knowing how the subconscious/unconscious mind works.
17997,"What is important to know is that, just like a computer, the mind is constantly collecting and storing information based on our experiences (creating our memory)."
17998,Based on the information being stored in our memory the subconscious is then creating programs that are always running (lets call them system processes of the mind).
17999,"These programs are what define our habits, beliefs and behaviors."
18000,Some of the ways new programs get created is through repetition (for example if someone keeps putting you down it can turn into a program that reinforces low self esteem) or via traumatic events.
18001,"In the case of anxiety, the subconscious mind is also running programs designed to keep us safe."
18002,"For example, lets say you've got a headache and take a couple of Tylenol capsules."
18003,Through the process you end up significantly choking on one of the pills as it gets lodged in your throat.
18004,"Luckily, the pill eventually dislodges but this can cause the subconscious mind to believe that pills are a risk to your safety."
18005,It can then launch a program that will create a fear response (hence anxiety) at the thought of taking pills (thinking it is keep you safe) or even a physical response (maybe your throat muscles tense up as you're getting ready to try to take a pill).
18006,Remember that when it comes to anxiety we are dealing with the subconscious/unconscious ... so those who are unaware of the cause of their anxiety may simply be unaware of the root events that created the program.
18007,"For example, you may have had an experience at the age of 2 (maybe attacked by a dog) that you no longer consciously remember although a program created at that time can be creating fear/anxiety in relation to dogs."
18008,"It may also be a program created from habits you subconsciously picked up from your parents (very common), siblings, schoolmates, etc ...

All that being said (and this may already be obvious) for those who are trying to avoid taking medications or get off medications you need to look into and clear the root cause of your anxiety (the malevolent program) in order to properly eliminate it permanently."
18009,"If you have the money, go to a psychiatrist and get medication."
18010,Consider yourself lucky: you were born in a time when methods and medication exist to treat mental problems.
18011,"I'm more interested in what to avoid doing, I have cheering her up down to a fine art but what are some common things that set of people with anxiety?"
18012,"She had diagnosed Social Anxiety for years before we started going out, I met her and got to know her, we started dating and for a good year it was much better, now she's starting to be more anxious and less socially comfortable again."
18013,"She feels she has no friends, cant talk to anyone at school, not even teachers."
18014,I'd just like some advice.
18015,"INFO of GF:

* age: Mid Teens
* gender: F
* type of anxiety: Social
* medications(if any): Fluoxetine
* country: UK

EDIT: Anti Depressant is Fluoxetine

Will delete this thread in 24 hours."
18016,"No matter what I do, if I'm not at home in a ""safe"" place I start to panic about how I'm feeling."
18017,"Checking my pulse, fanatic about staying hydrated, always concentrating on how I'm feeling."
18018,If something just feels a twinge wrong I have a very strong urge to escape and go home.
18019,"I find myself thinking ""I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE."""
18020,As soon as I'm free I always feel better.
18021,I have had two parents die of illness and I watched too much Dr. G as a youngster so the idea of people dying who don't appear sick is so frightening to me.
18022,Any advice?
18023,"Not really interested in meds because surprise, surprise I have a fear of medications."
18024,I'm really sick of this game.
18025,"I've been on Paxil, Celexa, Risperdal, Ativan, Klonopin, Seroquel, Prozac, Buspar, Zoloft, and now Geodon and Luvox."
18026,"When I see people comment on how a particular medication has been a huge help, I get bummed out because I've never really experienced that relief."
18027,"All these medications, and at this point in my life my anxiety, depression, and OCD are worse than they were ten years ago when I started this game."
18028,"I've only been on Luvox for four weeks and hopefully this time around it will be different, and really help me."
18029,"But so far, all these medications have seemed to do is cause side effects and keep me from drinking."
18030,So I am understandably pessimistic.
18031,"For all the challenges in my life, I could sure use an improvement of some kind."
18032,"Even my psychiatrist said when switching me to Luvox, ""it's about time you started feeling better."""
18033,"I was reluctant to start on medication because I really want to try to use coping strategies to deal with my anxiety like exercising and eating healthy, focusing on positive thought processes, etc."
18034,"At this point, I'm not sure what is the medication and what is the anxiety morphing into depression (typically the cycle for me)."
18035,I have to force myself to take my meds to sleep and its usually so damn late the little sleep I get is not REM and I get up and I am even more tired to face the day.
18036,I'm not taking any meds currently and I'm almost certain that I'm using sex in a similar way I could use medication.
18037,Most under the mind set that I didn't want to be dependent on a medication to feel normal.
18038,"I'm not on meds currently, having got off of them in October."
18039,"I have severe, severe GAD, social anxiety, and depression and have for my entire adult life."
18040,I was on zoloft for nearly a decade and took klonopin on a daily basis (as recommended by previous doc) and I was a complete zombie and coming off of zoloft was HELL.
18041,"I was hesitant about taking any medications after that and i agreed i would only take ones with the least amount of side effects, my new psych doc put me on wellbutrin, neurontin, and buspar."
18042,It's been about 6 months and i don't feel like i can think straight and i feel like i'm making poor life decisions and i have no motivations or even goals in life.
18043,i'm starting school again and need to be able to think.
18044,i can't decide if it's the severe anxiety or the meds that is causing the brain fog.
18045,"I've lowered my dose of neurontin and seem to be able to think a little clearer, but my anxiety is so bad...."
18046,A day after coming home I went to my GP and he put me on sinus medication.
18047,(with the hopes of getting medication).
18048,Any advice welcome and how did medication affect your anxiety?
18049,"I haven't had anxiety this bad in months, so I don't have any meds for it."
18050,"The obvious answer is immediate-acting anti-anxiety meds (benzodiazepines) such as Klonopin, Xanax etc but I’ve found I still have problems with anxiety even after taking the benzo I’m prescribed (Klonopin), even if it does somewhat diminish my anxiety and take the edge off of things."
18051,"I was recently diagnosed with PTSD, after years of a bi polar disorder misdiagnosis."
18052,"I was taken off of all of medications when I began treatment, which was my choice."
18053,The next 3-4 weeks are going to be extremely anxiety ridden for me due to work stesses as well as some personal problems.
18054,Its been building up this entire week.
18055,I've gotten to a point where I can't sleep.
18056,"I've been on the verge of an anxiety attack a couple of times, but the breathing exercises are becoming less and less effective as my stress level goes through the roof."
18057,What can I do to get through these few weeks?
18058,Removing the stressors is just simply not an option.
18059,Please help me.
18060,I feel a break down coming on full force.
18061,This feeling in particular is what I'm hoping medication can help with.
18062,So I'm asking about medication because it's all new to me.
18063,I realize medication is perhaps too easy a solution but I think with some of my issues it could be just the help I need.
18064,Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor and am in no way suggesting the use of cannabis as a replacement for proper medication.
18065,If the doctor does decide that I need medication etc.
18066,"It looks like 6 months of medication, life changes and therapy is finally starting to pay off..."
18067,"The only thing remaining is the yawning all the time, sexual problems (I pretty much have no libido anymore) and I think I may have sleeping issues due to the meds."
18068,Do the meds help?
18069,Going to the doc soon to see if I need to up my dosage or possibly switch medication (oh boy...).
18070,"So to summarize: The meds probably aren't working as intended, and I'm not sure my therapist is the right guy for me."
18071,"Luckily, the meds seem to stabilize my mood or I'm pretty sure I'd be in another big low."
18072,"I don't want to take medication, either due to how I will feel when I have to stop taking them in the long run, or that I will become dependent on them."
18073,"I've seen numerous therapists and am currently taking Lamictal and Abilify in unison to quell my mood swings and general anxiety, as well as a panic medication for when the panic attacks start to set in."
18074,"I couldn't do it on my own and I hated it, I caved in and got medication and it worked, at least for me."
18075,"With the help of medication and dedication, I was able to make something of my life and start to conquer my demons."
18076,He prescribed an anti-anxiety medication (don't remember the name but it was 7.5mg) and told me to take half every night.
18077,"Technically the only one I drink is Seagrams ginger Ale, but that's only so I can take my medicine without gagging."
18078,"I am unsure what to do...I know I should just take my anxiety medicine and disregard such thoughts, but it hurts."
18079,I attempted to make an appointment with a psychiatrist to discuss anxiety treatment options with medication but without insurance I'm looking at ~$300 for a new patient evaluation and revisits being roughly $150.
18080,I'm however eager to explore medication options for the first time but the price tag seems nasty for a broke college kid.
18081,"What did you do, as a penniless individual, to take the first steps to seeking medication treatment?"
18082,(I do not want to take medication.
18083,"So they refuse doctor visits and medication, even after my doctor and another neurologist ordered a MRI of my head..she said yeah sure!"
18084,"I finally got to telling him that the doc prescribed me the meds, and that I was still trying to decide whether to fill them or not."
18085,""", which was closely followed by ""I think you are strong enough to deal with this without meds""."
18086,"We talked about it more, and eventually he explained that he has loved the person I have been throughout the relationship, and doesn't want that to change due to the meds."
18087,"While I understand his concern, after the experience I had today (finally trying to open up to someone about my anxiety, crying in front of a stranger for the first time, being prescribed medication for a disorder I have actively tried to hide from everyone, etc, etc, etc) it was not what I wanted or needed to hear."
18088,"Now I feel like if I fill the rx and start the meds, he will think I'm weak, or that I failed somehow, and eventually start to resent me."
18089,"Don't get me wrong, I have my own concerns about starting medication."
18090,"But at the same time, I live with this crushing anxiety constantly....something's gotta give eventually, and if the medication can help with that, what is the big deal?"
18091,"I don't mind that he wanted to share his opinion, but later on in the conversation I brought it back up and said that I was worried that he would think I wasn't strong enough if I decided to take the meds due to his prior comments."
18092,i've been on medication/therapy off and on (90% on) for 15 years.
18093,"I've tried medication, and therapy and neither worked."
18094,I am looking for any alternatives to traditional meds..
18095,"Due to my classes for the semester, I cannot be on medication that completely numbs me and kills my creativity (faced this with Zoloft) -- I will fail -- and I would rather put up with the crazy than flunking a class in my major."
18096,I have finally been getting treatment for the past few months for my GAD and depression but the only attempt my doctors have made to help my anxiety and depression has been medication.
18097,I would like to not use medication and focus more on natural ways of handling my anxiety/panic attacks.
18098,"I am very nervous about talking to my doctor about having a therapy cat, i don't want to feel silly for it, especially when I tell him I don't want to use medication to treat my anxiety."
18099,I've never taken meds and doing so could negatively impact my status at work.
18100,"I've been dealing with anxiety, intrusive thoughts, obsessive thoughts for years, and I've been self medicating myself through it, and I've never had a help, or medications or anything."
18101,"Usually my anxiety is steady, and never too bad."
18102,"But I go through episodes, where it gets really bad, and I have bad intrusive thoughts, and obsessive thoughts over things, and it leaves me depressed, and drained."
18103,"I finally decided to open up completely, and I told my girlfriend about the extent of it all, and she's really understanding, and supportive."
18104,"She's really pushing for me to get help, and to stop running from it."
18105,"I know I need to, but I always tell myself I'm fine, and then I'll feel content for a while, and regret once I feel really anxious again."
18106,"So no more running; I want to get help, before it completely ruins my life."
18107,"I want to be stable, and be able to have a stable future with my girlfriend, and have a family and such."
18108,"So, I really want to get therapy, but I have no idea where to start?"
18109,"Do I consult my doctor first, or look for a nearby therapist?"
18110,How does it work?
18111,Thanks.
18112,I have very bad anxiety and compulsive thoughts which I take regular meds for and currently get CBT therapy.
18113,"I would like to find someone (doctor, counselor) that can give me counseling and also give me good advice on medication."
18114,I have noticed my MD has no problem prescribing me medication but does not know much about anxiety and previous counselors/psychologists know about counseling but hate that I take medication.
18115,"I've for the most part been able to control other anxiety with distraction, medication or weed, but this particular brand has a hold over me."
18116,"I do not take medication anymore for my issues, haven't for about 8 years or so."
18117,"I talked with the counselor about regular therapy the rest of this year and summer, maybe medication."
18118,"I've never been on any anti-anxiety medication before, have any of you been on lorazepam (Ativan)?"
18119,"I'll keep my fingers crossed that I get the medication and not the placebo, and hopefully it does help!"
18120,"I'm 18 now, and have been on medication for the past 7-8 years, pretty much as long back as I can remember."
18121,"For the past maybe 6 months I've been feeling horrible, my situation has gotten worse, and despite my psychologist prescribing new meds I still feel awful."
18122,"I don't attribute any of this to the medication, but I feel it's not helping and I would feel better if I was off it, even just for a few months to evaluate my situation with a clear head, but after even a day without taking my main pill that I've been on for about 2-3 years I feel absolutely horrible and can't even function, and I feel almost weighed down by the drugs that once helped me."
18123,"**Male, 21, no meds currently**

&gt;Picking cuticles, 
&gt;Scratching ears to the point of bleeding,

18125,"I haven't told really anybody about my problems (depression and generalized anxiety disorder), and I am on medication (zoloft 150 mg and abilify 5 mg)."
18126,I'm not interested in medication.
18127,I went to the doctor today and I've been diagnosed with anxiety and obsessive and delusional thoughts.
18128,I was on Seroquel but I asked to switch cause of the weight gain.
18129,"He told me that seroquel is the only medicine certified to treat the ups and downs, so I need to take two medicines."
18130,He said to think of it like an Oreo.
18131,I need medicine controlling my highs and lows in order to meet in the perfect middle.
18132,"He prescribed me geodon, which I've read is the best for weight gain, and lamictal."
18133,He was kinda frustrated about my request and didn't believe seroquel effects metabolism.
18134,"Anyways, can anyone explain the time of the two medicines in simple terms."
18135,"Does one help lift my mood, while another control my mood/thoughts from spiraling out of control?"
18136,Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
18137,Hey guys!
18138,I'm new to this subreddit.
18139,I was diagnosed with Anxiety this past January and let me tell you it has not been easy on me (as most of you may understand).
18140,"I'm constantly feeling nauseous, fatigue, dizzy, shaky, and sometimes have trouble breathing."
18141,It has been a daily struggle.
18142,"I'm a senior in high school currently transitioning to college, but I'm not really stress out about anything."
18143,One thing that always seems to be on my mind is throwing up.
18144,I have been afraid of throwing up since this past December when I had the stomach flu.
18145,"The reason I'm on here is to ask, do you guys every get really nauseous from anxiety?"
18146,And what do you do to help?
18147,I'm currently not on any medications.
18148,"We discussed my syptoms and she reccomended that I begin a therapy group, and then if I was still experiencing syptoms after 2 months then to call her, which then she would recommend medication."
18149,"I'm working a second seasonal job that ends next month, so when that ends and I have more time, I'm going to start therapy again and hopefully try medication."
18150,Hello!!
18151,Just looking to see if anyone has any experience with this combo.
18152,I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2006 (although it has been an affliction as far as I can remember).
18153,"I was on Adderall for several years in college which led to some abuse, but I got it under control."
18154,"After years of trying medications, a year ago I started 50mg of Zoloft and it really seems to help me handle everything (hooray)!"
18155,"Only problem is, I have trouble concentrating even more and every so often, I just want to sleep for days."
18156,"Dealing with this for so long, I completely understand that drugs aren't the answer, just a a stable foundation to build a house."
18157,"Today, I was prescribed Strattera, which my doctor said wouldn't counter act the Zoloft."
18158,Anybody with similar stories?
18159,Same combo?
18160,Suggestions?
18161,"I know everybody has different reactions, but familiarity and sharing helps, right?"
18162,Thanks all!
18163,I avoided meds for long as I can.
18164,"I have been taking medication for my anxiety, but I don't want to rely on it to get to sleep."
18165,"Hey guys, I've been having a hard time digesting food due to lack of bile (because I don't have a gallbladder), about 11 days ago I woke up with diarrhea and high blood pressure, next thing I know the next couple of days has been full of anxiety."
18166,"My hands get cold, I get scared, I start shaking, my blood pressure goes high (I take bp medications for that), and I really can't focus on anything, I can barely speak, get the urge to pee a lot."
18167,"I don't know what to do in these situations, I feel like a scared animal."
18168,I try telling myself it's okay but it gets worse.
18169,"I breathe normally, I only had hyperventilation one day."
18170,I feel scared that there's something wrong with me and I can't contain it.
18171,What would you guys suggest I do...
18172,"Anyways, here is my question--Can I get some kind of medicine from a regular, family doctor?"
18173,"I had to stop my ADHD medication a couple months ago, and now I'm drowning in school."
18174,What coping strategies minus meds do you guys use?
18175,I've been suffering panic attacks and anxiety for almost exactly 10 years now.
18176,I'll give a brief history below in case this matches your symptoms.
18177,TL;DR provided at the bottom.
18178,It started in my mid 20's (which I hear is common) with a series of panic attacks (I didn't know what they were until visiting the doctor a few months after they started).
18179,These panic attacks even in retrospect were pretty severe.
18180,"Most of the time, it was a feeling of severe disassociation, terror, and confusion, with the physical symptoms of rapid heart beat and light headedness."
18181,"At first, I seemed to have no trigger, they would just hit out of random."
18182,"Then after a few panic attacks driving alone in a car, they became more frequent while driving."
18183,"The caused me to become a bit of a shut-in for a while, scared to drive anywhere."
18184,"I have long since forced myself to drive to take the power away from that fear, with good success."
18185,"Still get panic attacks on the road occasionally, but I'm not going to let that interfere anymore."
18186,I've been given various medications: Effexor (which I stopped taking after a few months due to all the side effects).
18187,"For spot treatment of panic attacks, I was given clonazepam."
18188,"I found I was NEVER able to take a full one, it whacked me out too much and honestly triggered panic attacks due to the wave of it coming on."
18189,"I don't know how to explain that one ;)

So for about the past 8 years, I've been dealing with the anxiety with tiny doses of clonazepam, although I think it's worked more as a placebo than anything else."
18190,"Lately, my career has picked up and I have also started doing a lot of stage acting."
18191,"Work has caused a general level of anxiety for me, not severe, but enough to keep me on edge on and off."
18192,Theater was a different story.
18193,"I love doing it, but I would generally have an anxiety attack within the first 5 minutes of being on stage."
18194,That's NOT a great place to have a panic episode (unless it works for your character!).
18195,"Many of these attacks came from the fear of getting sick on stage, the fear of which fueled a panic attack."
18196,Recently I got a huge role that would require me to basically be on stage full time for 3 hours each performance.
18197,"I could have declined it and let my anxiety win, but instead I decided I would push through."
18198,"I've been seeing a therapist lately to talk through the anxiety which has been great, but he asked for me to go back to the doctor to see if there are any other things I could try medication-wise."
18199,"This time, the doctor prescribed me propranolol, a beta-blocker, 10MG."
18200,"He explained that this would help keep the physical symptoms of the rush of adrenaline from affecting my body so much, effectively lessening the feeling of an oncoming panic attack, hopefully breaking the cycle."
18201,AND IT HAS WORKED.
18202,"I take on in the morning, one around dinner."
18203,"I don't feel on edge of a panic attack all the time, I don't feel the physical symptoms nearly as bad before getting on stage or driving, and best of all I haven't felt any side effects as of yet."
18204,"Maybe a tiny bit tired when I first started it, but no more."
18205,"I don't want to be on medication my whole life, but this has been so helpful for dealing with the short term dips into an anxious state."
18206,"**TL;DR: propranolol has help curb my body's response to the rush of anxiety, hasn't mucked up my clarity, and has made me feel like I'm in control again."
18207,"** 

Edit: I forgot I also tried Lexapro."
18208,NEVER AGAIN.
18209,"Edit #2: OH, and something I've started to notice."
18210,I'm craving cigarettes a lot less.
18211,"I was never a heavy smoker (2-3 cigarettes a day), but it's been hard to just put them down."
18212,Now I'm barely smoking 1.
18213,I just don't want them as much.
18214,"Not sure if this is an actual effect of the medication, or just from being more calm in general."
18215,I have had medication and counseling awhile but it's obviously not working.
18216,"Btw Yes I've done therapy, been to a psych hospital, and I'm on medication."
18217,b) Should I be looking to get other medication?
18218,Is it better to try to stay clean and do it without meds?
18219,"Or can my GP prescribe anxiety medication, and if so is that a simpler/better option?"
18220,"I am pretty scared of taking medication, too."
18221,"I'd love to hear what works for you guys, whether it's knitting, medication, or even talking to pets."
18222,"She also said that in four weeks time we'll meet again to discuss other courses of action if counselling isn't for me, and she specifically mentioned medication."
18223,"What I'd like to know is what would this medication do, what are the long terms affects of being on it, would it bring any side affects and how reliant should you be on it?"
18224,"The stress of my fathers death triggered a number of things, Migraines, (I still take Imitrex shots for them), Blood pressure problems, (Controlled), Ulcer symptoms, (Controlled with daily meds), and the worst Bowel pain you can imagine."
18225,My meds?
18226,"She, also, is on enough pain medication to probably kill a person without her high tolerance."
18227,Her meds?
18228,"Does anyone have any strategies for beating the ""social"" part of anxiety that doesn't require intense therapy and medication?"
18229,Am I allowed to specifically ask my GP for certain medication?
18230,I flew home to be with family and recover until the meds I was prescribed kicked in.
18231,"Unfortunately, whenever I start meds like this, they usually give me vivid dreams."
18232,Only temporary until the meds kick in.
18233,Update: I talked to a pharmacist at Walgreen's and they told me to stop taking the medication since it's harming me.
18234,Would like advise on how to manage besides meds.
18235,I remember my first panic attack and remember what it felt like and how I got it under control so I have always felt that I didn't need meds.
18236,"So for the past 8-10 years I have been in therapy, tests and other fun things."
18237,"It was only until recently that I was ever diagnosed with anything, which in all common sense seems a little late."
18238,"I was diagnosed with ADHD-I, Agoraphobia and an Anxiety disorder."
18239,"Whenever I talk to someone about anxiety, they tell me that anxiety isn't something that affects them 24/7."
18240,For me it is exactly that.
18241,"Nothing ""triggers"" my anxiety and nothing relieves it, it only gets worse over time."
18242,"Most recently it has caused me to be unable to sleep in a healthy way, I get maybe 3-4 hours of stage 2 sleep, and I never go into REM sleep."
18243,"(Went through extensive sleep tests to just get the answer ""you have a sleeping disorder"" and nothing more)

Everyone thinks my symptoms are psychosomatic when nothing triggers it."
18244,"Sure, every psychiatrist that has talked to me looks at my past, and immediately treats me like I went through the most depressing life ever, mainly because my father had 2 life threatening diseases for years, and he was expected to die before I was even born, but lived til I was 16."
18245,"I am gay, live in a christian household (everyone is supportive, and no one cares that I am gay as long as I do not change myself)."
18246,"I am 18 now and recently everything has just gotten worse, nothing anyone says interests me, nothing motivates me, my skin is cold but I sweat at night and during the day, and my chest constantly feels heavier every day, and I feel apathetic towards everything."
18247,"I have tried SEVERAL medications, to the point where every doctor just gave up on giving me medication."
18248,"Medication just never helped in the slightest, just gave me internal issues that happily didn't cause any damage."
18249,My thoughts have turned obsessive and suicidal thoughts are a very common thing with me.
18250,On Tuesday I am going to see a psychologist for an evaluation for therapy... again.
18251,I hope something will change.
18252,"(no this is not a throwaway account, I am not scared if people find out about this stuff)"
18253,"I want to switch meds, but my next appointment is in November during my Thanksgiving break."
18254,"(I'm having a lot of trouble describing it right now, partly because my mind is so foggy right now and partly because I've been on this medicine since February, so I don't have any recent examples as far as things that have been triggering me)."
18255,"About 5 months ago, after one too many embarrassing moments, I started trying medication again after years off of therapy and meds because of some bad experiences and general ineffectiveness."
18256,"Part of me wants to stick it out, suggest trying some meds I tried when I was younger (we got a genetic screening, so a higher/lower dose of something might work) and suggest trying rescue again, and I can give it to my mom to give to me."
18257,I've been taking Lexapro for probably two or three years now for my anxiety issues.
18258,I've gradually been training myself mentally to deal with problems to a point where I think I stop taking it.
18259,Additionally I think its been making me very lethargic and it affects my sex drive a bit.
18260,I've heard conflicting reports that halting medications like Lexapro cold turkey is bad for mental health.
18261,Obviously it'd be easier to quit cold turkey but if it affects me I'd rather ween myself off.
18262,"They (lexapro) work, don't get me wrong, but being on a daily medication isn't something I'm personally comfortable with."
18263,"I have ulcerative colitis, it makes me bleed internally in my colon but is kept in check with medicine."
18264,"Nothing was working, and I was seriously considering meds."
18265,Since I'm in college the doctor said the medicine is extremely cheap if I try it.
18266,"Since then, I have improved vastly (without meds) and gone from having attacks everyday to about once a week/fortnight."
18267,"I'm currently on Luvox and Klonopin, but I know that it's going to take a lot more than medication to break the self-perpetuating cycle."
18268,"I've been going to doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, two support groups a week and I'm finally starting to feel a bit better but I'm trying to get adjusted to my new medication and I feel constantly sick and gross."
18269,"After getting the IV (that was not fun, but I was a trooper) I received 3 meds pushed slow with time in between."
18270,"Went to a clinic and got some medication, but my anxiety was still so strong that I wasn't able to go back to work on Monday, or even call in."
18271,I have tried tapering off the SSRI medication but I can immediately feel a huge difference.
18272,After going back on the SSRI medication I am experiencing the worst of both worlds.
18273,I need to know what I can do to improve my anxiety without being on any medication.
18274,"I do this for 8-12 weeks and if that doesnt work, she reccomended that I try medication."
18275,"(Which I guess I'll take medicine in that case, but 12 weeks is a long time, and who knows how that'll go??)"
18276,"I'm taking medication for a heart condition which lowers my blood pressure, but I don't think that would have anything to do with it."
18277,I really prefer not to go on medication.
18278,I recently started taking meds for my anxiety because the symptoms had gotten to be too intense for me to continue to suppress them.
18279,I started initially on alprazolam and wellbutrin and the anti-anxiety meds worked amazingly well.
18280,"I felt relieved that they'd called in a medication for me that I knew would help, but also completely humiliated at the thought that they thought I was some sort of drug-hound trying to weasel medication out of them."
18281,I've been having a rough couple of days and I just need to talk.
18282,"I can, and will, talk to friends as well, but it's just so frustrating to try to explain to people who don't understand."
18283,"They try, but at the end of the day I just feel like they think I'm complaining about something minor or even non-existent because I can't just show them a wound to empathize with."
18284,I have [panic disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_disorder).
18285,"I remember having my first panic attack when I was younger than ten years but they don't diagnose panic disorder that young, if I'd seen a doctor they probably would've called it GAD."
18286,I saw a therapist for the first time in my early teens.
18287,"The anxiety started before my family tumult but was surely exacerbated by it as time went on, I won't go into the details (an across the world move, a divorce, deaths, etc.)"
18288,because that's beside the point.
18289,It was harder when I was younger because my family life was so intense and unsupportive and when I reacted physically I didn't know what was happening.
18290,"I would think, sitting in my desk at school, that the bones in my hands were trying to claw their way out of my skin."
18291,At night I would curl up in a tight ball because if my feet touched the end of the bed I'd have to recognize that I was growing physically which meant I was also growing closer to death.
18292,I'd hide under the covers at night thinking that the shades over my windows were opening themselves and that monsters were waiting outside to kill me and I'd race up the stairs in the dark because I thought hands were reaching out from beneath them to grab my ankles.
18293,I was put on antipsychotics that I still have stretch marks from because I gained so much weight so quickly.
18294,After years of doctors and medications and exploration I accepted what I have and that it isn't going anywhere.
18295,Knowing what it is makes a world of difference.
18296,"This is how I explain it to people now:

I'm walking down the middle of a road on a sunny day, everything is just fine."
18297,I hear a pebble skip behind me and I turn to see where it went.
18298,"I find a car there, feet away, racing toward me, and I don't have time to run."
18299,"My heart races, my muscles tense, my sight tunnels, my breathing stops."
18300,"I'm terrified, I'm about to die."
18301,"That moment of, well, panic - sometimes I feel it five times a day."
18302,"Sometimes I might not feel it for a whole day or two, those I recognize as great times."
18303,Sometimes it passes in an instant and sometimes it stays for hours.
18304,"It might hit me while I'm alone or while I'm with a group of people, at work or in a store."
18305,"You know in movies and shows with ""crazy people"" how sometimes they'll hit their heads over and over with the palms of their hands?"
18306,"I do that, but I've been doing it  for so long that when I close my eyes tight and my hand goes to my forehead I'll brush my hair back so you don't recognize what I'm really doing."
18307,People comment on how often I sigh sometimes and tend to attribute it to something like boredom when really those sighs are heavy exhales because I just panicked and had been holding my breath.
18308,I've been doing this long enough that I know how to look normal and sometimes that's even more terrible because it makes it harder for people to believe me when I try to explain that I'm not well.
18309,"I'm not afraid of people or situations, my self-esteem is pretty adequate and I've been described as being laid back and accepting, which is one of the bittersweet qualities of this anxiety."
18310,Being struck so often by the fear of an inevitable death gives me a lot of perspective.
18311,The absurdity of this condition is that it's given me some phenomenal gifts in addition to the daily struggles.
18312,"It's hard, extremely hard, and it's the kind of dark that makes people very, very uncomfortable."
18313,"I function because I have to but it takes so much more than healthy people realize, and some days, like today, I just feel so frustrated."
18314,There's plenty more I could say but this is already growing long.
18315,"I'll answer questions if you have any, I don't mind talking about it, in fact, it helps to think that I might be able to help someone else understand."
18316,My therapist thinks it would be good for me to have as needed anxiety meds but my regular doctor wont give them to me.
18317,I've recently upped my medication- under doctor supervision- and have been walking around with that really terrifying constant underlying dread.
18318,"My mother worked with me to drop band (which I was certain was causing most of my stress), took me to a doctor to get medicine, and helped set up therapy (first real session tomorrow)."
18319,"My medicine has helped with my depression, but I don't think I've stopped shaking and tensing my muscles in months."
18320,[Medication] I recently decided to address my anxiety and sleep issues with medication.
18321,"But I want to get over my anxiety, so I need to realize that these pills serve a purpose and to trust my doctor, and medication."
18322,"I need to find a nice buffer of trusting the medication, taking it with confidence, but also not subjecting myself to withdrawal symptoms."
18323,I also fear how medication might affect me as well as the social repercussions surrounding it.
18324,"My boss saw me vomiting in the parking lot whiich is something i have done since I was in 7th grade ( nervous reaction).i'm in thereapy, on medication,  excercising , meditating, I have a great support system."
18325,Nothing helps Stop the panic attacks except the medication which means I can't operate a vehicle and that  was part of my job ( pool tech ).
18326,"I also have decreased sex drive, and it's a pain in the ass to have to remember to take all my meds every night."
18327,I also worry about being on meds for my whole life; I'm especially worried about if I ever want to get pregnant.
18328,"She thinks I'm ready to try and wean off my meds, and re-adjust to life without them."
18329,"*My body and mind are, and ever will be controlled by the peace of God (the Highest Spirit) and love for all, and not preoccupied by judgement, guilt, or doubt."
18330,Let my spirit be wholly light and unclouded by the darkness of worry or listlessness.
18331,"*


Lately my therapist and I have been working on some ways to battle anxiety and heal the brain and body without the use of dependent medications."
18332,"I've been on SSRI's and SNRI's for the better part of 7 years now and would like to work to manage and know myself without them, at least for a time."
18333,"She is teaching me a meditative practice called the **H**ealing **E**nergy **L**ight **P**rayer, that focuses my intentions upward, on positivty and tranquility."
18334,"The best way to do this, she says, is to have a mantra, or chant that you can use to verbalize your intentions and keep you focused as you slowly let it flood all of your being."
18335,"Energy healing and metaphysics aside, I find that a good mantra has always really helped me when I need to align my breathing and relax my mind."
18336,"It reminds me that one time I was positive I COULD be tranquil, that one time (whenever I thought of it) I WAS calm and not panicking, and that I WILL embody that tranquility again, even if it feels like that's impossible."
18337,What are your mantras?
18338,"What quotes, or intentions do you set for yourself to get through your healing and anxieties?"
18339,"If you've never thought of any, maybe it could be a useful exercise for you."
18340,"&lt;3 Loving vibes and clear, positive intentions are going out to all of you today."
18341,We care for you and love you in this community!
18342,Don't forget how awesome you are :)
18343,What I'm looking for is maybe some legal medication since I've been trying to avoid drugs/alcohol due to family history including addictions to both.
18344,"tl;dr: don't want therapy, just want meds"
18345,"Whether I need a higher dose of Paxil, A replacement medication or maybe an additional one, I don't know."
18346,I am seeing a therapist and taking medication which is helping immensely.
18347,I start by saying don't fear the meds but also don't jump onto the medication bandwagon.
18348,"You should really try all other resources before hitting up medication - meditation, exercise, CBT and diet."
18349,Even if you choose to try medication you should continue to do all 4 of these things regardless.
18350,So I am here to tell you that you shouldn't fear medication.
18351,Those of you who have had bad experience with medication please try to put your experience in a positive light to help ease the burdens of those who are fearful of trying it.
18352,My advice is to use medication as a last resort - if you are experiencing some temporary life changes don't run to medication (i.e.
18353,Talk to your doctor about therapy and other solutions before jumping on meds.
18354,For those who are exhausted and frustrated that nothing has helped them and haven't tried medication then please talk to your doctor about it and don't fear it!
18355,I for one feared medication for the longest time...let's say about 9 years.
18356,I started small and cut the pills in half and slowly introduced the medication to my body.
18357,The medication has really helped me open up my world and stop the shrinking feeling.
18358,Please remember that this medication is a bandage and a crutch.
18359,Same goes for medication.
18360,I was once very afraid to try meds and you aren't alone.
18361,"If it really freaks you out take a tiny little grain of the medication, put it on your tongue, swallow it."
18362,I was prescribed some lorazepam  ( I already take anxiety meds daily ) and it was quite the little miracle but that's besides the point.
18363,I was not allowed to to shave or take my migraine medicine.
18364,What is the best way to get rid of anxiety (Not just driving) without medication.
18365,(I cannot go on meds or I cannot join the military.
18366,"I was put on Lexapro, but my psychiatrist hasn't renewed my medication in a month so I've been on my own."
18367,But the scariest part of it is coming off of my meds and the unknown of how bad I will suffer if I do get pregnant without my anxiety meds.
18368,I just started medication two weeks ago.
18369,"So, I broke down finally and made an appointment for medication management."
18370,"The past few years I have not been medicated for anxiety, however, I know it is an issue for me but I have been doing quite well without medication."
18371,"At first, I went off medication because I didn't have insurance."
18372,"I explained that I had questions, needed a doctor for medication management and that I wanted to know if I could get a new patient appointment."
18373,She asked me some basic questions and said I could have an appointment but the Doctor would not give me medication without therapy.
18374,The medication is collecting dust on my shelf.
18375,Go to the student health center and get prescribed medication.
18376,What if they don't want to give me medicine?
18377,What if they just think I'm trying to get medicine to sell?
18378,"I should note that I'm 30 years old, male, and I've never been on any anxiety meds."
18379,TL;DR version:  Things were good so I dropped down on my meds.
18380,So I was just diagnosed with GAD today and my councilor suggested going on a medication before we start therapy next semester.
18381,"I have been on Welbutrin before and hated it, any one have any stories or suggestions on other medications out there?"
18382,"Anyway, my therapist asked me recently if I'd considered trying medication."
18383,I'm just... leery of medication?
18384,"And yet, I also love a good beer, and I'd hate to not be able to drink occasionally on meds."
18385,"I'm a writer, and I'm afraid I wouldn't think the same or be able to write if I went on meds."
18386,No meds?
18387,Should I try meds?
18388,Not bad enough to need medication and most the time Im fine.
18389,"I know self medication is the result of problems in my life, i.e."
18390,I'd like to hear about anyone's experience with Valium or other fast-acting meds (sedatives?
18391,"I don't have a therapist, don't take meds, and for the most part have just dealt with periods of anxiousness with yoga, keeping away from public situations, and occasionally stress-eating popcorn."
18392,"I take my anxiety/depression meds at night before bed, and I don't know if maybe taking it at a different time will help or not...but this is truly making every morning a waking nightmare."
18393,"My therapist gave me an sort of ultimatum this week, she said I can continue therapy which she said could be up to a year plus or I can be prescribed medication."
18394,"I'm kind of skeptical of medication but anxiety has kept me out of school and work for 6 months already and I just don't feel me any more
Just a few questions 

1."
18395,"Is the medication controlling in anyway, do you not feel your self after taking them, does it hold back your emotions?"
18396,Would you recommend medicine or therapy?
18397,"I really don't know anyone that has taken medicine for anxiety so I guess I would come here for help, and hopefully you guys can help me!"
18398,"Hi there,

My wife went on medication after boughts of anxiety attacks and some persistent thoughts / obsessive compulsive stuff."
18399,"This all started when she started with medication, and her doctor told us this is a common side effect."
18400,"She feels responsible for this problem, and attributes it to the medication (so do I)."
18401,TLDR: How have you worked with/through your medication to keep a happy sex life?
18402,I am on meds but its not helping with this.
18403,Seeing the negative impact my anxiety is having on me caused me to try to find out what kind of medication would be best.
18404,"Or meds like it... does anyone have any advice, or insight on what I can expect?"
18405,"I don't even like taking generic medication, why would you think I'm taking whatever the fuck that is?"
18406,The meds I'm on are day to day and they help lower general anxiety but when an attack comes on I'm severely debilitated.
18407,"I have a doctors appointment (GP) tomorrow but I don't know exactly what to tell him, my therapist and I have tried a range of things but she basically said to me that if it gets worse or keeps up at the range it is that the only other options are medication or to leave my job."
18408,"I'm cutting off a lot of detail here, but basically after Obamacare took effect, I lost my psychiatrist and have been having trouble finding a new one and I don't have enough medication to keep the treatment going."
18409,Is there any way of controlling myself without meds (OTC could work).
18410,I've lost everything because of anxiety and depression I'm just a loser now I'm even taking medicine and it isn't helping i just want to die.
18411,I'm just having a day.
18412,I've doubled up on my klonopin (doctor approved) but I think I just held in too much shit last week.
18413,It was the 3 year anniversary of my brothers death &amp; things were just really screwed up because my family is a bunch of bad people.
18414,I don't wanna whine too badly but am I the only person who calls into work &amp; just stays in bed until 4 pm?
18415,I just want a reminder that it's gonna be okay and right now I don't have that and I am angry with myself that I can't just explain it to myself.
18416,"General info [24/f, 25 on Friday], medications: klonopin &amp; lamictal (have been working well for the most part), therapy: none, was told I was rational enough to work my problems out alone by a therapist."
18417,Not sure if that was a compliment or an insult.
18418,"Whatever, it's saving me money I surely don't have."
18419,"I also have been taking medicine for my anxiety, on and off, since then."
18420,"So I am sure this has been asked a million times, but I just started on Prozac for anxiety and depression and I am wondering how many of you have any experience with it?"
18421,"Today is only my first day taking it, so I didn't expect to feel any positive effects or anything."
18422,"I have been feeling pretty nauseous all day though, so that is no fun

 :(

How long did it take for you to start feeling the effects?"
18423,Did you have any side effects?
18424,How long did they last for you?
18425,"I meant to ask my therapist but I forgot - and google didnt turn up any useful results for me, but do you know if it is safe to take gravol while taking Prozac (or any anti-anxiety meds really...) I don't take any other medications, but I dont want to mess with this is gravol isn't good to mix."
18426,"With cognitive therapy/meds, I have gotten a clearer view of this disorder and taken control back in my life (mostly)."
18427,"I didn't want to be on the medication forever though, so a couple months ago I started tapering."
18428,"Edit: If it counts for anything, I figured I'd throw out that I am on medication (on my 3rd or 4th month)."
18429,"I have an appointment with a therapist to start some medication and do CBT next Tuesday, but lately things have been getting so much worse."
18430,"I did a search about anxiety and weight gain, but all I found were posts talking about having gained weight while taking a certain medication."
18431,I'm considering going to the hospital just to see a doctor that'll prescribe me anti-anxiety medication.
18432,It was diagnosed but i wasn't put on medication until about 6th grade.
18433,"As I grew older, I stayed on my medicine but I developed a skill set to help me deal with anxiety."
18434,I've been to the doctor and they give me acid-suppressing medication and send me away.
18435,"I've tried various medication (tecta, rabeprazole, metoclopramide, ranitidine and sucraflate coating) none of which have helped."
18436,"He's not taking medication for his anxiety, and as I said he doesn't believe in therapy."
18437,"Starting probably around December, I had switched to a new medication that had me feeling great."
18438,Also apologies for the thousands of questions I have posted regarding this medication.
18439,"The nausea seems to have subsided a bit, but my anxiety is now ramped up - I'm taking more xanax than I was before I started this medication to cope."
18440,Or is this what this medication does - numb all emotions within me to treat the anxiety?
18441,I know that I've only been on the medication for little more than a week now and that I've only been on the full dose for 4 days... and that it can take 4-6 weeks for the full effect to kick in.
18442,I'm seeing a counsellor in a few days and I think there's a good chance I'll end up on medication.
18443,"I know it isn't a realistic outcome, but I'm really hoping that the medication is the silver bullet that can make me feel like giving up isn't the better option."
18444,Can anybody relate their experience with medication?
18445,Rx medicine also scares me just because I tend to be somewhat of a naturalist I guess.
18446,"After about eight months of CBT I decided to give medication a try about four months ago, and was put on 10mg Lexapro/day, which worked beautifully almost immediately, *except* that it made me really, really fatigued (read: crushingly exhausted, aching muscles due to longing for sleep, actively falling asleep at work - but still, you know, pretty cheerful)."
18447,"She has said I could take a daily low dose of propanolol, but I really want to avoid any medication if possible."
18448,My husband suffers from depression and anxiety and has done in a moderate or severe form for about 8 years.
18449,"Usually, if the depression is bad is suppresses the anxiety; if the depression is more under control, the anxiety flares up."
18450,"He's had weekly appointments with the local mental health nurse, been in low-intensity (telephone) CBT and high-intensity (face-to-face) CBT therapy, and has been on antidepressants since diagnosis."
18451,"He's finally been assigned a psychiatrist, who has changed his medications from 60mg citalopram to 30mg paroxetine per day."
18452,"At the moment, he's on the waiting list to see a psychologist (we're in the UK, the NHS is free, but resources are limited)."
18453,Anyway.
18454,"Lately - since switching to paroxetine - his anxiety has soared, to the point where he's unable to leave the house, or sometimes even the bedroom."
18455,"As a coping mechanism, he's regressing to a childlike state, usually acting about 7 or 8, and I'm 'looking after him' as an adult looks after a child, instead of him making his own decisions and having his own responsibilities."
18456,"It isn't all the time, just in moments of great stress for him, but as his anxiety gets worse, he gets more stressed."
18457,It's getting very wearing for me to be the 'adult' all the time.
18458,(I'm getting bored of watching pokemon!)
18459,"I just wanted to ask if anyone out there had seen or experienced a similar coping mechanism, and if they had any ideas or insight about how to help him through this?"
18460,"I've made an appointment with the psychiatrist, but the next 'urgent' slot isn't til next month."
18461,"**TL;DR, my husband has severe anxiety."
18462,Lately it's got a lot worse and to cope he's reverting to acting like a child so that I can 'look after' him.
18463,Any ideas about how to get him through this?
18464,**
18465,"However, in late spring, I switched to a new place that had both therapists and psychiatrists because I decided that I needed medicine now."
18466,"After about a week of that, I was sure it was the medicine and started taking 15mg again, and felt better, but I still had (though not as bad as when I was on 30mg) symptoms of depression and eventually concluded my depression was now coming back as well."
18467,It took 3 weeks for the medicine to kick in.
18468,"I actually think at this point that I could ween off my medicine completely, but I'm in no rush haha!"
18469,"And if you think you need medicine, don't be afraid to give it a try."
18470,"And if your current medicine isn't working for you, do not be afraid to ask to switch to something else."
18471,There are so many different meds out there for depression and anxiety and many of them work in totally different ways.
18472,My therapist told me many of her patients need to switch their medicine 3-4 times before they find the right one for them.
18473,"I am seeing my family doctor tomorrow and expect medication (which I'm happy for, at this point), but this whole thing has me so shook up, I'm not sure what to think."
18474,"Last year I was diagnosed with GAD as a blanket for several problems caused my a frontal lobe disconnection (ASD, ADHD, OCD, anxiety, intrusive thoughts, etc.)."
18475,"I've been put on a lot of different meds over the last year - anti-seizure, AAPs, stimulants, calcium-channel blockers, blood pressure medications."
18476,"My doctor has tried getting me to sleep more/better, CBT, do productive things in my life to build a reservoir of positive experiences to outweigh the bad ones, change my diet/lifestyle, see other doctors."
18477,I feel like I've done everything possible and my doctor has tried every avenue.
18478,Other doctors have no idea what to do with me either.
18479,"I can't even play competitive video games without adrenaline flooding my veins, making my hands shake and my vision blur."
18480,I can't even drive or be in crowded places for very long.
18481,I'm losing my independence.
18482,Has anyone else shared a similar experience?
18483,How did you get through it?
18484,I don't want to be some shut-in the rest of my life.
18485,"I've always disliked being around people, but I don't want to be afraid of them either."
18486,"I wish I wasn't like this, I might need to go back on some medication to calm me down"
18487,I keep posting about medication here and I'm sorry.
18488,"I am on wellbutrin, but should I see about getting on anxiety medication?"
18489,"Ive taken paxil for abut 4 months now and I can feel the 20mg no longer working, rather than bump up my meds, Im thinking of tapering down."
18490,"I don't take medication, because I'm personally against it."
18491,"i've hardly any experience with medication so my understanding of other options is limited, but i'm told this is one of the mildest anxiety options."
18492,I've also recently come down with strong signs of depression caused by medication.
18493,"Not currently on any medication, but I'm considering seeking some for those really bad days."
18494,"It's getting better with time in steps, so I don't believe medication/therapy are necessary for me (NOT knocking either in any way!)"
18495,"My SO has anxiety and ADHD, is on medication and has been dealing with it long before we met."
18496,I did try medication (the kind that takes a few weeks to kick in) and it seemed like it didn't help me.
18497,Even things that are frustrating to me yet hobbies are much more pleasurable while I'm on this medicine.
18498,"(btw, I am already seeing a doctor and talking about potentially getting on meds...but until then this anxiety is making me feel like I'm losing it and any advice or help or whatever you can offer is greatly appreciated.)"
18499,"I take medication and see a CBT on a floating schedule, usually once a month."
18500,"Once I can be sure that my new insurance policy will cover my current meds reasonably, I will also talk to my PC about possibly adjusting my dosage, or seeing if I might need to change meds altogether."
18501,"Hi guys,

this is my first post on this sub, but I'm having a really rough day and feel alone, and I just need a place where I feel like I can vent."
18502,some background on my mental health: I suffered from purging-type anorexia from the time I was 12 until I was 19.
18503,I am 22 now.
18504,I was undiagnosed until I was 18.
18505,I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 15.
18506,"My father is a reverend, and we moved around a lot when I was younger."
18507,I was bright and super ambitious and a perfectionist.
18508,"I went to therapy for about 3 years (16-19) and took many, many medications, and hated every single one."
18509,"The side effects varied with each one, but the main issue was that I didn't want to rid myself of emotions, so with my doctor I weaned myself off."
18510,"From the time I was 18 until I was 20 I used alcohol regularly (every weekend), and now I smoke marijuana regularly."
18511,"I chose this because instead of building up in my system and keeping me greyed-out 24/7, I can use it to relax for an hour or two, while spending the rest of my day with a small buzz or completely sober (Never smoke before work, serious engagements)."
18512,OKAY.
18513,SO.
18514,i'm getting married on saturday.
18515,"what should be the happiest time of my life is being overrun with panic at 

1. my wedding is small and cheap."
18516,i will be the laughing stock of the internet.
18517,"2. things still aren't finished, (my dress and his kilt) because it's a 100% diy wedding."
18518,3. i start my second semester of my nursing program 2 days after the wedding.
18519,"4. i started a new job at the hospital this summer and am working full time, 12 hour shifts."
18520,"last semester i did 4 8 hours a week, and went to school 4 days a week."
18521,"this semester it will be 3 12s an 3 days of school, with every other weekend off."
18522,i'm worried i can't handle this because 12s wear me out.
18523,"5. i'm worried about how much i'm worrying, which makes me worry more."
18524,"i don't want to be back on meds, i don't want my fiance to back out because i'm being a spaz (pretty much why every other partner has left me), i don't want to burden my family."
18525,"6. when i was drinking, due to a long complicated situation with my then best friend, i ended up on probation and had to take drug education classes."
18526,"these instilled a huge guilt in me of using weed, which has basically ruined that for me, and made it a source of stress as well as peace."
18527,"7. both of my bridesmaids that aren't my sister (my best friend and my fiances sister, who is like my big sister) moved to the west coast for legal weed this summer."
18528,my SIL lost her job (due to weed) which forced them to move their plans up by 6 months.
18529,they are living with his brother and don't have jobs.
18530,they can afford weed (and post about it online) but can't make it back.
18531,"my best friend left spur-of-the-moment to live with an acquiantance who offered them a room, as her lease was up and they didn't plan, and now they are both working at the zoo (she was a CNA with me- how we met."
18532,"and he was a shift manager) for minimum wage, and can also afford weed but not my wedding."
18533,"basically i'm scared, i'm lost, and i feel like a burden."
18534,"i'm very introverted so losing my best friend was hard, and i was scheduled to work the next three days."
18535,i was up all night crying and freaking out about how i wouldn't get any sleep and i wouldn't get anything done and i had to call into work today.
18536,which is only adding to my anxiety because last month i got a terrible viral infection and was off for two weeks.
18537,"it was excused and they were very nice, but i'm not sure what to tell them."
18538,"my mom suggested i just say that its stress from the wedding and ill be fine tomorrow, but i'm still panicking."
18539,"reading this back i sound like a spaz, but i just felt like this would be the best place to find other people who understand what this is like."
18540,thanks &lt;3
18541,"In September I was sick with a respiratory infection and took cold medicine to help myself out, and preceded to get terrified to the point of having my first-ever panic attack, because I was overthinking how I was feeling and was convinced I had something really wrong with my brain or something."
18542,"I later saw that anxiety was a side effect of the cold medicine I took, and didn't take it again."
18543,Im going to my GP this afternoon for help as im already on medication and am starting to hit rock bottom.
18544,"If it turns out I need medicine for my anxiety, then they will prescribe me a mild drug."
18545,I've never had any medication for it or anything like that.
18546,I am obviously on no medication as I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet.
18547,"I'm not interested in medication because it made me feel like a zombie last time I was taking it, and I can't afford it anyways."
18548,I have soul crippling social anxiety and I have done countless hours of researching treatment and medication and all about paxil and I am confident that I know more or less all the important stuff about it.
18549,I can get my hands on it without visiting a doctor and I don't really want to pay the doctor's fee on top of the medication costs.
18550,I know people's opinion of this medicine is varied but for me it has been a savior...except for one thing.
18551,Might be my most persistent anxiety.
18552,It is so draining.
18553,The body naturally being in a constant state of flux makes me constantly question EVERY itch or throb.
18554,Looking up symptoms is so addictive.
18555,Self diagnosing is so damn addictive.
18556,Seeking reassurance is so addictive.
18557,Buying medicines is so addictive.
18558,And avoiding getting tests is so addictive.
18559,"When you do get an actual condition, it validates your fears about other conditions."
18560,Who else here feels this way?
18561,Did meds work?
18562,But I'm scaring of becoming addicted to and abusing meds.
18563,"Several months ago, when visiting my physician regarding my anxiety and depression meds I was taking, she asked how much caffeine I consumed per day."
18564,Even medication like benzos seem to make things worse because they force you to relax.
18565,"When I was at my GP for my yearly a couple days ago, I'd mentioned to her that I wished I could get on some type of stabilizing medication because I find I get really anxious and frustrated occasionally."
18566,The doctors are more interested in prescribing me acne medicine instead of my ear.
18567,"I use the term 'medicine' very loosely, because apparently you can't do anything about an ear infection other than a couple of pain killers."
18568,"I was on meds from the time I was 13 until I was 17, I ended up being on 250mg of zoloft a day and knowing nothing about how to come off medication I just stopped taking it, then the downward spiral came and I some how developed agoraphobia."
18569,"The medicine is making me lose my concentration, I keep focusing on my nails or plucking hair."
18570,"I am a 29 year old male from SC...i met the love of my life nearly 4 yrs ago....
She has anxiety disorder and depression...for the first couple years i knew her...she handled it well...but in past year...our lives have become very stressful and her control and medication barely help anymore...it kills me to not be able to help her...and she worries that ill leave her because of it...i wont but i almost feel like maybe im causing her problems somehow...and i feel so helpless that i have briefly entertained the thought of giving us a break..but i worry what that may do to her seeing as ive promised id never leave hwr...i want to marry her...we have been unofficially engaged for about 9 months....what can i do...someone help me please"
18571,"Hello (: 
So the only medication I've ever taken was birth control, but I recently started (yesterday) taking Lexapro."
18572,"I feel like that since that is the highest dosage you can give it's a little unnecessary for GAD, especially with how quickly I respond to other medication and I'm very small..."
18573,If i don't feel better in 3 months I will start taking medication.
18574,I've refused any medication because I figured I could get through it on my own.
18575,My question- is it possible to take some medication for a brief period of time without being stuck on it forever and is there any success with going that route?
18576,I really don't want to have to take medicine and risk any adverse effects or withdrawal symptoms.
18577,Around six months in and after a slow steady ramping of medication I began motivating myself to work and things were looking slightly better.
18578,Has anyone else experienced extreme moodiness when they have stopped taking their meds?
18579,"I tried, and by then 15 minutes had passed, I had an Ativan in me (and an aspirin to thin my blood), so I went outside with him for a walk, thinking to let the meds work."
18580,"And no, medication is never an option for me."
18581,Currently on meds (paxil) but still have overwhelming symptoms that affect my daily life and the decisions I make.
18582,"I take my medication every day, and it's helped a lot."
18583,"Now that I have it under control, I find myself constantly wondering ""What happens when they decide that I should stop taking my medication?"
18584,I'm so scared that because I'm getting better that I'm going to get worse when I stop taking my medication.
18585,I know that I shouldn't take the medication if I don't need it.
18586,"I'm not sure if I am posting in the right place, but I thought it was worth a shot."
18587,I've been on 10mg Cipralex for about 2 months now.
18588,The first three weeks were really rough.
18589,"I would wake up in the middle of the night from panic attacks, I developed new physical symptoms (intense feeling of warmth in my chest, a teeth chattering tick), and a strong desire to NEVER leave my couch ever again."
18590,I felt sort of empty.
18591,Fast forward to week 4 on Cipralex and everything was amazing.
18592,"A good portion of my OCD habits reduced or disappeared, I was no longer rehearsing conversations before I had them."
18593,"I teared up once or twice, but this was mostly because I was so incredibly grateful for all that I had."
18594,"After discussing my future plans with my family doctor, we decided that although Cipralex was working incredibly well for me I should switch to Zoloft so that when I was ready to consider having children with my Husband, we would be safe to do so."
18595,Today is day 2 of 25mg Zoloft after weening myself off of Cipralex and I am pretty sure I am losing my mind.
18596,My anxiety is back full force.
18597,I almost had a full blown temper tantrum - stomping and all when my Husband asked me a question during the last few minutes of a show I was watching.
18598,I feel like a raging BRAT!
18599,"I keep crying at everything, hyperventilating, generally freaking out at random things."
18600,This morning it was because the bread wasn't defrosted.
18601,Seriously?
18602,":(

Basically I just need some reassurance that the Zoloft is going to kick in eventually."
18603,My doctor had me under the impression that the switch would be relatively seamless because I was already on an SSRI.
18604,If you have switched medications before - how long did it take before you felt like yourself again?
18605,Is it possible that Zoloft just hates my body and will never EVER work?
18606,"If you've made it this far, thank you for reading."
18607,I'm ready to stop feeling like crap now :(
18608,"I'm seeing a psychiatrist, trying different meds, and a therapist, but nothing is working so far."
18609,I get really bizarre but STRONG anxieties about things.
18610,"My wife is getting fed up with me, as did my last wife."
18611,As have all of my groups of friends over the years.
18612,As have people I worked with.
18613,On and on the list goes.
18614,"It kills me so much because people just roll their eyes, or even laugh."
18615,In my mind it's reality.
18616,I can't look at someone and tell them not to see that grass is green.
18617,I can't tell someone not to feel a burn on their hand when they touch a hot stove.
18618,Just like I can't see it any other way that these ideas and suspicions that creep into my head are laughably impossible.
18619,I worry about having about 20 different health conditions a year.
18620,Adding in about a new 5 as each year passes.
18621,"I come to terms that I don't have others, but something new always comes in to replace that one."
18622,"It just goes on and on, and though I thankfully haven't passed these tendencies into my children...they now see me in the same light as others."
18623,My son laughs and rolls his eyes at me.
18624,My wife tells me I worry about everything and gets pissed that I can't just be happy.
18625,She says I'm unreasonable and that I don't look at things logically.
18626,YET in my mind I'm using nothing but logic.
18627,In my mind it feels like she leaves everything up to chance.
18628,"I feel like stress is protecting me from forgetting important details, from being careless when I hand in paperwork that's important."
18629,I feel like stress makes me a good father because my kids don't go without anything.
18630,It makes me humble and a good worker.
18631,Yet I feel like it's destroying my life.
18632,"It has destroyed my life, more and more consuming everything as each year passes."
18633,I take the medications that are supposed to work.
18634,They are supposed to be the alternative.
18635,"They don't work, they don't help they just make me blank."
18636,"Sometimes shit still creeps in, and I still just have to talk to someone."
18637,"I have to vent I have to feel better, because if I say it, and I hear it, sometimes it sounds so stupid that I do laugh about it."
18638,"And my wife sits there and gets frustrated, and I go ""I'm sorry, I know this gets old."""
18639,"To which she replies...""::sigh:: it's fine."
18640,"I'm used to it."""
18641,"I'm starting work out of state away from them for a while, so that maybe giving them space from me will help things and they won't be so burnt out by me."
18642,"I'll only be home a couple of days a week, but it hurts."
18643,I'm going to miss so much of my children's life.
18644,and I'm going to be so alone.
18645,I just don't know how to deal with any of this anymore.
18646,"I'm not suicidal or anything, I just want to be happy and have my family happy to have me around."
18647,"Can't sleep...anxious about my appointment in the morning, I already took my sleep meds...so I'm drowsy but not enough to get me to sleep."
18648,"I've pretty much finally come to the conclusion (Long story, a lot of thought and just a few situations) that I need help in tackling my anxiety head on (Both meds/therapy probably)."
18649,I also want to share my story because there is a bit of an 'anti-SSRI' bias on Reddit which I know stopped me from taking medication when It shouldn't have.
18650,So here is my advice: if therapy isn't working or you have a family history of the illness (which I did) give medication a shot!
18651,"I decided enough was enough, I obviously don't have the mental capacity to stop binge eating on my own, it's time to get some medication."
18652,"All the can do is give me medicine, but the even the thought of that gives me such bad anxiety."
18653,"I know you guys might suggest I take medicine, but here is another problem."
18654,I have really bad anxiety about taking medicine.
18655,If I took medicine just the thought of doing it would give me anxiety really bad.
18656,"They gave me medicine, but that also gave me anxiety just thinking about it."
18657,I have tried taking medicine a few different times and I just can't do it because of my anxiety about taking it.
18658,I know ADD medicine raises blood pressure so that is a no go.
18659,Not that I would anyways because it would give me anxiety taking medicine.
18660,I just need something I can do (besides meds) that will help when I start worrying...
18661,Does it actually 'repair' anything or is it just a stop gap and once I get off the medicine my GAD and depression will come back?
18662,"I have an appt with doc tomorrow to discuss options, medication being one of them."
18663,I was so happy to be off regular medication.
18664,I have the decision of turning a few hours back and going home or continuing on and trying to manage my anxiety (no meds) and I can't figure it out.
18665,What if the medicine never works completely and this is his life?
18666,I need help but can't go on traditional meds like Paxil.
18667,Generally that medicine helps get me down to a starting level of zero which lets me breathe and see things more calmly.
18668,I've gained 60 pounds since then and am much healthier psychologically since I've gotten on meds.
18669,I've been feeling really crappy since January.
18670,"Here's the context: I took 75mg of Effexor for about 6 months last year (March-early  September), and it worked WONDERS."
18671,"Then, at the beginning of the school year, I started getting more stressed and interpreted that as my anxiety getting worse, so my former doc an I doubled the dose to 150mg, which I took from September to early December."
18672,"Upping the dose didn't help, and actually made me feel calm but less emotional all together (which I didn't like) and made me zone out from time to time, so the doctor switched me to Cymbalta."
18673,"I took Cymbalta for about a week and half-two weeks, and when it finally started working and stopped just making me really sleepy it gave me a TERRIBLE migraine (the first and only one I've ever had, and it lasted for 2 days)."
18674,"I emailed and called my doctor, and stopped taking it (she's my *former* doctor because she didn't respond to me in any way for 4 days)."
18675,After the period of withdrawal (which was weird and sucked) I started experiencing the worst anxiety I've ever had.
18676,"I started having to duck into bathrooms at work and at school almost every day just to cry because my mind would get so off-track and spiral out of control, and I had to run out of a computer lab while working on an final essay in April because I experienced the closest thing to a panic attack I've ever experienced (I think they're called limited symptom attacks, which what experiencing less than four symptoms of a panic attack is categorized as)."
18677,"I tried Zoloft for a few days at one point and although I know the first few weeks on new meds are really difficult and can make you feel worse, I gave up and decided that I wanted to try and deal with my anxiety without meds."
18678,Sometimes I REALLY regret this decision.
18679,"I started seeing a new therapist in March and she's been REALLY helpful, but it's still so hard to just keep my head up and calm down some days."
18680,I haven't been able to see my therapist in two weeks and I've been feeling really shitty for the last few days.
18681,"Sometimes I look back on how I felt during the summer of last year and notice how much worse I feel now, and think a lot about trying to go back on the smaller dose of the Effexor."
18682,"Sometimes I just feel so insecure in every part of my life and it drives me up a wall, because I know a lot of my downward-spiraling thoughts are just caused by my anxiety."
18683,"I'm as on-top of my shit as I can possibly be right now (job that pays the rent, one year of college left, really good internship, loving boyfriend, and the weather is nice) and yet I constantly question myself and beat myself up because sometimes I feel like a fucking turd that doesn't do anything right."
18684,The biggest problem I have is that I constantly worry about and fear how my future is going to go after I get my degree.
18685,I'm terrified of being in tons of debt and I'm terrified that I'm going to get stuck in a job that I might realize I don't like so much.
18686,"When I was taking the meds, I wasn't so freaked out about this, and I would be able to remind myself that nobody knows how the future is going to go and that you just have to roll with the punches, and it made me feel fine."
18687,"Now I still do the same thing, but it feels impossible to not worry about it sometimes."
18688,"I'm seeing my therapist again on Friday and I honestly can't wait, because I started slowly getting better until I wasn't able to see her for two weeks."
18689,"That's all I have to say, I guess."
18690,Opinions of what to do about medications (or what not to do) are totally welcome.
18691,Thank you for listening.
18692,":')

Edit: So now it's the next day and today has already been a lot better."
18693,"Sometimes we have extra bad days or even a bad hour or two during a decent day, and those hours are hard but we can push through!"
18694,Sending positive vibes to all of you out there!
18695,"Anyway, after college I stopped going to therapy, got off meds, etc."
18696,I'm currently not on any meds but I take St. Johns wort and I find it helps somewhat.
18697,I really don't want to take medication.
18698,"However, as I ""weened"" off the medication, I felt funny."
18699,"If I'm over 140, the Army requires hypertension meds which may disqualify me from certain jobs."
18700,I do some more research and find that many of the principles that modern psychiatry is based on are simply a giant scam to sell medication.
18701,I already had to switch away from one doctor in the practice because she forgot what meds I was on.
18702,"I haven't been on meds for a while (can't really afford them), but my anxiety and depression have been getting so bad recently that I decided to make an appointment to start meds again."
18703,I never realized until this happened how twisted my stomach feels and how cloudy my head gets when I'm not on the medication.
18704,The only time I ever talk about these feelings is when I take that medication.
18705,"I can't focus in school or even on driving most of the time, and can't even talk to my parents about it without the medication."
18706,Who can I tell that I've taken my girlfriend's medicine without getting in trouble?
18707,I was expecting to feel worse physically which is fine but I don't know whether my mental symptoms are a result of the meds or just my anxiety over the possibility of developing psychosis on them.
18708,I don't know if I'm just being hypervigilant because of the meds or what.
18709,I just went to the doctor today and they told me I have an upper respiratory infection and that i am required to take two days off of work but that they will not give me any medicine unless I get worse.
18710,"I'm really thinking about trying to get on some medication specific for social anxiety (I'm already taking Citalopram against my depression, but apart from that, it doesn't do much) if such a thing exists, to facilitate my exposing myself to these situations, hopefully learning there actually is nothing to be afraid of."
18711,Any experience with medication?
18712,id like to have half a day of being a normal person before i get racing thoghhts before night time and need to take my stronger meds
18713,I did have meds though (oxazepam?).
18714,"I'm not on medication, I'm not in therapy, I'm not ready to accept that kind of help."
18715,You may have been diagnosed with it and take medication around it and are now afraid to quit taking the medication.
18716,"I have seen a doctor who has checked me for pregnancy, taken blood samples (to test for gastritis) and given me meds to help reduce the acidity of my stomach (which haven't helped at all), I also started taking some ginger vitamins the pharmacist recommended to me but unfortunately they didn't help either."
18717,"I hope this isn't too lengthy, but there is a little backstory about my medication history that I need to say."
18718,"I apologize in advance; I'm having a mild panic attack right now, so I might ramble a bit."
18719,I just got prescribed Seroquel and Luvox today by my doctor.
18720,Supposedly this is to help with my anxiety and OCD and increase my appetite which has been garbage these last 5 months since my digestion has been so out of whack and I've lost about 14 lbs.
18721,Now I'm on 25 mg Seroquel and 25 mg Luvox.
18722,I haven't started taking them yet but at the very least I'm hoping it could help with weight gain.
18723,I've also been taking Remeron.
18724,I've been on Remeron for the past 4 years and now she wants to start taking me off it.
18725,The Remeron was originally for my anxiety and depression and at the beginning it really did help increase my appetite but didn't really affect my depression or anxiety.
18726,"My doctor upped the dosage and while that helped with the depression and anxiety, it seems like my appetite went back to absolute crap."
18727,I was on 45 mg of Remeron and I just got bumped down to 15 mg so my doctor can taper me off.
18728,The nervousness came from when I searched for Seroquel and Luvox (my new meds) on reddit and read nothing but horror stories.
18729,"Needless to say, it's got me even more anxious."
18730,Has anyone here had any experiences with these meds?
18731,I can't help but worry that all my anxiety problems are a result of all these medications I've taken.
18732,"I've always had very mild depression and anxiety problems as a teenager and young adult, but it seems like since I've been on medication it's gotten severe."
18733,I'm just absolutely terrified that this could screw up my appetite even more and just make my anxiety worse.
18734,I was prescribed this because when I take ADHD medication my anxiety gets out of control.
18735,After months of convincing my parents I do in fact have social anxiety and one (or two) panic attacks I am finally getting some meds to deal with it.
18736,"I am finally starting to notice (slight) improvements in my symptoms, however I seem to be unable to shake the insomnia that my meds are causing me."
18737,My psych prescribed me meds for schizophrenia anyways....' and you get the idea.
18738,I currently do not take any medication and I never have.
18739,But the thought of the rest of my life depending on medication is so terrifying it makes me sick to my stomach.
18740,Are there any odds of using some anxiety medication to fix my issues?
18741,"TL;DR Can anxiety meds be used as a coping method short term, and in turn make the long term easier even if i come off of them?"
18742,"I have had anxiety for years now (I'm 22 but was diagnosed with anxiety and depressive disorder in middle school)

I have been relatively attack free for the last couple of years (thanks to the right medications, meditation, and lifestyle changes)

One of the things I found that gave me a good benefit was a supplement called **L-Theanine**."
18743,Theanine is a supplement which crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been shown to lower anxiety levels.
18744,It puts the brain in a relaxed state and can help take the edge off if you are ever in a bad place.
18745,"It's extremely safe, you can take it without worrying about hurting yourself (for those of you who have anxiety about taking medications and so on)

It's sold in 100mg tablets but they also sell it in 200mgs for those who think they need the extra boost."
18746,"**IMPORTANT POINT**

&gt; This is not going to cure you."
18747,"The only way you will truly see a real benefit in your condition is the right medications, the right therapist, and the right lifestyle changes."
18748,"&gt; 
&gt; This is just something you can add to your current treatment for added beenfit."
18749,Does it ever happen that meds backfire?
18750,Also the doc upped my meds to 30mg and I start then tomorrow.
18751,I've gone to therapy monthly for the last four years and I've taken several different meds in very regimented ways while working closely with my family doctor.
18752,Hello all.
18753,I have been spending the last 7 months seeing a GP about anxiety and depression issues.
18754,"I've been diagnosed with GAD, SAD, and depression."
18755,I've already gone through 4 medications and I have started a 5th a couple of weeks ago.
18756,"My GP has me start off on a starting dosage for each for 4 weeks and if there are no effects, up to a higher dosage for another 4 weeks, then change medication if that doesn't do anything."
18757,The thing is I am not feeling anything from any medication prescribed so far.
18758,"I read about people getting nauseous or dizzy, tired or having trouble sleeping."
18759,I am feeling nothing.
18760,Even from stopping medicene and going from one to another has no effect on me.
18761,"I don't know if it is an actual lack of effect that the medication has on me, or my GP is prescribing placebos."
18762,If anything it is making me more anxious.
18763,I live too far from a town to be able to make therapy group visits and I don't even think I could handle it in my current mental state anyway.
18764,I have one more insurance covered visit until my next one resets in June.
18765,My parents' insurance company allocates 6 covered visits per year per person which rolls over once the day the first visit comes around.
18766,"I am only paying 20.00 now, but once the insurance stops, I will pay 125.00."
18767,My insurance does not cover specialist visits so I can not afford to visit a real psychiatrist right now.
18768,I am out of work because I get minor panic attacks when I have to work with more than a few people face to face.
18769,I have quit three jobs now due to panic attacks.
18770,I take college classes online to be able to at least further my education for in the future.
18771,I think my attacks are caused by over-analyzing every thing I say and others say.
18772,I simulate conversations before they even happen and eventually I just break.
18773,I think my triggers are mainly environmental.
18774,I live my parents in a rural area of a Western US state where every thing is about an hour away.
18775,"I am a very skilled person with computers, but there are no opportunities here for me."
18776,"I want to get out, but my mental state is making it near impossible."
18777,I am really not sure on what I should do now.
18778,I want to be able to do stuff without feeling the way I do.
18779,I want to move out and get my own place where my skills can shine.
18780,I want to be social.
18781,"Various phobias have come and gone, but later in highschool (junior year or so) I developed a fear of travel, medication (due to my sisters previous bad experiences with anxiety meds), and food (due to discussing medication over dinner every night)."
18782,"In reality I probably have a significant chemical imbalance and should probably be on some long term medication (there is a family history for it on my moms side, literally every single aunt and uncle have had to be treated to some degree and my mother struggles with it sometimes too.)"
18783,"Because I take medication for it, this is manageable, but it helps a lot if it's not a problem in the first place."
18784,I just found this sub.
18785,I'm 23yrs old.
18786,And I been going through this hell that is anxiety since I was young it only manifested its self about 5yrs ago and that anxiety attack put me in the ER and I'm talking bout ambulance trip and 11yrs having tests done and having a IV drip of anti anxiety medications.
18787,And I don't even know what my triggers are.
18788,I have debilitating anxiety attacks and honestly I can't describe the feeling other then it's the scariest experience in my life.
18789,Currently I'm waiting to see my doctor to be put on anti-anxiety meds again and going back to my shrink.
18790,I'm hoping for the best at this point.
18791,Honestly anyone who is going through anything like this.
18792,Reach out please get help don't wait it only gets worse the longer u wait.
18793,If you need anyone to talk to feel to talk to me I will happily take time out to help anyone through anxiety attacks or whatever ur going through thanks for listening.
18794,I know everyone has mixed results with medication...
18795,"I've never had any medication like this before, and the anxiety isn't helping me trust it any..

Any tips would be great..

Edit: Jittery!"
18796,"I take medication for it, 40mg of propranolol twice a day and I have my first therapy session on Monday with a CBT."
18797,Well I started this journey to get over my anxiety back in January without medicines (I came off of Celexa officially in April) and therapy.
18798,And it worked!
18799,I had a month or so where I was great!
18800,I still had minor anxiety but it was easily controlled.
18801,I learned to let go.
18802,Now it seems to be back and to have changed forms on me.
18803,I'm finding myself getting panic attacks frequently and coming to avoid situations that I fear will give me a panic attack.
18804,This is completely new to me.
18805,Also seeming to surface is an intense fear I have of throwing up (I've had this for a long time but it comes and goes in intensity).
18806,"This is the primary thing that makes these panic attacks so scary for me - I know that my heart won't explode, I won't pass out, etc."
18807,but I *do* know it is possibly to throw up from a panic attack.
18808,To anyone who has successfully been treated for anxiety - is this normal?
18809,"Is this ""relapse""/""mutation"" of anxiety I'm having normal?"
18810,"Originally I would have obsessive thoughts that I feared of ""letting go""."
18811,I learned to let go and things were great!
18812,Now it seems to be the physical manifestation of that idea of letting go that I struggle with.
18813,Is all hope for me lost?
18814,Also also I am going  back to therapy to confront this phobia once and for all (something I have never done before).
18815,"My fear of that is that in order to be ""cured"" I will have to throw up."
18816,Words cannot describe how much this freaks me out.
18817,Is this the case?
18818,I'm not currently on any medication because I'm afraid of the potential side effects.
18819,"As the title states, I'm interested in going to graduate school, although I do have a few hurdles to cross."
18820,"I should mention I have severe social anxiety (From years of childhood bullying), as well as some amount of ADHD."
18821,"The doctors aren't sure if the Anxiety drives the ADHD, or the other way around."
18822,They could be separate and independent issues.
18823,"I want to see if it's worth it to take the GRE, and try to go back to school and get a graduate degree."
18824,"But before I ask for answers, I should provide a bit of background (Apologies on the length of this post!"
18825,"):

I live in the United States, and the schools I'm talking about are all within the United States."
18826,"I majored in pre-engineering at the community college, Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University."
18827,I did change majors to Computer Science.
18828,"When I went to a community college, and during my first semester of classes at a University, I was taking medication to control my anxiety."
18829,"it was working very well, I got great grades, and was being told that I'd likely be able to start taking graduate classes early."
18830,"After my first semester, my doctor at the University decided to take me off the medication."
18831,"She never did like it, and had been trying to get me off it, despite having gotten good results."
18832,"I was using pot, and now I understand that it was CBD-rich."
18833,"At the time, that was something I didn't know."
18834,I do now..
18835,Although I wish I had known that back then.
18836,Anyway...
18837,I was taken off that medication.
18838,"My anxiety came back, and my grades started to drop."
18839,"My doctor couldn't understand it, she had expected my grades to go even higher."
18840,"She kept prescribing all kinds of medications, and I couldn't take most of them due to side effects."
18841,I lost my chance to go to graduate school while the doctors argued over how to handle my anxiety.
18842,"Ironically, I couldn't get services unless I was in classes, and I would have preferred to put classes on hold while I figured out what to do for medication."
18843,"The ""no try this, try that, try these other multi-colored pills"" approach wasn't really working right."
18844,"So I go, ""Why don't we go back to what worked?"""
18845,I had a proven academic history.
18846,I had strong recommendation letters for my admission to the University.
18847,"All I got was ""No, no, no, no, that should not be working at all."
18848,"Impossible, impossible, impossible."""
18849,So I ended up plowing through my classes and finishing my degree with a lower than desirable GPA.
18850,"I had a 3.27+ GPA with the medication (still had the ADHD issues, but those were workable)."
18851,"After the medication was taken away, and during the whole turmoil, my GPA went down to a 2.75."
18852,"I do great on homework assignments, and lab work."
18853,I am able to explain my work on a one on one basis with my professors/TAs.
18854,"I just can't do well on exams, especially if they're taken in classrooms filled with many students."
18855,"An example:  I had one class, we did a practice exam in the lab sessions."
18856,"I demoed most of the solutions for that exam, and got great praise from the TA."
18857,We were told that the practice exam was *harder* than the actual exam.
18858,"I went to the exam, along with about 120+ students, all crammed in a small room like sardines."
18859,"I promptly had a panic attack, and proceeded to bomb the exam."
18860,"Since I completed my degree requirements, I've dumped that doctor."
18861,"Well, actually, since I left the University, I can no longer see her, as she's working with the University now, and cannot see people unless they're students."
18862,This is the same doctor I saw while I was at the community college.
18863,"She was working for another agency, then decided to get a job at the University I was going to."
18864,So now you have some background information..
18865,"Given the fact that while I was on medication, my professors and advisors at the community college and University all told me that I had what it took to do graduate level work, do you think it might be worth it for me to take a GRE to show the graduate school that I'm capable of doing graduate level work?"
18866,Would the damage to my academic record due to the removal of medication be too much to overcome?
18867,"A friend of mine says she thinks that the medical explanation might be enough to overcome that, but I'm worried about how I'm going to prove to the graduate school that I'm capable of doing graduate level work."
18868,"Sorry, that was a lot to cover."
18869,"I remember seeing the eager, enthusiastic looks on the faces of my professors/advisors giving way to disappointment, bitterness, and anger as my grades kept sliding."
18870,"It felt like my academic career started to burn down, as my doctors played."
18871,"I tried to fight back, but the anxiety was too strong."
18872,I feel a little like they failed me.
18873,"I'm back on the medication that was working before, although I am more easily able to pick out the CBD-rich forms of the medication now due to it being legal in Colorado now."
18874,Is it too late for me?
18875,"Should I just focus on rebuilding my career, and forget about graduate school?"
18876,Should I take this question to another subreddit?
18877,"I know there's one for graduate school advice, but I thought I'd try to get advice regarding the anxiety first, before I try going to that subreddit."
18878,"I fear that using CBD-rich pot as a form of medicine will get thrashed there, although there is more and more proof that CBD-rich pot is effective in treating anxiety."
18879,"Once again, sorry that this got a little long."
18880,I wanted to give as much detail as I could to get the best advice.
18881,EDIT: Thanks for all of your feedback!
18882,It's given me some things to think about.
18883,:)
18884,"Luckily, I JUST started medication yesterday (because I always have terrible anxiety, it's just way worse when I actually have something to worry about) so I really hope that it kicks in in a couple of weeks and gets me more under control before the event."
18885,I was put on this medication for anxiety.
18886,I finally went to a doctor last week and started medication.
18887,"If that wasn't the medication I was experiencing, I have no idea what to expect for the coming weeks."
18888,The doctor has suggested on therapy to compliment the medication.
18889,"I've been taking ADHD meds on and off ever since I was a kid, I was on Concerta for a long time but recently switched to Adderall."
18890,"I don't usually have trouble sleeping, and I'm usually a little anxious on my medication but nothing like this before."
18891,My anxiety lately has gotten really bad and I finally took the step towards using medication.
18892,I'm so scared that the initial first couple weeks of medication are going to be make things worse (the potential side effects) combined with dealing with this breakup is going to be completely overwhelming.
18893,What the fuck mom.
18894,YOU are the one who started me on therapy and medication.
18895,You take it!
18896,You depend on it!
18897,"When I came out and cried for help, YOU SAID YOU WOULD BE THERE."
18898,YOU WOULD GET ME HELP.
18899,"Now that my younger sister is crying for help, she refuses."
18900,She denies help.
18901,"She blames my sister, says she's just looking for attention."
18902,I'm just so lost.
18903,Every time I think I can trust my mom she gives me reasons to break that trust.
18904,I'm dependent on my medication right now.
18905,"My therapist is an amazing woman, and has helped me so much."
18906,"Whenever I start to stress,  I just think about what she would say,  and I can help myself temporarily."
18907,My sister needs that.
18908,My mom complains she can't take off work and pay for my sisters doctors.
18909,"I offered to take off work, and pay all copays and medications if she needs it."
18910,"Then she screamed ""THATS NOT THE POINT, TIRED0WL!!"""
18911,THEN WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT.
18912,And if I am sick how long can I live without medication?
18913,"I tried going to a specalist doc and all he does is prescribe me meds that my parents are against me taking, but I still secretly take anyway."
18914,I go through Target for my meds since the generics are cheaper than going to my hospital's pharmacy.
18915,"My doctor isn't there on weekends, so I won't get it for two more days now...thats 10 days without the meds... How long before its completely out and I have to essentially start from scratch?"
18916,Anybody on medication that can help those short periods of anxiety?
18917,I think I'm going to ask for the 1 mg version of clonazepam but if anybody else has good experience with other medication I'd like to bring it up with my doctor.
18918,I realize now that I was actually having an anxiety attack over taking the anti-anxiety medication.
18919,First i have to apologise for keeping to speak on this forum.
18920,I feel that I need to reach out even though I speak to a family most of the time.
18921,As my previous posts have said I've started a secondment to another team due to the lack of challenge in the old team.
18922,the problem is huge anxiety attacks.
18923,I'm frightened I will never be able to cope and this horrible feeling will never go away.
18924,In addition I have a three day course in a different town and I am worried that I won't be able to eat and find it very difficult to go to the course.
18925,"I'm a complete mess constantly, tired and I don't want toeeat."
18926,The only comfort is that people at work are very supportive.
18927,I left yesterday to go to the doctors and am not going in today.
18928,I have booked into Councilling so I hope that will help.
18929,I am currently on citraoplam and was wondering if there other medications which are more suited to anxiety?
18930,Thank you for taking the time to read.
18931,"I've had plenty of therapy and medicine for depression in my past so I understand pretty well how to talk myself down from over-thinking, usually."
18932,"I have been to my doctor and have been prescribed anti-anxiety medication - I don't feel 100%, but that's another story."
18933,"I'm on a new medication, and I have two comorbid disorders of Panic Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder."
18934,"I've been relying on the medication to alleviate all this, but anything I can do while it's not fully in my system yet?"
18935,"Long story short, I'm afraid to take the medication."
18936,"Is this normal for anxiety medication, and is the possible benefit worth it?"
18937,I told her from the beginning I was against medication.
18938,How is she to function without medication?
18939,"I'm on medication, but this anxiety seems to be worse than anything I've experienced previously."
18940,"If I knew the dangers involved and the start of the medication carousel, I never would gave touched that first bottle of Ativan."
18941,before medication becomes a crutch.
18942,I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and will be receiving medication on Monday morning because I had a panic attack last week during my first round of exams in front of my professor because I did not finish her exam on time.
18943,I'm no longer on meds.
18944,I also visit a therapist regularly and asked if there was a way I'd be able to get onto an anxiety medication since I'm completely sure that I have an issue with it and she doesn't seem to think it's necessary.
18945,I just got on some medication after an ER visit because of an anxiety attack that lasted 14 hours and I couldnt stop throwing up.
18946,"Also, I want to know if the severity of these disorders effects your chances of getting better medically... obviously it would be Fer to do therapy with really high anxiety and unable to think striaght but can medicine get even the very severely anxious (mentally) to a manage able state to work out their issues."
18947,I was seeing a therapist a few months ago and she suggested I have low grade anxiety/depression that flares up during different periods of my life and that I should try medication along with yoga and exercise.
18948,"I'm just not sure of whether I should see my doctor about going on anxiety medication, or just find better ways to reduce my stress!"
18949,"I couldn't help but beat myself up with these questions: Why did he shove all those drugs down my throat without recommending any therapy, why was I given controlled substances while being addicted to meth, and why when I get sober and re-diagnosed with depression/anxiety he is no longer willing to give me the medication specifically designed for those issues."
18950,"They say I need some meds 

but an ear was all I needed."
18951,"But with time and effort I have made some big strides, I have adjusted to my medication which has pretty much cured my anxiety and through determination I have made new friends and most importantly gotten my first girlfriend now at 28, something I pretty much had altogether given up on."
18952,"He's been diagnosed ADHD, on meds."
18953,"I know I have to see a therapist and be put on medication, but I really wanted to post this just so I have some people who understand things my friends just don't comprehend."
18954,"Sure enough, on a weak day (a day I forgot to take my medicine), I felt myself getting attached and falling in ""love""."
18955,"The medication really helped for that and I don't have them nearly as often, I can even go weeks without having any."
18956,"But tonight, at the grocery store, I had my first in-public panic attack since taking medication and it really affects me."
18957,I have suffered from panic disorder with agoraphobia for many years.
18958,"I always believed that I could force myself to go out, get a job, go grocery shopping, do whatever I need to in order to survive on my own."
18959,Last summer I tried several times to leave the house and was never successful.
18960,I have come to realize that I am not able to take care of myself in any way.
18961,"I have seen therapists, psychiatrists, and tried several medications."
18962,Nothing has worked.
18963,I can’t afford to see anyone anymore because of cuts to my insurance.
18964,I just don’t know what to do anymore.
18965,"The idea of not being able to take care of myself, even going to the store, is raising my anxiety higher than it’s ever been."
18966,I would really like some advice on how to take care of myself and cope with everyday life.
18967,"Im finally on meds and going to counseling and i know im ready for college, i know i can pass all my classes and do great but i cant pay for it now."
18968,Should I worry about offending him by locking up my meds?
18969,This is why I am fairly optomistic I won't become addicted to this drug which seems to be the biggest drawback of this particlar medication it seems.
18970,I haven't seen a lot of posts concerning medication (or self-medication) when it comes to treating anxiety.
18971,I used to be legitimately addicted to synthetic cannabinoids.
18972,It's been a year since I've partook and since then my anxiety developed.
18973,"I know the two are not connected for three reasons: my triggers have to do with my father's death 2 years ago, my father had severe anxiety (mine is mild to moderate) and my doctor said it wouldn't be the reason."
18974,My medications seem to be working very well.
18975,"I'm not checking my pulse, I'm not concerned when I get dizzy, I'm not experiencing hypochondria."
18976,I want to smoke trees.
18977,"I feel like tonight would be a good night, but I'm a little worried my anxiety will kick in."
18978,"If I *do* end up smoking, I don't plan on getting blazed, just a little buzzed."
18979,I just need some feedback as to whether I should or not.
18980,"For the record, I'm on .5mg klonopin and 20mg celexa."
18981,"I saw a psychiatrist because the panic attacks haven't gone away yet, and she suggested Clonazepam I think it was, but after what had happened to me on Effexor and seeing the odd horror story about Clonazepam, I've realized I'm quite scared to even go near another medication."
18982,Anywhere I  look at JUST doing something like a screening is $200... and then 150 per consultation not including meds.
18983,I really think I need medication to help me cope while this hell semester goes away.
18984,"The therapist helped but wanted to prescribe me meds, and I gave it a shot, but the feeling of the meds affecting my brain made my panic attacks even worse because I felt like I wasn't in control of my own head, the chemicals were."
18985,"First things first, i'm terribly sorry if this is un-readable, english is not my first language and i had 3-4 drinks to calm down."
18986,I've been dealing with anxiety for a couple years now.
18987,I've always been on the fence about medications and been able to deal with it on my own for a while.
18988,"But everytime i think i ""mastered"" a way to deal with my anxiety, it comes back with a vengeance."
18989,"At first, my worries we're always related to health issues; Heart Racing, Chest pains, Having a ""ball in my throat"", etc."
18990,"I've been able to deal with those for quite a while, but now my anxiety is more ""mental""."
18991,"I suffered from derealization for a while, feeling like i'm on the verge of going insane, having terrible nightmares, constant worrying, having trouble focusing, feeling dizzy, being constantly tired, etc..

All the progress i've made just disappeared and i've sank deeper than where is already was."
18992,"At home or with friends, i can manage."
18993,But it really affected my performance at work.
18994,"I can't focus, i dread my job."
18995,"I work in an office specializing in web development, i feel lucky to have scored this job, i never studied in this field, started from a lower position as a Q.A and landed a better position in the company."
18996,"It is not a dead-end job, i could make a career out of it, the people are nice and everything but i still hate it."
18997,Lately my performance went downhill because of my anxiety.
18998,I'm being given more and more responsabilities and i just feel like it's crushing any energy that i already don't really have.
18999,Today i had at meeting with my boss and the human ressources regarding my situation.
19000,"They don't want to fire me, they're giving me more chances (i worked there for two years, i haven't always been a bad employee) I told them i was having a hard time, and that it could be related to health issues but i haven't specified it was Anxiety and Depression."
19001,I told them i was doing my best but that i didn't know how soon i could go back to being the good employee i was.
19002,They told me i should set an another appointment with them when i had a more concrete answer on what i wanted to do.
19003,"My dilemma is ; 

I could try to negotiate being on unemployment and work on myself for a while, without adding the worry of not being able to pay the bills."
19004,Or i should suck it up and do the best that i can.
19005,"I wouldn't really mind losing the job except for the money, it could give me the opportunity to find a job that i'd really like and the time and energy to work out, meditate, focus on myself and just being more healthy overall but i also feel that quitting would be admitting a certain defeat, and it would just get my situation worse."
19006,"I respect the people over there and feel like a burden in my team, but i just feel like i can't take it anymore, and i don't really see it getting better."
19007,"I'm wondering what you guys think, 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading."
19008,"I sought out medication, therapy and practiced heaps of self help exercises."
19009,I have a strong feeling it's yet another medication with little to no effect though.
19010,Recently I almost died due to a food allergy.. only to find out that not only has my allergy worsened but I cannot afford the only medication I need in order to survive another allergic reaction.
19011,"Seroquel 400mg, Prozac 20mg, Klonopin 3mg/day

I have been one many meds, and Klonopin has been the only constant."
19012,"Well, he's prescribed me meds (Cipralex), has me seeing a therapist this evening, and wants to be sure to see me again in three weeks!"
19013,"Now, I know that these meds are NOT an overnight fix and that they'll take time."
19014,I've been on anxiety meds for six years now and as with all of you I'm sure there have been some very high highs and very low lows.
19015,"Currently on meds for depression and anxiety and up until recently, they've been pretty fabulous."
19016,"Part of it is due to the fact that I had to move to a new state 4 hours from where I've lived my whole life, and I'm running out of my medication (40mg Prozac, .5mg Klonopin) as I desperately try to find a new doctor."
19017,"I don't drink ""too much"" often but when I do go slightly over my limit (which isn't much, thanks to my size and meds) I notice that the next day I don't get a typical hangover."
19018,Does anyone else experience this as a result of drinking while on medicine?
19019,Currently I am seeing my family dr and am on some meds that seem to help a little bit.
19020,"Hi everyone,

I was thinking about getting a prescription for anxiety medication, however, I've heard that depression can result from taking it."
19021,I can barely afford medicine and I haven't been to a psychologist in a while.
19022,I'm not on any medication or anything.
19023,I feel weird asking this.
19024,"I grew up being taught marijuana is a drug, it will ruin your life, etc."
19025,But I have to know.
19026,I am a 19 year old female residing in Missouri.
19027,I have been diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety for a few years now (genetically passed down).
19028,"Once diagnosed I went from one anti-depressant and anti- anxiety medication to another, to another, etc, with each time one didn't work the dosage has been doubled each time."
19029,These have all astronomically helped my depression but none have helped my anxiety.
19030,My anxiety has steadily gotten worse and I have numerous anxiety attacks a day.
19031,"I don't have any situational triggers, I'm not stressed.."
19032,"I have a great family, an amazing fiancé, friends, and I don't have troubles in school."
19033,"So now that you know a bit about me and my situation, I want to know your opinion about medicinal marijuana."
19034,will it help my anxiety?
19035,I've never used before.
19036,I'm tired of being scared my medications will effect me later in life and I will become dependent like my mother.
19037,And how do I bring this up to my doctor?
19038,He knows none of the medications work for my anxiety.
19039,"TL;DR: I have bad anxiety, and my meds have all sucked."
19040,Should I consider medicinal marijuana?
19041,Medicinal marijuana is NOT legal in Missouri.
19042,"Unless you're dying, however we have considered moving to a state which it is legal in."
19043,EDIT: [X-Post from /r/askreddit:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hrytn/anxiety_and_medicinal_marijuana_i_need_some_advice/)
19044,My dentist offered to give me anxiety meds before the appointment.
19045,"One place I contacted called back and said they only do anxiety meds, despite advertising it on their site."
19046,"Hello im 23 male here huge hypochondriac and also have bad social anxiety

I started on meds before christmas 50mg setralin and then shortly 100mg now im starting to take 150mg since i was still getting panic attacks and bad body symptoms like needles and tingling tunnel vision stiff neck all that scary stuff that scares the shit out of me and ofc i think i have ALS."
19047,I also tried various meds for over a year and they did exactly nothing.
19048,"I was going to therapy up until about a year and a half ago, and there was a short period of time (about a few weeks) when I was on medication."
19049,But these days I'm very desperate and I really want to go back on meds again.
19050,I feel that medication would really help.
19051,"I get the feeling that if you're low-income, you're pretty much screwed in terms of meds."
19052,To be honest I'm not looking for anymore self-help tips or anything like that; at this point I'm just concerned and interested in medication.
19053,"I don't want to take medicine or see someone, but my fiancee(M22) says I should see someone for it."
19054,Is there anyone out there who takes medication for there anxiety's?
19055,Is that normal for someone on those meds?
19056,"I have high blood pressure (under control with meds), am overweight (but with diet and exercise I've lost over 20 lbs."
19057,"I've tried medicine, but it made my symptoms worse."
19058,"Not on any prescribed medication, although I've tried some otc stuff for general anxiety which hasn't worked, including aniracetam and magnesium."
19059,"Finally, I sought the help of a psychologist--she told me I'm amicable and easy to talk to, and she thought I could beat my problems without medication."
19060,I beat agoraphobia and depression about a year ago.
19061,21 (f).
19062,"I did it au natural, no medications and therapy over twice a week for about a year."
19063,"Trust me, they wanted to put me on a bunch of crap."
19064,"But being the stubborn girl I am, I refused to become a zombie."
19065,I first became agoraphobic because of my family.
19066,I've been emotionally abused and mistreated my whole life.
19067,My biological is an asshole I was forced to spend time with.
19068,My step-father hated me for all of my teenage years.
19069,My mother never stood up for me.
19070,In the end year of high school I lost all of my friends (for a fault not my own) and ended up losing the one outlet I had.
19071,That was followed up by a physically abusive romantic relationship and my father disowning me that eventually landed me in the therapists office.
19072,"I stopped going to school, stopped leaving my room."
19073,"I would cry all day, wanting more than anything to be able to go outside... but I couldn't even go out into my backyard."
19074,Places like the mall were an impossibility.
19075,I had to cover myself in thick coats and hats (in the summer) to even feel comfortable about going to the therapists office three minutes away.
19076,"I was so ashamed of myself, the way I looked and how I felt that I hated myself and wanted to end my life."
19077,But I fought like hell and beat it.
19078,I went back to school.
19079,Got a job.
19080,Even started a new relationship that's been good for nearly a year now.
19081,So much progress has been made.
19082,I *was* so proud of myself.
19083,But I hate my family.
19084,And I can see that they're position they're putting me in and my hatred of them is going to make me relapse.
19085,"My mother has a lucrative job, by all means."
19086,But she never planned or saved money unless it was for herself.
19087,"She and my step-dad worked at an institution, only to be fired simultaneously and black-balled so that they couldn't find work anywhere else for over a year."
19088,My mom went back to work eventually.
19089,"My step-dad refused, staying at home like a lazy piece of shit."
19090,This leads me to where I am today - the money situation has gotten so bad that he needs to find work.
19091,"I'm able to go to college because my mother works at one and I get free tuition (a blessing, even though I hate the school)."
19092,"But because we need to pay for debts, my step-dad needs to get a job."
19093,Which means he can't drive me to my job.
19094,Which means I can't work.
19095,"Which means: no income, no freedom, no more saving up for a car of my own, no more planning and saving for a semester overseas."
19096,"I feel like all my freedom is being stripped, like all the bad decisions they made are bringing me to my knees."
19097,My anxiety level is through the roof - I can't stop myself from crying and freaking out.
19098,"I have thoughts of leaving it all behind - my school, my job and my boyfriend."
19099,"He hasn't even done anything wrong and I'm ready to end the whole thing right now, cause I can't deal with it."
19100,"I feel like every positive step I take, I'm pushed back a mile by their bullshit."
19101,"And if they were supportive, it wouldn't even be as bad."
19102,But they're so overly critical of me as it is that I don't think I can stand to be lectured one more time.
19103,I'm smart and I'm loyal and I'm a damn good person.
19104,"Through therapy, I learned these things and believed them with all my heart."
19105,But now I feel like the world is closing in on me and I'm genuinely scared.
19106,I don't know what to do.
19107,Help?
19108,Advice?
19109,I'll take anything.
19110,"I am not on any medication, seeing as I have not gone to a professional, yet, about these issues and I do not self medicate."
19111,"I've been getting cbt for about five months now and it's been going well, but it has never lasted throughout the week."
19112,I've come to the personal conclusion that my anxiety is linked to an actual chemical imbalance and not just the horrible experiences I had as a child (which didn't help) and that I need medication to regulate my brain alongside my therapy.
19113,"My therapist agrees and she's referred me to a psychiatrist, although there is a lengthy waiting list of about 6 months...I may get in earlier."
19114,Here's the thing: I'm 17 and I'm extremely studious(and passionate).
19115,"My anxiety has limited me in many ways (sound sensitivity, fear of cars/driving, fear of men, checking behavior, anxiety attacks) but I've never faltered in my studies, both personal and in an academic setting."
19116,I'm actually starting college a year early next fall and I've tested into very advanced classes (I'm an engineering major; see how the fear of men would hinder me?
19117,"It's not horrible, yet, but I want to keep the problem from escalating)."
19118,The process of drug administration and calibration is a tedious one and I fear that I will crash and burn (for the very first time in my life) in my studies just when I need to start being even more serious.
19119,"I feel like I don't have time to experiment with drugs that could make me fat, make me extremely fatigued, make me dumber, or make me numb."
19120,I have intellectual obligations.
19121,"How can I approach fixing what my therapist, my family, and I myself see as a very serious issue without creating another very serious issue (failing college and becoming apathetic about my passions)?"
19122,"I love learning and studying so much now and I don't want to lose that, but I fear that anxiety could cause me to lose that all the same."
19123,Any recommendations?
19124,Is there anyone who's successfully messed with medications in college?
19125,"My mother took prozac for three years and the only side effects she had were nausea in the beginning and low-libido, and I don't mind those that much."
19126,I can handle those.
19127,"But I can't handle extreme fatigue, drowsiness, apathy, flattening, or weight gain (of anymore than 5-10 lbs...I understand water weight and I'm already a low weight so trivial weight gain is no big deal to me)."
19128,I absolutely cannot.
19129,My therapist says that I have a beautiful mind.
19130,"She thinks that I have great potential and wants me to see that, too, without being clouded by my anxiety."
19131,She thinks medication is a great idea.
19132,Why would she mislead me?
19133,"I'm so afraid that she doesn't actually care if I become apathetic and fail in life, even though she says that she values my mind so much."
19134,I've heard so many horror stories...
19135,Hi guys!
19136,"Being a big Armin van Buuren fan, I manged to get tickets to his last Armin Only show."
19137,In late October I will be travelling to the Czech Republic and the city Ostrawa - to take part in this great event with 20.000ish others.
19138,"I am thrilled, and really looking forward to this."
19139,"Not having a lot of money, a weekend trip and a concert like this is a big and costly thing for me."
19140,"I'd just like to state for the record that I am a normal functioning dude with a full job, a house and a girlfriend - but I am struggling with anxiety, more specifically, agoraphobia, which tends to make me a mess in large crowds."
19141,"I don't take any medications for my anxiety, and I deal with it head on, exposing myself to whatever 'dangers' are out there."
19142,I know this will be one of those challenges that I will just have to overcome.
19143,"Still, this is a big deal for me, and I really want to make the most out of it, and make it an experience of a lifetime."
19144,"I know myself well enough to know that this will be a huge anxiety issue for me, and while I'd normally just ""fight it off"" with disassociation and other tools us anxietiers use - I'd like to know if there's a way to take the edge off, and just be able to fully enjoy the party and the music."
19145,"I don't smoke or drink, and I've never used any recreational drugs."
19146,"(I know what you're thinking, I'm such a boring guy, right?"
19147,"Well no, I'm not;) ) Normally, I'd be opposed to the thought of using anything but common sense to overcome a problem, but this is a once in a lifetime big thing for me, and I want to make any and every effort I can to make the most out of it - and to that end - I'm asking you for help."
19148,What would you do if you were in my shoes?
19149,I am pretty sure he would be unwilling to agree to some medication for me (not even sure psychotherapists can prescribe?).
19150,"you may need therapy,
you may need medication, 
but eventually you will move past it and become a stronger person."
19151,"I'm in therapy, on medication, and doing everything I can on my own but it's going to cause me to lose someone I care about so much and I just don't know what to do."
19152,"My grandmother on my Father's side was on anxiety medication, my mother is on medication for depression as well as for an under active thyroid, and my brother was prescribed medication for anxious thoughts."
19153,"I've already been to a counselling session after I had a panic attack about it, and I've booked a doctor's appointment to talk about potential medication."
19154,"But these are the things that I feel helped me a lot on my journey:

- Finally finding prozac after trying 3-4 different meds
- Therapy throughout college from student health office
- Avoiding marijuana
- working out

And the big one...

**- Consistently testing and challenging my anxiety**

**Everyone, please try your very best to take baby steps every day."
19155,"i don't usually worry about taking medication, but i'm just feeling a lot of anxiety around this, perhaps because i've seen my husband's struggle to get on the right meds, and i know it's not always an easy process."
19156,"i've never taken medication for either of these issues before, and have never really had severe anxiety until a couple months ago (have battled depression on and off for most of my life, but never anything i ""couldn't handle"")

i drink occasionally and socially, but have wanted to drink tons these last few weeks (i haven't)."
19157,"I feel like I should be on meds, but I don't want to risk the side-affects at 16 years old."
19158,Could those symptoms be from my anxiety and not taking my medication?
19159,I hate how I take this medicine that I say makes me feel better but I am so paranoid I don't tell the doctor it isn't helping anymore.
19160,I hate how if I don't take the medicine I feel even worse.
19161,I am back in therapy and changed meds to paxil.
19162,I then went to 20mg of lexapro (now) and still being hit with attacks and symptoms so my next step is going to a psychiatrist to evaluate me for the right meds to get back to how I use to feel.
19163,"I am just really hoping to find the right meds to to put me back in that state of being I had just a few months ago....but of course, I worry of the side effects and another medication not working again."
19164,I don't know if it's because I've been reading so much of this sub section or the people I've talked to but I don't know if I need medication or not and would like to just let the Dr decide.
19165,"Hello, let me start off by saying ive been dealing with severe anxiety for about a year now, with moderate anxiety being present my whole life (20 years)."
19166,"I have a tough time reading long paragraphs, and i freeze up in doctors offices, leaving very few options for choice of medications."
19167,"Ive been on a plethora of them, but I dont remember exactly which ones."
19168,"Paxil, Clonazepam, cipralex, vyvanse, welbutrin, lorazepam (briefly, doctor took me off of it for unknown reasons, anxiety was too bad to argue it at the time), as well as one or two others."
19169,"Basically, which ones should I consider, and vaguely what do they do?"
19170,"As I previously stated, i have a hard time with large blocks of text, making research very difficult for me."
19171,"A common side effect of all the medications ive been on is loss of appetite, which is pretty awful for me, as im already quite slim."
19172,"If anyone has experience with a certain medication that seems to work without that side effect, please let me know (I understand everyone has different side effects for different things)."
19173,"Also, i have pretty severe add, which im coping not-too-well with, but I guess its something to consider."
19174,Any advice would be seriously appreciated!
19175,I know I can't do anything about the actual anxiety--she's seeing two therapists and taking meds--but I'd love to be able to help with this (possible) particular troubling symptom.
19176,Clonidine is traditionally a blood pressure medication so its hard to find people online taking it for anxiety.
19177,"The other effects of the medication have improved our relationship in some ways, because I am more comfortable and can relax more than ever around him."
19178,"I know that the loss of feelings are possibly not because of the medication, however (the loss of libido certainly is)."
19179,Maybe I would be having these feelings even if I wasn't taking the medication.
19180,"But if it is, and if that is what I have to sacrifice to get rid of my anxiety, I don't think I want to take the medication anymore."
19181,"If you've stopped taking medication because of the sexual side effects, have you had success with other methods of alleviating anxiety?"
19182,Hello Reddit!
19183,I am currently taking 50mg of Pristiq to deal with panic disorder and social anxiety.
19184,I've been on various medications for the last few years.
19185,"After talking it over with my doctor, I've decided I'd like to discontinue Pristiq, and got a referral to a good Psych to see whether I'll have any success with CBT."
19186,"However, I'm still not sure how to actually discontinue Pristiq."
19187,"My doctor advised me to cut the tablets in half, and step down that way, but I've done some searching on the net, and everything I've read has told me that cutting them in half can cause dose dumping and that you shouldn't do it."
19188,Has anyone else gotten off Pristiq?
19189,"I feel like I have tried countless meds, and talking to a counselor but still cannot seem to manage the anxiety when it comes to that."
19190,Is this such a deep rooted issue now that its time for medication like Cialis or Viagra?
19191,I don't know what true anxiety issues constitute and I'm unsure of whether what I'm experiencing is severe and actually requires medication or not.
19192,I also didn't feel depressed even though I didn't take any of my medication (I was telling my mom I was taking it).
19193,I didn't have to take any medication anymore and I had a fairly normal day-to-day life with only a few minor panic attacks for about a year.
19194,I was dealing with my anxiety really well without medication and staying clean.
19195,I am a 28 year old female who has had social anxiety disorder and depression since age 12.
19196,I have been taking zoloft 100mg and wellbutrin sr 150mg for about 7 months.
19197,I have also been taking ativan 0.5 mg twice daily for 2 years.
19198,"I have taken almost every ssri and they allow me to be minimally functional but I still have very low energy and motivation, difficulty concentrating, and constant feelings of guilt, sadness, and anxiety."
19199,The last few weeks have been particularly rough with a significant increase in anxiety and difficulty concentrating.
19200,I've made an appointment with my psych doc for next week and have been researching non-ssri medications to suggest.
19201,"My first choice is Parnate, an maoi, which i've read is very effective for treatment resistant depression, but I don't know if my doc will want to try that yet bc of the tyramine interaction risks."
19202,"The other 2 I'm considering are Abilify, although the weight gain and tardive dyskinesia side effects worry me; and Straterra."
19203,Any advice or experiences with these meds would be greatly appreciated.
19204,I ask friends (Though I completely understand and agree with the illegal distribution of prescription ADHD medication is wrong and deeply affects people who need it) if I can try their medication and find myself more centered and in control...
19205,"Overall,
I've been drunk all night and have simmering off of my medication."
19206,After that I lost all hope in anxiety meds.
19207,Does anyone have any familiarity with these 2 meds and know what I should expect?
19208,"I'm on medication and have been for close to a year, but it's a daily medication (Zoloft) and I don't have any meds for taking during a panic attack."
19209,"I know this is just general anxiety, but does anyone know what I could do to reduce these without having to take medicine?"
19210,I've been on more medications for anxiety and depression than I can remember.
19211,"I have a high incident of side effects, in addition to just piles of health problems."
19212,"Side effects I have had have ranged from medically induced Parkinsonism, to severe tachycardia, to hallucinating."
19213,This recent side effect though has me plain frustrated and I'm curious if anyone else has experienced anything similar.
19214,My psychiatrist and I have been on this never ending quest to find an anxiety aid that isn't habit forming.
19215,"(Just give me my Klonopin, damnit!)"
19216,"I've been a good girl and tried everything she suggests without fussing, namely because it would be nice to have something I didn't have to go through withdrawals from once a year."
19217,Our latest little adventure into the world of random medication has be propranolol.
19218,"I work myself up to high blood pressure from stress anyway, I thought hey, two birds, one stone."
19219,I liked it quite a bit.
19220,Made me calm and not wiggly without feeling drugged.
19221,I was on it a week or so and then I noticed I was having a hard time reading.
19222,"I figured I had been playing on my phone all night, maybe my eyes were tired."
19223,I wake up the next morning and put on my glasses to find I have double vision.
19224,"I decide to try my contacts, and when I put them in is when I noticed I was going physically cross eyed."
19225,"My right eye crosses in with glasses, my left with contacts."
19226,WHAT??
19227,"So I call the psychiatrist, they tell me to go off propranolol."
19228,"It's been 4 days since I went off it, and I went to the optometrist today for a check up."
19229,The optometrist was floored.
19230,My eyes are healthy.
19231,Each eye individually can see 20/20.
19232,My prescription hasn't changed.
19233,"( I'm 5.50 in contacts, legally blind as a bat ) I'm even going slightly cross eyed with no glasses or contacts."
19234,She kept talking about how intriguing it was and how she's never seen this.
19235,All my doctors and the optometrist  assure me it will go away over time.
19236,I have been wandering around my house only able to see blurry shapes and colors for days.
19237,Who knows how much longer?
19238,"I can't drive, I can't watch TV or use the laptop, I can barely make food for myself."
19239,I can only use my phone because I can hold it 3 inches from my face.
19240,Anyone else ever go through this?
19241,"I look goofy as all get out walking around cross eyed with double vision, so I have to stay pretty much blind until it fixes itself."
19242,"I start college the 25th, something I've been working towards ever since I dropped out 5 years ago."
19243,And now I'm practically blind.
19244,Sorry for the rant.
19245,TL;DR Propranolol broke my damn eyes.
19246,"I got a dumb book from the library and sat outside for a bit and that helped, and I also took some over the counter anti-nausea medication and thats helped a little."
19247,"I could go to the hospital for the post-exposure treatment, but they and my family would think I'm crazy (maybe I am), and the medication is supposed to have extremely unpleasant side effects (to the point where some people actually stop taking them)."
19248,I'm already on meds but the thoughts won't stop!
19249,I'm on a lot of meds due to also having bipolar disorder but I'd say my anxiety has been relative stable for the past few weeks with my meds.
19250,He also thought that my memory problems are a sign that I may have ADD and he wants me to research it and get back to him about it before making me go on medication for it.
19251,**TL;DR;** *Can any experienced runners give me advice on the methods they use to help them lessen their anxiety and let them run in relative peace?
19252,"* (Things like, where do you run?"
19253,What time of day do you run?
19254,How long do you run?
19255,etc.)
19256,"**Context;** So I've always kind of told myself I was going to start running or do some form of exercise outside of my home, I just need to deal with this anxiety thing first."
19257,"Well, now I'm 27 and ""this anxiety thing"" is as much if not more of a thing than it ever was before."
19258,"I've finally started running, mainly because my new psychologist (I'm trying CBT without medication for the first time after about 10 years of diagnosis and medications.)"
19259,kept berating me to do it.
19260,Nobody really gets how big of a deal this is for me.
19261,I've been so socially phobic in the last 5 years that I've developed a full on agoraphobia.
19262,"There are about three scenarios that I can think of off the top of my head that terrify me beyond speech; public speaking, super-market check-out lines, and working out/exercising in a public place."
19263,"Just the possibility that there might be another person out there, judging me, watching me, totally not paying any attention to me at all as I sweat under the hot flood-lights of paranoia and anxiety, transforms the act of turning my door handle with the intention of going outside into a titanic battle of will."
19264,"When I go outside to run, I climb three mountains, when I get out of bed, when I leave my room, and when I leave my house, and the rest of it is such constant adrenaline fuelled panic-nightmare of forcing myself to not just turn around, that I don't really remember the actual running part very clearly."
19265,"So, after that long bit of context, my question is; **Are there any experienced runners here, particularly the sort who run as a method of dealing with anxiety, who could offer me any advice on how to mitigate the feelings that make my experience wholly unpleasant?"
19266,**
19267,"So the situation:
My SO has anxiety, a lot of it."
19268,We've been together for nearly a year.
19269,"This spring they spiraled out, things got bad, I stuck with them."
19270,"We got them on new medications, diagnosed as bi-polar."
19271,"They were briefly in inpatient (voluntary), then did group DBT, but the weeks have been a slog."
19272,"In part life just keeps pelting us with crap, but in part they can't seem to do anything about it."
19273,"Their current prescription is lithium, just got the first serum test donelast week but haven't heard back."
19274,"Canabidiol extract (cibdex) has been helping a fair bit, but only for about 2 hours at a time."
19275,I guess I'm just looking for anyone who has figured out how to live with this.
19276,"I love them, and I'm not going anywhere - but I'm running out of ideas to help."
19277,"I think exercise would be a huge help, but they have no history of athletics and ankle problems."
19278,Has anyone had success with yoga to alleviate anxiety?
19279,"Its just about my last idea, but I don't want to waste their time."
19280,Has anyone got any ideas I might have missed to help them?
19281,I'm afraid that if nothing changes it's just a matter of time before I lose them.
19282,Its hard to argue against suicide after months of straight misery.
19283,I almost feel like I'm holding them hostage.
19284,"Stick with it and keep reminding yourself, despite nagging doubts: through strength, persistence, and the medication, I'm getting better every day."
19285,Found myself in A&amp;E begging to be put back on medication.
19286,"I know speaking with my doctor is one of the main things I can do, and no one here really knows me or my medication or history, so no one can provide professional or solid advice, but I'm just looking for anything."
19287,I was on meds before.
19288,I felt sick for taking medicine.
19289,"Paroxetine made my IBS worse, and probably all the other meds too."
19290,So now I also feel scared of medication.
19291,The only freedom of mind I get is the fact I dont take medication.
19292,I'm going to see about getting on meds.
19293,"Of course, talk to your doctor before taking any medication."
19294,"Took my nightly meds Gabapentin, Zantac, and Citalopram."
19295,"It usually calms me down and stops my panic attacks   not causes them   But usually I don't take it so close with my other meds either
is there some timing problem with it so close to the others?"
19296,Is it common for anyone else to basically wake up to an anxiety attack?
19297,"I often wake up in the morning and the sudden dread/anxiety hits, tightness in the chest, my stomach/intestines go crazy, and I end up sitting/standing in shower crying and wishing I could curl back up in bed and fall asleep."
19298,"I assume it's usually related to the initial morning thought of ""what needs to get done today"", and the anxiety that hits when I realize there's more to do than can be accomplished."
19299,But it's like I can't even get to thinking about what needs to be done before the anxiety attack starts.
19300,I don't know what else could be causing them.
19301,"I'm not currently taking any medications, but have been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds in the past (went off them last August or so)."
19302,Oh I am also back on anti depressants and I was good on both meds for 2 years then when I quit them it got bad again.
19303,I started medication and therapy at age 19.
19304,I had a medication regime and still I felt awful.
19305,My meds were tapered off.
19306,I started sleeping through the night without medication.
19307,Four months later I'm off all meds.
19308,"Years and years and years of hard work, medication change ups, therapy, groups,  family support and lifestyle changes healed my brain."
19309,The anxiety medication I was on when I was admitted wasn't helping anything because I had hypertension which wasn't treated properly.
19310,I didn't think I'd ever be off meds.
19311,"I quit taking my zoloft, because I don't want to be held down to anxiety medicine for the rest of my life."
19312,I started therapy and swore I would never take medicine.
19313,"I started my therapy up again (I had taken almost a year off), and discussed medication."
19314,He has bumped up my meds to 10mg hoping to see more of an improvement.
19315,I know the medicine will take time to kick in.
19316,"I guess I just wanted you guys to know, if you are against medicine, you might want to reconsider."
19317,I live in Japan and I'm not sure if the doctors will give me anything medication for anxiety or just tell me to wait it out.
19318,He gave me a prescription for general anxiety as well as another medication to use as needed in the event of an anxiety attack.
19319,"Some personal facts: I'm a 25 year old male, I live in the UK, I've never been prescribed any medication, I don't really know what else to say here."
19320,I controlled my anxiety really well for 4 and a half months with no medicine either!
19321,"Hello,
I'm new to the sub and am not very active on Reddit but I have finally decided to make a post and get some feedback."
19322,I want to start by saying that I've had anxiety for years and have never taken any medications for it because I can usually control it myself.
19323,"However, I had a recent loss in the family which was the first time I've ever had to deal with death and I strongly believe it has been a trigger for me."
19324,I've noticed that my anxiety about things has completely gone through the roof and I just can't help myself anymore.
19325,I get most of my anxiety and panic attacks at night time while I am in bed and this keeps me from sleeping/staying asleep.
19326,Although I do get anxiety throughout the day too.
19327,I find that things that would cause small amounts of anxiety before are now really hard for me to overcome.
19328,I'm also getting anxiety over things that never bothered me before.
19329,It's really hard for me to open up and ask for help because I almost feel stupid for having such bad anxiety and panic attacks.
19330,"The people who are closest to me somehow make me feel like I'm just overreacting and should be able to get over it, so I feel like I'm just alone."
19331,I just don't know what to do anymore.
19332,"If anybody has any recommendations about what I could do, I would really appreciate it."
19333,"Its not that I don't want more help, its that getting help in the first place was fairly crippling and the medication I have been taking has been working well so far."
19334,The point is that I have come to the realization that the medication has maybe not been working so well in the last few weeks.
19335,"I have tried therapy, vitamins, eating healthy, and medicine."
19336,"Since I did that, I went about 3 days where the meds weren't seeming as effective, but that has seemed typical that every two weeks around the same time I'd have a few days like that."
19337,"Now they're effective again but now I'm back to where the effects will fade over night and I feel okay, but I don't feel ""great"" until about an hour after I take the meds."
19338,I've been on medicine in the past.
19339,"and she got back to me within about a day and left a message just wanting to know the nature of the request, so I left another message with some further details (anxiety, depression, meds, yadda yadda)."
19340,"The only medication I take is klonopin (.5mg) nightly and I've wondered if being on it for the last year has contributed to it, but I highly doubt it."
19341,Had a appointment with my Pdoc (who also has a lot of experience in other areas of medicine) and he suggested I see a cardiologist for a work up due to some weird palpitations I've been having and to put my health anxiety at rest.
19342,"I did get a formal diagnosis for depression about 5 years ago, however, I have not been in therapy or taking medicine for some time."
19343,"I haven't tried different medication because I decided that because this worked, wasn't giving me any negative side effects, and was making me feel better I was just going to stop there."
19344,"It has gotten better now (I'm 17), but when I was a kid (a smaller one, atleast :)) it was really bad and I used to take medication (not sure what it was)."
19345,"I think removing those problems could boost my confidence a little, but should I use medicine or do you think I could work through this myself?"
19346,I haven't been on medication that works in months and I can no longer afford my old meds.
19347,"I've been working with psychiatrists for about a year now in helping to treat my eating disorder (anorexia b/p subtype), bipolar 2, and anxiety."
19348,I've been through a few different medications but have been on my current medications for several months now (Lithium and Prozac).
19349,"While my depression and mood cycling have definitely improved, my anxiety is still through the roof."
19350,"Given the nature of my bipolar, which is basically cycling through very intense depressive moods and an equilibrium, it has been my psychiatrist's main focus."
19351,"Should I ask him more about the anxiety, or given that everything else has lightened a bit should I just accept it?"
19352,"Backround:

* 19 years old

* Current cigarette smoker for around five years (around half a pack a day for the past two years)

* Sporadically active but not overweight

* Unsure of family history with heart conditions

* Some history of panic attacks, but mostly linked to marijuana use (infrequent marijuana use, elaborated in the comments)

* Blood pressure was normal as of around 6 months ago."
19353,"* I take Minocycline for acne, and it causes some stomach discomfort

So for the past three days I've been having episodes of panic and rapid and slightly erratic heart beat."
19354,The first night I simply assumed it was a panic attack and managed to put it off and get to sleep.
19355,"The last two nights however, I've been unable to sleep, constantly checking my pulse."
19356,"None of my normal panic reducing strategies are working and I am getting weird sensations throughout my body, constantly bringing me back to the anxiety."
19357,I have a hollow/heart-burn (not quite painful-- just uncomfortable) like sensation in my chest/abdomen and when I'm laying down I can feel and see my heart-beat in my abdomen.
19358,I also have a slight pressure in my head with what occasionally feels like a bubble or pinch in my arms (biceps) and head slightly to the left of the center near the top of my head.
19359,"I also get these random warm spots (usually on my arms), but they go away within a couple minutes."
19360,"I'm not necessarily asking for a diagnosis, as I have a good idea of the possible (and predominantly scary) conditions, and hearing it told back to me will probably just make the anxiety over it worse."
19361,"The research has been hard enough, so unless you feel as if I'm in immediate undoubted danger, please don't give me scary warnings."
19362,My main concern is getting into a non-ER doctor tomorrow to get some tests done.
19363,"I say non-ER because it is frankly very expensive, and my parents are already spending quite a bit between my dermatologist, counselor, and medications."
19364,"I haven't yet been diagnosed with any kind of mental health disorder, nor given any medications, and I went in for depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, social anxiety, and sporadic panic attacks."
19365,Do you have any idea how I might be able to get into a doctor tomorrow of the day after?
19366,Thank you for reading!
19367,"Edit: 

* Formatting

* Not sure why this seems to be tagged school/exams and not sure how to fix."
19368,"This is just my second time posting, and I'm not *entirely* sure how to go about it."
19369,* Clarification
19370,"I'm not currently taking any medication, and my anxiety is primarily triggered by any sort of new social situation."
19371,I'm hoping that the meds will help with therapy which has been useless in the past.
19372,Keep my fingers crossed that meds will fix everything?
19373,Neurologist wants me to get off the medication but told him I want this sleep condition resolved first.
19374,"Of course my mind gets involved and I worry that I'm going to die because I can't sleep, or that I'm really going to have a seizure and all these years without one are gone down the drain and I'll never get off my medicine, or maybe it's just fight or flight kicking in and I can't do either and just being helpless."
19375,Does serotonin medication actually help?
19376,Do you think my medication could be making me feel like this?
19377,"I am wondering now since I am in a good place if it is wise to ween myself off my medication, as I feel like I no longer need it."
19378,"I have read that this medication causes difficulty with orgasm which I believe I am experiancing, but I have nothing to compare it to since I lost my virginity in this time period- I know for a fact though I do not and never have had a low libido."
19379,I also have frequent and vivid nightmares on the medication- sometimes I forget whether it is reality or not they are so life like.
19380,Anyways besides these issues the meds are not effecting my life in anyway except positively- if at all.
19381,Is it advisable to ween myself off of this medication?
19382,"I am on no medication, my doctor told me to use herbal remedies which are doing nothing."
19383,I don't have much experience with anti-anxiety meds but are these side effects a normal part of taking benzos?
19384,Had a session with my therapist today and we talked about how I haven't been taking my meds.
19385,"Hey all, I am a nineteen year old female and I have horrible anxiety along with being clinically diagnosed as bipolar."
19386,I am currently taking lamictal as well as lithium and I've been taking the medications too recently for them to take effect.
19387,"Along with this, I have absolutely no friends, I'm the black sheep of my family so they are out of the question for support, and my ex-boyfriend and I are on some sort of ""break"", but recently I discovered some horrible things that he has said about me."
19388,"Actually, reading what he said about me set me off which I can go more into depth about if we talk."
19389,I would honestly and truly enjoy talking on Skype video chat or voice.
19390,I really think it would help to calm me down to hear a voice and actually interact with someone as I have been cooped up in my apartment for a good portion of the day.
19391,"This wouldn't be a temporary thing, I would love to build a friendship based on mutual understanding of each other as well as giving each other support in any stressful situations."
19392,"I have kik as well, but ideally I would love to Skype and then kik."
19393,I do appreciate you taking the time to read this.
19394,I read [this](http://sometimes-interesting.com/2013/04/24/the-story-of-gennie-pilarski/) [**DON'T READ IT**]article yesterday from reddit.
19395,"It's scary, it terrifies[d] me."
19396,"I began to think, which is my worst enemy."
19397,"I read that, and applied it to my circumstances."
19398,"I've been committed and it's as bad as the article suggests, even in 2014."
19399,"In fact I'd claim it's worse because every ""med"" they can give you turns you into not you - a zombie."
19400,"But you're still there, helpless and unable to come out of the prison they've built in your head."
19401,Let's not dwell on that though.
19402,I went to bed at 1am - well tried to go to bed.
19403,"I couldn't fall asleep, on my mind was that poor girl in the article."
19404,"On my mind is how it's acceptable today for much worse, and that is considered treatment by ^*experts* [lol]."
19405,I woke my mom up freaked out.
19406,I couldn't handle myself.
19407,I did not trust anyone ever.
19408,"I didn't feel like they were out to get me, but I felt a situation like the article as the inevitable consequence of my injuries, that can be seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1waxpq/iama_there_was_interest_in_this_coma_survivor/)."
19409,"I talked with my mother for about 2 hours, nothing alleviated it."
19410,I just got more scared.
19411,"I threatened suicide, no, promised."
19412,I built elaborate plans for it.
19413,It comes down to the fact that mental health ^*professionals* aren't in it to help people.
19414,They're in it to make it as easy on themselves to earn a paycheck.
19415,My mom works in mental health and wholly agreed.
19416,The system is broken.
19417,The medications [sic] used are broken.
19418,"The doctors are broken, and the primary cause of all this."
19419,I went to bed eventually.
19420,Woke up and was still freaking out.
19421,"Demanded control of my money, parents are my guardians."
19422,And promised they wouldn't see me again before it ran out.
19423,I appear to be okay to them but I'm not.
19424,"I have a wicked ability to feign okayness, despite what's happening."
19425,I'm good at reading people and showing them what they want to see so I can get away.
19426,In the end I don't know what happened/is happening.
19427,"Do not suggest medication, it's a scam and I refuse to take any medication."
19428,"Do not suggest therapy, it's a scam and worse than medicine."
19429,"Have had panic and anxiety attacks before, was on serotonin meds for a while but just stopped taking them, felt weird."
19430,tl;dr Anyone ever got help minus meds?
19431,"I talked to my therapist who said I should call my doctor (just my general physician, he is who is prescribing my meds now) and see if I could get the dosage increased."
19432,"The nurse I talked to on the phone was amazing, she said she has medicine anxiety too and she hates taking meds like I do, but that these two meds are made to work together and they think it'll really really help me be able to cope and function with day to day life."
19433,"*My question is, has anyone ever been on two different meds/med classes?"
19434,"I have a prescription for anti-anxiety meds but I only take ""when needed"" ..."
19435,Today starts the third weeks in which I've been on meds to control my recent Anxiety issues.
19436,I used to be on meds a few years ago and came off and have been fine til I bought my first house.
19437,I've been in and out of therapy but never really finished a program and I'm really trying to avoid meds (my current therapist just brought this up as an option if things don't improve over the next few weeks).
19438,I started a new job 3 days ago.
19439,Internship actually.
19440,"And for those 3 days, anxiety took control of me completely."
19441,"It made me feel useless, stupid, and it made me want to just get out, not be there."
19442,It made me question why I was there in the first place.
19443,"""This job is a huge mistake""."
19444,"""You don't even want to be here""."
19445,"""There's so many things you'd be better suited for and you're just not suited for this""."
19446,"But when I thought about all the other things I've done in the past I felt sad, because It made me feel like anxiety has been one of the main driving forces in my life for as long as I can remember."
19447,"That it was the anxiety that always made me change form one thing to another - job, place, people."
19448,I get afraid.
19449,I feel useless.
19450,I need to change something.
19451,I run.
19452,"""You've always been this way""."
19453,"""You're just too shy, to much of a coward""."
19454,"""Your brain doesn't work like a normal brain should""."
19455,Thinking like this made me feel like something has to change.
19456,I can't continue to live like this.
19457,"A half life, a non-life carried out in perpetual fear of failing."
19458,It can't go on.
19459,But how can it change?
19460,I can't see any way out of this negative living.
19461,I can't imagine any way out.
19462,Except one.
19463,My thoughts turned to what medications that can be bought and mixed in a way that I would go peacefully to sleep and never wake up.
19464,"Maybe bleach might do it but that would hardly be a gentle sleep, and I'm scared I'd wake up permanently worse that before."
19465,"I talked to some friends that I might not be very good at this job, that it had me worried."
19466,They gave me some useful advice when starting such jobs.
19467,It was appreciated.
19468,I'll try again tomorrow.
19469,But If this dark cloud doesn't lift soon I'm lost.
19470,I take medication for it and consider it to be manageable.
19471,"Lost my job 5 years ago, have been housebound since, got off of all meds except got some Xanax here and there from family members."
19472,I had this writing urge so maybe this may come of use to somebody.
19473,"So you have anxiety, or you think you might have anxiety."
19474,"No worries, it’s a normal thing."
19475,That’s one big thing to remember: it’s normal.
19476,"If you’re the unsure case, well, we need to know what anxiety is."
19477,"Anxiety defined: a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome."
19478,"Now, there are a few different major categories of anxiety."
19479,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Phobia (Social, Specific), Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder."
19480,"While it’s never good to self-diagnose, you can probably self-evaluate with a simple Google search to best learn what exactly is going on."
19481,"Anxiety is, for the most part, caused by adrenaline."
19482,"Yes, the same thing that helps you avoid split-second car accidents, and gets your libido on."
19483,Some of our brains dump adrenaline at the most inopportune time; it’s too much of a good thing.
19484,"Once you know what’s going on, you can further analyze with behavioral analysis."
19485,"Ask yourself:

* Stimulation - what were you doing?"
19486,* Thought - what were you thinking?
19487,* Emotion - what were your emotions?
19488,"* Body Sensation - heartbeat, hot, cold, shaky
* Joy level - 1 to 5, where 5 is very joyous and 1 isn’t joyous whatsoever."
19489,"* Misery level - 1 to 5, where 5 is miserable and 1 isn’t miserable."
19490,* Action - how did you act upon when stimulation?
19491,"* Going into the situation, what were your resources/strengths?"
19492,"* Going into the situation, what were your vulnerabilities?"
19493,* Trigger - if any?
19494,* What actions were helpful?
19495,* What actions made the situation worse?
19496,"If you accumulate enough data, like anything, you can begin to understand it better."
19497,"Then, there are some life hacks:

* Avoid caffeine - it’s a stimulant, and stimulants have properties that invoke anxiety."
19498,* Avoid stimulants - see above.
19499,"* Physical stimulus - do something, be active, even if very simple."
19500,"Stress ball, taking a walk, wrestling with your puppy."
19501,"If your temperature goes up, your anxiety goes down."
19502,"* Have food in your stomach - you know how when you’re hungry, you’re often cranky?"
19503,"Yep, same concept applies here."
19504,"* If you’re medicated, make sure you’re keeping a steady habit of taking your medications."
19505,* Sleep is vital.
19506,"Don't get too much, but don't get too little."
19507,7-9 hours is great.
19508,"Now, in some cases, such as social phobia, there isn’t really enough time to do that 10-step questionnaire (“hold on - feeling an onset of panic - gotta fill out this form!”)."
19509,Why do we have social phobia?
19510,"Well, it’s a natural thing."
19511,Some of us are just more natural than others.
19512,Common characteristics of social phobia is an extreme worry of scrutiny or judgement by others - most often by people around your age.
19513,That last bit is very key: by people around your age.
19514,"For example, I’m great around parents, elders, and little kids, but if you bring someone +- 5 years of me, I’m a shitshow."
19515,The best way to overcome such situations is desensitizing yourself.
19516,Think of it like playing the same song over and over and over (...) until you get sick of it.
19517,"Well, same applies here: if you do the same thing over and over, soon, you’ll become less sensitive to the situation."
19518,"It sucks at first, and remember it only gets better after that."
19519,Each time you’ll become less and less sensitive.
19520,"If you’re having a panic attack in a relaxed, laid-back environment, and are able to take a timeout, do some four-count breathing:

* In for four seconds."
19521,* Hold for four seconds.
19522,* Out for four seconds.
19523,* Repeat for four minutes.
19524,"While there is heaps of information out there, and on this subreddit, there is no substitution for a therapist."
19525,They are covered by most insurance companies too.
19526,"Check Angie’s List for some reviews on therapists in your area, or a good ‘ol Google Search will also suffice."
19527,Please help me find treatments for my jitters and anxiety.
19528,I am a man of limited means but my heightened state of anxiousness is making things difficult.
19529,I cannot afford to see a doctor now (I recently quit my job -- wasn't being able to handle the pressure).
19530,Are there over-the-counter medicines that can help?
19531,"I live in India, where getting fleeced, even by doctors, is always a possibility."
19532,I'd appreciate any guidance.
19533,PS: I refuse to take medication.
19534,"So I am a 16 years old guy, 2 weeks ago I had my first anxiety atack because I though that I am having a heart atack and I am gonna die, after that everything was fine untill yesterday when I was running outside with my dog, stopped for a moment and felt like my heart skipped a beat, I panicked, ran inside and had an anxiety atack again, after my dad gave me some pills (I think it was xanax or something to calm down), I went to bed and felt asleep, then today in the middle of the biology class, while talking about heart and stuffs, I got an anxiety atack, this time I calmed down in 3-4 mins, but today all day I was feeling pretty bad, every time when I think about my health or anything related to heart I start to get close to having an anxiety atack again.So I was wondering if there is any way to stop my anxiety without taking any pills or anything, I talked to my dad about going to someone to consult me but he said that I am fine and I dont need any medicine (he is a doctor, and my mom is a doctor too).When I get an anxiety atack at home, most of time I just cuddle my dog for several mins and then I slowly calm down... but that is not posible at school and I dont want to look like a guy with serious mental problems in the middle of class just because I have a strong fear of heart atacks, even after my dad explained me that a skipped beat (or a PVC) is nothing to worry about, because no one in my family had heart problems and my EKG is fine, my heart has no problems except that when I get a panic atack, my pulse gets pretty high (130-140 yesterday when I though that I am gonna die because of the skipped beat)."
19535,I have a few symptoms that I was hoping some people on here are familiar with that could give me some ways I can alleviate them without the use of medication.
19536,"I also have an appointment with a psychiatrist on June 12, but I would really like to go the route of no medication."
19537,Mass antidepressant hysteria.
19538,There's a lot of it here.
19539,Why is that?
19540,Let's take a look at the hysteria and what causes it and why I have such disdain for those who perpetuate it.
19541,"When I was young, I went to my dad and told him something int he house was broken, I don't remember what."
19542,"He responded by saying ""why doesn't anyone come tell me 'hey, the dishwasher is working great'?"""
19543,"Obviously, if the dishwasher is working as expected there's no reason to report on it."
19544,Just load it up and hit start.
19545,Get on with your life.
19546,The situation didn't do anything for me at the time but it stuck with me.
19547,"And I'm glad it did, because it comes up often in critical thinking."
19548,"If you Google your drugs, you'll notice a lot of people with problems taking the drug your doctor just prescribed you."
19549,The people who post that stuff are generally the *people who have had problems*.
19550,Count how many there are.
19551,There seems to be a lot.
19552,Now research how many people take the drugs.
19553,Do some math.
19554,Now count how many people report good things.
19555,Do some more math.
19556,"Something doesn't seem right, does it?"
19557,"Because those who have enjoyed the benefits of the drug they are taking, they are out enjoying the benefits of their medications, and living life possibly free of their symptoms."
19558,They have better things to do than to go post on forums!
19559,They represent what you might be trying to accomplish.
19560,This is simple logic.
19561,"Yet people grab on to these bad posts and run with them, propagating the hysteria everywhere they see an opportunity."
19562,And that's sad because these bad posts are causing a lot of fear of these drugs.
19563,"On nearly every post about Effexor, for instance, you'll find someone who is now afraid to take the med their doctor prescribed because of the hysterical posts by non-doctors."
19564,"Now, I'm all for being cautious."
19565,"But I have also seen meds save people's quality of life, their way of life, *their life*."
19566,"I've had it happen first hand, and I've seen it over and over again."
19567,Data supports this relief people feel using SSRIs and SNRIs.
19568,Do a little digging before giving up on what your doctor told you to do.
19569,"And if you still have concerns DON'T POST HERE, GET A SECOND OPINION FROM A PSYCH DOC!"
19570,"There are only a few docs here, and if they are reputable, they will not diagnose you or advise you here and will recommend seeing a doctor."
19571,One of the big hysterias that came up recently is that withdrawing from SSRIs and SNRIs quickly or cold turkey is monumentally a bad thing and VERY DANGEROUS!
19572,I have a goal now to show that there are no absolutes.
19573,"If your doctor says it's ok, trust them."
19574,"If you don't trust them, get a second opinion."
19575,"If you're still not satisfied, look at peer-reviewed studies on the subject, and NOT anecdotal information (even mine) posts on forums (even mine) or sites that have a vendetta against big pharma (even mi...wait, I don't have one of those)."
19576,Just don't get afraid.
19577,Especially by posts from non-doctors.
19578,"And if someone says they are a medical professional, always seek credentials."
19579,Consider the source.
19580,Find out who is saying what is being said.
19581,"Doubt, but ultimately decide based on solid information."
19582,"The drug you wind up taking, even temporarily, may put you back in touch with what it feels like to have a life."
19583,"You may have to try a few different meds, but if meds are indicated, make informed decisions about what you are trying."
19584,Don't believe the hype.
19585,"If you decide to go the natural route first, good on you!"
19586,"You might find that your anxiety is something completely manageable through good diet, exercise, meditation, yoga, or spirituality."
19587,"Or you might find non-drug approaches like CBT, ACT, or DBT work just fine for you without any drugs at al."
19588,"If that's the case, awesome!"
19589,I envy you.
19590,"But if all that fails, remember that *you* haven't failed, that there may be medical reasons for your anxiety and depression, and that it's not your fault."
19591,"More often than not, if you and your doctor have decided that meds are the way to go or at least try, you're going to need to try multiple different meds to see what helps with the fewest side effects."
19592,"For example, while most people can tolerate Zoloft, it gave me eye twitches that interfered with my ability to work."
19593,I'll continue that example.
19594,"Because I need to work, it became necessary to stop Zoloft ASAP."
19595,"The eye twitching wasn't dangerous, but it indicated a quick withdrawal because a guy's gotta make a living."
19596,"Other times, the side effects of a drug may get into more serious territory."
19597,"For instance, I personally know people for whom Effexor worked just fine, but for me it caused side effects that were disturbing, but also indicated there may be medical reasons to get off of it quickly."
19598,"Nothing life-threatening, but some possible digestive and sexual dysfunction problems (and I don't mean not being able to get it up, check out ""retrograde ejaculation"")."
19599,Plus the med just wasn't doing what it needed to do for me.
19600,"Still other times, if your doc feels you can handle it, he may want you to move on to the next drug quickly, because why drag it out?"
19601,"I work for myself and can take a few days off whenever I want, so this is no problem."
19602,My doctor knows that.
19603,And he knows I've been on the med-go-round for a while now and can handle the abrupt withdrawal.
19604,"Whatever the reason, if your doc says ""get off now, today"" or you just can't take the side effects of a particular drug anymore and your doc says it's ok, I want to give a first-hand account that with a doctor's ok and with monitoring, going cold turkey IS NOT MONUMENTALLY DANGEROUS."
19605,"It's ok in a lot of cases, and it's not in others."
19606,That's why you check with doc first.
19607,But don't believe this hype that getting off of SSRIs and SNRIs quickly or even cold turkey is going to kill you no matter what.
19608,"Again, consider the sources of this information."
19609,"The things I've talked about here, the bad posts, the alarmist attitudes towards things your doctor wants you to try, the absolutist beliefs that it's ALWAYS dangerous to get off SSRIs and SNRis cold turkey only add to the hysteria that these are horrible drugs and have no value or benefit whatsoever."
19610,These drugs have their place.
19611,I've seen them work to great success in my own family and friends.
19612,And I've seen people continue to suffer because they believed the stuff they read on the Internet that said their drug was horrible.
19613,"Which road you choose, which information you choose to believe is between you and your doctors."
19614,"Trust them, get second opinions if you don't trust yours, read peer-reviewed articles, do whatever it takes to make an informed decision."
19615,"Don't go by my anecdotal information, find out for yourself."
19616,And certainly don't believe the drug-bashing hype.
19617,You may be cheating yourself out of a better life.
19618,DISCLAIMER:  Always check with your doctor.
19619,I can't say this enough.
19620,Your mileage may vary.
19621,Void where prohibited by law.
19622,No purchase necessary.
19623,Dramatization.
19624,Actual results may vary.
19625,"May cause infertility, bowel obstructions, visual disturbances, dry mouth, restless penis syndrome, fear of farm animals and in rare cases, a complete inability to understand humor or to think critically."
19626,"And no, I don't work for the drug industry."
19627,I create websites for a living.
19628,"I am a socialist who believes the profiting off of the sick is disgusting, vile and beneath any civilized society."
19629,Capitalism mostly sucks.
19630,Sometimes.
19631,A lot.
19632,Not always.
19633,But a lot.
19634,Get the money out of congress and campaigning  and it solves these problems.
19635,But I digress.
19636,I'm here to see if anyone can relate some experience to taking anti-anxiety meds to combat such an issue.
19637,"I'm not even doubting that the meds work, but I'm curious as to *how* they work on someone like me."
19638,"She said their policy was not to provide any such meds and that it was all about ""mind over matter""."
19639,I've tried meds that made me want to commit suicide and so on.
19640,I don't know how many times I've heard this in my life.
19641,"""You're just having a panic attack, you'll be okay""

""Panic disorder is very treatable"" 

""You're going to get better""

Man, fuck that."
19642,I've been having panic attacks since I was 16 years old.
19643,I'm turning 25 this year.
19644,I've tried a lot of medications.
19645,I've seen therapists.
19646,I've altered my diet.
19647,I've tried yoga.
19648,Everything is a miracle cure apparently.
19649,"I'm envious of you people who have found reprieve in something, but the truth for me is I don't think I'll ever get better from this."
19650,"Honestly, I'm frustrated by the optimism, and by saying this I'm sure someone will think I haven't tried."
19651,Fuck you.
19652,I have tried.
19653,I try every day.
19654,I'm trying.
19655,"I've asked for help since the beginning of this mess, I'm constantly looking for help."
19656,"Lets cut the bullshit about how looking for help is a step to getting better, for some of us it's a fucking circle."
19657,"An endless loop of medication, therapy, and anxiety that just sends back to where we were before, sometimes worse off."
19658,Anxiety is treatable.
19659,"Sure, there are ways to make it *less* bad, but the truth is, there is no cure."
19660,That is reality.
19661,That is the truth.
19662,There's no cure.
19663,"And somedays are worse than others, but there are days like today that remind me I'm stuck with this for life."
19664,I'm damaged fucking goods.
19665,"How can I be with someone, if I can't even be with myself?"
19666,How will anyone be able to accept me for me?
19667,"I've got dreams, and hopes that I see pass by me as the years go by."
19668,"I've loved and I've lost, and I'm tired of living this fucking life with a handicap."
19669,"I know things could be much worse, I know, I know, *I know."
19670,"* and by writing out this huge thing I just feel like I'm whining, but I'm just so frustrated."
19671,"I just kind of needed to get this out, and for someone to read it."
19672,There is no hope for me I don't think.
19673,"I'm not a suicide risk, so I hope you don't think that."
19674,"The truth is, despite all my pain, I'm too scared of a death to be."
19675,"No I'll sit here and wait till it's my turn to go, I just wish it wasn't so lonely."
19676,I just wish I could be the person I want to be.
19677,This time around I want to try to help myself a bit more by going on anxiety medication (ONLY if I get accepted to the college I applied to.)
19678,What type of doctor do I see for this type of medication?
19679,"I regularly meditate but I'd love to hear some helpful breathing exercises and/or any other self help tips, thank you in advance!&lt;3  

EDIT: forgot to mention, I don't take medication and I quit therapy a few months ago for other reasons."
19680,Since it was requested and I'm currently seeing gains from what I've been practicing.
19681,Feel free to add anything you feel helps YOU as well as any scientific stuff you have.
19682,"**Disclaimer** 

Anxiety comes in all shapes, sizes."
19683,"This post is not to tell you why, diagnose or provide an alternative to therapy or medicines."
19684,"This cannot answer the ""Why am I this way"" that plagues so many."
19685,This post is to make a collection of a multitude of methods that work for the individuals who post with their Anxiety in hopes of providing a hand to those who may need it.
19686,"**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy**

From my knowledge this fairly new to field of Western Psychology."
19687,Its main focus is Mindfulness.
19688,"Becoming aware of yourself,  feelings and thoughts."
19689,&gt;*Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) focuses in particular on the ways clients understand and perpetuate their difficulties through language.
19690,"Providing a comprehensive overview of the approach and detailed guidelines for practice, this book shows how interventions based on metaphor, paradox, and experiential exercises can enable clients to break free of language traps, overcome behavioral problems, and enhance general life satisfaction*
[Source](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1999-04037-000)

&gt;*The core conception of ACT is that psychological suffering is usually caused by experiential avoidance, cognitive entanglement, and resulting psychological rigidity that leads to a failure to take needed behavioral steps in accord with core values."
19691,"As a simple way to summarize the model, ACT views the core of many problems to be due to the concepts represented in the acronym*, **FEAR**:

**F**usion with your thoughts

**E**valuation of experience

**A**voidance of your experience

**R**eason-giving for your behavior

And the healthy alternative is to **ACT**:

**A**ccept your reactions and be present

**C**hoose a valued direction

**T**ake action
[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy)

**Mindfulness and ACT**

&gt;Being present means being in direct contact with the present moment, rather than drifting off into automatic pilot, and getting in touch with the observing self, the part that is aware of, but separate from, the thinking self."
19692,"Mindfulness techniques are taught to experience the observing self firsthand, whether they bring awareness to each of the five senses, thoughts, or emotions."
19693,"Opening up is the ability to detach from thoughts (defusion) and accepting, or making space for and dropping the struggle with painful feelings, urges, sensations, etc."
19694,Acceptance is the ability to allow what is to be as it is instead of fighting or avoiding it.
19695,"If someone is thinking, “I’m a terrible person,” they might be instructed to say, “I am having the thought that I’m a terrible person.” This effectively separates the person from the cognition, thereby stripping it of its negative charge."
19696,"When someone is experiencing painful emotions, like anxiety for example, they might be instructed to open up, breath into, or make space for the physical experience of anxiety and allow it to remain there, just as it is, without exacerbating or minimizing it."
19697,"[Source](http://www.goodtherapy.org/acceptance_commitment_therapy.html#Mindfulness and ACT)

This is the book I'm using right now:

[ACT Made Simple by Russ Harris](http://www.amazon.com/ACT-Made-Simple-Easy-To-Read-Acceptance/dp/1572247053/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382941250&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ACT+made+simple)

**OK** Stop for a min

Take a deep breath."
19698,In through your nose.
19699,"Notice how your breath passes through your nose....how it cools the back of your throat as it fills up your lungs....Don't think anything of it, if you are, that's ok. Just gently bring your attention back to your breath."
19700,"How your body expands from the inside out...Now, notice how your clothes feel against your skin...how your shirt feels on your shoulder...take another slow...deep breath and close your eyes and breath a couple more before coming back to this...

**I know you just read those words."
19701,Now go back and take a couple mins to really try it.
19702,":)**


That's mindfulness."
19703,"It takes practice, but It really has helped me get enough breaks in the storm to start moving forward against the wind."
19704,I know that was a lot of info.
19705,"Scan it as you can, maybe come back a couple times."
19706,"**Meditation**

This is the single best thing I do for myself."
19707,"(Again, ill update later)."
19708,Simple start.
19709,Mindfulness is kind of like Training wheels for Meditation for me.
19710,"It sometimes seems like my mind doesn't want to meditate because it's terrified of being still, but once I just **Start** the resistance fades and it's wonderful, then it comes back, then it's wonderful."
19711,"[Good Article on Swiss Study](http://sciencenordic.com/mindfulness-helps-against-anxiety-and-depression) 

I've noticed a slot of the science I find behind Meditation has been labeled *Mindfulness*."
19712,"Not sure why, but there are a lot of similarities."
19713,Think of Meditation as a Good nights sleep.
19714,"You dream, your body re cooperates and your mind rests to get you ready for the next day."
19715,"As you go through your day, if you start to feel tired you might need a power nap to bring yourself back up."
19716,That could be Mindfulness.
19717,"Meditation practice prepares you for the day, and throughout it if Anxiety starts to tap you on the shoulder, you use a mindfulness exercise to quit your mind again and get back to what you were doing."
19718,"[THIS is a GREAT post from another user about getting started and it's benefits for them](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1msb30/how_i_learned_to_harness_meditation_as_a_tool_to/)

It's referenced in the post think, but [THIS VIDEO](http://youtu.be/7irn1Ga-Gyc) has been EXTREMELY helpful in getting me started."
19719,I start is when I lay down to go to sleep and just follow the speaker until I fall asleep.

Go walk for 20min."
19722,"Make a playlist,  get a podcast and just go."
19723,Your anxiety will be there whether you are walking or doing nothing.
19724,The biology behind it is great.
19725,"**Goals**

Setting goals and accomplishing them is a great thing."
19726,It doesn't have to be anything BIG at all.
19727,This is for you and no one else.
19728,Pick any 1 thing you feel your anxiety has prevented from doing that you *want* to.
19729,"Start small, and do something, Maybe it's visiting a new subreddit, trying one of things above, or even just responding this this post!"
19730,You can do it!
19731,"And even if you don't, Thats ok too."

19735,Sound familiar to anyone?
19736,What would you say if a close friend that you love said that to you?
19737,What would you tell them?

19740,**Updated 10/28: added a bunch.
19741,Let me know if there's anything else or edits to make**
19742,I've had anxiety for quite some time now.
19743,"I've tried going to therapists but I never really committed to going, and I just sort of ended up giving up on them."
19744,"But now it seems my anxiety and social phobia is worse than ever, and I'm really not sure what to do."
19745,"In the past, my social anxiety was manageable, but now it seems that any type of social gathering causes intense anxiety for me."
19746,"Also, I really have started to dread conversation and meeting new people."
19747,"In fact, I've grown to detest it, actually, because of the painful feelings that it gives me."
19748,"I'm actually quite worried about this, because if I have no desire to branch out socially, I'm afraid it won't be very good for me in the long run."
19749,I'm not sure what to do.
19750,"I feel comfortable only in very particular social situations, and it's really limiting my life."
19751,"I was once almost put on anxiety medications, but that sort of fell through partly because of my reluctance to take medication."
19752,But now it seems like I really need it.
19753,"I don't know why but I feel like I can't talk to anyone I know about these things, not even my family."
19754,"So all of this is basically a secret struggle that I have, and I tell no one of this."
19755,It's not healthy and it's really eating me up inside.
19756,"At this point I don't even really know my options, and sometimes I wonder if I'll ever see myself out of this and finally be happy."
19757,Is this possible?
19758,Can therapy and/or medication really help me out of the horrible state I am in now?
19759,"I'm currently taking 10mg of Citalopram a day and 7.5mg of Buspirone as an ""emergency"" medication."
19760,"Part of it's the fear of retching or throwing up, and part of it's just that the meds kill my appetite."
19761,Today I've decided to drop the meds.
19762,I know it's normal to have to try more than one medication.
19763,"I think that, despite thinking of myself as pretty savvy, I was desperate and looking for a magic cure to make everything go away, when this is something I could probably work through without meds."
19764,"I'm relatively convinced the meds are causing the attacks, because again, I've *never* been this anxious in my entire life."
19765,"I'm in therapy and on medication, but when I'm stuck at school for long periods of time alone, I wig out, and am tempted to snoop on my husband's online profiles."
19766,"I've doped myself up with medication before, but I hate being a zombie."
19767,"Today I got up and eventually made food, but pretty much everything that comes out of the mouths of my family members is making the irritability and anxiety worse, and I don't have any anti-anxiety medicine as my pharmacy needs to have the prescription renewed by my doctor first, and now I am in a different state all-together."
19768,How does everyone else deal without the aid of medicine?
19769,"So anyway, doc Rxed me 20mg Paxil a night (long story, has to do with my thyroid meds and a disagreement we're having over how to treat my hyperthyroidism)."
19770,"Recently, I've been getting to sleep, but having these oddly vivid dreams and waking up in a panic I guess, and maybe it is my thyroid changing (or the meds themselves interacting with my other meds, which is Xanax mostly), but doc thought the Paxil would help that and maybe my anxiety overall."
19771,"We both think I might benefit from adding a second medication into the mix, possibly a short acting Xanax."
19772,What about adding a second medication?
19773,"I want to hear success stories about medication, or therapy.. Because I need a kick in the ass to get me to commit to asking for help."
19774,It just hurts to see someone I really care about very obviously struggling and very obviously afraid of weaning off of medication.
19775,"She has recently (within the last year and a half) got medication for her disorders though, and I've seen a dramatic impact."
19776,"With the money generated from selling off all the things I don't really need, and the money saved from my last paycheck (I had to quit the job because the stress was giving me panic attacks every time I was at work), it is enough to pay for many appointments to mental health doctors and medication for 3-4 months, without insurance."
19777,"I'm hoping that after the first few months of medication I will feel good enough to get a new job, and continue to fund my meds for much more time."
19778,"I've sought help and thank goodness, I'm finally receiving help from a therapist and receiving medication (Mirtazapine, 15mg)."
19779,The side effects scare me and so does the thought of being dependent on a medication.
19780,Besides taking medication I see a counselor once or twice a month and work on mindfulness and such.
19781,My partner suffers from anxiety disorder and has been a guine pig for so many antideppressant/anxiety medications and their side effects for the past 20 years and.
19782,The highest dose of Paxil just stopped working for her due to adding Welbutrin to the mix.
19783,After two weeks she stopped taking the Welbutrin and weened herself down to 10mg of Paxil.
19784,She finally got in to a therapist who perscribed her Celexa and 10mg klonopin to take with her valium(shes taking highest dose perscribable).
19785,It seems to have made a difference in just the last 24 hours.
19786,"Through all of this happening to her, I've been doing my best to be supportive and remind her that what she is going through, is not her(shes a great person) but a chemical imbalance in her brain."
19787,"We've gone through the emotional roller coaster everywhere from panic attacks, nervous breakdowns, separation anxiety, feeling bad for me having to deal with it, beating herself up, crying fits, insomnia, abusing her meds, not being able to leave the house, hopelessness and wanting to die, ect..."
19788,"It's a slow process for her to get better and I need to be patient and supportive through the stages but I've been working my ass off, taking care of my disabled 6 year old daughter, and trying to keep my own sanity through this."
19789,Any helpful tips?
19790,"I'm also sick, but am sick too from the side effects of missing meds."
19791,My panic attacks are going crazy from missing my meds and are only fueled because I feel ill.
19792,Could the medicine change be doing anything?
19793,I've always wanted to be on meds.
19794,I have limited amounts of medication and I'd rather not rely on it when I should be able to find a way to wake up when I need to without it triggering an attack.
19795,I've been sleeping next to my mother for about a month and a half because she wants to watch over me as I sleep to see if she notices anything weird (because of my anxiety).
19796,She's been telling me for the past month and a half that I jump/jolt/twitch a lot in my sleep.
19797,And that I move around a lot.
19798,Last night she had to get up and get me a glass of milk because she thought I couldn't get to sleep.
19799,"She told me this morning that she had asked me if I wanted the milk and I responded with a ""yes""."
19800,"The thing is, I don't recall this."
19801,I was asleep through it.
19802,"The point is, I feel as though I'm sleeping without really *sleeping*."
19803,I don't know if this makes any sense.
19804,"My mind sleeps, but my body doesn't."
19805,Could this be linked to my anxiety?
19806,Feel free to ask any questions as to what medications I take and what my sleeping routine is.
19807,I just really want to know what's wrong with me.
19808,I learned this when I was first seeking treatment.
19809,"The first several medications I tried either didn't seem to help, or (in one case) actually created even worse symptoms."
19810,"I thought that maybe being medicated just wasn't right for me, and that there was nothing that could help me."
19811,"I was off my meds for a while after getting discouraged, going through what seemed like a hundred options that didn't work, and then finally decided to try again this past September, and it's been working so well for me I can't believe it!"
19812,"Just remember that because a particular medication didn't work for someone you know doesn't mean it won't work for you, and just because the first (or second, or third...) meds you try don't work for you, doesn't mean there isn't one that will!"
19813,Everybody's brain chemistry is different :)
19814,"I know I should speak to a therapist or take meds, but the idea of doing either makes me worry because I feel like it would make it official that I have a real issue and not that this is just a passing feeling."
19815,Maybe I should just get some kind of medication?
19816,"I'm a 21 year old male and I can't get legal medication until I am out from under my parents, if I even need it."
19817,"So, a few months after weaning off of my medication, my anxiety has peaked again, and now I'm getting stress hives."
19818,"While I get the rest of it sorted out and likely go back on medication, does anyone have good ideas on how to treat these nasty itchy hives so that they don't stress me out more?"
19819,"I've tried meditation, I take medication, I drink sleepy teas."
19820,"Ive read this is a very effective medicine, and I know I should, but Im afraid of the side effects or having an allergic reaction."
19821,I'd say the climax was a massive breakdown in 2010 that very nearly landed me in a psych hospital and finally convinced me to give medication a try.
19822,"I've stuck with the medication, although I'm not always happy about it."
19823,"I have switched my medication from Prozac to Zoloft, and because it works a thousand times better for me, I've been able to preform in this job and face my fears."
19824,"My medicine has a big fat ""DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL WHILE TAKING THIS MEDICATION"" sticker on the side of the bottle."
19825,I stopped my medication and was accepted.
19826,"I'm now back home and in university, I haven't been on medication in over 5 years but its something I've thought about possibly trying again."
19827,However I want to apply to the police force and I'm horrified of the possibility of being turned down due to being on medication.
19828,"This is something that has been bothering me for awhile, I've come this long without medication and I can function and get by but I often wonder how things could be different with medication."
19829,"): 

Is it common to get more anxiety and panic when upping the dosage, even though the medication has been working fine until 3 weeks ago?"
19830,I don't want medication.
19831,I use my meds as prescribed.
19832,I've started taking a low dose of medication for anxiety and am waiting to see if I get any results.
19833,"I dont have my meds, klonapin, and cant really afford to...I was super anxious and jabbery, I also ran away to the bathroom in the middle of my shift to quietly and isolatedly freak out by myself."
19834,"I don't plan on kids just yet, but maybe in a year or two-three and i take anxiety medication (seroxat, also known as paxil) for an anxiety disorder."
19835,I've had to take 3-4x the amount of emergency meds as I have in the past few months.
19836,They gave me Apo Alpraz ( anxiolitic medication ) but when I was doing panic attack in class I could NEVER NEVER come back in because I was thinking that people may think i'm weird.
19837,But I never gave up and threw my medication away and day by day tried to understand what made me felt this bad and focused on it.
19838,Did you take medication?
19839,"To start, I've always been against medication."
19840,"I've always felt if I take a medication that alters my brain, I'm giving into someone, something."
19841,I used to have nightmares of being drugged with a sleeping medication and seeing my family laughing with relief that they were in my control.
19842,"Every time I'd take a Nighttime cold medicine or something that would make me sleepy, I would get incredibly agitated."
19843,"Ive never told my therapist about this, but she has mentioned something about me possibly having repressed memories, and I'm wondering if this has something to do with my fear of meds."
19844,"I have the same story as a lot of you, I'm sure."
19845,"I was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder last year, and after seeking professional help, it seemed we found the right combination of medications (Zoloft and Klonopin)."
19846,"Things seemed ok for a while, but the last two weeks have been hellish."
19847,"My job is nothing but constant pressure, and I am always on call."
19848,"I get calls at 2 in the morning, on the weekends, whenever."
19849,Emails all day every day.
19850,"We are constantly told to do a better job, but they keep cutting my staff's hours and supply budgets."
19851,"I am a manger overseeing 5 buildings, 5 other managers, and about 300 employees."
19852,"I have to do everything- payroll, ordering, HR, recruiting, training...everything."
19853,"I just never feel like I am off from work, and I am always worried about the buildings and getting that next call that something's fucked up."
19854,I am starting to miss work now (my bosses don't know that because I am basically left alone to run my area).
19855,I'm rambling- today was really bad.
19856,"Really, really bad."
19857,"I literally drove to a building at 1pm (my day is supposed to start at 7am), and couldn't bring myself to get out of the car."
19858,"Shaking, clammy, short of breath, throwing up, heart pounding, light headed..all of this becomes my daily routine."
19859,"Sometimes I get over it, then there are days like today where I didn't even go to work, and my heart is still pounding and I am short of breath."
19860,"I have to get out, but the thought of failing at a new job and not having health benefits for a while gives me even more anxiety."
19861,I am spiraling.
19862,I'm scared.
19863,"I wasn't supposed to see my psych for 3 weeks, but I made an appointment for tomorrow."
19864,"I am going to see if she can knock me out of work for a few days, and maybe get a therapist or something."
19865,"I haven't yet identified all the triggers, and though I'm on meds for both the anxiety and depression, I can have days where it's very, very hard to function."
19866,"Being on my own then was the right thing, and it helped me recover (along with upping my dose of antidepressants and getting some new anti-anxiety emergency meds for the really bad attacks)."
19867,I came off my anxiety/depression meds back in June and had been doing pretty well up until this past few weeks.
19868,"I started taking my meds again last night, but its not overnight."
19869,I took my anxiety medication that I have for when I get panicky.
19870,I was taking 50 MG of Zoloft but after the attack I self medicated back to 150 MG since my insurance has been cut off and I don't have a doctor to treat my medicine.
19871,"Calves, tights, lower and upper back, shoulders and my head feel so painful in the morning that sometimes I can't even move much in the first few minutes despite my pain and anxiety medication."
19872,My medication for anxiety is 3x2mg of Clonazepam daily +Propanolol and/or Pregabalin when needed.
19873,"Thanks, this is a great subbreddit, I decided to use a throwaway for this, also I'm not on any meds."
19874,"Anti-anxiety medicines include many adverse unwanted effects, but biofeedback for anxiety provides a natural and noninvasive treatment alternative."
19875,"Prior to deciding to begin a prescription medicine, you need to explore all of the available alternatives."
19876,"This will help you to determine the very best strategy for you, without taking on unnecessary risks along the way."
19877,"Biofeedback can offer effective relief for signs and symptoms of tension, while being gentle in your mind and body."
19878,**So How Exactly Does Biofeedback Work?
19879,"**  
  
Biofeedback functions by teaching patients to consider in nondestructive ways."
19880,"By teaching the individual how you can correctly react to their anxiety, biofeedback might help sufferers of anxiety to manage their signs and symptoms without medication."
19881,Biofeedback functions by giving the individual the opportunity to view their physiological reactions to worry.
19882,"Probably the most noticeable and customary signs and symptoms of tension that biofeedback therapy trains patients to acknowledge include:  
  
•	Cold Sticky Hands  
•	Alterations in Skin Temperature  
•	Shallow and/or Rapid Breathing  
•	Muscle Tension    
•	Elevated Heartbeat  
•	Alterations in Brainwaves  
  
**So How Exactly Does Biofeedback Affect Anxiety?"
19883,"**  
  
Numerous research has proven great enhancements in patients receiving treatment with biofeedback for anxiety."
19884,It's been proven to aid in dealing with both chronic and episodic panic attacks.
19885,"Doctors have seen that biofeedback helps patients with controlling an array of anxiety signs and symptoms for example racing heartbeat, breathlessness, and muscle tension."
19886,"The outcomes were sustained publish treatment, with lower self-reported anxiety maintained after 6 days."
19887,"Neurofeedback is really a revolutionary type of biofeedback that particularly concentrates on redirecting brainwaves that might be leading to anxiety, together with many other nerve conditions like chronic discomfort and stress attacks."
19888,"It may be particularly helpful for training the mind to consider in healthy normal designs, and steer clear of falling into designs that cause anxiety."
19889,Follow the linked text to understand more about neurofeedback.
19890,**Is Biofeedback Suitable for Me?
19891,"**  
  
With the information provided it can help to determine whether biofeedback for anxiety can help you together with your signs and symptoms."
19892,"The good thing is biofeedback has proven no unwanted effects, so giving it a go has fairly little downside."
19893,"Embracing dangerous anti-anxiety medicines isn't your main option, and you ought to consider natural remedies before putting yourself in danger."
19894,"There's not just one easy cure-all for the disorder, but you will find steps you can take to create coping with anxiety simpler."
19895,"Anxiety patients often discover that by exploring all of the treatments, they're able to better find relief for his or her signs and symptoms and their anxiety in a workable level."
19896,"Coping with anxiety does not have to feel impossible, be positive regarding your treatment and you may learn how to seize control of the disorder"
19897,"I have low self esteem with depression (on medication) and think I will just feel shitty about myself after seeing her, since I've lost a lot of hair and have made no career or big relationship moves since."
19898,"Hi, I just had a terrifying experience and am not sure what happened or why it happened."
19899,"A little background info: I'm a guy in my early 20s and I would say I have mild depression, social anxiety and probably strong loneliness issues."
19900,"I say mild because I constantly feel ""bummed out"" but wouldn't say it's affecting my life as much as someone with clinical depression."
19901,"I am not on any medications, do not drink alcohol or caffeine, do not smoke and do not take drugs."
19902,Okay so over the last 24 hours I began getting some chest pains and feeling very depressed.
19903,"Nothing traumatic or extra stressful has happened recently but for some reason I felt very, very sad, nervous and later on started getting shakes."
19904,I felt a knot in my stomach and really weird like I was going insane or losing control of my mind and started having some suicidal thoughts.
19905,Then I noticed my heart rate was increasing and increasing until it got insanely fast and I thought I was having a heart attack.
19906,I then couldn't breathe and couldn't stand and collapsed before I could call 911.
19907,I thought I was dying.
19908,This intense part last about 5 minutes but then my heart rate started slowing down (still fast but not insane levels) and I felt a little calmer but still freaked out.
19909,I went to the ER and they said my heart is okay and it's nothing a heart attack and the doctor said he thinks it might have been a panic attack.
19910,What do you guys think?
19911,"Have you experienced something similar, is this a panic attack or nervous breakdown or something?"
19912,Also why do you think this happened should I see a psychologist.
19913,"As of now I feel okay for the most part but still anxious and ""just not right""."
19914,Thanks for reading.
19915,"It is probably from my medicine, lexapro."
19916,"I have been battling anxiety and worry most all my life but in the last 4-5 years it has been much worse, to the point of interfering with my life."
19917,"A few years ago, several events happened in my life and my family and I began to experience panic attacks where I felt like I couldn't breathe."
19918,I didn't know what a panic attack was because I had never seen or experienced one before so I thought I was having asthma attacks which prompted me to see my doctor.
19919,After asking a few questions she told me that I had been experiencing panic attacks and prescribed an inhaler and Prozac.
19920,"A little backstory: my dad has generalized and social anxiety and my biological mother had depression, anxiety, postpartum depression after my birth and actually overdosed on a cocktail of pills (mixed with alcohol) when I was 5 years old."
19921,So I told my doctor that I was apprehensive  about taking any pill.
19922,"For one, I felt like since my mom was addicted to pills, I had a better chance of being addicted too."
19923,"And for two, I was scared of having to take them for the rest of my life and never being able to come off without withdrawals."
19924,My doctor simply told me that she understood my concerns and if I changed my mind or felt worse to call her.
19925,The inhaler helped a lot which I attribute much of that to be mind over matter.
19926,Fast forward to approximately a year ago...under the advisement of many people/friends I started smoking weed in an effort to relieve some anxiety.
19927,I only smoke at night at my home; never have I smoked during the day or before going somewhere.
19928,This has relieved some of my anxiety and obviously I like it and I feel like its great.
19929,"But lately, over the last 10 months or so, my anxiety feels like its back with a vengeance."
19930,"It has never been so overwhelming, even when I first started having panic attacks."
19931,Sometimes I will just randomly cry at the very simplest of issues.
19932,I snap at people I love and care about.
19933,My attitude is sour at least 50% of the time.
19934,I just feel mentally and emotionally exhausted and at the end of my rope.
19935,"I still smoke regularly but lately, I have been considering asking my doctor to help me better understand my anxiety and for some kind of medicine that would help."
19936,What do you think given the situation with my mom?
19937,"Also, what medicines would you recommend I ask my doctor specifically about and what side-effect/withdrawals have you experienced with them?"
19938,"Sidebar: I rarely (like once a month) have an alcoholic drink and even rarer am I actually ""drunk""."
19939,I do take Sprintec daily (which is a birth control).
19940,I have switched my birth control a few times (in case the culprit of my anxiety is mostly lady-hormones) and Sprintec feels like the best I have tried so far.
19941,"Hi, I'm female, 21, and I have a therapist and a psychiatrist to handle my panic attacks, general anxiety, and mild depression."
19942,I take low doses of most of my medications because I seem to be very sensitive to them.
19943,"I was on Celexa 15mg for about a year and anxiety-wise, I felt great."
19944,"No panic attacks, stable mood."
19945,"However, I slept constantly, lost all motivation and lost my ability to orgasm."
19946,Lowering the dose cancelled out its effectiveness towards my anxiety problems.
19947,Boo.
19948,"I went off Celexa for a few months and afterwards tried Wellbutrin, which my psychiatrist said was good for sexual side effects, but might not be good for my anxiety."
19949,"Well, my sex drive went up the wall and my ability to stay awake and focus was amazing."
19950,"However, after a few weeks I started having horrible panic attacks, so I went off that completely."
19951,"Tried Prozac for a few weeks, didn't really help my anxiety at all."
19952,Now I've been back on Celexa for three months.
19953,Same deal.
19954,"I feel great mood-wise, but I'm constantly sleeping, unmotivated and can't orgasm."
19955,"Doctor gave me a little Adderall which is okay when I really need to wake up and focus, but it doesn't do anything for my sex drive and my mood crashes when it wears off."
19956,"When I try to bring up these issues with my psychiatrist, she doesn't have any real solutions for me except to try different medications."
19957,"She doesn't offer any explanations on which medications would be a good fit for me, trying to have a conversation with her about the difference between SSRIs and SSNIs is like pulling teeth."
19958,Does anyone have any experience with difficult psychiatrists or different types of medications for anxiety that might work for me?
19959,"I'd love to get a different psychiatrist, but it's not feasible at the moment."
19960,Thanks!
19961,I've had anxiety and depression since I was 16 (now 21) and it's only been in the last month that I've had any real relief.
19962,After finishing school in 2010 I decided to take a year off which turned into three.
19963,"After living a very isolated life for these years I noticed my anxiety had become much worse, especially in social situations."
19964,I've been prescribed nearly every medication available so I'd pretty much given up on the idea of ever being well again.
19965,"Well, I decided to see a new therapist who is great and he put me on Remeron (Mirtazapine)."
19966,I thought this drug was for depression but it has done absolute wonders for my anxiety.
19967,It's pretty insane how well this has worked for me.
19968,"If anyone deals with anxiety and depression I urge them to try it, especially if you've had no luck with other medications."
19969,In addition to this I feel clarity of thought coming back to me and am able to concentrate longer which has been a major issue for me.
19970,"I don't want to take strong medication, but I have not even started therapy or much of anything else."
19971,this medication does not reduce my anxiety.
19972,and when i finally see this person i'll have to start a new medication like lexapro or something (i've only ever taken ativan) and i dont know if that will work or how it will affect me when i finally get it.
19973,i've always been scared of taking medicine every day.
19974,feeling like i could have a panic attack at any time because i dont feel confidence in this weakass medication.
19975,"It's all in my body language, some of my personality quirks, and my failed attempts at passing off medication side effects as just being ill."
19976,Hello!
19977,I got this stuffed nose few days ago and it started to worry me so much that its hard for me to sit still.
19978,Connected with ocd it makes me walk around house thinking all the time.
19979,Its hard as Im afraid I will fail my exams because I cant sit in classes or at home and study... And im constantly thinking i wont be able to sit thorugh classes and the circle starts again.
19980,Its like I had this giant rush of adrenaline or sth and it lasts for days.
19981,Any of you has this?
19982,What do you do?
19983,Any medications I can buy in drug store?
19984,I dont take any ssri etc because they didnt help me/got my anxiety worse.
19985,Im even envious when people are have panic attacks that made them feel only depressed...
19986,"I've been taking my prescribed anxiety medication (it's as-needed, I normally never take it but I brought it with because I knew this would happen...) but sometimes that doesn't totally cut it."
19987,Is this normal while on anxiety meds?
19988,**TL;DR: How do you know when/if anxiety meds stop working?
19989,Recently my meds haven't been working as well as they were and I've been feeling really anxious.
19990,He said I had general anxiety and to take a medication for a while and it should go away.
19991,"I really am trying to make things work, and I took a medication vacation to avoid the sexual side effects of Lexapro as we were beginning our relationship."
19992,"These past couple of days I have started wrapping up this phase of my life, I have made amends with the women in question with a clean slate after I apologised for the way I acted, I will start to be even more social, get involved a lot more, continue volunteering, come out of my shell a lot more (I have gradually been doing it since I started the meds), be more confident, stop over-thinking, continue losing weight and take control of my life."
19993,So I want to use alternative medicine instead.
19994,"I have noticed that the anxiety gets a lot better when I take some of my leftover hyperthyroid meds, such as atenolol or trazodone."
19995,"Last week I started meds, (Zoloft, 25 mg twice a day) and the first night I woke up at 3:30 with a clenched jaw and felt horrible until it was time for work."
19996,"Yesterday my doc finally got back to me and told me to get off the meds, said I had a very extreme reaction."
19997,"I know it might not be out of my system yet, but honestly this isn't much worse than where my momentum was carrying me before I started meds."
19998,"Currently, I have a few things I'm trying: 1) Pursuing different meds, 2) continuing counseling with my counselor, 3) Seeing a general physician (haven't had a checkup in years), 4) Seeking group therapy, 5) Maybe exercising (which has always been hard for me), 6) trying to do CBT and recognizing and fighting automatic thoughts."
19999,I found some info online about two meds that have shown promise for treating bruxisum - clonazepam and buspiron.
20000,As the title says im looking for some over the counter anxiety medications that I can try to help me get through my next speech in public speaking.
20001,Thanks.
20002,I have both anxiety and depression.
20003,"In the past I have tried Cipralex (which is Lexapro in the USA) but it made me gain 30 pounds AND I was exhausted all the time, sleeping about 16 hours a day."
20004,I went off the medication and my anxiety/depression was manageable.
20005,"I was only stuck with the extra weight, which took a huge toll on my self-esteem."
20006,Now I am at a very bad place in life.
20007,"I have failed out of school, got fired and I am only gaining more weight due to emotional eating."
20008,"I can't sleep, and I feel myself slowly falling back into the terrible place I was at the first time I needed the medication."
20009,"My social life, family life and work life is all slowly slipping away from me because of this...


My question is: What can I do?"
20010,"I don't necessarily want to be on medication, but I don't see another option."
20011,I am already seeing a therapist.
20012,"What medications have worked for you, and what side effects did you encounter?"
20013,Please tell me what medication you are on that is not doing either of those things.
20014,"Since he is Army, the idea of medication isn't even an option."
20015,I have been having anxiety problems since the beginning of summertime.
20016,One of the worst things about it is that I get easily exhausted if I do cardio types of exercise.
20017,It is much worse in hot weather.
20018,"When it first started I went to the doctor and had a lot of tests done, and it doesn't seem to be any other health problem."
20019,Sometimes I feel like I could faint if I don't stop and rest.
20020,Can someone explain what chemical is causing this or what exactly I am feeling when this happens?
20021,Also I don't take any medications so it isn't a side effect of any drugs.
20022,Thanks.
20023,I don't want to rush getting off the medication.
20024,"At the end of the day, I guess I'm a little nervous about the final step and I'd like some reassurance that it'll all be okay to get off my meds!"
20025,"Well, here goes nothing."
20026,"I'll try to keep it short, 
20F, used to be really depressed as a kid but definitely got better."
20027,"Been in a really healthy place, workout 5x per week and eat a healthy diet."
20028,"Low caffeine intake, no medications."
20029,"Never had horrible anxiety but used to check the locks in my house frequently growing up before going to bed ( 2x per night, never considered it to be OCD or anything though) 

Smoked a little pot over the last two years, smoked a bowl, went to bed."
20030,A noise woke me up in the middle of the night (boyfriend closed the bedroom door) and I went into full on freak mode.
20031,"My heart started pounding, thought I was going crazy, gonna have a heart attack or something, shaking, general freaking out."
20032,Now every time I'm around weed I have to try to fight to control my anxiety and have actually stopped smoking all together which sucks big time.
20033,Second issue - I feel the need to check things constantly.
20034,"Examples: I put my wallet in my bag, walk 10 feet, must stop and check to see if I put my wallet in my bag/that it hasn't fallen out/that I haven't left it anywhere."
20035,A few nights ago I left my wallet in the car and woke up in the middle of the night in a panic wondering where I put it.
20036,Walked out to my car at 3:00AM in the snow because I HAD to know that it was still in there because I could not sleep.
20037,Same goes for triple checking my phone/keys/rings ect are still in my pockets/on my hands.
20038,"This is really, really, REALLY annoying and I want to stop panicking every time I start wondering where I've put my wallet/keys ect."
20039,What can I do?
20040,I don't really feel like seeing a therapist because quite frankly I'm in university and work a lot and I don't really have the time or the finances to cover it.
20041,"EDIT: Also get some crazy tingling in different sides of my head fairly frequently, especially in my forehead."
20042,I've heard this is a symptom of anxiety.
20043,Is this true?
20044,"tldr: Panic attack after smoking pot,  consistent anxiety over checking to make sure where I put my wallet/keys/ cell phone/rings etc."
20045,even though I KNOW where they are.
20046,What gives?
20047,"""Don't take meds, they turn you into a different person!"""
20048,I'm on meds.
20049,What to do when the medicine don't help?
20050,"I'm worried they will run out of meds to recommend :(

Edit: I live in the UK."
20051,"I have never told him that I have anxiety problems, though I did once tell him I was having adverse reactions to a medication (and gave no further details)."
20052,"Hi everyone, first time poster here."
20053,Recently got health insurance again and finally was able to get in to see a Doctor about my constant Anxiety.
20054,Basically what happens with me is my mind always defaults to the worst possible scenario and I have resulting panic attacks from it (and the panic attacks make me feel like I can't breath which results in more panic from being overly aware of my body functions).
20055,"For example, say I leave the house to go to the store and I see someone walking down the street my very first thought is ""That guy saw me leave and is probably going to break in and steal all my stuff"" or if I'm walking somewhere at night and see someone else walking I instantly think they are going to kill me, or if I can't get a hold of my SO for any reason I instantly think she got into some kind of accident or died."
20056,"It's horrible and I cannot control the thoughts, idk if it's anxiety causing the thoughts or the other way around or what exactly is wrong."
20057,"Anyway, it's negatively affecting my life."
20058,"I have absolutely no interest in the ""everyday"" tasks in life such as cleaning, cooking, paying bills, etc."
20059,"I just physically can't do mundane things and instead try to ""escape"" the world with video games and spend as much time in roleplaying games as possible."
20060,"I don't even like to leave my house for fear of everything that might happen that could result in me dying, or m building burning down or other horrible things."
20061,"Well, my Doctor initially made me a perscription for Effexor but I actually stopped taking it because after only the first couple days I had horrible, horrible side effects of nausea, blurry vision and weird memory issues, like I would stop talking mid sentence."
20062,I go back to see the Doctor in a few weeks and I'm curious what I should tell/ask.
20063,I'm not sure about other possible medications.
20064,I'm not too big on medications to begin with and have anxiety even about taking medication.
20065,I tend to prefer natural remedies but everything I've tried hasn't worked and the negative thoughts still control my life.
20066,So to wrap up (I guess you could call this portion the TL;DR) is there a specific medication I should ask my doc about?
20067,I want those horrible thoughts (and the resulting constant panic attacks) to go away but at the same time I still want to be myself.
20068,"I read about all the SSRIs and how they change people and have negative sexual side effects, etc and I don't want any of that."
20069,"I don't want to feel like a zombie, or be emotionless or even be ""calmer"" I still want to be me just....not defaulting to the most horrible outcome that could happen."
20070,"It'd be nice to be able to for example be in a car where I'm not driving, or on a bus or just go to the store without having to have constant escape and emergency plans because I'm constantly thinking something is going to go horribly wrong and I'm going to need to escape."
20071,"I was thinking about Zoloft, I've read many positive experiences about it but again I'm not sure...most of these meds seem to have more negative effects than positive."
20072,"I have to be honest, I would rather continue to live with this anxiety than become a different person from medication."
20073,Any suggestions?
20074,"*edit* Also, anything that I can ask about that might be able to help with not being able to go to places where I have no escape from would be helpful."
20075,"Like right now I just simply *can't* go on an elevator, or let someone else drive a car with me in it, etc without having a really bad panic attack."
20076,It's like I have to be 100% in control of every situation and need an escape or I physically can't do it.
20077,Yesterday I didn't take my ADHD meds.. so I think I just wasn't completely in tune with myself and accidently drank too much.
20078,I didn't take my ADHD meds again today either.
20079,"I'm not big into medication and so if there's a way I don't have to take it, I'm down with it, and exercise is making it so easy to cope without meds."
20080,"Hi guys, I don't know where else to look for advice."
20081,"My boyfriend (we live together for about 4 years), has been dealing with depression/add since forever, but always was a cycle, until now, it's been like 4 months since he left his job (not quitting, he just didn't went to work anymore) and he's been in therapy with psychiatrist the same amount of time."
20082,"He prescribed him escitalopram, methylphenidate, clonazepam and quietapine."
20083,"But I can't see any changes, all he does is play dota and sleep."
20084,"I don't see any of the medications is really working, or am I being too impatient?"
20085,"I went to see his doctor and he gave me clonazepam, because at this point I have anxiety attacks, and I'm afraid most of the time because I don't know how to handle this, I don't know how he will react to anything I say, most of the time he responds aggressively... Btw his family lives far from here and they really don't understand this problem, they don't get it and I'm tired of making them understand, they just don't."
20086,"Also, his credit cards are over limit, my job doesn't cover all the bills and I'm studying at night, I also do all the chores, such as cooking, cleaning, everything because he is not willing to do anything asides from taking his pills."
20087,"I've been there, I dealed with depression since I was 11, (now I'm 28) but I always wanted to be better, sometimes I was so deep down the hole that I wanted to die but I made it and I'm better now, I really want to help and show him that there are ways out, but he is completely unmotivated."
20088,What can I do?
20089,"=(

UPDATE."
20090,He found me crying and he got upset and kicked me out of the house.
20091,So I'm at my mom's now... sad and worried.
20092,I have to see the doctor tomorrow and I may go back on my Lexapro meds for anxiety/depression.
20093,"So I saw a doctor, got some medication and started meditating and looking into CBT."
20094,"Had to pick up medication today, pharmacist sassed me when he said he wouldn't here my voice and I had to speak up."
20095,"Took medication late today, stressed me out."
20096,"So far though, this medicine seems to be doing the trick."
20097,This is my first ever medication and I'm going to get it filled after work but I'm just curious if anyone here's had any positive or even negative outcomes with it.
20098,"The medication has done wonders for my anxiety, making it possible for me to be social, look for jobs, travel on busses and in cars etc."
20099,"I can't come off the medication, or be on it."
20100,"The second doctor just put me on medication, which I was scared to take for fear of going even crazier."
20101,"I have GAD but I am not on any medication for it, just therapy."
20102,"So my question to you all is, has anyone taken medication before a test?"
20103,"I don't feel like any medication is helping, but I also don't believe my doctor."
20104,I am a 20 year old male who has never taken any type of medication outside of antibiotics when I am sick.
20105,"I'm currently on 150 mg of Zoloft to help treat depression, but I'm not happy with my dosage and I'm looking to lower it."
20106,Are there any other medications I should ask my psychiatrist about?
20107,I've been on meds for almost a year and the Xanax helps sometimes but nothing controls my brain.
20108,"I feel very embarrassed to be writing this, but these thoughts have been with me for almost 3 years now and i'm scared that they are getting worse."
20109,"I've shared bits and pieces with a couple friends, my mom, my therapist, but ive never spit them all out at once."
20110,"Im scared I would lose people if they knew, which is why I'm doing it anonymously here."
20111,I am a jewish white male in my mid-twenties.
20112,"Basically my obsessive thoughts revolve around hating myself for being white, hating myself for being a man, feeling like everyone hates me for this, and recently fear, anxiety, and anger triggered by anything that reminds me of these things."
20113,"I know that “white guilt” is a thing, but in my case it's become mental illness and is ruining my life."
20114,I think it's getting worse because it seems more and more things can set me off.
20115,About 3 years ago when it first started it was just things like articles online criticizing whites or men as a group.
20116,Now almost anything will send me on a tailspin ruminating and driving myself crazy for days.
20117,I feel like everyone is my enemy and everything triggers a “fight or flight” response.
20118,"For example, I'll see a picture of a black actor on a billboard- one I liked back when I was a healthy- and I tense up and a thought in my head goes “he hates you, noone likes your kind, they think you have it easy, noone cares about you, you hate yourself, you deserve no sympathy, you're not allowed to think the way you do.” I'll be playing a game and  just seeing a picture of a female character the same kind of shit will go off."
20119,It makes me feel pathetic.
20120,"I'm not schizophrenic, I know i'm being irrational and noone is out to get me."
20121,I know I'm just taking things way too personally and projecting my own self-hatred onto other people.
20122,But it doesn't change the obsessive thoughts.
20123,I feel like my world is getting smaller and smaller because of all the things I have to avoid.
20124,"I can't look at newspapers, all but a couple websites online, watch almost anything on TV because everything will set me off."
20125,I haven't dated in a long time because Im scared that girls see me as their “oppressor” and it makes me sick.
20126,I'm scared to ever have a daughter for the same reason.
20127,I'm scared all this negativity directed inward is starting to seep outward as well and I may be becoming bigoted too rather than just feeling persecuted.
20128,The worst part is I used to be the exact opposite of this.
20129,I grew up in a very diverse neighborhood where I was a white minority (maybe that has something to do with it?)
20130,and got along with kids from all over the world easily.
20131,I used to be into punk music which I can hardly listen to anymore because I feel like all the lyrics are judging me.
20132,I was into the “activist” scene in college and can't even stand to hear anything about it anymore.
20133,(maybe that has something to do with it too- whites and males are criticized a lot there).
20134,I used to love reading but somehow even “books” got associated in my head with “they're writing something bad about you” I'm constantly scanning my environment for “danger” which in my case is anything that will confirm my idea that im being attacked.
20135,I've read this type of behavior is a sign of paranoia.
20136,"I don't want sympathy, I just want to live my life normally without being ruled by fear."
20137,I'm scared i'll have to move out of the city I grew up in and loved to somewhere all-white just to have less anxiety.
20138,"I've fantasized about joining a skinhead group (as a jew, hah) not because I hate people that are different then me, but because at least skinheads don't seem ashamed of who they are."
20139,I've fantasized about killing myself and leaving a note saying “you taught me to hate myself.” Don't worry Im not going to because it would ruin my parents lives (i'm their only child) but I've thought to myself once they're dead then I can do it.
20140,"I'd prefer that people didn't assume I was a bad person or had everything easy because of my race and background, but I know I can't control what others think."
20141,So i'd be more than happy just to like myself and not be so at the mercy of my environment.
20142,Please don't just tell me I need medication or to see a therapist.
20143,I already am doing both (I'm on Seroquel XR and Cymbalta) but it's not enough.
20144,If you have any advice on other medications that might suit me better I'm all ears.
20145,"Or ways to stop the obsessive thoughts, or deal with triggers better, or just have more self-esteem."
20146,"Please don't debate politics with me, that's the last thing I want to do."
20147,"I don't care if I'm right or wrong in my perception of society, I just want to stop feeling so bad."
20148,I know I'm overly focused on myself and in the greater scheme of things I'm very blessed.
20149,I want to focus outward and on making the world better but these thoughts are debilitating me.
20150,"If you want more details of my symptoms, life, or anything just let me know."
20151,Ill try to provide as much as I can while staying anonymous.
20152,One thing that might be relevant is that my dad has a degenerative disease and been an invalid since I was 13.
20153,Since then my mom and I have been taking care of him rather than the other way around.
20154,So maybe not really having a father figure/male role-model growing up has something to do with all this?
20155,"Sorry this is so long, and thank you very much to anyone reading it."
20156,"Everything started to go well and I landed the job in october 2014, the job interview went great with the help of the anxiety medication and after a few days at work I decided to throw them out as an addiction to Benzodiazepines is way worse than anxiety, I moved out of my apartment to my grandfather as I hated the current place I lived and considered it a conduit for my anxiety and depression."
20157,My parents want me to get help but I'd rather not go on medication.
20158,"We were talking about getting me started on meds soon, but then my insurance dropped me (we're having a disagreement about my income-- they want me to go on Medicaid)."
20159,"So, a few people asked for an update on [my first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2xowhv/i_have_an_appointment_with_my_family_doctor/)."
20160,Here goes...
20161,"So, went to my family doctor and asked her about a referral -- she asked for what and I explained my issues."
20162,She wanted full details.
20163,"After being very attentive and sympathetic, writing down everything I said, she asked lots of questions about my moods and other things, and said there were lots of different options for someone like me."
20164,"She then asked what it was that I had in mind in regards to the sort of help I was looking for, whether I was hoping to look into counseling, medication, etc."
20165,"She explained there are a number of different possible medications, anti-depressants, and a ton of other things but that she thinks it would be best to hold that off as an option, but not a first move -- unless I felt my anxiety was so severe that I couldn't get through my day to day life anymore without something to help calm me down."
20166,"I explained that I was open to medications if necessary, but that it wasn't my first choice as I'd rather learn to deal with my issues around decision making, the future, fear of failure, etc."
20167,rather than just numb the anxiety.
20168,She agreed that was an excellent choice and wrote down a number of websites and resources for me to check out regarding CBT.
20169,"I also discussed how I don't have insurance and how I'd love to do some actual therapy, but I can't afford it."
20170,"She gave me a referral to a free mental health clinic -- unfortunately because this is a free government service, it is intended to be short term counseling rather than ongoing, indefinite support, but that it would be beneficial for whatever time I could have there."
20171,"She then told me that she'd like to see me again in a month to see how things are going and told me that if I feel like I need to explore medication, we can look at it at that time, or if things get worse before then to come in sooner if I need to."
20172,I then went over with my referral to the mental health clinic -- different building in the same parking lot.
20173,"They had me fill out some paperwork that had questions regarding what brought me there, etc."
20174,so I filled that out.
20175,"Based on that, they will assign me a specialist from the facility that best fits my needs and will be in touch next week to set up an appointment."
20176,"So, yeah... That's that!"
20177,"I'm nervous about this whole thing, but simultaneously relieved."
20178,I'm also worried that I'm hoping for too much in the short amount of time I have considering this is short term counseling.
20179,"Either way, I'm glad that I've made the first steps."
20180,I look forward to the day when my anxiety no longer clouds my mind and holds me back from making decisions and pursuing my dreams.
20181,Thank you to everyone who gave me information and offered their kind words.
20182,Its been greatly appreciated.
20183,My next appointment with my doctor is in the middle of April and I'm going to ask for medication again but the thought of that makes me feel so much more disappointing and hopeless.
20184,How did you guys broach the subject of medication for anxiety and deal with parents/family who have this mindset?
20185,Is there any way to reduce my anxiety without the use of medication?
20186,"Up until that point though I was resisting getting on medication, because I wasn't actually feeling depressed and honestly I didn't even feel all that anxious in the first place during all this."
20187,"Finally I gave in to her suggestions that I 1) get on medication, which is now a low dose of Lexapro, 2) continue seeing a therapist, and 3) attend a mindfulness meditation group."
20188,Klonopin is a seizure medication.
20189,"I am a 6'0"", 173 lb, 24 year old male."
20190,I have been dealing with chest discomfort/pain for about 3-4 years now and it has really taken a toll on me mentally.
20191,"I fear something is wrong with my heart and/or lungs, despite the tests that have been performed on me over the years."
20192,I fear dropping dead to the point that my career as a musician is suffering as I have been turning down bookings for over a year now due to that fear.
20193,"I experience stomach, arm, back, and neck discomfort from time to time as well."
20194,I had an echocardiogram and stress test in the winter of 2012 and again in the summer of 2013.
20195,I had an endoscopy and an abdominal ultrasound during the summer of 2013 as well.
20196,"I have also had a multitude of blood work, EKGs, and chest x-rays with my primary doctor, at Urgent Care, and at hospitals."
20197,Every test came back normal and healthy.
20198,"I've been dealing with anxiety and panic since since I was 15 years old, so almost 10 years now."
20199,I see a therapist from time to time and have been on and off a few medicines over the past decade.
20200,"I'm aware that anxiety and panic can cause chest pain, a well as other physical symptoms."
20201,I currently take Luvox.
20202,"Other than the Luvox, I take no other medications regularly."
20203,"I was a cigarette smoker for 3 years, recently quit for months, started up again briefly, and now quit for good."
20204,"I was a heavy marijuana smoker in high school and college and still smoke now, just to a lesser degree."
20205,"I drink alcohol occasionally, sometimes days in a row, but not an excessive amount where I'm black out drunk or anything."
20206,"Other than that, I use no other drugs."
20207,I try and watch what I eat.
20208,I end up having to eat pizza or fast food sometimes when I'm working.
20209,I practice yoga occasionally and lift free weights in my apartment.
20210,"I like to run, but I haven't ran in awhile."
20211,"However, the last time I did go for a run was a 5K in the fall and I completed it in a half hour without having to stop."
20212,Does anybody here have similar issues to mine and have any advice for me or would just like to share their personal stories with anxiety and health?
20213,Would anybody like to give me their opinion on my situation and my worry over my health?
20214,TLDR: Health anxiety has ruined over a year of my career as a musician.
20215,"Any advice to or personal stories of getting over/managing health anxiety, especially whilst performing in front of a crowd?"
20216,I have the meds I need and am going to be receiving therapy FINALLY with the right healthcare.
20217,"I live a three hour drive from where I am to them, getting in a car for long car drives (hell even short ones) is completely undo-able without medication still."
20218,"My mother suffers from an ""illness"" herself, and I recently found out that she hasn't been taking her meds, and she also started drinking."
20219,"But he said everything is alright, and he even told me to take a medication called sertraline."
20220,Give up and give the medication a try?
20221,**edit** I removed a whole bunch of the post because it was unreadable and it wasn't anything you guys could help with.
20222,"I feel better now, after crying on my bed for an hour or so, and writing this."
20223,These are all questions I can answer.
20224,But I need to know.
20225,I can't stand guessing anymore.
20226,I'll talk to a doctor soon.
20227,"I need someone to just say ""Yes."
20228,This helped me.
20229,Please do this.
20230,You will feel better.
20231,"You can't handle this yourself anymore, and I'm not sure how you've done it so long."
20232,Being able to handle your own problems is great until you can't handle them.
20233,You have great friends.
20234,"Use them."""
20235,Or something like that.
20236,"But like, someone else."
20237,I need help sleeping.
20238,I plan on going to bed earlier and reading until I can fall asleep.
20239,"Prescription sleeping meds don't work, but I need them."
20240,Wish I didn't.
20241,I'm thinking a foolproof ritual might do the trick.
20242,I have plenty of books to read and I love reading.
20243,Does talking to people really help?
20244,"It's gotten so bad that I think it's worth the guilt of bothering someone (yes, I know that sounds ridiculous.)"
20245,I won't talk to my family.
20246,Will talk to friends.
20247,"I might set up appointments with the counselor here, but I've had bad experiences with counselors."
20248,"Regarding counselors, the only reason I think I'd like one is that I'd be able to tell them everything."
20249,"No one knows everything, and I'm sitting here being anxious about things that happened 13 years ago."
20250,Should I start exercising again?
20251,Ease myself into it?
20252,Tips for getting over the early push so I can start again?
20253,I love ultimate frisbee and the practices resume tomorrow.
20254,Too soon?
20255,I hate medications of all kinds.
20256,I rarely take ibuprofen.
20257,I don't know what is out there for anxiety meds.
20258,"If there is something--preferably in low doses--that has helped people, let me know."
20259,"**tl;dr** writing this made me feel so much better, especially after weeping into a pillow for an hour."
20260,But I have questions above that I would really like answered.
20261,I've been very good at keeping everything together for so long.
20262,But now I need help.
20263,I doubt I'll be able to talk to my friends unless they catch me in another breakdown.
20264,I doubt I'll see the school counselor.
20265,I'll try and make a doc appointment tomorrow.
20266,I don't like to take medicine and I'm hoping the therapist doesn't think I need it.
20267,Have had GAD under control for a few years with meds and (out of practice) CBT.
20268,"I cant even fucking work I'm scared to be around people, I almost passed out when the nurse told me they were taking my blood and ran out of the hospital, I need my blood taken because I have issues wrong with me, I'm terrified to take meds."
20269,I am not on any medication...does it sound like maybe I should be on some?
20270,Anything I can do to help without medication?
20271,"My psychologist and I have talked it over and the plan is for me to get some medication, he can't prescribe so I will be seeing a psychiatrist (family doctor won't prescribe anything), except I won't be seeing them until the 21st."
20272,"At this point I'm seriously considering just throwing myself down some stairs, I don't want to kill myself but if I do something like that I won't have to go to school and I'm sure that will expedite the process of getting meds."
20273,"I know meds usually take a week or two to take effect, but I could at least get a little bit of comfort out of the idea that I have them."
20274,"**TL;DR- I'm probably getting meds, but I won't be getting them until after a week of midterms and tests, and even if I get them immediately after my appointment, I will have 4 days of midterms."
20275,I suspect that this is more a product of the guilt I'm currently harbouring for hiding the fact that I'm on this medication from my father.
20276,"I believe I mentioned this in my last post, but I have a constant sense of impending doom and the longer I spend messing around with ineffective medicine the more imposing that shadow of dread seems to grow."
20277,"I don't want to see a therapist due to the prices being so expensive, and am afraid of being placed on medication that may just make the problem worse."
20278,Hey everyone!
20279,I've posted a few times on this sub but mostly I've just been a lurker.
20280,But recently went to my psychologist and he gave me the right diagnosis and medicine that actually works with my body and I honestly can't remember the last time I was this carefree and happy.
20281,I've suffered from really bad anxiety for the past few years.
20282,"I had a boyfriend, fell in love, got left for another girl, lost my job, and felt like I was burdening everyone with my existence."
20283,I was always over thinking things; things had deeper meanings than what they really *were*.
20284,And I'd drive myself absolutely insane.
20285,"One minute, I'd be perfectly fine and then something as tiny as a friend not texting me back would lead me on a roller coaster of emotions, most of the time downhill."
20286,And I would always assume I was unwanted.
20287,My life had turned to complete shit.
20288,"I couldn't get a job because I would have anxiety attacks, hanging out with friends was always a chore because I had assumed they hated me so much, that everything was said to me in vain and I would **always** take things so offensively."
20289,"A few months ago, I started seeing a psychologist."
20290,I told him my troubles of anxiety and we went through my vast history of anti-depressants and anxiety medications.
20291,"I've taken Welbutrin, Prozac, Effexor, Xanax, Ativan and a bunch of other medicines I can't remember the name of."
20292,"I had quit taking every one of them because I always ended up feeling **numb**, like I couldn't even enjoy life anymore."
20293,I would sit and stare off into space for hours just not feeling a thing.
20294,It was even worse than what I was feeling before.
20295,I was starting to feel discouraged and I thought I had to live the rest of my life with anxiety.
20296,This is where things finally start to get better.
20297,I told him how everything I had taken wasn't working for me; even the ones he prescribed me.
20298,Then he told me about this mouth swab test that can test your DNA and tell you what kind of medications will work for you based on your levels of serotonin or whatever.
20299,"I don't remember exactly what he said, I'm not a doctor."
20300,"Anyways, I took the mouth swab test and came back 2 weeks later to discuss my medications and how I was doing."
20301,"I told him about how I have mood swings and the littlest things could send me into a deep depression, and he said that I might be bipolar along with having anxiety and I should try a mood stabilizer."
20302,He gave me a medicine called Lamictal and holy shit you guys.
20303,It fucking worked.
20304,Today was my first day of taking it and I feel like I felt when I was a kid.
20305,You know that feeling that you get when you first fall in love and everything is perfect and you're still in the honeymoon phase and *nothing* can bring you down?
20306,"Yeah, that's how I feel."
20307,Like a vacation from my anxiety!
20308,I didn't realize that my mood swings were actually the primary cause of my anxiety!
20309,I've had a clear head all day.
20310,I did things that would cause me to have a panic attack but I've been perfectly calm and handled myself pretty well in all tricky situations today!
20311,"I'm not a huge poster on here, but I can't thank you guys enough for being supportive when I did need you, and for helping me come to my diagnosis as bipolar/anxiety."
20312,"I guess there are a few bits of advice I have: 

**1)** Keep a journal handy at all times."
20313,Write down any feelings you have and make sure to mark it with dates and exact times of those feelings.
20314,It's extremely important to keep track of your feelings so you can go back and later asses them.
20315,"**2)** If you are lucky enough to have a psychologist, please use that to your advantage."
20316,I was an idiot for a long time and never told my therapists or psychologists the full truth because I was afraid of them judging me.
20317,Remember they are not there to judge you.
20318,They literally entered the business because they want to help you be the best you that you can be!
20319,"**3)* Also, if you have a psychologist, ask them about the mouth swab test!"
20320,"I'm not sure how common they are, he said it was fairly new but he's got nothing but good reviews from this method."
20321,Look around your area and find a psychologist who can do this for you.
20322,**4)** Make sure you have the right diagnosis.
20323,"I'm not a doctor, but I've been misdiagnosed a bunch of times."
20324,This is why it's important for you to keep a journal.
20325,"A lot of times, anxiety can be triggered by other emotions, so make sure you know what exactly is causing them."
20326,"**5)** Lastly, please do not give up hope."
20327,I know anxiety is such a hard thing to have.
20328,Sometimes you can feel hopeless and engulfed in an endless sea of despair and sadness.
20329,I know how shitty it is.
20330,I thought I was a hopeless case but I kept trying because I knew I deserved more than a life like that.
20331,And so do you.
20332,"If I can find happiness, I have no doubt that you can, too :)


**EDIT:** OHMYGOSH you guys I forgot another thing that helped me a lot!"
20333,[this](http://www.amazon.com/The-Secret-Rhonda-Byrne/dp/1582701709) book has been amazing in terms of positive affirmation.
20334,Not only was this one of the key things that got me out of my anxiety but it has brought me so much happiness because it made me believe in myself.
20335,Which is hard to do when you're always second guessing yourself.
20336,"If you only read one book this year, please read this book."
20337,You will not be sorry!
20338,The only medication I'm on is Omeprazole which I have been told should not cause any issues.
20339,"So last night I suffered my first full-blown panic attack, and it sent me to the emergency room because I didn't realize I was experiencing a panic attack, basically."
20340,I've had anxiety for most of my life and have been on and off anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medications since high school.
20341,I have had panic attacks before... but I have never experienced anything like this before.
20342,"Which leads me to believe that the level of anxiety I had before was enough for me to warrant seeing a therapist and getting medication, but *this....* this was *real* anxiety, and panic."
20343,"I'm a university senior dealing with my senior research project and presentation preparation, as well as my final examinations, important friendships and relationships that are soon ending upon graduation, graduate school admissions and interviews, moving to a different city upon graduation, and just generally making decisions that will affect the rest of my life..."
20344,"I knew I was stressed, but I'm the kind of stresser that just kind of ignores it or denies the fact that I'm stressed out."
20345,Apparently my body retaliated last night.
20346,So my question is - what kinds of physical symptoms are the most common or normal during a full blown panic attack like that?
20347,My experience was really strange.
20348,I had been feeling minor chest pain (more like discomfort) in the left side of my chest all day.
20349,I had 2 Red Bull's that morning/mid-afternoon so I thought perhaps my caffeine intake was getting a bit ridiculous (it is not unlike me to drink this much daily).
20350,"I had minor cold sweats, very noticeable shortness of breath, and a cramp in my left arm/shoulder around 12-1PM that concerned me so much, because they were beginning to look like symptoms of a heart attack."
20351,"Which is terrifying, considering I'm a 22 year old female who is relatively healthy and has no history (or family history) of pre-existing heart conditions..."
20352,"So I ate a large meal to help me calm down, which included an ice cream cone from Sonic."
20353,I felt relatively better and less discomfort for a couple of hours.
20354,I then left my house to go to a study group that I tutor for around 6:30; 45 minutes into instruction I started to feel the discomfort really escalating.
20355,"So much so, that I had to crouch over and pretty much lay in fetal position to keep from feeling uncomfortable."
20356,"My group ended up being freaked out enough to call 911, which panicked me more, and I was hyperventilating at this point."
20357,I was wheeled out of the fucking university library on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room.
20358,"They tested my heart and all of my vitals, and I was perfectly fine."
20359,"In fact, my blood pressure was IDEAL."
20360,"Nothing was wrong with my body, yet I am sitting here in the utmost discomfort, unable to uncurl from this ball, crying and feeling pathetic."
20361,I don't understand the physicality of this panic attack.
20362,I have never had physical symptoms like this... especially ones that didn't correlate to the tests they took on me.
20363,"It really didn't help that the shitty nurses in the hallway were talking very loudly about my medications/conditions and saying ""Oh boy another college student freak out; wonder how many we're going to get this semester"" and sort of laughing."
20364,"It was really unprofessional, rude, and didn't exactly help my anxiety situation..."
20365,If anyone has any advice...
20366,I'm so open to it.
20367,"I'm not new to anti-anxiety/anti-depressant meds, but I never had this side effect."
20368,"My Mom has anxiety (which I have, too), and is on medication, Dad is on nothing but vitamins."
20369,"Those were awful, but luckily my medicine calmed them, and I haven't had one in a while."
20370,"I have been treated for generalized anxiety including panic attacks, but now that I'm a bit older that's all under control without medication."
20371,"Random leg pains and chest pain, i dont know if this is from the meds or not, but they have been more persistent"
20372,A while back on the r/steroids forum I posted a video of the Joe Rogan show where here was a doctor on who treated patients anxiety and depression with hormones.
20373,I'm a long time lurker of this subreddit because I do have anxiety caused by PTSD and a TBI.
20374,I've been on so many SSRIs/SNRIs and other medications to counteract side effects.
20375,Never have I had a good experience in any of these medications.
20376,"The only thing that has ever helped is testosterone, I feel ""normal"" it's a night and day difference."
20377,It's something truly amazing.
20378,I urge Those of you that have tried all the medications to no avail get bloodwork done to see where your hormone levels are.
20379,"There's a lot more to it and it's late so I am going to bed but I wanted to post a few links about the subject:
Here are two, they are x-posts:
http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/2odeq9/its_pretty_amazing_what_testosterone_replacement/

Edit: who actually downvotes something that can help someone?"
20380,"However I also suspect that my dizziness may be anxiety/panic related... or they may be intertwined and when I begin to feel slightly dizzy from the medicine, my anxiety takes it up a notch."
20381,How can I tell when my dizziness is simply anxiety or the medicine?
20382,"Getting the medication was just the first step, though."
20383,"In addition to the medication, I've been reading this book called, ""Hope and Help for your Nerves"" by Claire Weekes - which was actually recommended to me by someone here on reddit!"
20384,"Over the last two years I have tried therapy, yoga, exercise, and finally medication, but this $4 book I bought used on Amazon has been the most helpful by far."
20385,"Also, I don't mean for this post to be all pro-medication - I totally understand if that's not the route you want to take."
20386,"There's therapy, books, medication, meditation, exercise...tons of ways to at least start treating your anxiety and eventually curing it."
20387,"I have general anxiety, health anxiety, and social anxiety."
20388,"I currently am on 3 medications (Wellbutrin SR 100mg, Lexapro 20mg, and Lorazepam 1mg)."
20389,I also see a therapist on a weekly basis.
20390,"Long story short: most of the time, i think i'm doing great."
20391,"But every once in a while i'll have a panic attack, and i'll let my wife know about it."
20392,"I had a panic attack today, and my wife opened up to me saying she's become overwhelmed with my anxiety and panic attacks."
20393,Anyone have any advice that i could give her to help deal with my issues?
20394,"The fact that she told me that she is overwhelmed, instantly raised my anxiety and caused a second panic attack."
20395,"I love her more than anything in this world, and i hate seeing her hurt."
20396,I don't know what to do to help her understand what i go through.
20397,"I'm off to my therapist appointment, and i won't see her until later tonight."
20398,"I'm just worried because she said the line ""i'd rather talk about it than email it."""
20399,"(we were at work emailing each other all day about my current panic attack, and what i was going through.)"
20400,I'm nervous and on edge now.
20401,"Worried, and panicky."
20402,Thanks for any responses.
20403,Would medication help?
20404,"I have some books I've been trying to get through and I also have emergency medication which should make anxiety/agoraphobia not even an issue, but I'm still just..."
20405,One of my issues is that I refuse to take any medication because I have too addictive of a personality.
20406,"This has been so horrible, and I at least want to maintain while I wait for medication and more therapy :/

EDIT: I have seen a psychologist, but I'm waiting for a psychiatry consult."
20407,"I have some history of anxiety, when I was a child I used to take medication because I used to be so afraid of getting on elevators that I would force one of my parents to take the stairs with me instead."
20408,I am tired all the time and overweight all because of my medication but without the medication I am scared of everything and constantly crying plus all the hallucinations.
20409,I'm starting to have doubts that I can continue this medication.
20410,"Was on meds and am tapering off successfully, however I still find that I'm too susceptible to other people's moods and comments."
20411,I am going to work on reinterpreting that feeling- I think that is my only option because meds have not worked- it destroys my ability to make art- and not making art has not worked either...
20412,"I am not in a position to get prescription medication, and have tried a few nootropics and remedies that I have read about online:

 * ECA stack (ephedrine/caffeine/aspirin - caused severe anxiety and horrible withdrawals)
 * DHEA (trying currently - seems to increase focus, but others have commented on increased anxiety as a side effect)."
20413,"I have read bad things about Zoloft, so even taking the meds is giving me anxiety."
20414,I have had to take a little bit of meds rarely but I'm here having the time of my life with people so precious to me and you can too.
20415,"Anxiety slowly destroyed my life over those years despite numerous meds, self-help books, and psychologists."
20416,"I was always calm and cool, even without anxiety meds."
20417,"I'm terrified that my house is haunted, I'm having anxiety attacks again even though I'm on the medication."
20418,"I was having such good results with the medication prior to my move, and I just keep trying to remind myself that this is all stress related, and once things calm down, I'll go back to feeling better."
20419,"I really really hate taking my medication, but it's looking like I'm gonna need to drug myself up with ativan and xanax before hand which I'm not looking foreword to."
20420,"First thing they ask is ""are you on any medication?"""
20421,I'm afraid that medication might be the route to stabilize my anxiety and stop threatening my recovery for self harm and eating disorder.
20422,"I'm worried because I don't want to have to take medication again, I don't want to be at that point."
20423,"I have anxieties about becoming addicted to medication, building a tolerance, and letting other people know about my problem."
20424,"It's been hours since I've smoked, I've even slept, and I'm having paranoid dreams and crazy thoughts like I've never had before in my life..now I'm afraid I will have to be on meds like the rest of my family and my bf will leave me.."
20425,"Yet suddenly, despite this comforting knowledge, I've been questioning whether I'm even human or just trapped in a human body, questioning my very existence, and wondering what's the point of it all if I'm always going to feel this way without meds from now on."
20426,"I just want my heart rate to go down, but in the ER they had to give me meds for hours to make that happen.. How the hell am I supposed to do it solo?"
20427,* Do you take any immediate short-term medication (e.g.
20428,"The place is packed and I'm sipping on my beer, anxious of potential side effects due to meds."
20429,Two years ago I finally gave in after years of resisting and began taking medication.
20430,"But if I go to anyone else they won't understand, they'll just think I'm looking for pills to pop, since I have only talked to my doctor about general anxiety and haven't seen the need to ask for meds before now."
20431,"I've been feeling increasingly anxious throughout the day for no apparent reason, but I know that it's just my body getting used to the medication and it'll pass."
20432,"I've never taken this sort of medication before so I'm not entirely sure at what point ""as needed"" is really needed."
20433,I am not on any medication.
20434,Do I just take the other medication as needed after the attacks happen (which shouldn't be for a while)?
20435,I am wondering if I should look in to medication for this.
20436,Meds or no meds?
20437,Do you have any tips (other than medication) to help me stay asleep longer?
20438,Was given more meds.
20439,I'm so worried that any medicine for it is going to affect me negatively.
20440,"So I was diagnosed with social anxiety and depression years back, and have been going on and off various meds since then."
20441,"Around last year I got to a really low oint because I hadn't been on anything for about 12 months, and it was a final push to get help because I was too anxious to do anything, school work, cleaning, hanging out with friends/family was difficult, and I finally went to therapy and got on meds."
20442,"So with the medicine, over the past year I've been getting better (yay!"
20443,He said it was to prescribe me medicine.
20444,"I am scared that I will go and I won't like them, but I would like to have someone who could prescribe me medication so that I don't have to get a doctor seperately."
20445,I'm currently on no medication.
20446,Some background: I take a daily anti-depression/anti-anxiety medication that has worked really well for me in the past.
20447,I have an appointment to see a psychiatrist to get back on medication.
20448,As we were going over my medical history I mentioned I do my anxiety and that I take medication for it.
20449,"However, I wish they would have paid attention to the fact I said I have anxiety and that I take medication to control it."
20450,"I started taking medication for severe anxiety, and everything was good for the first couple weeks."
20451,"I have been prescribed .25mg of xanax 3x a day recently, no warnings from my psychiatrist about drinking on this medication."
20452,"I am having a panic attack now, because I have drank on this medication."
20453,"Hello all, I'm kinda freaking out about my upcoming day when I have to get onto a plane for Basic training in the army."
20454,I hate flying on planes.
20455,I hate the feeling I get on take-off.Everytime I've flown I feel like my head is going to explode and I begin to sweat because I feel like I'm in an oven.
20456,Can you guys offer any advice that can somehow calm me down while I fly.
20457,Are there any medicines I should take?
20458,Does everyone get these kinds of feelings and just suck it up?
20459,"I feel like I'm just some big baby, but I have no idea."
20460,"Regarding medication, I refuse to take medication because well, a little because of the stigma that is attached to it."
20461,"I realize people don't have to know you're on medication, but it will hurt my pride if I take it."
20462,I have tried four different kinds of medication and I hated every single one of them.
20463,"I have been prescribed Xanax, some chest medication to maintain heart rate so I don't get chest pains and Prozac but I haven't tried any of them out yet."
20464,I want something where I do not have to take medication to fight this anxiety.
20465,"Okay, long story short I have extremely bad anxiety, to the point I can't leave my house most days, and I am worried about starting anxiety meds because I have heard how bad they can be for you; addiction is also a strong factor in my family as my mother got addicted to anxiety meds."
20466,"I was just wondering if anyone can talk a bit about their personal use of either anxiety meds or cannabis for anxiety, also sorry for how poorly this was written."
20467,After wrestling with anxiety symptoms for a year now I finally brought up the conversation of medication with my doctor today.
20468,"I am currently on Lexapro for the first time and it has done wonders for my general mood, my ability to handle stress and for reducing my anxiety levels."
20469,"For context, I have been on the drug for about one month now and I am also on the pill."
20470,"I am approximately 130lbs at about 5'6 and I have previously lost about 60 pounds, so I am well aware of dieting, being strong with cravings and sticking to healthy eating plans."
20471,"HOWEVER, I have found my appetite to be out of control and my ability to self-control my binging completely non existent."
20472,"For example, tonight I ate a double portion of stir fry, half a family block of chocolate, a quarter of a jar of Nutella, half a carton of ice-cream, a quarter of a jar of peanut butter, nuts, dates, yoghurt, granola, chips and more chocolate."
20473,I have literally eaten to the point of nearly throwing up and this has happened a few times since starting on the drug (about three of four times).
20474,It's as if my brain doesn't listen to me anymore.
20475,I keep on telling myself to stop but I just can't.
20476,I just feel permanently unsatisfied.
20477,"Not necessarily hungry, mostly unsatisfied."
20478,It is even to the point where I will go through an entire packet of gum each day because I can't control my need to chew or eat something.
20479,Has anyone else had a similar experience?
20480,"I am wanting to contact my doctor about this as it concerns me to be so erratic with my nutrition, especially as I have a propensity to put on weight due to my PCOS."
20481,"The results of my binging also means that I have diarrhoea the following day, nausea and depression."
20482,"Edit: I forgot to mention that I have also been waking up at 2am, starving to the point of feeling nauseated and having to eat lots just to go back to sleep."
20483,This concerns me the most as even sleep seems to cower down to my appetite at the moment!
20484,"FURTHER EDIT: SO I talked to my doctor this morning and while she acknowledged that binge eating/weight gain is uncommon on Lexapro, she was more than happy to have a chat to me and to try some other medications."
20485,"She's reduced me to half a pill until Monday morning, so that I can slightly wean myself off the drug prior to seeing her."
20486,What's concerning (and I didn't tell her this as I don't want to seem like a hypochondriac) is that I've woken up with a large lump on my neck.
20487,It feels like one swollen gland but its large enough to be quite visible.
20488,Let's hope this bump goes down aye?!
20489,Extreme edit: dammit guys!
20490,It's not even 10:30 and I've already had two biscuits and a slice of cake &gt;.&lt;
20491,I was wondering if anybody had any ideas on why I could be getting anxious around my birthday and then anyways to kind of help it naturally because I don't want to have to take medicine all the time.
20492,I've been consistent with taking my medication.
20493,"I guess I came here to talk about it, and to get some reassurance that with help from a doctor, a therapist, and maybe even medicine, we can get this thing under some degree of control and keep having our wonderful relationship."
20494,"So boom, back on the medicine."
20495,So again I find myself retaking the medicine because I think I'm too dependent on it now and basically I cannot properly function without getting to a breaking point and acting as if the world was ending.
20496,"While doing some of my research not that long ago, I found out that 40mg is actually the highest dosage this medicine is prescribed at and they start at 10mg."
20497,In my general life experience I've found that doctors usually gradually move from lower doses to higher ones to properly assess the right dosage of medicine to give someone.
20498,However I'm also the one that's been going back and forth convincing and unconvincing myself on whether I need this medicine or not.
20499,"I promised my BF I would contact my doctor and get on something, I have always been opposed to medication but it has never been this bad."
20500,"I have a therapist, I take meds."
20501,"I was sent to a psych hospital because I was self medicating my anxiety, apparently I have depression too /s."
20502,I got out of that hellhole yesterday but tomorrow I am being forced in to group therapy.
20503,"I talk to people just fine, and have been to several group therapys before, which aren't in the least therapeutic, just frustrating because nobody actually takes shit seriously as a teenager."
20504,Another point which sucks is that if this happened a few months from now I wouldn't even have to worry about this shit.
20505,"I started using MXE which worked wonders, I didn't even have to take it every day or even every week."
20506,"Medications have never worked for me, I have always either had no reaction or a negative one to them."
20507,Now I am being out in a place where I would rather have my legs runover by a team roller than go to therapy.
20508,"What can I donor, my anxie is back, no medications work, and therapy has been a bust for me,even when I trytogetsmething out of it."
20509,I know that my best friend who also has ADD has said that a lot of meds actually have the opposite intended effect on her - she ends up feeling anxious and restless on them.
20510,Hi all!
20511,I am moving away to school and was wondering what exercises/activities/websites etc you all have to help anxiety or feeling homesick/uncomfortable in a new environment.
20512,"Of course I will be taking my daily medications and have Ativan if need be, but I always like to try and calm myself down if I can."
20513,"It can be a distraction, a game, music, a meditation, anything!"
20514,Even advice on things to put in my room or share what comforts you!
20515,"I want to be prepared and have some things stored in my ""toolbox"" as I call it."
20516,I have worked with my therapist but I wanted to know some of your ideas!
20517,Mostly so I'm prepared if I get homesick or anxious while I'm gone.
20518,Thank you!
20519,I'm looking to see my GP to see if I can get some meds to see if they help.
20520,"I very much am not comfortable with the idea of seeing a therapist about this though, as I have friends I can talk to who also have this problem - they recommend I give meds a go as it has helped them."
20521,"I got prescribed meds that made me feel worse, and I decided that what I felt before was better than what the meds made me feel."
20522,"Since my anxiety is mostly centered around fear of having a severe allergic reaction to medication / suffocating to death from inexplicable and magical causes, this freaked me the hell out."
20523,My anti-anxiety medication gave me a panic attack?
20524,"I am on an antidepressant and antianxiety medication, which helps, but not all of the time."
20525,"I meditate to curb my regular panic attacks and that works a lot of the time without needing meds, but with this sort of ""attack"" I cannot even begin to focus on meditation."
20526,*Hey /r/anxiety!
20527,"First time poster, short time lurker here."
20528,"*

So today (about 10 minutes ago) my best friend messaged me saying he's going through a really bad anxiety phase."
20529,He has been having repetitive and recurring thoughts really often.
20530,"The biggest symptom he explained through text messages was how small, pointless, and stupid thoughts become a really big deal in his mind and he can't really get over a thought without completing it or somehow getting his mind away from it (distractions)."
20531,"He also mentioned the following, straight from the chat log:

&gt;""Let's say I have a test on Friday."
20532,"Until I take the test I will not stop thinking about it, as if it is a level that I **have** to pass in a videogame."
20533,After it's done I feel relaxed.
20534,"I like to get shit out of my way, but until it isn't, it bothers me."
20535,"I talk to myself like there's someone telling me to ""not care about it"" and someone else telling me to keep thinking about it; like an angel and a devil."
20536,"Ultimately, he is asking me to get him some weed to help with this."
20537,I obviously told him to just talk about it and that I'll see what I can do but I feel like he's escaping his problem instead of facing it.
20538,As I have little to no knowledge with anxiety – other than personal experiences – all I could advise him to do was to seek a therapist.
20539,He replied saying he doesn't feel comfortable talking to a stranger and the idea of taking medications is a turn-off as well.
20540,I am not really sure how to help him further than this and would be really grateful to receive any information on this.
20541,Thank you very much for reading!
20542,EDIT: grammar
20543,So I am finally tapered off all medication.
20544,"I really don't want to be on medication, but I also can't be a successful student, girlfriend, puppy mom, etc."
20545,Should I just suck it up and try another medication to get a hold on it?
20546,"The doctor's appointment/meds are happening eventually when money and transportation stop being an issue, but in the meantime I've been trying so many things, MoodGym which has helped but not really stopped the random physical panic symptoms, meditation which I can't really do in the throes, taking 5-HTP, and just recently binaural beats."
20547,"However, the psychiatrist prescribed her an anti-anxiety medication and anti-depressants as he felt that depression might also be a part of the problem."
20548,"However, after the medicine wears off I spiral into this soul crushing depression which I don't know whether it's caused by the medicine or just my anxiety coming in full throttle without any chemical help to suppress it because my life is lacking stability right now."
20549,So I got my meds adjusted just over two weeks ago.
20550,I don't know how I'm going to survive until I get meds.
20551,"Somehow, I have to survive 2 more weeks (and then more while I want for the meds to hopefully kick in) when I'm in extreme anxiety and suffocating existential despair."
20552,I'm reading reviews and now i'm anxious about my anxiety meds haha the irony.
20553,I'm also kind of scared to take any cold medicine now.
20554,"I have been suffering from anxiety for a long time, was on Zoloft and Paxil when I was younger(16) and it did nothing but make it worse."
20555,"I am now 26, and my anxiety is pretty much unbearable."
20556,"I work, I work out, I eat extremely healthy, and have great relationships with everyone around me."
20557,My problem is my own mental health and stress.
20558,I feel like I've tried everything and ready to try medications again.
20559,"I would rather not have anything maintenance(having to be on something longer than 3 months, every day) And I dont want any hardcore sedative."
20560,What are some success stories and past histories with peoples medications?
20561,"**PART 1: BACKSTORY:** 

I've had anxiety problems since developing a phobia as a child but have always been scared to take medication."
20562,"If so, what other type of medication has worked for you?"
20563,"I honestly didn't suspect the medication was causing any of my problems, since I took it to stop those very issues."
20564,"I'm scared to try any other medicine, but I think I probably need it at this point - at least as a stepping off point for improving this."
20565,"*

[Hair loss with medication][http://www.dr-bob.org/tips/split/Hair-loss-with-medication.html]"
20566,No meds.
20567,I need my meds but I need sex too.
20568,My Gf of 7 months has of late been suffering from serious anxiety/depression issues.
20569,"She has felt so bad lately that, she has had to take a leave of absence from work."
20570,"Her doctor has bumped her daily dose of Lexapro up from 10mg to 15mg,(started that yesterday) she is also taking .5mg of clonazepam twice daily."
20571,"Small doses I know, but she is a very small girl roughly around 90 lbs."
20572,Her anxiety is a strange one and the fact that it is strange and unusual also seems to cause her more anxiety.
20573,"The biggest trigger is that almost every time she eats or drinks something, she believes she has swallowed a pill."
20574,"Not only that, but she can actually feel something hard and round go down her throat(pill) each time."
20575,"I try my best to assure her that she hasn't swallowed a pill, and to try to have her think logically about it."
20576,She also has problems with things touching the floor or her pants feeling contaminated.
20577,"A lot of chemical centered things, like being anxious about the bath water if I don't use a certain bathtub cleaner."
20578,"She also suffers from nausea, weakness, dizziness etc."
20579,"The pill thing is the biggest issue, and is the newest problem."
20580,She has had some form of OCD/anxiety/depression most of her teen/adult life.
20581,"She is 23, but the pill thing has only been around for a few years."
20582,"She has had a very unsupportive family, and previous Bf's which I know didn't help matters."
20583,"The depression she is going through, I believe is due to the fact she thinks there is no hope, and she is going to have to be like this the rest of her life."
20584,"She had been through quite a list of different medicines combinations, and feels like their is nothing left to try."
20585,"She feels her therapist doesn't understand, and she doesn't trust her advice all that much."
20586,"I would like to have her see a CBT/DBT trained specialist, but that isn't something that is available to us in our area."
20587,"I try to assure her that there is no easy fix and that we have to just keep trying, and not to give up."
20588,"I really love this girl, and want to start a family with her someday."
20589,I know that isn't something realistic at this point in time.
20590,I try to be patient and supporting as much as I can.
20591,"I do my best to let her know I have her back 24/7, and try to be there for her at all times."
20592,"I do feel helpless at times, and that is the worst fucking part."
20593,"But I try to be strong in front of her, and hopeful."
20594,If anyone has any words of advice or encouragement you don't know how much we would both appreciate it.
20595,"I'm also on some temporary non-related medication as well, that I take on mornings and evenings."
20596,"Just now when I was getting my other meds (it's evening over here) I noticed right after swallowing, that damn, that was Escitalopram and not the other stuff."
20597,"Oh yeah, and the escitalopram has no effect with my other meds, so that isn't a worry, even with a bigger dose."
20598,I can't get medication until I am 18 because the place I have to go to is terrible and have a bad reputation.
20599,"I ended up telling him about my breakdown that happened a year or so back and how I'm on meds, etc."
20600,I have no idea what they are going to think of my self-medication.
20601,"After years of trial and error, i found a medication that makes things tolerable."
20602,"But when i forget to take my medication and the feelings come back, even though i know its all in my head, its a constant struggle to keep reminding myself that its not real."
20603,I'm starting to get really tired of taking all this medication.
20604,"I used to push through my anxiety, refuse the medication and I still felt successful, as if I was actually getting closer to leaving home."
20605,I'm scared to try medication because I don't want to lose my sex drive.
20606,He left to go back home where his medical is and so the past two weeks he's been working on finding the right medication and what's causing it.
20607,"Since he's left he talks much more, found out what has caused it, and at least got a medicine to tame the attacks when they happen."
20608,He suggested anxiety medicine and I called my mother who wanted nothing to do with the conversation.
20609,She belittled me by going on medication and called them happy pills and my father said if I want to live in la-la land than go right ahead.
20610,"I am taking a leave from work to focus on figuring out my medication, therapy, and the direction I need to go after this."
20611,meds diazepam 5mg.
20612,When did you say enough is enough and go for meds?
20613,"However, I'm beginning to think I need a change in meds."
20614,"I didn't really expect it to instantly cure my troubles or anything, but the medication only really ever took the edge off."
20615,I'm willing to try whichever meds my psychiatrist recommends and will stick with whichever one helps me!
20616,The anemia test came back negative and he sent me home with anxiety medicine.
20617,The medicine made me sleepy and I felt better.
20618,I spent a small amount of time working on school work and then began reading about a new medication my doctor had given me.
20619,"I have had GAD and panic attacks for the past 4 years now, but have recently started feeling really depressed."
20620,I am not on any medications currently and am going to a psychiatrist on Friday.
20621,"I have never been medicated for anxiety, but it is something that I can no longer endure."
20622,"However, I have been prescribed antidepressants twice now and both times I have never felt so sick before during the first night taking them and have stopped immediately."
20623,The side effects are so terrible personally I cannot bare to take them more than one night.
20624,Does anyone have any suggestions on medication or other options?
20625,Because I have a strong feeling they are going to push antidepressants on me again.
20626,"I truly do want to be happy, but I'm not sure antidepressants are the answer."
20627,"I developed anxiety attacks about two years ago after an isolated incident, then created a plan on how to address and eliminate it that included mindfulness meditation, some therapy (not super helpful), confronting triggers in controlled doses, and a very low dose of anti-anxiety meds that worked WONDERS."
20628,I've been off meds for quite awhile now and I have all kinds of mental coping strategies in place for my occasional anxiety attack/outbreak.
20629,I've been recommending the anti-anxiety meds to her since the day I started them.
20630,She continues to suffer through her anxiety because she is paranoid of becoming dependent on the meds if she even tries them once.
20631,"I feel like she's just suffering for no reason, and the intensity of her anxiety prevents her from feeling like she could ever have any control over it - meds would eliminate the worst of her attacks in a way that would enable her to work on a recovery plan like I did."
20632,All she hears is meds.
20633,"""But I don't want to be on meds."""
20634,"**tl;dr: My friend has mostly irrational reasons to not try medication therapy for her debilitating anxiety attacks, and I don't know how to deal with it other than just let her keep suffering."
20635,"So, ever since I was a kid, I have suffered with my nerves, which lead to numerous doctors saying I had mild anxiety disorders and I have heard different doctors diagnose different types, (sometimes recommended medication, to which I have refused several times in my life as I worried I would become dependant on them)."
20636,"Being suffering from massive anxiety and panic attacks since I was 10, been benzo (xanax) addict for 2 years, I took 6mg-10mg a day, managed to quit somehow, have tried every AD, every anti-anxiety drug, every legal and non legal drug (self-medication), sports, counsellings, destroying my life, trying to enjoy my life - tried everything, have been trying to get help all my life from psychiatrists - finally they described me Paxil (no idea why no one did it before, I have tried like 30 of them)


Didn't think about it anything, why not try, nothing to lose."
20637,"Hi guys, I've just started taking pregabalin for GAD."
20638,"I already take other meds, but they kind of just keep me alive, I'm still chasing quality of life..."
20639,"It's a fairly 'fringe' treatment, mainly a last resort for non-responders to SSRI's."
20640,"I had a terrible experience with an SSRI in the recent past, which has made me quite nervous about trying to add new medications to the mix."
20641,"So I've been pretty cautious, and only taking 1/3 of the recommended dose initially, my plan is to titrate up when nothing disastrous happens at lower doses."
20642,"I suppose I'm writing this here, looking for any input from others who may have tried it, some inspiration to stay brave, perhaps?"
20643,"It doesnt help that I'm transitioning to a new job next week, so the last thing I need is a problem to arise..."
20644,"Seeing my doctor tomorrow morning as well, but I just thought hearing from any of you peeps with 'lived experience' could be really helpful."
20645,"Also, on a side note, thanks to all in this community, it's gotten me through some dark times."
20646,"I've read comments here that have literally brought tears to my eyes, tears of hope and gratitude."
20647,"Sometimes, just that little push from an internet stranger can really make a difference!"
20648,"I've never taken meds and I don't really want to, I really want a natural cure for this... (Yep, I don't want to see a doctor and am scared of med side effects)."
20649,Should I wait a bit longer or go to the doctor and try to get on medicine?
20650,I went to my doctors the Thursday before last and went back on medication (Pristiq 50mg).
20651,"As I grew older I became more frustrated and disillusioned with pandering therapists and the ever-changing cocktail of meds I was prescribed, which never seemed to do me any good."
20652,I did not anticipate being anxious about actually tapering off the meds.
20653,I felt like I had no other option than to finally see my doctor and get some medication.
20654,I really need to take this medication in hopes of getting better but how can I if I cause myself endless worry from taking the medication itself?
20655,I need to get over it though so I can let the medication help me.
20656,"I mainly have health anxiety, so I fear that somehow the medication will make me sick, give me headaches, make me too dizzy to drive, etc."
20657,How do I get over this fear so I can benefit from my medication?
20658,Is it a side effect of stopping taking meds that will go away on its own?
20659,"I usually take Kolonopin (as well as a barrage of other meds) to manage my symptoms, but my medication has lapsed considerably in the past few months."
20660,I'm really trying to deal with my OCD and anxiety without medicine.
20661,Hey.
20662,I guess there's a bunch of back story involved......
20663,"In June, I went to my local health clinic and explained that I pretty much feel like shit and had researched meds and felt that Xanax would be a good solution for me."
20664,"The doctor said OK, and I was given a prescription of .25 mg Alprazolam, 3 times per day as needed."
20665,"For the first time in the last several years, I was able to shut my brain up."
20666,"I took a pill when I felt like I was going into a situation that I knew was going to make my brain reel, and it genuinely made me feel totally relaxed."
20667,"I was not taking it three times a day, but refilled my prescription prior to running out because I have a history of not having insurance and I wanted to stockpile meds..... (just kind of a weird thing, but I was afraid of running out I guess) 

After three months of refills, I had a situation where the pharmacy and health clinic were both saying I needed to check with the other one to see why my prescription wasn't being refilled."
20668,"Finally after calling the health clinic several times about the prescription, I was told that the prescribing physician no longer worked there and the head of the clinic looked at the prescription and doesn't think it's good to continue."
20669,"I was told to make an appointment with the behavioral therapist, and I explained the exact same scenario to her."
20670,She (along with another PCP) both explained that Xanax can be very addictive and it's not a medication that they prescribe.
20671,This pissed me off.
20672,I decided to make an appointment with another clinic.
20673,I called prior to going to see if it was a medication they prescribe.
20674,The receptionist said that since it wasn't a narcotic (they don't treat chronic pain) that it shouldn't be a problem.
20675,I drove 30 miles to this clinic today to meet with the doctor.
20676,"She agreed that it was not a medication that she prescribes and that ""they"" are learning more about it and it's not a good option."
20677,I asked WHAT DO YOU DO FOR PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY?!?
20678,"She suggested exercise and meeting with behavioral therapist, first available appointment 2 months from now."
20679,"So, now I've asked three different doctors for a medication that I genuinely thought helped, but they think is addictive."
20680,I've driven all over the county asking for it.
20681,"I am embarrassed and in hindsight, pretty pissed off that a doctor would cut me off of a medication that made me feel better without even ever having met me."
20682,Am I in the wrong?
20683,Is Xanax not one of the most widely prescribed medications for anxiety in the world?
20684,I was prescribed Buspar by this new doctor.
20685,"I don't even know what it is, and I don't like the idea of taking medicine every single day, regardless of circumstances."
20686,Maybe I don't even have anxiety and I'm actually depressed?
20687,Or maybe it's normal for everyone to constantly think about everything 1000 times.
20688,"Thanks for reading, if you made it this far."
20689,I'd love to hear anyone's feedback.
20690,but how can my file be closed if my meds are still being prescribed?!
20691,"there must be a record of me somewhere, they aren't just going to dole out psychoactive meds to anyone... i felt like this doctor was going to be there when i needed help."
20692,"i feel abandoned &amp; like no one cares...

&amp; what truly baffles me is that there is even a system in place that could have someone prescribed meds from a distance but not be allowed to see the doctor prescribing them."
20693,"what if they suddenly ""delete"" my file &amp; i can no longer get my meds?"
20694,Have any of you had similar symptoms and did any medication help you?
20695,"What’s frustrating is I show a mask of a calm co-worker and I almost never seem stressed in person (except the few times I’ve been caught “sleeping” when I was actually having anxiety attacks), and I’m more lively due to the medication, so my bosses think I'm perfectly fine and keep lighting the pressure on me."
20696,Both of them became self-destructively impulsive after starting their medication.
20697,What if medication doesn't work?
20698,"I was wondering about the experiences any of you have had with the following:

1) If you were afraid of starting medicine for your disorder, what finally made you decide to take it?"
20699,"2) Have you ever experienced stigma or resistance to taking medicine (even though you wanted to or felt like it helped you) from a partner, spouse, family-member, or friend?"
20700,"First off, I know that these are only thoughts and I couldn't see myself ever hurting anyone as I am a sensitive person."
20701,Now to begin with my story.
20702,I have been having intrusive thoughts since December of last year.
20703,Here are the thoughts that I have had since said time: I bought into the Mayan apocalypse hype.
20704,I thought that I was dying of cancer.
20705,Now I have intrusive thoughts of hurting others and going to prison for life.
20706,"I have bipolar disorder, obsessive anxiety disorder, and a touch of ocd."
20707,"So yes I am mentally ill, but I do take my prescribed medications."
20708,"I was actually pretty normal just like anyone else, until around 2009 that's when it all really hit me."
20709,I am sure now that there were early warning signs just didn't recognize them.
20710,At any rate I am having thoughts of hurting others and going to prison.
20711,Although I highly doubt I could ever hurt anyone just the thoughts are scaring the shit out of me.
20712,I am a father of two and married for 2 years now.
20713,What I am looking for is answers to why I might be having these issues and how to deal with these issues.
20714,Is it part of my disorders?
20715,Or is it that I am simply going crazy?
20716,I have already heard this go to mental health nonsense.
20717,Where I live the mental health institutions aren't so good and I hardly think this is worth going to a facility for anyways.
20718,I have been told by plenty that it could just be my bipolar disorder.
20719,I actually got over the thoughts for about two months until 2 days ago.
20720,PS: Please help me I am scared.
20721,"Before I even start I might as well let you all know that I don't get panic attacks, I'm not on any medication and I get by pretty well day-to-day."
20722,I've tried medication before.
20723,Luckily medication and therapy has helped with a lot of that.. except now I carry scissors and nail clippers everywhere.
20724,I made the decision that I hadn't wanted to reach the point of: I was going to get on meds within the next month.
20725,"I'm afraid I can't handle being off my medication, but I also can't handle gaining all that weight again."
20726,I'm waiting to be put on stronger medication because Citalopram isn't working at all.
20727,Is there anything you think I can do to work through it or will it never go away as long as I'm on medication?
20728,I was put on medication at one point but stopped taking it.
20729,She's a regular family medicine doctor.
20730,"My age is 23, male , I don't know what type of anxiety or if i really have anxiety at all, not on meds, U.S., not sure for insurance."
20731,What what just happened as not happened for a year on meds.
20732,I really don't want to become reliant on any sort of medication.
20733,I don't know... this is my first time being on any type of medication.
20734,She's taking meds once a day.
20735,I sought out some therapy and was medicated until I learned to control my severe panic attacks without the meds.
20736,"While dealing with the causes and symptoms of crippling anxiety and depression is very subjective, there are a few things that I have found which *really* helped me alongside prescribed medication (I am on Sertraline and Propranolol);

* Sleep - for me, regardless of medication, a lack of sleep is a major, major trigger."
20737,* medication - oh lordy - I  can only speak from experience with SSRI's but holymoly dont miss a dose or fiddle with dosages.
20738,"I've been doing really well lately because I have been in consistent therapy for a year now, and I'm finally on meds that actually make a difference."
20739,"When I was a kid I was diagnosed with some sort of anxiety and had panic attacks, and I took medication for it for years."
20740,Maybe it's an infection or something I need prescription medicine for?
20741,She told me to suck on a cough drop if allergy medication wasn't working.
20742,I also told her I was taking allergy medicine every day and I didn't think it would be allergies.
20743,I would really like to avoid medication.
20744,I have had problems with anxiety for several years and I had a very bad episode of depression about 8 years ago.
20745,"I was recently diagnosed with MS, which of course made me upset, but I was not depressed."
20746,I wanted to get on some type of medicine to control my anxiety and hopefully help if I became depressed while taking my MS medicine (depression is a very common side effect of interferons).
20747,"My neurologist prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro, which I was on in the past and really helped me with depression."
20748,"I noticed a huge anxiety spike after the second day taking it, and on the third day I had a full blown panic attack which lasted a few hours and had me suicidal."
20749,I immediately stopped taking it after three days.
20750,I was able to get an appointment with a psychiatrist.
20751,I was a little out of it when I went to the first appointment after the horrible experience with Lexapro.
20752,"She seems to think I am depressed, but I am not depressed, I am just temporarily sad and worn out about the diagnosis, my physical symptoms of MS and my bad experiences with the doctors I've been to recently."
20753,She prescribed me 75 mg of instant release Wellbutrin to take in the morning (to give me energy) and 0.5 mg of Ativan to take at night (to calm me down and help me sleep).
20754,I've been taking them both as prescribed for 8 days now and I am hating the Wellbutrin.
20755,It makes me extremely irritable and I become a monster that snaps at every little thing for about 1-3 hours after I take it.
20756,"It slightly increases my anxiety, but it's more of an angry type of anxiety rather than a sad type of anxiety, if that makes any sense."
20757,I have violent thoughts and it makes me feel really horrible about myself.
20758,"Once I take the Ativan, the anxiety lessens and I feel okay."
20759,"The Ativan makes me completely normal and gives me no side effects (except yawning a lot, even though I don't feel tired)."
20760,I have an appointment on Saturday and I'm not sure what I should say to get off of this medicine.
20761,I am afraid that she is going to say that it takes a while to get used to it and I have to give it more time.
20762,I am a very peaceful and gentle type of person (look at my username!)
20763,and this medicine makes me want to kill someone.
20764,I'm also afraid of what she might prescribe instead.
20765,"This is a difficult time for me and I'm going to be doing my first injection of MS medication next week, which could potentially cause a slew of side effects."
20766,Dealing with that while feeling angry and anxious would be disastrous.
20767,"I really don't want to be dealing with these horrible medicines, but I would like to stay on the Ativan (just to have for anxiety emergencies, even)."
20768,Does anybody have any advice on what to do?
20769,"I have a feeling I had bad reactions to the Lexapro and Wellbutrin because I'm not actually depressed right now, I'm just anxious - but I also seem very sensitive to medication."
20770,What medicine do you think she will try next?
20771,How can I make it clear to her that I really am not depressed?
20772,Any advice would be appreciated.
20773,"I'm a 24 year old male, I work out regularly, I eat generally well, look healthy, and for the most part feel FINE."
20774,About 5 years ago a good friend of mine was diagnosed with lymphoma and passed away a year later.
20775,Since then I have developed some very significant health anxiety.
20776,In the last 6 months it has rely gotten bad.
20777,"There isn't a period of time I am not obsessing about something, be it cancer, stds, checking my temperature, examining my moles, anything!"
20778,"My current fear has cycled around to lymphoma, again, after finding a swollen lymph node in my neck a few weeks ago that has still not gone down."
20779,"I went to the doctor and she told me I had a viral infection and not to worry, that it is normal for lymph nodes in the neck to swell for some time during and after a viral infection."
20780,"Of course WebMD suggests all the worst things, and I still keep checking online."
20781,Overall this is just exhausting... this constant fear that I have some terrible disease waiting for me around the corner.
20782,"Unfortunately I have noticed that drinking alcohol is a very good situational escape from these cycling fears, but I do not want to become dependent on its numbing effects."
20783,"If anything, drinking will just deteriorate my overall health...but I don't know what else to do."
20784,Personally I'm not really into psych medications.
20785,I am hoping there is some kind of herb/meditation/therapy that can help me with this anxiety in lieu of a pill or a pint.
20786,Has anyone else experienced these irrational health fears?
20787,"If so, how did you deal with/overcome it?"
20788,Thanks for your help.
20789,I have 1 klonopin left (i got from a trip to the ER heart rate related) from now until my medication appointment next Friday.
20790,I'm going back on some form of medicine because this is ridiculous.
20791,"I had a really odd reaction, and the meds made me manic."
20792,"I'm worried as to where to turn next, as without the meds I'm anxious, but with them I'm manic."
20793,I don't know where to begin.
20794,"I had 2 ""normal"" days in the last 30 that I can remember."
20795,I don't remember when I had a normal day past that but they come few and far between.
20796,"It's been years of this constant ""anxiety""."
20797,"I've been eating healthy and exercising, yet I still have this feeling like my whole body is tense and I'm a big open nerve."
20798,The best way I can describe it is that feeling when you're sitting in a chair at your desk and you tip backward and almost fall but catch yourself.
20799,Only it's all the time.
20800,"I have a numb spot that comes and goes in the middle of my forehead, my chest feels unusually tight all the time, I've have had constant high blood pressure for about 6 months and was given medication."
20801,I'm 27.
20802,"I wake up startled every morning, that's when the anxious feeling hits me the hardest but it never really dissipates, just kind of lessens a little through the day."
20803,"I have acne on my face, chest, back."
20804,Sometimes I get these dizzy feelings like I'm going to pass out.
20805,I can't seem to hold my thoughts and my memory is terrible.
20806,"I'm a bright person, and this depresses me greatly."
20807,I tend to hide away from people because of how just a tiny little bit of stress makes me hit the roof inside.
20808,I don't want to weird them out or make an ass of myself.
20809,"I'm not medicated with anti-depressants because nothing has seemed to help me, these last 6 years."
20810,"Zoloft, Gabapentin, Lexapro, Paxil, Welbutrin, Xanax, Valium, Lithium, Prozac, etc."
20811,I feel like they're experimenting with me :/ These mental medications have just seemed make my emotions all wonky without lessening the feeling I have.
20812,"And I have to hold a job, I support myself alone."
20813,I'm getting to a breaking point though.
20814,"I've had my thyroid levels checked and my T3 level is always just a tiny, tiny bit low."
20815,I had my kidneys ultrasounded for adrenal nodes and nothing came up.
20816,I had a 24 hr urine catch and my cortisol levels were just a tiny tiny bit elevated.
20817,None of these warranted any action by doctors.
20818,"I was diagnosed with PCOS, and put on birth control."
20819,"That really threw my body out of whack, and that's when I decided to start eating healthy and exercising."
20820,"I have normal stressors, but nothing that should make me feel like my life is constantly in danger."
20821,"Can anybody relate, or point me in any kind of direction?"
20822,"Has anybody here ever had constant, unrelenting anxiety?"
20823,What do you use when it comes to cough/cold meds?
20824,"Hello, I've been on Zoloft for about 3 years to treat my anxiety and OCD."
20825,"I went to the doctor to talk about weaning off it, and she wasn't very supportive (she was a dr. at a walk-in, I don't have a regular family doctor...seems none are taking new patients!"
20826,"), but agreed to gradually lower my dose until I hit 0."
20827,I am currently at 100 mg.
20828,"I know that perhaps the reason why I feel good is the Zoloft, but I don't want to be on it forever, and I figure I will have to at least try to wean off it and go back on it if I need to."
20829,"Also, my life has improved for the positive in the recent year, and I have been doing regular exercise, which forces me into a healthy routine and has helped me feel more energetic."
20830,"Anyway, I am wondering what people's experiences coming off Zoloft have been like?"
20831,Experiences with other medications for treating anxiety/OCD are also appreciated.
20832,Thank you so much.
20833,I take medication for it and it's normally not a big deal.
20834,"In December i was on a medicine designed to deal with urinary issues but it made me feel like shit, then I began having like weakness in my muscles and shakes sort of, I've always been shaky and not very steady with my hands."
20835,Turns out I had low vitamin D which lack of leads to muscle problems but Ive been on meds to give me D for two months and somehow its gotten worse.
20836,"Atm, no meds, and I feel silly seeking professional help for something that is not an issue at the moment for the most part."
20837,My mom also suffers from anxiety issues and thinks I should get on some sort of anti anxiety medication.
20838,"I just started my Masters, and I'm already feeling overwhelmed and I worry a lot about my coursework and that I'm somehow not smart enough for my program (even though I got a great scholarship and was courted pretty aggressively by my university)."
20839,"Most of my anxiety stems from the mandatory participation in class, which counts for up to 25% of my grade in some classes."
20840,"I dread going to class because I know I have to participate, and the pressure to speak up in class is so daunting."
20841,"I've always had trouble breathing here and there, but it was only recently that I clued in that it is anxiety related."
20842,"I read somewhere that excessive yawning and not being able to get a full breath can be caused by anxiety and hyperventilation due to anxiety, and I've been having increased bouts of breathing trouble like that ever since the beginning of September."
20843,It's hard to deal with something so physical that makes me just shut down and not be able to interact.
20844,"That being said, I'm not sure whether I want to try any medications."
20845,"I think that just being able to realize that my breathing problems are anxiety related and trying to work on regulating my breathing is helping somewhat, but I really wish I could just dial down the worry because it feels like I'm physically hurting myself."
20846,Has anyone else had a horrible experience with a medication they usually have no problem with?
20847,1st one)This was the worst one oflot all advice he gave was eat more medicine he increased my dosage randomly.
20848,My mother flew into a rage when she heard about that so my treatment stopped completely.. until we decided to go to him again he give some miracle pills idk i felt like i was flying i was ridiculously active and positive but what's this medication killed my appetite completely i couldn't even take 1 biscuit with a little coffee i would vomit.
20849,"So, today I got some lorazepam, first time ever using meds, so it's been the only thing to help."
20850,I have general anxiety due to stressful life situation and it recently turned in to social anxiety.
20851,"I also have insomnia, I was taking melatonin to help me sleep for the less six months or so."
20852,It worked great for the first 4-5 months.
20853,"But recently, because of personal life situation my anxiety was off the roof."
20854,"I stopped taking melatonin for 1 week, because I ran out and forgot to get some more."
20855,"Maybe coincidence but not taking melatonin seemed to have decreased my anxiety a lot, but it wasn't completely gone or even within reason."
20856,My life was slowly running out of control and I needed to do something about it.
20857,So I met my doc and he told me to start with half of 25mg zoloft (generic) and told me to not take melatonin.
20858,He didn't give me anything for sleep.
20859,He also told me I can take propranolol as needed basis for anxiety attack.
20860,I tried to break my zoloft but it would crack into several pieces so after doing some online research I found out that 25 mg is actually a very low dose to begin with and most cases absolutely minimum.
20861,So I started taking 25 at a time instead.
20862,Its been 5 days.
20863,"Started feeling better from day 2, but I was still having problem sleeping."
20864,"After three days of not having any proper sleep, I decided to get something to help me sleep."
20865,"(Side note: in my country you can get virtually 99% medication without any prescription, its not even illegal.)"
20866,"After doing some online research I found out that one of the few pills thats ok to take with SSRI is bromazepam, its also supposed to help with anxiety."
20867,I took 3mg and slept good.
20868,But when I woke up in the morning my anxiety was off the roof.
20869,Like before I started taking any medications.
20870,"My question is, does sleeping pills enhance anxiety for some people?"
20871,Or is it just my choice of sleeping pills that might have cause me anxiety?
20872,Thanks for any help.
20873,I wondered whether anyone has experience with these methods (either with or without CBT and medication) and whether or not you felt any relief.
20874,Do meds genuinely help?
20875,I feel like if I take meds I won't really be solving the problem at hand and instead I'd be taking the easy way out.
20876,"Also, how do meds make you feel?"
20877,Hey guys.
20878,I've been struggling with anxiety since 2004 which is when I was 16.
20879,"My first panic attack was when I was in 6th period English and I heard a plane fly over and I thought to myself ""what if it were to crash into the school""?"
20880,Almost all my panic attacks start from crazy thoughts like that.
20881,I proceeded to be unable to breathe and then my left arm went numb.
20882,I was sent to the nurse because I could barely talk and was barely breathing.
20883,By the time the ambulance came I was so worked up that my pulse was at 200 and I was completely numb all over.
20884,They gave me some lorazepam and sent me on my way.
20885,Over the years I would get them every now and then but nothing like that first one.
20886,That is until 2008 when my dad had a stroke due to a deep vein thrombosis in his brain.
20887,They give him a 5% chance to live but he ended up pulling through.
20888,"6 years later he still has the clot in his brain but can walk, talk, drive, and function normally."
20889,Only people who have been around him his whole life really can see a difference.
20890,"Anyway, after his stroke my panic attacks started coming back."
20891,First they were just little ones but now they are just like the one I had when I was 15.
20892,I've tried anti anxiety medications but none have really worked.
20893,I've tried to figure out the triggers for my panic attacks but they are so random.
20894,I know my dad's illness caused them to start up again but I don't know why they've continued after so long.
20895,"I've also tried working out, eating right, cutting caffeine, and writing but nothing has stopped them."
20896,I'm tired of having them for no apparent reason.
20897,Just the other day I had one while sitting on the couch doing nothing.
20898,Does anyone else have panic attacks like these or maybe some suggestions with how to deal with them?
20899,I try to talk to people about this but no one seems to understand.
20900,"Edit:  
A few details about me, in case that helps  
18 years old, male, and I do not take medication for anxiety"
20901,"I'm wondering if the medicine can help my sex drive, or hurt it even more."
20902,I have been having trouble finding and securing an appointment with someone who can monitor my meds.
20903,"Time, therapy and meds have made me learn how to deal with the stress so it doesn't generally boil over into anxiety."
20904,I don't plan on discontinuing this medication again.
20905,"Put on a rainbow of medication, most recently zoloft."
20906,Refused to take medication for fear of weight gain.
20907,"I have an appointment with a psychiatrist next friday, but I'm scared the meds he gives me will make me gain weight."
20908,"So here's the deal I magically got anxiety around a year and a half ago, luckily I have health insurance..bad thing is no doctors were able to help me."
20909,I've been to 2 psychiatrists and psychologist.
20910,The only medicine that has ever helped is Klonopin..cbt and other medicines all failed.
20911,The klonopin made it only a little easier as well.
20912,Now I'm not in school lost my job and starting to abuse alcohol and drugs more and more.
20913,I've been clean off of painkillers for around 5 months now as well but my day just revolves around trying to get drugs..I'm highly functional mentally but when it comes to anxiety I get agrophobia and SAD.
20914,"I'm not really sure what to do anymore, I even resorted to quit smoking to help it, but I can't even stay out of the house for more then a hour let alone leave my neighborhood."
20915,"I know this is supposed to be a temporary problem but my only escape is drugs, other then that is suicide..any tips?"
20916,With certain medication I can minimize those attacks to a liveable center.
20917,"I talked to the pharmacist and he told me about st john's worts medication--not sure if it's supposed to help, but thought I'd give it a try."
20918,"I'm off meds and without psychotherapy for over a year, I have to wait about a year to test my ears or pay money (hoooray our ""free"" healthcare!)"
20919,I am diagnosed with Situational Anxiety and PTSD.
20920,"I have always been scared of getting in trouble, It almost always culminated in me getting shouted at in front of a crowd, publicly humiliated, teased or threatened."
20921,It started young.
20922,"Teachers shouting as loud as they can about missed homework, throwing/dumping my desk contents in front of everyone."
20923,Using me as an example until I had no more friends.
20924,"DARE officers teasing me in front of class for liking certain music, Scout leaders making fun of me for not ""getting"" a game right away."
20925,"Parents smashing my belongings and shrieking (they were addicted to speed, booze, the smallest infraction would lead to entire months ""grounded"")."
20926,"During their divorce Mom would often tell us ""If you don't behave social services will come and take you away, so don't you say anything."""
20927,"Security on a field trip shouting at me for allegedly taking flash pictures of the Declaration of Independence when I didn't even have a camera ""ARE YOU BEING SMART WITH ME?!"
20928,"YOU DO NOT TALK BACK WHEN I ASK YOU SOMETHING!"""
20929,"Going forward to adulthood, cop reaching for his gun because I walked in proximity to a park at dusk (we had alot of parks in the area), with my brother, in the rain, holding my umbrella."
20930,I often got stopped for walking and interrogated.
20931,Apparently walking is probable cause.
20932,"I never learned to drive out of fear I will make a mistake and the cops will ""get me"" because they scare me, and apparently any anxiety, means I MUST be guilty of something."
20933,"My great uncle who was an ex cop told me when I was little, ""Don't ever be a cop unless you like F**king with people""."
20934,It stuck.
20935,"Now I live in a small city, and I cannot even bring myself to leave the house."
20936,"I hear sirens every day and every time, I freeze up, my heart drops out and I become convinced they might go for the wrong house or I'll be in the wrong place at the wrong time and my anxiety will trigger and they will take my entire life away, or kill my dog or whatever."
20937,I feel like my only protection is being a white female.
20938,"I try to watch my posture, how I dress, I try to be well spoken and aware of my actions."
20939,"I have spoken to my therapists about it, they never have advice."
20940,"The best my last therapist gave was ""look, I'm on this computer and I shouldn't be!"
20941,And I don't care!
20942,"You shouldn't care what people think!"""
20943,I have tried cutting out reading the news.
20944,"I try to avoid reading about the atrocities In the world, I can't even watch TV shows where people get arrested without triggering, but avoidance does nothing to help."
20945,"This has carried over to fear of employers, landlords, inspectors, customers, even handling money."
20946,It is Paralyzing.
20947,Panic attacks come on hard when people raise their voices or I feel unprepared for a situation.
20948,I'm told immersion is the best way to desensitize but how do you immerse yourself when your fear is getting in trouble for appearing anxious?
20949,"Medication made me worse because then I acted stoned or dazed all day, or increased my paranoia."
20950,I have been on many medications over the years.
20951,What on earth can I do to desensitize?
20952,I have never had a job where getting yelled at by an employer did not end in me having a full blown panic attack.
20953,It is destroying my life.
20954,Every little mistake I think I make leads to wild conclusions and me vomiting for the rest of the day.
20955,"TL;DR: PTSD from years of verbal abuse created Phobia of authority, Now I'm scared of everything."
20956,Therapists and meds have not helped or made things worse.
20957,How can I desensitize myself?
20958,"I'm a little aprehensive about medication, but when I started to panic last night I took a pill and it did help within 30 minutes."
20959,Now I'm worried that I'll still panic at work... even with the medication.
20960,"And my meds...and so I wait for them to kick in and work, to remove these thoughts for now and wait...wait for the storms of life to return and to go through this again."
20961,*This is my first post here.
20962,"The sub seems really supportive so far, but I've had some bad experiences with ""supportive"" subs and comments saying that I deserve what's happened to me or that I'm making a big deal of nothing, or worse."
20963,Please don't comment to be cruel or hateful.
20964,Please.
20965,"*

Background: I have PTSD and a few other disorders that stem from that due to being abused by mental healthcare professionals."
20966,"This makes me very fearful of anyone in mental healthcare, but especially psychiatrists."
20967,"I usually can trust anyone my therapist sends me to because he only refers me to people he knows personally, but I'm having a hard time since he referred me to a psychiatrist."
20968,"More recently, I've been having trouble at work because of my anxiety."
20969,I come in late because I get physically sick almost every morning before work because I'm so afraid of seeing people.
20970,I have panic attacks every day at work to the point that I'm hyperventilating and I've even collapsed a few times because of it.
20971,This also makes me afraid that someone at work will call someone to take me away and hurt me.
20972,"To put this in perspective, I love my job."
20973,I work with animals and get to cuddle with puppies and kittens all day - it's the best job ever.
20974,That doesn't stop me from being terrified all day.
20975,"I'm afraid of getting fired due to my anxiety and then never being able to work again because no job could ever be better than this, if I could ever get hired again."
20976,"I have panic attacks and flashbacks very frequently, a few times a week that aren't work-related.This is amazing improvement from before when I was living with my parents; life was basically one big panic attack."
20977,It never stopped.
20978,"Even though my living situation has changed and I'm a lot happier, I still have attacks."
20979,"I sometimes have trouble sleeping because of my anxiety, but that's ~3 times a month."
20980,My panic attacks last about an hour each and my flashbacks can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 6 hours.
20981,My flashbacks cause memory loss during that time and serious derealization.
20982,"About once or twice week I have derealization episodes without having a flashback, normally when I'm overstimulated (grocery shopping is a biggie, being in crowds, after particularly intense panic attacks...) and I'm afraid that I'll get hurt someday because I wander around aimlessly and it usually happens in public."
20983,I've gotten lost quite a few times because of it and I don't think it would be a stretch for me to wander into traffic or something like that.
20984,I'm currently in therapy once a week.
20985,I just stopped EMDR a few weeks ago because the therapist said that my fears are entirely rational and it's unethical and probably impossible to get rid of them.
20986,"So, that brings me to now."
20987,"This Friday, I have a psychiatrist appointment with someone my therapist referred me to."
20988,I had a psychiatrist before who made fun of me when BuSpar didn't work and told my mother everything I told her.
20989,"I'm afraid that this psychiatrist:

1."
20990,"Will deem me ""untreatable"" like my last one
2."
20991,"Will hurt me (and my therapist won't be able to help because people believe psychiatrists over therapists, or that my therapist isn't actually as trustworthy as he's made himself out to be which has happened to me before)
3."
20992,"Will think I'm seeking drugs to abuse or sell and then I'll never be able to get any medicine to help me 

I've tried Zoloft and it almost killed me, Prozac which helped with my PMDD before I got on birth control but is useless for anxiety, and BuSpar which literally did nothing."
20993,"From what I've read, it sounds like klonopin might be right for me but I can't take it all the time which is scary."
20994,Most other medicines make me panic just when I think about the name because I heard them when I was being abused.
20995,I know it doesn't make any sense but PTSD isn't known for making you logical.
20996,I feel like if I take those medicines then I'll be abused again.
20997,I think if I explain this to the doctor then she'll think I'm just looking to get high and then no reputable doctor will ever help me.
20998,"Like, even I know that I need another medicine with klonopin because you can't take it all the time, but just the names are so terrifying and even thinking them makes me want to hide and cry."
20999,Maybe I could find a list online of all the medicines and cross out the scary ones for the doctor...
21000,"Still, that might come across as I'm telling her what to do and trying to get drugs to abuse or whatever."
21001,"I guess my questions are:

1."
21002,"How can I not come across as drug-seeking, but still get my point across?"
21003,2.
21004,"If this doctor is awful and doesn't listen to me and thinks I'm seeking drugs, can I go to another doctor or will it permanently be on my file?"
21005,3.
21006,How can I not just break down the second I go into her office?
21007,Right now I feel like a cow walking into a slaughterhouse...
21008,I'm afraid that if I go in having a panic attack then she'll hurt me.
21009,"I'm seeing my therapist right after I get done with the doctor, but I just don't know how I'll make it until then."
21010,I am a 36 year-old man and I have had severe social anxiety disorder for 17 years.
21011,"For all but 3 of those years, I have lived with my parents."
21012,"I have never had a girlfriend/relationship and not many friends, my whole life."
21013,What are the symptoms of my anxiety?
21014,"My head/neck twitches, I get a headache, my muscles stiffen up, my heart pounds, diarrhea, stomach cramps, I cannot think straight, and I feel tense all over."
21015,"I usually do not get all of those symptoms at the same time, but I always get at least one of those to a severe degree."
21016,When do I experience anxiety?
21017,Anytime I leave my “room”.
21018,"Yeah, I am 36 and still only have a room."
21019,I have a hard time just being around my parents.
21020,I often have a hard time getting through a checkout line at the grocery store.
21021,My muscles often stiffen up and I tremble.
21022,"In pretty much any situation where there are people, I have a lot of anxiety that always involves physical symptoms."
21023,"Xanax helps a little, but not much."
21024,What has my life been like with severe social anxiety?
21025,I have been mostly isolated in a room with a computer and t.v.
21026,for most of the 17 years.
21027,I guess you can imagine what that might be like.
21028,"For awhile, I had a vehicle and got out a little, but my dad decided to sell it a few years ago, so he could afford another vacation."
21029,"My parents support me, but that is about it."
21030,They do not care enough to help.
21031,"They do not want to spend time or money on me, so I can get better."
21032,"They just ignore me and go on with life, like nothing is wrong."
21033,"They go on vacations, etc."
21034,instead of paying money for therapy.
21035,I have no friends and have never really had many.
21036,Relatives do not care and ignore me or insult me.
21037,I guess things could be worse though.
21038,"My parents could have let me go homeless, as my mother reminds me when I ask why they did not help me."
21039,"Some people sure have it worse, but my parents have/had the means to help and they did not."
21040,"That makes me really sad that they care more about going on vacations, etc."
21041,instead of helping their own son!
21042,"Maybe it has always been up to me to help myself out, on my own."
21043,"I have tried, but it is pretty hard when your head twitches, your muscles freeze up, and you often cannot think straight, etc."
21044,around people!
21045,A lot of people treat me like I have the power to help myself.
21046,"They do not believe my anxiety is bad and they think I am just “lazy.”
What treatments have I tried?"
21047,"As far as medications go, I have tried almost all of the SSRIs and SNRIs, multiple times."
21048,"I have tried MAOIS and tricyclic antidepressants, multiple times."
21049,"I have tried many other drugs off-label: anti-psychotics, Gabapentin, etc."
21050,etc.
21051,I have tried so many things and I cannot remember them all.
21052,"Doctors and myself gave up, awhile back."
21053,I was told that I was in the “refractory group” and that the only thing that would work for me is “gene therapy”.
21054,"As far as psychotherapy goes, I have tried a few things."
21055,"Mostly relaxation and biofeedback stuff, awhile back."
21056,I think something like C.B.T.
21057,"might work, but I cannot afford it, since I have no income or health insurance."
21058,What are the causes of my anxiety?
21059,"I am not sure, but I am guessing it is a combination of genetics and environment."
21060,My father has bipolar disorder and some O.C.D.
21061,My grandfather was somewhat of a hermit/loner and I suspect he may have had social anxiety.
21062,"Nobody really talked about it though and for many years, I did not think there was anything wrong with him."
21063,I had to experience S.A.D.
21064,first to figure it out.
21065,He found a way to work around his anxiety though and self-treated with alcohol and cigarettes.
21066,His life could have been much better though.
21067,"A big problem with society is that many people do not talk about mental illnesses,  even today."
21068,"I guess it is better than it used to be, but mostly people just ignore people with mental illness and the problem itself."
21069,I have always been a bit different.
21070,"Somewhat of a free spirit, I guess."
21071,"When I was growing up, I did not like sports and I just never fit in."
21072,My father’s O.C.D.
21073,"and control freak personality, meant that I could not have many toys."
21074,"He could not stand clutter, so I could not have toys out."
21075,"So, eventually I stopped getting toys and just got books."
21076,He was too overprotective too.
21077,I just did not get to do the same things other kids got to do.
21078,"I got glasses in 4th grade and my vision has progressively become worse and worse, since then."
21079,"It turns out that I have Keratoconus, a progressive eye disease."
21080,"So, my glasses kept getting thicker, I got braces, I was fat, and I was different."
21081,"All of that added up to getting bullied and ignored, up through Junior High."
21082,"In 8th grade, I got contacts, got my braces off, and slimmed down."
21083,I fought back at bullies and won.
21084,It did not matter though.
21085,The damage was done.
21086,I generally was ignored in High School.
21087,"I did get attention from girls starting at age 17, because I was good looking, but I just was too aloof and shy to get anywhere."
21088,That happens why you are ignored and isolated.
21089,"When I was 19, it all hit me hard."
21090,My neck started twitching at work and I started getting tension headaches.
21091,"I ended up being fired, and that is when my severe anxiety started."
21092,"I tried college, but I was just too anxious to be able to stay in class for long."
21093,"My head and neck was always tense and twitched, I got diarrhea and cramps, and I was generally nervous."
21094,"I later went back to a Community College, starting in my late 20s, and I eventually got an Associates degree in Computer Science."
21095,I had to be doped up on a lot of Xanax and Klonopin (benzos) to get through it though and it was tough.
21096,"I built up a tolerance to the benzos and so they do not really help anymore, and they are just bad drugs."
21097,I eventually got off of them and I still in protracted withdrawal.
21098,Why did I write all of this up?
21099,I don’t know.
21100,I have been really depressed lately.
21101,"It maybe part of protracted benzo withdrawal, as I have read that that is common."
21102,I have been thinking about how much my anxiety has affected my life and I do not see much hope.
21103,"It is hard to have much hope in life when you are disabled and nobody cares about you, for so long."
21104,Any advice?
21105,Update: thanks for the advice
21106,"I've been on medication for about 4 years now and it has helped a good bit, but recently I have been having some issues."
21107,"My meds allow me to hang out with friends and do somewhat normal things, but when it comes to going to a party or doing anything with a lot of people I can't do it."
21108,Should I talk to my doctor and increase my meds again?
21109,I thought maybe the medicine was actually the cause of the problem so I slowly stepped my dose to .25mg 2x/day which seems to have relieved some of the issue...but I'm not sure if that's a direct cause and effect.
21110,Anyone experienced something similar or have any more knowledge about the meds?
21111,Anyone have suggestions for medication combos that work well for panic attacks (mostly at night)?
21112,I'm not currently on any medication because they all ruined my already horrible sleep schedule.
21113,"Therefore, I can't go to a psychiatrist to get actual proper treatment/medication."
21114,"I need medication now so I can get rid of the anxiety enough to get a job, which will in turn give me my own health insurance where I can get the proper help I need."
21115,How much of the previous paragraph can I tell the doctor so that I get the medication and not have to go to a psychiatrist?
21116,"Any good medication you guys know of that isn't addictive, acts fast and is helpful for anxiety?"
21117,"I am not on any medication and never have been, nor have I ever taken any drugs."
21118,I fear that I might have to go on meds in order to rectify this.
21119,"For a long time I battled hearing that Anxiety was a mental illness, to me when I hear that term I think of people in institutions that require daily dosing of heavy duty medication."
21120,I went to the doctor who prescribed me medication for my acid reflux.
21121,"Yes, the allergy medicine."
21122,I asked her if she really meant the allergy medication and she asked me what I thought hydroxyzine was.
21123,I've been dealing with low blood pressure events lately.
21124,"It's scary -- dizzy, nausea, blurred vision, clammy hands."
21125,Had a panic attack because I had just taken a medication and had flashes back to when I've had bad side effects from medications.
21126,"It's really tough tonight because I'm about to leave work and my friends are busy, can't really talk."
21127,Blargh.
21128,"If anyone would be up for messaging tonight on here, that would help me feel less alone."
21129,"Hey there guys , first time posting , long time lurker but after these past weeks I felt why not express how I've been feeling this last week or so ."
21130,"This month I've had a few traumatic incidents occur, one being the passing of my beloved dog of 12 years ( I'm 19 so she's been a great buddy to me my whole life )  and the other is experiencing my 3 year old niece not wake up after a nap calling for an ambulance and promptly a long hospital visit ."
21131,"Leading to spinal taps , testing , and so forth ."
21132,These two are the best things I have in my life as I'm not much for materialistic things .
21133,Since then I've been having terrible anxiety attacks ( more so a panic since it's so sudden and scary feeling ) Also Since the attacks started happening I've also been sick with a bad virus that my little niece also had so this caused gas pain in my chest and stomach quite often which I thought at first was a serious heart condition or sickness .
21134,Since the traumatic experience I've been having the attacks on and off but learned to understand that it's anxiety and not some condition causing bodily harm.
21135,However I'm still unable to reason with myself WHILE it's occurring which is scary as all hell since I want to function normally day to day .
21136,It makes my left arm tingle and tighten and generally makes me feel on the verge of passing out .
21137,I know being sick doesn't help while dealing with anxiety so that could be why it's felt so extreme considering I haven't been sick in a while .
21138,But I feel like it's changing me mentally and physically since it's such a hard strain on my mind .
21139,I'm not here for sympathy at all I just figured the reddit community in /r/anxiety would understand a bit and maybe help me with some fix in' upin' with all this crap going on .
21140,I've always been sheltered by my mother who also has terrible anxiety even worse since she's on meds for it .
21141,And these events have taken a toll on me making her get worse anxiety since she knows this might be contributed by her constant anxiety and stress about me and my we'll being .
21142,I just have some questions for you bros out there dealing with the same stuff .
21143,( a little bit of background about me and my life !
21144,"I'm 19 years old , been living in a mobile home since age 10 when we left our old home due to being screwed over by a family member with rent ."
21145,"I've always been low income , very low compared to my friends but I always kept on par with being happy regardless of the amount of money ."
21146,Currently unemployed and doing whatever I can to make my mother happy with little to no money .
21147,"Whether it be cleaning the house , remodeling her back yard and generally just doing whatever I can to make things easy on her ."
21148,"My mother and father came from a very very , like seriously VERY bad past and the way they hold there stride makes me feel so proud of them in more ways than imaginable ."
21149,Unfortunately my father has a drinking problem which makes me a bit sad as we'll as I can't stand to see something happen to my mom or dad .
21150,We function fine even with arguing and typically never having what most would call enough .
21151,I've been smoking weed and cigarettes since a young age too but quit cigarettes a few months ago and dwindled down the pot intake since it was noticeably making me less productive .
21152,So taking all this into consideration I just wanna know some stuff from you amazing people out there! )
21153,DONT FEEL OBLIGATED TO ANSWER THEM ALL !
21154,I JUST THREW WHAT WHAT I FELT OUT THERE AND ANY INPUT HELPS !
21155,Question 1: What do you do as soon as you feel the anxiety coming on ?
21156,Question 2: Does being sick cause you to usually feel worse anxiety than normal ?
21157,Question 3: What ways do you cope and not have to take medications ?
21158,"( I'm very against prescription medications , especially for anxiety as in some cases it makes people different ) 

Question 4: Does physical and mental exercise really help with anxiety ?"
21159,Question 5: Can this anxiety be caused from these sudden traumatic events instead of just built up bs over my whole life ?
21160,Question 6: How can I help myself and my mother work on this together ?
21161,Question 7: Does anyone else feel like there brain goes a million miles a second during the panic attack / feel like your in a movie ?
21162,Question 8: Does anxiety make you feel detached from reality / loss of any human feelings you should normally have considering I'm a sympathetic and loving person ?
21163,"Question 9: Has smoking weed caused you guys to get more anxiety or less , cause I'm having mixed feeling but still have been holding against it regardless since a straight train of thought has been helping more or less ."
21164,"But still have mixed feelings :/ 

Question 10: I'm not going insane right bros ?"
21165,"❤️

Sorry for making this so long I haven't ever vented that much and anyone who reads through and gives solid input I appreciate it more than you can imagine !!"
21166,Seriously your fucking awesome and it means a lot !
21167,"Sorry for typos I'm on my iPhone laying on the couch at the moment , thanks again bros (:"
21168,"I'm currently involved in a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy program to address my severe social anxiety, with a primary focus on my phobic reaction to public speaking."
21169,"First of all, I want to say that I see many of you are unhappy with your therapeutic programs and your prescriptions."
21170,"I completely understand, I tried 2 counselors, 1 psychiatrist, and countless medications (prescribed and illicit) to no avail."
21171,"Finally, last year, I found an awesome CBT clinic for panic and anxiety disorders nearby, and it has COMPLETELY changed my life."
21172,"I recommend you all do some research on local CBT clinics (they are, unfortunately, not incredibly easy to find)."
21173,"So, the Behavioral part of CBT involves creating a hierarchy of ""Exposures"", which are situations characteristic of those that cause you severe anxiety, ranked in order from least-anxiety-provoking and least-likely-to-avoid to most-anxiety-provoking and most-likely-to-avoid."
21174,"Your task is to start doing these exposures (often times as role-plays in the safety of your therapist's office) until you retrain your brain to realize that you aren't in danger (it's more complicated than that, but I'm sure you're already sick of reading)."
21175,"I am scheduled to give a presentation about myself tomorrow in class, which is my absolute highest-end exposure."
21176,A year ago I wouldn't even be thinking about doing this.
21177,"Tonight I feel pretty capable, a manageable amount of nervousness, and a tiny bit of excitement to do it."
21178,"Really guys, I suggest looking into CBT."
21179,"Even if there isn't a clinic nearby, there are tons of great workbooks that will walk you through the process."
21180,Sometimes people are 100% successful doing it themselves.
21181,"Thanks for reading, this subreddit has also provided a major space for me to feel comfortable and not so crazy."
21182,I truly appreciate that.
21183,"TL; DR: read the title

UPDATE: I just got back from the class I had to present in, and it went AWESOMELY!"
21184,"I volunteered to go first, something I'd never have done in the past."
21185,"I was nearly puking with nerves beforehand, my anticipatory anxiety is always horrible, but as I got into it I started to habituate and the whole thing went incredibly well."
21186,My Professor even said I set the bar really high for subsequent presentations.
21187,"Thank you all for your comments and support, really."
21188,I checked this thread before my class and was incredibly comforted by all of your words.
21189,Truly.
21190,Thanks again!
21191,I have been on lexapro for about 3-4 months and haven't really noticed too much of a difference honestly.
21192,Ever since the end of highschool I have felt a sort of depression which has stemmed from lonliness and probably social anxiety.
21193,"I tried Effexor for about a week until I read up on the brain zaps even when tapering slowly off, so I switched to Prozac which I believed didn't help at all (it probably was, but I wasn't doing anything with my life so I still felt pretty depressed) and then switched to Lexapro and have been on it for about 3 months."
21194,"I don't really get the lows that I used to get every so often but I still wasnt feeling great or even somewhat good, just alright."
21195,"So I thought to myself maybe it wasn't working and decided to talk to pdoc about switching medications

He recommended Cymbalta as the next choice so I tapered down to 10 mg Lexapro by cutting my pills in half as stated by doctor."
21196,After the 3rd day (yesterday) of being on 10 mg I noticed chest pain in my upper left chest similar to the feeling of anxiety.
21197,"The whole switching thing has really been stressing me out as I havent had any side effects from the lexapro but no real crazy 'improvement' either, which was probably stupid of me to think, but I thought that the cymbalta might give me more of a lift."
21198,"Today was the 4th day I was supposed to be on 10 mg but I decided to just take the whole pill hoping all would be back to normal, nope."
21199,"Worse

Increase in anxiety, twitching, jaw clenching, chest and stomach pain still in full effect."
21200,What have I done.
21201,I can't contact my pdoc until tomorrow and I do not know what I should do....
21202,I've been getting worked up constantly and I've decided I'm going to try medication.
21203,"I'm the last person who'd want to take meds, but I'm to the point now where I'm COMPLETELY fed up."
21204,"I've taken some unused pain-meds from cabinets in my house before when I just needed to feel ok for a few hours, but its not worth the shame I felt afterwards."
21205,"And I don't want to take medication I just want to lose weight and find peace, and be happy, and have a life, anxiety free..."
21206,"My blood pressure came back a bit high (because I was nervous about seeing a new doctor) and despite my efforts to explain that I really needed help, the doctor said my anxiety was BECAUSE of my blood pressure and prescribed high blood pressure meds!!"
21207,"I didn't take them, because if he had bothered listening, most of my family has issues with blood pressure meds."
21208,"Hello,


Throwaway here because friends know my username."
21209,I've been anxious my entire life and up until now I've been able to deal with it.
21210,I'm in my senior year of college and I've taken a job with a lot of responsibility.
21211,I like excitement of working in a high-pressure environment but the stress it is causing is finally bringing my anxiety to the surface and I can't keep it in check as well as I have been able to in years past.
21212,"So, I set up an appointment with a psychiatrist."
21213,"I have a lot of questions, but I'll try to limit the questions that I can ask the doctor."
21214,What should I expect the appointment to be like?
21215,Will the doctor ask me questions or will I need to explain the details of my situation?
21216,Will I need to take a test?
21217,"If so, it is some kind of physical test or a questionnaire?"
21218,What are some good questions that I should ask the doctor?
21219,Should I expect to leave the office with a prescription and a plan of action after the first appointment?
21220,How much time does a typical first appointment take?
21221,What prescriptions would you guys recommend?
21222,I don't want to take anything that gives me a high or a low.
21223,I don't want to take anything that affects my cognitive ability.
21224,"(I'm guessing the doctor would be the proper person to talk to about this, but I'm completely uninformed about the medications that exist.)"
21225,How soon should I expect to start feeling better?
21226,Does anxiety really ever go away?
21227,Should I expect my personality to change?
21228,"If so, how will it change?"
21229,Thanks
21230,"I'm on medication (150mg Wellbutrin &amp; 50mg Zoloft) and have a therapist, and while I'm definitely on the right track to getting better, I still have my issues."
21231,"I keep trying things like medication and attempting to convince myself I'll be okay, but it never works."
21232,i've kissed a girl when i was about 12. i've suffered some severe social anxiety/depression for a number of years and got to councilling/been on meds and yet i'm still terrified.
21233,"I know medication cannot be the only answer, but I think I am in an extreme state of anxiety lately, and I feel Ive tried every non medicinal way I know of with no relief."
21234,"I guess my very long winded question is, what should i do/what can i say to my family physician to get him to see that anxiety medication would benefit me."
21235,TL;DR:  what should i do/what can i say to my family physician to get him to see that anxiety medication would benefit me.
21236,"Therapists, medications, doctors, not to mention the travel involved, fuck."
21237,"I can rarely afford bus fare to look for a job or go to college, I live in a 3 bedroom trailer with 7 other people, for fucks sake if I survive poverty then anxiety will surely finish me off."
21238,"Even if somehow possible that I could obtain any help, I cannot put that on my family."
21239,"We move constantly because we can't pay rent, and since we don't stay somewhere very long, I never had friends or built relations that would possibly aid me."
21240,"I'm Hispanic, but I can't even join a fucking gang to mask my individual insecurity as I am mixed yet cannot fit in with white people either."
21241,"That's  what poor do, they suffer economically but can find haven socially."
21242,"But I cannot do either, I've been bullied my whole life by white people and Hispanics alike, for being brown and not looking dark enough, not to mention my physical appearance, so I belong nowhere."
21243,"So, to recap: Not white, poor, and ugly."
21244,Come the fuck at me.
21245,"I am looking to consult with my doctor tomorrow about medication, and I am interested to know what you are taking and how well it has worked for you."
21246,I'm finally pursuing medication (as an adjunct to the CBT and meditation I'm already doing).
21247,"This situation is not the sole reason for my wanting to go on meds - the anxiety affects other areas of my life too, just happens most pervasively with my love relationship."
21248,"Before I ask a non-psychiatrist about medication, is there anything I should keep in mind?"
21249,Specific meds I should ask about?
21250,"Hi r/Anxiety,

I thought I'd turn to you for some advice to see if anyone has ever dealt with something similar."
21251,Ever since I was ~12 years old my fear of flying has become overwhelming.
21252,To the point that I threw a temper tantrum at an airport when I was 17 and then physically couldn't get on a flight for a conference when I was 21.
21253,I've tried different medications and once took way too many and my family had a hard time waking me up on the airplane.
21254,I've also developed a fear of elevators especially after getting stuck on one for literally 2 minutes.
21255,"I've been seeing a psychologist to try to get over the fear, but I feel that it's never going to happen."
21256,"The older I get, the worse my fears are."
21257,This fear has affected my life.
21258,For example I've turned down a great job because of my fear of flying.
21259,The thought of accepting the job seemed like suicide to me.
21260,I feel discouraged and sad.
21261,I'm beginning to accept that I will always be a fearful and anxious person.
21262,I literally can't get myself to go on an elevator anymore.
21263,Has anyone dealt with something similar and gotten over it?
21264,How did you do so?
21265,Any advice is welcome and appreciated.
21266,"Regarding medication, I was on Lexapro of varying dosages from the age of fifteen until last December – I had tapered down to 5 mg already, but I couldn't afford it any longer once I turned 26 and was no longer on my father's insurance."
21267,"I believe I need to get on some kind of anti-anxiety medication, but that is such a daunting prospect not just because of the issues of doctors and finances, but because of how much trial and error it might take to find something that works."
21268,"Hopefully, I can work on getting medication through them, or they can help me find someone who can get me started on that."
21269,Obviously I would need to see a doctor/psychologist first.
21270,I would like to hear about your experiences with different types of medications that can me overcome social anxiety/depression/bipolar disorders.
21271,I am scared to try any medications because I heard a number of bad stories particularly when it comes to antidepressants.
21272,"I'm not totally sure if this is a side effect from switching medications, but I didn't have this problem on my last meds, so I'm assuming."
21273,"I recently switched from Paroxetine to Sertraline, and I've noticed that I've been cold sweating every night for about a week."
21274,"I know cold sweats can be anxiety itself, but I've never had this issue before."
21275,"I've woken up every night freezing, but drenched in sweat."
21276,"I've never sweated this much in my sleep before (I honestly don't think I've sweat this much doing work or exercising either) I've began drinking more water in case it becomes dangerous, but I'm more so curious if anyone else has experienced this with Sertraline."
21277,Is it possible for me to get medication in my financial situation?
21278,I did it because I ran out of meds and money to refill them.
21279,"I'm very weary about medications as the side effects always freak me out, especially Seroquel."
21280,My family doctor prescribed it to me a few days ago as I didn't sleep at all one night and she said for me to try it for a bit.
21281,I've had a massive headache for the past 2 weeks that hasn't gone away and I read that this medication can cause migraines.
21282,I can't handle anymore headaches.
21283,It's 25mg - the lowest dose -  and it's now 5:30am and I can't seem to fall asleep.
21284,Would this be too late to take it?
21285,"I am worried he will think I am looking for medication and to get signed off work,  which I am not."
21286,"So yeah, just wanting to ask what medications you take for anxiety?"
21287,"So, redditors who are and have been on meds...do you really think the breathing room the drugs give you are worth the side effects and the fact that your brain now needs drugs to function?"
21288,"Meanwhile, though my counselling is covered by the county health system until January, medication would not be."
21289,"And at this point, I feel that medication is an absolute necessity."
21290,It would be easier to get medication.
21291,I want to know if medication would help me make that final push into the no more anxiety at all.
21292,Has anyone else lost their appetite while on medication?
21293,"It's not just anxiety medication I need, I want to try a new antidepressant again(for the 4th time)."
21294,"I know I want a low dose anxiety medication until I've had more counseling, do I just state that blatantly?"
21295,What can I expect with the new medication?
21296,He is completely against going to a psychiatrist on a regular basis and refuses to be on any medication.
21297,"But there really is no time for therapy or money for medication, nothing."
21298,I was put on some meds and have started a bit of therapy but have yet to get far.
21299,"I have to leave for an appointment in 2 hours to the city haven't slept to see a psychiatrist for medication, I have ADD aswell and need to get a script filled to help me get through uni and hopefully make me feel better, I'm scared that its going to make my anxiety worse."
21300,How long should I give the citalopram before I think about upping the dose or trying to new medication?
21301,"I just feel a lot of guilt because I had beaten anxiety without medication, and now I'm in this hole again."
21302,"But when I think about my anxiety, I get this overwhelming fear about my need for the medication."
21303,I get really worried that 20mg is alot and one day the medicine might lose it's effectiveness on me and I won't be able to be prescribed more.
21304,"Been through benzos, SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, AAP, and the meds don't get me where I need to be."
21305,"I feel like such an utter failure when I have to take emergency meds for it, or I have to run out of the classroom because the room is spinning, or I have to leave my groceries in the middle of the store and cry in my car."
21306,do they often prescribe medication right away or therapy?
21307,In the last 4 nights I've slept about 12 hours total.
21308,I slept for almost 5 hours last night.
21309,I guess that's an improvement.
21310,"I was prescribed 30 .5mg tabs of Xanax at the beginning of the month, instructed to take 1.5mg a day as needed."
21311,I realized about a week ago that I have less than half left and have been taking the full recommended dosage nearly every day.
21312,I haven't taken any in the past few days and it's giving me all kinds of side effects.
21313,"Insomnia, mood swings/dysphoria, no appetite to speak of either."
21314,I just don't want to be dependent on the stuff.
21315,I'm trying to curb my habit before it becomes more serious.
21316,"I'm a high-functioning individual and highly independent, so I can't be sleepy through my day."
21317,"I had an energy drink this morning just to not fall asleep at my desk, but it's making me twitchy and restless, and now I have tachycardia."
21318,I always have a few mg of Xanax on me for emergencies.
21319,It's so hard not to take one right now.
21320,"I don't really know where I'm going with this :\ I just wanted to talk about it, somewhere."
21321,"I know it could be so much worse on a higher dosage, but it's affecting me anyway and it sucks."
21322,Do any of you take Ativan?
21323,I've been thinking about switching.
21324,Xanax lasts for only so long and makes me so tired.
21325,Other medications: 30mg Paxil
21326,"The medicine is helping, but I'm still feeling the thrawls of the episode."
21327,"Fast forward to now, years of anxiety treatment and different medication regimens and a stay at a psyche ward after I was diagnosed with depression."
21328,About this time last year I lost my grandfather.
21329,"I already had moderate anxiety, but this set off my first truly debilitating panic attack."
21330,I was put on Zoloft with Xanax for emergencies.
21331,"I never really felt the Zoloft did anything, good or bad- although I was on lowest possible dose the entire time I was on it."
21332,After a few months I got off the meds altogether.
21333,"Anxiety didn't go away, but it settled enough that I was able to keep it under control through other means."
21334,"This meant going to the gym (which I hate, but it helps) and doing everything I can to maintain a good sleep schedule."
21335,"Anyways (sorry I realize I'm rambling), I recently got laid off from my job."
21336,"That, and being stuck in my house all day for weeks led to my anxiety building and my sleep schedule falling apart."
21337,"There were a few other things- my brother is somewhere where there was a nationally televised shooting (he's fine, but we had a very stressful day until we heard from him)."
21338,This all came to a head and ended up with me having a panic attack bad enough that I had to be brought to the emergency room last weekend.
21339,"I'd never had anything close to this bad, truly believed I was going to die."
21340,They gave me a small amount of Xanax and had me make an appointment with my physician.
21341,I told my physician that I had been on Zoloft before and felt that it was a waste of time.
21342,"She gave me a prescription for situational Xanax, but said that if I still feel I need it in a month, she thinks I should be on a daily medication."
21343,"I haven't reached full blown panic attack level, but my baseline has been *very* anxious since the initial panic attack."
21344,"My physiician understood my apprehension because of my previous experience with Zoloft, and was very open to discussing any other options if I end up getting on something (which I anticipate I will)."
21345,"I'm not entirely opposed to Zoloft, because I think the dose I had been on before was basically what they give you off the bat to make sure you aren't allergic to it."
21346,A good friend of mine also had really bad anxiety-could hardly leave his apartment- and has said Celexa worked wonders for him (and it shows in how well he has flourished as a person since his struggles).
21347,"Sorry for the long winded explanation, considering my question is pretty simple."
21348,I'm really just wondering what anyone else's experiences are with different medications.
21349,"I know we're all different, but any food for thought would be greatly appreciated before my followup appointment."
21350,I hope you all are doing okay and staying strong.
21351,Anxiety fucking sucks.
21352,The peace and satisfaction they bloomed in me was better than any medicine I can imagine.
21353,"Note: When my anxiety medication wears off, I now GET anxiety immediately."
21354,After that I decided I didn't want to depend on the medication any more and started working with a Psychologist on my anxiety.
21355,I started it 14 days ago and I felt like it is the right medication to help me quit lorazepam completely.
21356,Usually my medicine helps me more quickly than that but I think it was only partially responsible.
21357,I am beginning to think meds are the way to go.
21358,The reason I am considering meds is because it is the only option I have yet to try.
21359,Literally petrified.
21360,"I work in a somewhat medical field (pharmacy), and every day I have people coming in for all sorts of dementia, cancer, heart, brain, you name it medications, adult diapers, and the likes."
21361,"I'm only 24 and I have a bad back due to a leg being longer than the other, IBS, anxiety, and to top it off a hypochondriac."
21362,"But I've recently been dwelling on the fact that that could me one day, in the nursing home bedridden or not being able to control my bowels, heart attacks, strokes."
21363,Ahhhh!
21364,I've never been in the hospital for anything but an X-ray.
21365,I'm terrified in inevitably ending up in one.
21366,I'm terrified of the effects of aging and dying...I don't want to die!
21367,"And every day at least one person ends up telling me after picking up their meds ""don't get old, it sucks""."
21368,Ughh.
21369,I'm having a little freakout now because I'm nowhere near a hospital or anywhere I can get medication to kill the virus.
21370,Last year I got off a lot of medication because my insurance ran out and I couldn't afford to pay for it anymore.
21371,TLDR; don't know if my anxiety is enough to need therapy/medicine.
21372,"One of my sisters, my mother, my godmother have all suffered from depressions and are on anti-depressant medication."
21373,"She immediately asked how I felt about medication and due to personal experience I am somewhat opposed to it, so she gave me a prescription for counseling and told me to find someone."
21374,"this is causing a strain in my relationship with my boyfriend, he's always telling me i need to see my doctor again or need new medicine, (i do have an appointment in a couple of days.)"
21375,It may be a strange thing but I don't want to take any type of medication because frankly I wouldn't even remember to take it daily.
21376,"Edit: 

I spoke with my doctor about dealing with anxiety with out medication."
21377,(guess I'm all messed up now...) I still have not taken any medication as I am stubborn.
21378,I got through it with no medication (SSRIs) that may make you dependent &amp; sometimes have weird side effects.
21379,"Some people need meds and that works perfect for them and all the power to them, but I made the choice to take the long road of no meds for my crutch (except for .1 milligrams of blood pressure medication to help me get better sleep) and finally I've been attack free for over a month now... which is incredible."
21380,"They don't believe using meds for depression or anxiety is the ""right"" way, because I should just pray for the problem to go away."
21381,"They also believe that any medication will have a bad side effect, so I should just not even consider it."
21382,"For any of you taking meds, is it helping you, and are these side effects enough to deter you?"
21383,"I don't believe there would be meds if they were really that bad, right?"
21384,""", I mean they will let me go to a doctor to have them decide if I need meds or not, but not without a guilt trip and practically implying that the problem comes from me and I should (again) begin relying on God."
21385,She wasn't even qualified to prescribe meds.
21386,Since I was 10 I have picked at my acne.
21387,"I had it all over my back, arms, chest, and face."
21388,"15 years after it first developed I went to a dermatologist and am now on two different medications, guess what?"
21389,IT'S WORKING!
21390,!!
21391,Now comes the hard part.
21392,I am loosing my relief from my daily anxiety build up.
21393,"I did in my opinion very minor damage while picking,  I learned to be careful and ways to minimize damage as I got older."
21394,"I don't have any other self destructive behavior (as far as I know) no smoking,  rarely drink and am a functional 24 year old chick with a job, car and roommates."
21395,I don't know what to do to release that tension anymore.
21396,It was a coping mechanism for more than half my life and any others I come up with are time consuming.
21397,Does anyone have any productive methods or ideas for dealing with the daily build up?
21398,"I have mild social anxiety, and some situational anxiety."
21399,"It's so hard to describe, I am a bartender and I dislike talking to too many people."
21400,"Also I have a fair bit of anxiety about my skin being super oily, if people comment on it my stress level skyrockets."
21401,I really hope it's not something really serious because I don't want her to be given anti-psychotic medication because the side effects sound horrible.
21402,Sure I take meds and they seem to work for the most part.
21403,What are the potential side effects of i guess any sort of medication i would take if i opted to do so?
21404,I think I need to be on some type of medication.
21405,I tried other meds like propranolol and buspirone but they didn't do much.
21406,I know of a medication that works wonders for me - the problem is my doctor won't prescribe it to me.
21407,"I don't like the idea of being on mind altering medication like that permanently, and since I don't feel like this all the time, don't think its necessary for me."
21408,I hate taking new medication because I hate side effects... particularly in regards to my stomach :\  But the idea of not constantly feeling like shit or like I'm hung over 24/7 sounds very appealing.
21409,When confronted with hard topics I lose myself to anxiety and panic attacks.
21410,I hit myself in the head and leave bruises and swelling.
21411,"I've been seeing doctors, psychiatrists, multiple medications over the past four months, but I cannot shake my self harming or panic attacks away."
21412,My selfishness and anxious actions are the salt in the wound for my relationship.
21413,"I've been trying to work things out in my relationship but every step forward I think I take, all it takes is one question or one trigger and I'm off hitting myself and isolating myself, shaking, hysterically crying and making an already bad situation worse by focusing just on myself and my anxiety."
21414,I need help.
21415,My anxiety is ruining my relationship more so than ever and I am feeling so hopeless and so down that I am starting to think about doing more than just hitting myself.
21416,I feel like I can't handle my life or reality and I feel like it's only a downhill and dark path until I eventually die.
21417,"Advice, thoughts, help please."
21418,"We attempted some medication, but it wasn't really effective."
21419,"I quickly made an appointment with a psychiatrist and counselor, and was put on a low dose of meds."
21420,"After a couple of weeks, I started feeling even more anxious, so I decided to stop taking them (I've always been skeptical of medication, so that didn't help)."
21421,"When can I expect to feel better again, assuming that I resume my meds at ~10 a.m.?"
21422,Is medication the answer or can i learn to stop overthinking?
21423,"I don't know what to do anymore - the medication was ineffective, my therapist eventually ended my sessions because, in her words, ""there's nothing more I can teach you, all you can do now is apply what you've learned to situations."""
21424,I finally feel out of options and I am ready to give medication a try.
21425,"I want off of these meds,  but I don't know if I'd be able to handle coming off."
21426,I've been dealing with anxiety for about 12 years now.
21427,"I've never gone to therapy, seen a medical professional, nor taken any medications for it."
21428,Kind of had the mindset that it'll fade away as I get older.
21429,"However, being in my 20's now, I'm just ready to give in and figure that I'll never get better."
21430,"Instead of my anxiety just messing up my life, now it is affecting my relationship with my SO, who is getting tired of my not opening up to him."
21431,"In general, he is just tired of my overwhelming anxiety and all the associated symptoms."
21432,"I have trouble showing affection and being spontaneous around him, which stems from a bad childhood."
21433,"We can't go a week without him bringing up the fact that I'm so distant from him, even though I try to explain somewhat reasons why."
21434,"The truth is, he doesn't even know half of my problems and what I suffer through on a daily basis."
21435,"I feel like I owe it to him to tell him, but I fear rejection and don't want the stigma of the ""crazy girlfriend"" attached to me."
21436,I am now scared to be around my own boyfriend because I don't want to set him off for whatever reason.
21437,I don't know what else to do.
21438,"My plan is to talk with my PCP in the summer, once I get on my own insurance plan, but I'm pessimistic that I can wait that long, in fear of my SO leaving me or me just losing it."
21439,"However, thinking about having to being up the subject to my doctor makes me extremely nervous and panicky."
21440,"So here I am, asking for help and advice on how to deal with my anxiety."
21441,TL;DR // Afraid my boyfriend will leave me due to severe long-term anxiety and want advice on how to mend elationship and my mental state.
21442,With no help from medication or therapy.... i'm so proud of myself.
21443,"I was thinking about asking my gp for medication, but at the same time I am little bit afraid because of ""getting used to the drug"" and other outcomes."
21444,Here is some short background.
21445,There is a psychiatrist that was recommended to me by another doctor.
21446,"The catch is he is in Boston, and I am in Houston, TX."
21447,"The only way that I could get to him for an appointment, would be to fly there or take a train(there are no direct routes and service is sporatic)."
21448,Flying unfortunately is the only viable option.
21449,Here is my concern.
21450,"I don't like crowds, hence airports would suck themselves."
21451,"Of course this comes with the fact that I don't like being in situations I can't get out of, such as being in a line, waiting to go through security(simple stuff I know..)

I fear that if I have a panic attack, at say an airport...it will trigger even more scrutiny with security, therefore making my anxiety worse."
21452,All I can imagine is being taken out of line and dragged to a room and be interrogated because I'm panicking for no reason.
21453,"Besides taking my medicines, is there any other things I can do to avoid having a major anxiety attack if I choose to fly?"
21454,Would airlines be accommodating(I'd pay for 1st class tickets) to people like us?
21455,Should I talk to my doctor about possibly taking a different type of sedative to get me through a rough time?
21456,I'd appreciate some feedback.
21457,-Cheers
21458,"The medicine has successfully calmed me down a bit, but it sucks to sit in a family that hates you."
21459,I'm not on any medication although I have Klonopin for emergencies.
21460,"Honestly, with the combination of meds and therapy and attending NA meetings (I used to have terrible means of dealing with my anxiety) I've been so much better...almost my old self - which is this crazy, not shy, quick and clever girl...but all these changes are happening."
21461,On a new medication that makes me nauseous.
21462,I'd like to start by giving you an example of what happens to me when it comes to my anxiety issues and what medication I have been given by the doctor.
21463,I was wondering if anyone out there takes medication for their Depression and/or Anxiety and how it made them feel and whether they had to be placed on a stronger or weaker dosage?
21464,"While I was out with her my the medication started to come down, I started to feel extremely anxious while I was sitting down, I started shaking and could not focus on my conversation with her which was really bothering me because normally I am very good at making conversation."
21465,I told my grandma (I live with her) what happened and asked her to feel my heart because I thought it was the medication that made me feel so anxious.
21466,"She said ""oh no that's not good, your heart is racing"" (it was about 90BPM resting and my blood pressure was slightly higher than normal) I immediately began to freak out even more thinking that the medication was gonna give me a heart attack or something."
21467,The funny thing was this all started happening 7-8 hours after I took the meds so I doubt they were even in my system still.
21468,As the title says I'm (18/f) about to start these medications for some severe anxiety/depression I've been having.
21469,"Now, I've never taken either one of these medications or any like it."
21470,So I was wondering if I could get some personal experiences on how they worked for you.
21471,I know that each person will react differently but having feedback helps.
21472,"I was on SSRI's and those were awful for me, if that helps."
21473,I have .5mg of Xanax and will start 75mg of Effexor.
21474,Any feedback is appreciated.
21475,Thank you in advance.
21476,I have never had this reaction with the Ativan ( I know certian meds do different things with different people) I was just wondering if anyone here has had a bad reaction with the clona?
21477,"I'm also not on any medication for my anxiety, and am wondering how you guys calm yourselves down without pills."
21478,"That pill was about 6 hours ago, and it's the first allergy medication I took orally since 1 month ago."
21479,"Also, why the hell did my psychiatrist tell me the meds she prescribed for my panic attacks&amp;insomnia are sold on the street as a date rape drug?"
21480,#1 Do drugs/medication help?
21481,Also tried ADHD meds like Adderall and it seems to work too.
21482,I have an appointment on Tuesday with my doctor to discuss options as far as meds and possible therapy.
21483,Or what if I end up putting myself and my baby in danger while I'm pregnant by going off medication for nine months?
21484,I am not one of those people who can manage without medicine.
21485,"At my last Dr visit, I told him my medication still isn't doing anything (on Cipralex, for just over 3 months now)."
21486,"(I've tried meds and therapy, but my oh so clever brain can still tell me all the scenarios of how she doesn't like me, or what not)."
21487,"My son's father has had anxiety since I met him six years ago, he's gone to meetings, therapy and is on medication and still has anxiety which causes him to sometimes not see our son for months at a time."
21488,"Neither do the calm-down meds, so this is in my brain."
21489,I'm worried that my meds aren't working but my doctor seems hesitant to change my antidepressant.
21490,"* Ativan 0.5 mg for emergencies

I also take medication for ADHD which can cause an increase in anxiety but it's actually helped me more than anything else."
21491,I'm really tired of all this and I know it can take a while to find the right medication or for the right medication to work but I just don't feel like the Lexapro is helping.
21492,I'm afraid of medicine because in the past I had a bad drug interaction and it made matters worse.
21493,But during my last two flights the medication had adverse effects and I've been told to stop it and try flying without taking one.
21494,So I just started seeing a psychologist about my anxiety problems and I'm not sure how to go about getting new medication or stick with the same ones.
21495,Have any of these meds worked for you guys?
21496,Any recommendations on any different meds that have worked for you?
21497,"I start noticing that my heart rate is irregular, and that freaks me out, and I literally believe that the medication will kill me while I sleep."
21498,"Could it really be a side-effect of the medication, or is just all in my head?"
21499,"Ive never seen a doctor or taken medication, yet ive had panic attacks seemingly at random or feelings of nervousness and shaking that are extremely hard to tame."
21500,"Its been interfering with my life lately (extreme nervousness, paranoia, violent mood swings, fits of nervous energy revolving around meaningless things, etc) yet I dont feel as though I should get medication."
21501,"I am on medication and I avoid possible triggers, but every night like clockwork, I start getting that really anxious feeling like things aren't quite right or are about to go south."
21502,"My name is Mark, and me and a group of 3 friends (all with a heavy background in psychology, medicine and/or motivational speaking) have decided to launch a portal devoted entirely to Depression."
21503,"- Daily news posts with easy-to-understand (""for dummies"") explanations of what the latest research on depression and depression medication-related topics are saying."
21504,"Hey everyone, first time posting, but I was up late wondering about this so I was hoping you guys could help."
21505,"This always made me wonder, so I figured I'd ask you guys."
21506,"To cut to the chase, about four years ago my anxiety and panic attacks got so bad I couldn't do my job."
21507,My doctor at the time (this was on a military base if that affects anything) prescribed me two medicines he claimed worked well together.
21508,"He said to I believe take them at specific times a day (I think either 3 a day at first, then gradually less, or the other way around; sorry, I can't remember exactly)."
21509,"He said he knew my symptoms and had worked with it before, and said I had an adrenaline problem, that when I had panic attacks my adrenaline would spike, causing all sorts of awful problems."
21510,"He prescriped Risperidone and another medication, I forget what."
21511,"At the time, he seemed to very much understand my symptoms, even guessing that I had frequent urinary tract infections because of my disorder without me thinking to tell him first."
21512,"I was impressed, and glad to get meds to help."
21513,"When I went home and read the instructions, I learned that Risperidone was usually used to treat bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia, and occasionally, autism."
21514,"This, as you can imagine, only increased my anxieties and caused a lot of fear and paranoia."
21515,Did he think I was bi-polar or schizophrenic?
21516,Would he be obligated to tell me if that were so?
21517,Why couldn't I find anywhere online that said this medicine could be used for anxiety attacks?
21518,What could happen if I wasn't supposed to take these?
21519,"Just basically, the fact that these pills weren't specifically for my problem greatly stressed me out, and made me wonder if my problem was greater than I'd thought."
21520,"The other pill I was prescribed, I forget the name."
21521,"But it was generally used (according to its instructions), to treat people who'd formerly had heart attacks?"
21522,"It was mostly used on elderly persons, it had said."
21523,That was weird to; why not just a simple anti-anxiety med?
21524,Was it a military doctor thing?
21525,"The whole thing seemed weird, as neither of my drugs seemed to exactly specify that they would help with panic attacks, adrenaline issues, or anxiety."
21526,Has this happened to you guys?
21527,Is this normal?
21528,Should I have just trusted the doctor?
21529,How rigid are those instructions-papers in usage recomendations?
21530,"Also, anyone with adrenaline problems, any advice on how to keep calm?"
21531,"I get adrenaline flowing pretty easily, as my job is hectic."
21532,"Either way, taking these pills didn't seem to help greatly."
21533,"My panic attacks just seemed to change; it used to feel like the world was in slow motion, and I was in even slower motion."
21534,"yet I just couldn't ""focus"" and make my body and mouth move at the right speed to keep up."
21535,"Like I was far away, yelling at myself to keep up with my job and my body couldn't do it without me."
21536,"But on the medicine, I always heard a whooshing in my ears, and felt a little disconnected from the scene, though not entirely far away like before."
21537,"I felt more alert overall, though still anxious and antsy."
21538,"I seemed to feel less emotions, both good and bad, which ultimately made me want to not take them, as I was scared to pawn off my happiness like that."
21539,"[I know, I'm a mess :(]






Basics:  Female, mid-20's."
21540,US.
21541,This setting was when I was early 20's.
21542,"I have always handled stress poorly, and have had bouts of depression throughout my life."
21543,"I am paranoid, though rationally know it's illogical."
21544,"At the time of this story I was on the birth control shot, Depoprovera, which I believe GREATLY exacerbated my anxiety."
21545,"Panic attacks are generally triggered by loud restaurant-type settings, crowded stores, things like that where I'm overly stimulated and trying to be on my guard."
21546,In school I have breakdowns due to test anxieties and the fear of failure.
21547,I tend to be more hyperactive.
21548,I fidget almost constantly.
21549,"I have a lot of compulsions, though not OCD, mostly things like feeling the need to flex this muscle in my jaw/neck area a lot."
21550,I am in college and suffer very bad test anxiety.
21551,"edit: tl;dr Doctor seemed to know what he was talking about, but prescribed me medicine used to treat bipolor disorder and schizophrenia, and medicine for elderly who had suffered heart attacks and I'm wondering if that's normal/a good idea."
21552,My desperation and stubbornness led me to self medication - I broke my collar bone when I was around 17 and was put on opiates.
21553,"I know I need to see a therapist again, but I'm starting to consider that I may need to start thinking about medication options as well."
21554,"I would like some advice about therapy, or medication, or just any tips or tricks."
21555,"Honestly after 2 months the Buspar wasn't doing anything and was just making me extremely tired all the time so I stopped taking the Buspar, but continued taking my ADHD meds."
21556,"Its never going to go away, but with medication, talking about it openly and therapy."
21557,I have had anxiety issues for as long as I can remember (21f) and I only ever sought help for it in college.
21558,"I've been intermittently going to therapy and taking medications for just over two years now, and the medication(Zoloft) has helped me greatly."
21559,"I am not in counseling or therapy right now due to limited availability, and it's a bit difficult."
21560,"My anxiety tends to worsen in the winter, like many others, and the ""cabin fever"" problem often spirals out of control."
21561,I've been seeing my boyfriend for almost two years.
21562,"He's a very rational dude, pretty much the opposite of me."
21563,"Very low key, has fewer emotions and opinions, and is excellent at behaving under pressure and making educated choices."
21564,"Because of this, he's been endlessly helpful in keeping me on my feet while I struggled through coming to terms with my anxiety and the meds."
21565,"We live in different apartment complexes in the same part of town, only a moments drive away."
21566,We see each other maybe a couple times during the week and always on weekends.
21567,"We don't text much, but always at least call or have a short text conversation every day."
21568,"I find myself getting really anxious over everything when I am alone (even over our relationship, which is in reality very healthy and happy) but I feel 100x better if I can just be near him, physically."
21569,Is it okay to have this sort of safe place in a person?
21570,"I don't drop all of my problems on him, and I try to keep my unnecessary worrying to a minimum when around, but I do disclose to him my medication changes, anything I consider a serious problem or something I absolutely need to talk through, or other important issues."
21571,"He always is able to immediately quell my ""what if"" and ""oh Jesus"" spiraling panics, which I simply cannot do alone."
21572,"I try, and I'm MUCH better than I was two years ago, but i still find myself needing that calm physical presence to keep me grounded."
21573,Sometimes I feel life would be much easier if we lived together because I would worry less and put less strain on myself and our relationship.
21574,"Is this a rational sort of thought process, or am I dangerously using my boyfriend as a crutch?"
21575,"Tl;dr:  Is it ever okay to need somebody because of your anxiety, or should you be able to handle yourself alone?"
21576,I haven't talked to her in a year since I tried and failed to takr Zoloft after I hallucinated from the medication.
21577,Currently I have the cost of my medication covered under my father's insurance.
21578,"They are also skeptical of medication in general (they're into the whole ""natural"" supplement thing)."
21579,"He's on medication for it (I'm not 100% sure what it is), and also has a script for Lorazapam that he'll take if he feels a panic attack coming on (happens a couple times a year)."
21580,"His family's first line of defense has always been medication, which angers me to no end."
21581,"But it's frustrating for me to watch this happen to him, and his first resort is medication without even considering other alternatives like therapy or other lifestyle changes."
21582,"Hey all,

I currently suffer from OCD, GAD and a form of Tic Disorder."
21583,This all struck me out of no where a few months back due to an event from the past.
21584,"3 months ago, I went from being a normal 24 year old college graduate  to someone who has lost it all because of these health issues."
21585,I don't really have a social life anymore.
21586,"I'm losing great relationships with my friends, and being held back from making new relationships."
21587,"I keep reminding myself that only if things were like 3 months ago, all would be normal again."
21588,"Because of the medications I am on, I cannot drink alcohol."
21589,"I used to go out on weekends to bars/clubs with my friends being the occasional social drinker, but now I can't even do that."
21590,"The majority of things I do with my friends on the weekends used to consist of casual drinking, but now I sadly am the only one not drinking."
21591,My biggest fear is women.
21592,"I'm afraid because of my condition, I will not find someone to date, form a relationship and then eventually get married."
21593,I'm scared someone won't accept me or reject me because I might have to be on medications for the rest of my life.
21594,"Sorry about the long rant, but I've always wanted to get this off my chest."
21595,I want to see if any of you have gone through similar situations with both the drinking and dating life and how you overcame it.
21596,"Any tips, advice or encouraging words would be appreciated."
21597,"Last few years I have had a relationship with a few different therapists, psychiatrists, specialists, friends, family, whomever was willing to help."
21598,"I have been diagnosed with bi polar type 2 and general anxiety, I also suffer from common anxiety/panic-related attacks a handful of times a week."
21599,"I am currently on lithium to stabilize my mood, though I am on nothing for my anxiety currently (I'm open to medications, obviously, but benzos and shit scare me)."
21600,"Anyway, onto my actual post:
For years now I have been a picky eater, since I was a child."
21601,"I am 20 now, and the thought of eating something unfamiliar to my palate (which is a lot) is one of the worst feelings I can get, in all brutal honesty."
21602,"The anxiety caused by being a picky eater has only grown, made itself more prevalent and known in my mind, and it has absolutely got to stop."
21603,"I'm currently in a relationship with the most intelligent, beautiful, just goddamn all around perfect woman."
21604,"If I were into marriage, you better fucking bet she'd have a ring."
21605,"Problem is, she fucking loves food."
21606,"Eating it, talking about it, preparing it -- she's very big into homemade meals, healthy eating (not diets, but prepared vs. processed) all of that."
21607,"She knew about my picky eating tendencies, I was upfront about them, and she's fine with it.. she really is, though she'd prefer me to eat healthier (as do I, hence this post) but I can't."
21608,"I've been through this whole asking for advice thing before, and most of the time all I receive are platitudes or general replies (grow up, put on your adult pants, just try it it won't kill you)."
21609,"I need help though, ideas to help me get over this."
21610,"I've tried new foods, but there have been very few meals I've enjoyed outside of the small list of things I do enjoy."
21611,I'll post it below as general information.
21612,"**
Foods I Enjoy**:

*  Very little meat (fried chicken, small portions of grilled chicken, bacon, sometimes a taco)
*  Vegetables (most are fine, but only on their own, they can't be tossed into/on top of something)
*  Fruits (love them, but they are same as vegetables, have to be alone)
*  Cheese (I love all types of cheese)
*  Bread (I love goddamn bread)
*  I have an affinity for pizza, obviously, but only cheese pizza (I don't even like to pick off the toppings, so my half has to only be cheese)
* Snack foods (chips, cheese crackers, poptarts, all of that shit for the most part)
* Tomato soup (plain)
* Tortellini (paste+sauce, nothing else)
* Fettuccine Alfredo (see above)
* Typical breakfast foods (pancakes/waffles/toast/bagels/cereal)

Other than those few foods (carbs!)"
21613,"I eat nothing else, but I'm willing to change."
21614,"I mentioned above that I have tried new things, most of the time I come out disliking it even more (justifications!)."
21615,"I understand some people simply dislike certain foods.. but it's not the taste that bothers me (usually, sometimes it is) it's either the texture, how it was presented, or simply my anxiety that keeps me from enjoying/finishing a meal."
21616,"I want to change, and if there's a better/more proper home for this post than r/anxiety, lead me to it, please.. 

Once again, I have no aversion to bettering myself, and I know it'd make my girlfriend fucking ecstatic if I prepared her favorite meal and actually ate the same thing with her."
21617,"I'm fucking sick of going out to a restaurant and not knowing what I want, if anything."
21618,I'm fucking tired of visiting a new city and (basically) forcing her to eat at a fast food joint because of my aversion to new foods.
21619,"Anyway, thanks for reading."
21620,Thanks for any advice.
21621,"I'll thank everybody individually as well.. 

Also, there are likely a lot of grammatical/syntax errors, I'll get around to editing them as I find them."
21622,"I have tried meds in the past, but nothing really worked."
21623,What is the process to get on anxiety meds?
21624,I would appreciate any advice or experiences you have had with anxiety medication.
21625,I'm scared to take prescription medications so I was looking for something more natural.
21626,I need some expertise from anyone that has been on Anxiety medication.
21627,"I ran out last week, and so missed about five days of medication."
21628,"I'm seriously considering going off my meds for a week or so just to get some perspective, but I worry how that might effect my job performance."
21629,"I just recently discovered I can do the job, while on my meds, without developing a major headache, so if I need to take them later in the day that works too."
21630,"I don't know if I just need to wait for the 150mg to take effect, or wait until my triggers all die down, or if I need to advocate for a new medication regimen."
21631,"Given that I haven't had an attack in a year, I'm happy with my progress, especially considering I've made all this progress with no medication, just me, a journal, and determination."
21632,"I went to the doctor, got on meds.."
21633,"Months later, meds started giving me hives.."
21634,In the past two weeks I have been in the ER from a panic attack and been officially put on medicine to help get my anxiety back under control.
21635,"It should just be an easy first step before I consider long term things like therapy and medication, but I can't bring myself to go!"
21636,"Biomedicine and Pfeiffer Test (to check for chemical imbalances, vitamin deficiencies etc) is what my mum is urging me to try (her friend's daughter had a lot of success, she was previously always dizzy, nauseous, fainting, couldn't hold down a job, dropped out of highschool, now she's doing very well)."
21637,"For the most part, I've been really careful to recognize my triggers, breathe, do something nice for myself, deal with it no meds needed."
21638,( along with counselling ) I am pretty nervous about taking this as the only medication I have taken Ativan.
21639,"I am a 24 (f) 

EDIT: Female users of this medicine who are also on birth control, how did you see it effect your sex drive?"
21640,"Luckily, I've been fortunate enough to get some medication that at least quelled my G.A.D."
21641,"When I was anxious all the time I never had an appetite, and I thought that'd be at least somewhat fixed with meds?"
21642,My husband and I had been seeing a counselor for marital counseling.
21643,"About 1 month in, the counselor suggested that she wanted to see just me at some of the sessions to discuss some of the problems that I was dealing with within myself."
21644,Throughout my time seeing her she has casually mentioned prescribing me medication for anxiety.
21645,"I've been reading a lot about the potential side effects, and I wanted to gather information from others who are on anti-anxiety medications."
21646,What have you experienced?
21647,My psych added Abilify to my meds.
21648,"Hi /r/anxiety

Hope everyone is doing well."
21649,I have a little question about medications for those who take them.
21650,Right now I'm on Prozac (have been for about 2 months) and from what I can tell it is slowly helping.
21651,I just got up to 30 mg but no major changes have happened yet.
21652,I still have much of my general anxiety (which has been the main problem) but I feel comforted knowing I didn't have any huge side effects upon starting the meds.
21653,When is a good dosage to know if the med will ultimately work?
21654,In the beginning I had the initial spiked anxiety which my Dr. said would be a normal thing that may ultimately prove for a useful treatment.
21655,"As I said, I haven't noticed any major changes, but I also know I don't want to get up to something like 60 mg and then notice the medication actually hasn't done anything (or isn't strong enough)."
21656,Any advice on this area is appreciated.
21657,I haven't asked my doctor yet but plan to soon.
21658,Thanks!
21659,"Some other useful information: I have a relatively good diet (veggies/fruits/protein/etc) and I run weekly, sometimes upwards of a 5k twice or three times a week."
21660,"As mentioned, general anxiety is my target here and while these natural solutions work, they really just aren't enough."
21661,Hope this is useful.
21662,"Sorry if it made no sense, I took some Ativan a little bit ago (which made me even more anxious until it kicked in because taking medication is stressful or something)."
21663,Do any of you take anxiety meds and depression meds?
21664,"Now I'm afraid to take my depression meds, but really want to because I've been feeling exceptionally down lately."
21665,"I can't afford to see a psychiatrist, but am prescribed these meds through my regular doctor and don't think he'd know what to do."
21666,The only reason he does this for me is because I've taken these meds in the past and they had worked.
21667,"I have some ""emergency"" pills I take when my anxiety is particularly bad and they do a good job of calming me down, but they're not meant to be taken every day or I become reliant on them, so it'd have to be different medication."
21668,I don't want to start taking any meds either (unless it's absolutely necessary).
21669,"I know this sounds ridiculous, probably not to you guys, but lately I've been feeling too nervous to even go see my doctor (I think I'm nervous about it because I want to ask for medication for my anxiety and depression)."
21670,I feel like it would really help if I could just get some medication prescribed to me first so that I can be more comfortable going places/leaving my house - which would ultimately result in me being able to see my doctor and therapist.
21671,I think I need to get some medication from the doctor.
21672,I'm pretty much at the point now where I have done everything I can and have yet to find a way to keep my physical symptoms in control.
21673,"Every sign of SEVERE anxiety I get is from the crippling physical symptoms; heart pounding, chest tightness, shortness of breath, dizzy, arms and legs going numb or feeling heavy, and sense of terror like I will die."
21674,"It's been a year since I have lost my job and relationships because of the anxiety getting too out of hand that I couldn't leave the house and although I have come a long way, it's days like today that get me extremely pissed off and aggravated that I still have to deal with these symptoms that seem to be triggered from nothing at all."
21675,"I don;t want to go into every detail but I have tried it all from medications/therapy/meditation/acupuncture/change in diet/cardiologist and finally the beta blocker I am on now that I thought was finally helping but low and behold, here I am posting another story about how much these symptoms bother me."
21676,I don't know where this post is going but I'm just so fucking tired of dealing with this same bullshit.
21677,And I start a new job june 17th....
21678,"I had a bad panic attack yesterday morning that had me yelling at myself saying to just kill me already, not in a suicidal want to die kind of way but just so tired of dealing with it that it's like."
21679,So is this it?
21680,Is this what I have to deal with for the rest of my life?
21681,Do I have to accept the fact that I will continue to feel like shit?
21682,It isn't very comforting.
21683,"I get out a lot, I push through, I perform in front of large crowds and the only thing that brings my anxiety out is the physical symptoms that just don't seem to leave."
21684,"Sorry is this post doesn't make any sense, but I just had to rant a little."
21685,Hope everyone else is in more of a positive mind state and continues to work through this.
21686,I feel helpless since I refuse tryin medication.
21687,In order to get adhd medication my doc has drug tested me and told me to stop cannabis use or she will stop treatment.
21688,"Should I just be like ""I have this symptom, this symptom, and this symptom, I really think some kind of medication would help""?"
21689,"I'm currently not on medication (waiting on a doctor's appointment), so I was wondering..."
21690,"Excluding medication, what sort of activities, exercises, and the like do you guys do to help combat this?"
21691,"When she suggested I get evaluated for some meds, it was like the skies opened up and whatever higher being said ""you're not crazy!"""
21692,I am not taking medication for any(life is complicated and you should all know that by now.
21693,So in my life medication has been ruled out.)
21694,"I've tried so many different medications since my anxiety started, I honestly never expected that I'd be the one asking about them."
21695,"Anyway, today is my first day taking Trazodone."
21696,"I'm usually very open when it comes to trying and starting new medications, because I know each one works different for every one."
21697,"However, this time around I'm feeling a little more wary or skeptical."
21698,"In the past I took Prozac, which is an SSRI."
21699,"I actually took it for several years and it worked great, but it slowly stopped working as well and it absolutely killed my sex drive, so I thought I'd try something new."
21700,"(It also made my hands really clammy, but it wasn't constant and was manageable.)"
21701,"After the Prozac I went to Wellbutrin which gave me an unpleasant side effect so I then was switched to Citalopram, also an SSRI."
21702,"It's been making me feel better, but it makes me sweat like CRAZY and has also destroyed my sex drive, so here I am today."
21703,"Initially I read that Trazodone was also an SSRI, however I am also seeing it being called an SARI."
21704,Apparently this is very similar to SSRIs.
21705,"So my question is, if these other 2 SSRIs made me sweat and lose my sex drive, is it likely that the Trazodone will do the same?"
21706,Has anyone experienced anything similar?
21707,Thanks in advance for the advice and info and sorry for the novel!!
21708,=]
21709,"If I take the Cipralex for a month and then ask for a different medication, am I going to have to start the process over again, or will the Cipralex have prepared my brain (so to speak) to feel the effects of the new drug right away?"
21710,"Having no experience with this kind of medication, and after researching more about the drug, I'm still scared of starting it."
21711,"Does anyone have advice, knowledge, or experience with this kind of medication?"
21712,I am acting like a loser.
21713,Not a HUGE loser.
21714,Not a loser of society.
21715,Not a loser by society's definition.
21716,But certainly a loser by my definition.
21717,"I feel I'm letting myself down and refusing to take action and responsibility for my life, because I'm alway so anxious about the consequences."
21718,I aways ruminate and overthink about things.
21719,I haven't got my driver's license: I'm nearly 22 and I still haven't got my probationary license yet.
21720,"My current driving instructor says I'm doing quite well, and he thinks I'm well on my way to getting one."
21721,But I still can't do it.
21722,What's at stake here?
21723,The loss of $217 if I fail the driving exam.
21724,I still haven't found a decent career path yet: I studied a Bachelor of Social Science and now have grave fears about where I'm heading.
21725,"I can write analytically, think critically, and express myself well in writing, but how will these skills translate to the work environment?"
21726,"I don't socialize very often: I may be called an introvert, because I gather my energy from solitary activities."
21727,But when it comes to the job market it can be very hard to sell yourself.
21728,"I'm also quiet and reserved, never talk much, unless I'm in the company of someone who is talkative."
21729,"To some people they are known as charismatic, talkative, and outgoing; to others, they are known as the people who ""never shut up"")."
21730,So I don't talk to people that much!
21731,This is a vicious cycle.
21732,"I go into a negative feedback loop where I refuse to talk to anyone which lowers my confidence, and because I'm so shy and reserved I find it difficult to market myself esp in a job interview setting."
21733,I *know* that I'm capable of it because I've seen it before.
21734,"Sure, some of that confidence might've come from psychiatric medications, but it's not responsible for all of it."
21735,This isn't bad self-esteem.
21736,This is my emotions telling me that something's wrong and I need to take action.
21737,CBT doesn't seem to work as well as it used to.
21738,What's up with that?
21739,"Anywayz, Starting RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW."
21740,I'm going to write a list of organizations that I can contact that may have internship opportunities.
21741,I'm not going to be outcome dependent.
21742,I'm gonna write it up.
21743,I'm going to send it off.
21744,"After that, I'm going to send a text message to my driving instructor and book two lessons."
21745,I am going to be FINE.
21746,Y'HEAR ME???
21747,"BRING IT ON, ANXIETY."
21748,BRING.
21749,IT.
21750,ON.
21751,Have I been using a different medication from a doctor?
21752,"I realize that it's unlikely that will happen to us, since the cat actually had anti-flea medication prior and also because we only found two, but now every time I itch I'm freaking out."
21753,"Other than that, I feel like it is not doing much for everything else and I hate that I feel increased physical anxiety symptoms such as heart jumping, sweating, and last week I almost had a panic attack which I was able to fend off but I hadn't had one in a few weeks so it was strange that I had one when I got on these meds."
21754,"I had posted a while back that I was dealing with my anxiety medication free for a couple of years, but recently I had broken down."
21755,"And lastly a little thing I just learned from my doctor prescribing the medication was that if you have tried to keep everything bottled up and force yourself not to think about it, your body lets out those held up emotions in the forms of dreams."
21756,I'm scared that perhaps my meds interfere more than they help.
21757,"I've worked extensively through therapy, medication, and self-help (exercise, books etc) to gain control of my symptoms, which I have in the sense that they don't run my life like they did in college, but I still find myself very frustrated when I obsess over a certain thought for a day or week at a time, only to have it pushed out and replaced with something different like a revolving door."
21758,I've had anxiety medication prescribed to me before.
21759,I don't take medicine because prior to this incident I generally didn't have anxiety.
21760,I have always lived with anxiety but I think I am finally willing to accept that it is keeping me exhausted and lacking in life so I decided to try meds.
21761,My mother was diagnosed as depressed and took meds and my brother has had a General Anxiety Disorder for a while too.
21762,Not sure if he still takes meds or not.
21763,"So, a little background."
21764,"I've had Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Panic Disorder since I was 9."
21765,"Trigger examples would be, having to be away from home for extended periods of time, yelling and arguing, visiting with people, strangers, and females (No disrespect meant at all, I'm a girl myself."
21766,"I was bullied by a girl and her mother throughout elementary school, and it really stuck with me)."
21767,"I've been in therapy and been on and off medications since then, dropped out of high school, experimented with drugs and alcohol, all that ""cutting loose"" stuff teenagers sometimes do."
21768,"I'm currently 17(f), recently started high school again (just began freshman year, gah!"
21769,"), and I live with my boyfriend."
21770,I smoke a fair amount of pot to control my general feeling of fear and my panic attacks.
21771,"I know some of you may not agree with that method, but it works for me (for the most part)!"
21772,"However, I have major issues with my self image and jealousy towards my boyfriend."
21773,"In my heart, I know he's an extremely trustworthy person, I know he cares about me and would never do anything to hurt me."
21774,"But, he's the type that has female friends, and while I know he would never do anything with any of them, the situation makes me incredibly uncomfortable."
21775,I haven't even told him I feel like this.
21776,"I'm even ashamed to admit that, I looked at a few of his messages with some of them when he left his Facebook open to go to work."
21777,"Of course, I didn't find anything that would be considered remotely cheater-esque, even to even the most jealous of girlfriends."
21778,"But my suspicion was *real*, and *wrong*."
21779,"So, what I've come here to ask all of you is, how can I deal with this feeling?"
21780,"It's starting to control the way I live, I don't invite my friend's over unless he's at work because I'm scared he's going to be attracted to them, and I find myself resentful towards his female friends that have done nothing bad to me."
21781,"He deserves trust, and I don't think I'm giving him enough."
21782,"I don't *treat* him any differently directly because of this, but I think it might indirectly influence how I act and I don't want to shut him out."
21783,"I know this is an irrational fear, but it haunts me nonetheless."
21784,"I also don't have much time for therapy what with school and trying to graduate early, so I'd appreciate if I could get advice that I can incorporate into my everyday life."
21785,Thanks :)
21786,"However, I have a fucking stack of medication that doctors have given me over the past few months that I've been afraid to take."
21787,If the meds you are on aren't working try something new.
21788,I have been on medication for 8 years.
21789,edit: I have taken medication for 8 years but it doesn't work.
21790,"My anxiety medication does help, but I did just 'relapse' for the first time since August."
21791,My meds really haven't been working (xanex) and the things I do to cope with my anxiety isn't an option anymore since i'm in a dorm.
21792,Now I am on no medication and have no therapists or councillors.
21793,He refused to give me any medication and instead told me to use herbal remedies.
21794,"To make things more interesting im breastfeeding with no end in sight, so my medication options are limited and most meds are off the table."
21795,"I've had severe anxiety since my earliest memories and have been mainly bounced between celexa and zoloft, but the thought of being on a medication that's not supposed to be used forever makes me wonder if I should just be on nothing?"
21796,"I'm going to be on medication soon for it, but I don't know what I should expect my psychiatrist to prescribe."
21797,"If medication DOES help, how much relief should I realistically expect, because I wasn't able to hold down a job before cause of anxiety?"
21798,"This resulted in me losing my therapist, medication, and everything else keeping me stabilized."
21799,I need to be careful with antidepressants because I'm bipolar and I can't take any blood pressure meds because my blood pressure runs quite low.
21800,"It is fairly controlled by medication, but I have noticed in the last year or so that during the days before my period, when I typically suffer from a little PMS, my anxiety is absolutely compounded."
21801,"I'm willing to talk to my doctor about playing around with my medication, but I also would love to find coping mechanisms that might work in the short term."
21802,This is my second time to attempt to stick to medication.
21803,"The last time I started Prozac, I started at 10 mg and  worked my way up to 20 mg with little to no issues but then I stopped before going up to 40 mg (I was afraid of having to be on medication for a long time)."
21804,I take the medication at night before I go to sleep because I can't afford to be lethargic during the day.
21805,Last week i went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with social anxiety disorder.
21806,The doc prescribed me Lexapro (escitalopram) 10 mg/day (5 mg on the first 4 days) and Zoloft (sertraline) 2 x 50 mg/day.
21807,"4 hours after taking the first dose (5mg lexapro + 50mg zoloft) i got pretty sick (extreme dizziness, nausea, vomiting) so i didn't feel too inclined to take the 2nd Zoloft pill that day, instead i started researching a bit."
21808,After searching for hours i couldn't find even a single mention of  this combination and i read on multiple places that concomitant use of multiple SSRIs is highly discouraged and that during such treatment patients should be closely monitored and informed about the symptoms of serotonin toxicity.
21809,Nothing of the sort happened.
21810,According to [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2464814/table/t2-0540988/) table I've experienced all of the mild and none of the moderate or severe symptoms of serotonin toxicity.
21811,After the 1st day i stopped taking Lexapro and cut down the dose of zoloft to 25 mg/day and I've been fine since then.
21812,So my question is: am i missing something because as far as i can tell there is nothing special about my case that would warrant such treatment and even if there is it feels unlikely that my doc could have discerned it form the 20 min talk that preceded the diagnosis and the prescription of the medications.
21813,Any advice is highly appreciated!
21814,"I'm 31, and it reared its ugly and powerful head when I was about 13 or 14, I've never been on medication but finally decided it was worth a try."
21815,"so ive been going to the doctor lately, and i have been trying to convince her that, along with cognitive behavioral therapy, i should probably get some medication(benzos,beta blockers, anti deppreseants, etc.)."
21816,"i tell my doctor this and all the other stuff that makes me anxious, yet my doctor insists that i dont need medication, i dont understand why she refuses to prescribe me medication."
21817,I'm not on any medicine right now that usually dampens emotions like anti-depressants.
21818,"For the record, I've never been diagnosed with anything nor taken medication."
21819,"I've had this problem before and had medicine, but my mother didn't want me taking it because of possible addiction."
21820,"My ex-girlfriend had me committed a few months back, saying I was suicidal (wasn't) and was mixing meds (I stopped taking all meds now, out of complete fear)."
21821,"Edit: another stupid thing I do is I never keep a lot of pills (pain meds, sleeping pills etc) because I am afraid one day that I will have a stupid impulse/not think clearly and take too many."
21822,And please don't direct me to any medicine or drugs.
21823,what have your experiences been like when reducing (not quitting) meds?
21824,I've been seeing a therapist and taking medication (paxil) for the last ~6 months.
21825,A pretty shocking reminder to get back on my medication.
21826,"Did you know you needed meds, or did someone tell you?"
21827,As of right now I feel like I have two options either quit but I don't have another job lined up or find a shrink and see if meds would help.
21828,"I was diagnosed with severe clinical anxiety when i was 5, due to meds (currently on 75 mg of Zoloft) , its been pretty manageable until now."
21829,Or did it really effect you to the point where you'd never mix alcohol with your anxiety medication ever again?
21830,"I'm planning a trip to the doctor this week to see if I can sort things out with medication or counseling, but is there anything that I could do right now to improve my situation?"
21831,Obviously I want to get the full effects of the medicine.
21832,My boyfriend is prescribed medicine for his anxiety and really thinks I should go talk to someone but I'm afraid to.
21833,I am going to a doctor today to discuss going back on an anxiety medication.
21834,I feel like it has to be some sort of anxiety issue since it pretty much stopped while I was on the medicine.
21835,I think I need to get on meds or something...
21836,Hello!
21837,I've been dealing with anxiety (mostly health related) for about three years now.
21838,I've been on 20mg of Citalopram for that whole three years.
21839,"Up until about a month ago, I hadn't had any major anxiety or panic attacks in seriously 2-2.5 years."
21840,I had felt pretty good and was excited that I could live life normally again.
21841,"A month ago, it took a turn for the worse."
21842,I went to a concert and drank fairly heavily (I'm gonna estimate and say at least 6 double crown &amp; cokes and 3 shots of various liquor).
21843,No hangover or anything the next day; I downed a lot of water as well.
21844,"However, the next day, I had a full on panic attack - the only one that's managed to send me to the ER."
21845,"Had blood work, had an EKG - nothing but panic and some low potassium."
21846,"For the next several days after that, I was very, very anxious and couldn't even go to work."
21847,"The majority of my time was spent convincing myself I was dying, I couldn't breathe, etc."
21848,Panic after panic after panic.
21849,"After several days, things just kind of evened out and I felt fine again."
21850,Just like that.
21851,"I went two weeks feeling good again with just the occasional twinge of anxiety, but nothing like before."
21852,"This past Saturday was my fiances birthday, and we had quite a large party."
21853,"I drank, but not near as much as previously."
21854,I had a shot of crown and then two crown and cokes (that were mostly crown...).
21855,"The next day, I was an anxious mess again, and that has continued up until today, and I'm still feeling that way."
21856,Looks like I just need to lay off the alcohol completely if that's what's going to happen every single time...
21857,"I went to my doctor today for a 3 week checkup (I went after my ER visit) and told her how my anxiety went away, then flared back up."
21858,"We talked for a little bit and we decided a few things:

* I'm getting some blood work done today/tomorrow to check my thyroid
* We're increasing my Citalopram from 20mg to 40mg :\
* She put me on Buspar because I HATE the way Clonazepam/Klonopin made me feel (drunk and didn't take any panic away)
* They included my O2 Saturation level on my vitals list (99%!)"
21859,"and I am VERY thankful - helps me a lot to know that even though I'm feeling short of breath, my oxygen is alright."
21860,So..experiences with Buspar?
21861,I'm pretty nervous.
21862,"Since I have health anxiety, I hate taking new medications...I'm always afraid of having a reaction, etc."
21863,How does it make you feel?
21864,Is it noticeable like Klonopin or Xanax?
21865,And anyone else gone up from 20mg to 40mg of Citalopram?
21866,"I've read a lot about higher doses and it being bad for your heart so of course when my doctor said she wanted to increase my dose all I could do was think ""oh great."""
21867,But if it helps......
21868,Sorry for the book.
21869,I have a lot on my mind.
21870,:\
21871,It works great - better than any medication I've ever been on.
21872,"I've always had this issue with medication.. no matter what pill I take, or what it's for, I just feel like a junkie - I feel like someone who should be able to deal with their particular brain chemistry on their own, and by having to use pharmeceuticals to get through things, I feel.. broken, I guess."
21873,"The previous prescribed medication made the anxiety worse, and the doctors appointment isn't until tomorrow."
21874,I know everyone is different on how they respond to meds.
21875,I think I might be extra sensitive to medicine or just anything I put in my body like foods.
21876,"So for the last 2 years I have been experiencing varied amounts of anxiety ranging from horrible insomnia heart racing at night, to completely immobilized, unable to talk, have to leave work kind of thing."
21877,I may even lose my job because of it.
21878,The thing that truly drives me crazy is that I can and do treat my anxiety with a Xanax prescription.
21879,"Which works wonders, but due to going to my doctor in the past about an alcohol problem (stupid!)"
21880,he refuses to prescribe a normal amount.
21881,"Basically I am 'normal' and functioning adult for about 20 days per month,and the other 22 days I am a basket case either forced to deal with crippling anxiety or self medicate with alcohol."
21882,"(Which I hate, it gives me a hangover, and I know it is destroying my brain and liver."
21883,"Since I recognize this I have been cutting alcohol back more and more and more, but I cannot function in groups/work/society otherwise.)"
21884,"I've also been completely without medication (alcohol or pills) for long stretches before, and they were without a doubt some of the worst most worrying times in my life."
21885,"Where I made horrible life threatening decisions (driving at high rates of speed, casual sexual encounters, theft)."
21886,"I wasn't suicidal, I just didn't give a fuck anymore."
21887,"I realize he worries about addiction, but my only other options to deal with said anxiety is self medication, and I know it will end up killing me if I continue to drink with the same frequency I used to in order to combat anxiety."
21888,It's like I am stuck between being a drunk or a fucking pill head.
21889,And I don't take these pills to get 'high'!
21890,I take them to be normal.
21891,I take them so I can cope enough to go out to have a nice dinner maybe one or twice a month with friends!
21892,I take them so I can avoid drinking entirely.
21893,Or so I can talk to people at work without visibly shaking and jamming my words together.
21894,"(this is not a result of alcohol addiction, as I am not physically addicted)

Yet what I am prescribed is .05mg/42 days."
21895,I literally know of children on higher doses then that.
21896,My quality of life suffers and I feel like I will be marked as even more of a 'junky' if I go to another doctor or continue going back to this one asking for an increased dose.
21897,When I brought up seeing a psychiatrist he immediately dismissed the idea and said we should continue trying different antidepressants along with the anxiety medications.
21898,But I'm not depressed!
21899,"I'm crippled by anxiety, but I am not suicidal, I can recognize my problem."
21900,"I feel like the only reason he's trying to push less effective medications on me is because he is worried about the addiction potential, but antidepressants are addictive too!"
21901,Some of the worst periods I had were coming off celebrex or wellbutrin.
21902,I ended up feeling like a soulless automaton.
21903,"An effect soulless automaton, but it just wasn't worth it."
21904,I'd rather deal with anxiety then feel nothing at all.
21905,What's worse ?
21906,Being a functioning human who has to take anxiety medication ?
21907,Or a robot?
21908,I thought the end result here is supposed to be harm reduction.
21909,I truly wish I could stop with the medication (prescribed and self-administered) entirely but without it my entire world comes crashing down.
21910,"I'd lose everything my house, my job, my friends."
21911,"I guess I just don't know what do to anymore, and am hoping somebody who has been in a similar situation can offer advice ?"
21912,It's getting to the point where I am going to snap.
21913,And I've got too many holes in my wall already.
21914,Health is one of my biggest forms of anxiety.
21915,I am in therapy and on/in-between medications.
21916,I have to go get some blood work and ultrasound done for my liver.
21917,"My doctor told me not to lose sleep over it (they know I'm anxious), but of course I am."
21918,My mind is going over all the things that it could be.
21919,"I'm withdrawing inside my mind and trying to exercise the worry out, walk the worry out, meditate the worry out, ground myself, etc etc etc."
21920,Keep going basically.
21921,It's very hard for me.
21922,I need to listen to my doctor.
21923,I know this.
21924,They are the professionals and they know what they are talking about.
21925,"GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Thanks."
21926,"The usual things like medication, physical activity, and counting down from 10 have not helped much."
21927,Anyone else feel this terrible starting on medicine before it (hopefully) got better?
21928,The medication came on pretty strong the first day.
21929,"Two days ago (five days on the medication), I got invited out to the bar by a friend of mine that I absolutely adore."
21930,"Without the meds, I could have _fifteen_ beers, and still never muster the courage to dance with a girl."
21931,I'm gonna go ahead and just angry with everything anxiety related happening to me.
21932,"So basically all year this has been slowly progressing, I'm on Prozac and Klonipin because of Tourettes Syndrum."
21933,"You get a cool 4 package deal with this, ADHD OCD depression and aniexty."
21934,"(Since I'm not in the mood for complete grammatical whatever...) I have severe anxiety, mild everything else blah blah blah explanation over."
21935,"So I fucked up, and I mean a pretty bad fuck up."
21936,I started taking my klonipin everyday (hell I don't even know how it started really) and now I am physically addicted to it.
21937,"This wouldn't be so bad if I noticed this was a bad thing way before (got a psychiatrist appointment, next they can see me is on the 27th this month...) I could have fixed this with minimal problems."
21938,"So effectly two days without it = almost instant withdrawal and although this doesn't seem like it belongs here, here's something klonipin does if you're stupid like me and currently withdrawing... increases anxiety, to put the shit on turbo and bam instantly the annoying ass teenager with subwoofers blasting house music down the street."
21939,"Walking is a fucking pain for one, hell I feel myself pretty stressed out over nothing and breathing pretty heavily already just from typing this (probably the anger) it's hard as fuck to get anything accomplished like this."
21940,"With this on overdrive, the simplest task; eating, sleeping, even working for 3 hours every day becomes the hardest fucking chore to do."
21941,I'm on my last rope here right now because of how increasingly bad it has been getting this week alone with the weather not being able to stay the same for one god damn day (weather changes do affect me) and on top of it my allergies have sent my sinus' into the purge state where everything must go like it's memorial day or some shit.
21942,"So here I am again, unable to even think about sleeping since it scares the shit out of me to think about it, thirsty as fuck but not wanting to get up, havent showered in 4 fucking days after I finally got a good schedule going (I'm in therapy right now actually, the simplest chore is the hardest task for me, but I am able to do other things I'm just highly unmotivated and don't see the point in doing something I deem to be stupid or worthless.)"
21943,my eating has become so horrid that it is downright Weird and Unnatural for me to have eaten before work and I basically binge after work.
21944,Hopefully after the psychiatrist appointment I can put all of this shit behind me and have a good few days rest after all of this is over.
21945,"For right now and the upcoming future, fuck this shit."
21946,"A good PSA for you all, if you no longer have a psychiatrist and a general doctor is renewing your prescriptions and you have something on it like Xanax or Klonipin do yourself a favor and get your ass to another psychiatrist."
21947,These medications are so easy to get addicted to you might not even realize you are until your body wants more than what you're currently taking.
21948,"Not trying to throw a pity party for myself though, just angry and now things kind of feel a bit lighter in the chest area (which is funny enough since thats where the congested is now) thanks for reading."
21949,"I told my case manager I would volunteer at an event with her today, but I haven't been able to sleep or eat properly in weeks because of problems with my meds."
21950,"I really don't want to use medication

Thanks!"
21951,"I finally worked up the courage to talk to my doctor about my anxiety and he prescribed me an SSRI and a benzodiazepine, Cipralex (also known as Lexapro) and Ativan (Lorazepam), respectively."
21952,"I was looking through the subreddit to see what other people thought about Cipralex and almost every person wrote about how the first few weeks will suck (headaches, nausea, etc.)."
21953,Is it guaranteed that I'll feel bad for the first little while?
21954,I want to know whether I'll need to go out and buy pain relievers.
21955,"I normally would just as a precaution but I'm really poor right now and can't afford any OTC medications (luckily my prescriptions were free, yay Canada!)."
21956,"Also, when I was looking at the experiences other people had with Cipralex there were a lot of negative comments and I'm really worrying myself."
21957,"If anyone had any positive experiences with it, would you mind posting some encouraging words?"
21958,I'm really excited to finally be trying medication but I'm worried that I'll overreact to negative situations and make myself think the medication isn't working before I even give it a try haha.
21959,Thanks everyone :)
21960,"Until I was on medication, it was much more vague what I was having panic attacks about."
21961,"I've gone to doctors, Im taking meds, tried various types and whatnot, and nothing seems to do it."
21962,"It could be lack of sleep and exercise, and these things I want to fix, but I'm wondering if perhaps this medication isn't for me?"
21963,"I'm also not really open to medication, I'm hoping for some natural remedies (and as I'm still breastfeeding medication isn't an option right now anyways)."
21964,"Hi everyone - quick background: diagnosed with ""Anxiety Disorder NOS"" along with depression around 12; PTSD around 15 following an event that happened that year; ongoing issues with social anxiety / panic disorder / generalised anxiety disorder that are more or less under control using just behavioral therapy methods; no medications for depression/anxiety ever."
21965,"(tried SSRIs, they make me go crazy; tried benzos, they make me agitated; beta blockers had no effect on my anxiety and maybe even made it worse when I was on them for migraines; I've taken clonidine for unrelated reasons which has helped with the panic attacks and hyperarousal, and I take Ritalin for ADHD which helps my anxiety a lot, which I suspect is because it helps me be in control of my thinking, and hence lets me overcome the anxiety/depression)

My question is this - sometimes I get these ""limited symptom panic attacks"" and I'm not sure whether they're actually panic/anxiety attacks or something else."
21966,"Symptoms:
- My heart starts racing
- I get definite vertigo - it feels like me and my chair/bed/whatever are spinning in circles; along with lightheadness (not sure if that's the vertigo or not) 
- Sometimes a shaky/tingly feeling in my limbs - not like the hypoxic thing you get from hyperventilating where your hands turn into claws; more like a very light tingly feeling almost like pins and needles but at a third of the intensity."
21967,"Currently it's only in my left side of my face and my left arm, but sometimes/usually(?)"
21968,it's on both sides of my body.
21969,"- A really strong feeling like ""something is wrong""."
21970,"My breathing stays normal/fine and definitely isn't hyperventilating, but nevertheless I breathe ""correctly"" like I've been taught to do when I'm panicking, which doesn't have any affect on it."
21971,"My thought processes aren't at all anxious; usually when I have limited symptom attacks or panic attacks they're pretty much triggered by either my thoughts, or my thoughts as a reaction to physical symptoms (ie: ""whoa, my heart's beating really fast and I can't breathe, maybe I'm having a heart attack / dying ?!??!!"")."
21972,"However with these ones, my thoughts have absolutely no effect on them."
21973,They're just purely physical symptoms.
21974,"The rest of the time when I get panic attacks or limited symptom attacks, it's really obvious that I get them - and I can easily control them with breathing and thinking right."
21975,"With these, all I can do is shrug it off and play a distracting video game until it's over, usually a few minutes, maybe ten or so at the most, later."
21976,So I guess I'm just curious... can you get limited symptom attacks that don't respond to breathing and thinking right that are still anxiety?
21977,It started when I began taking sinus medication a lot because of a sinus infection that my doctor ignored and would refuse to help me with.
21978,"Eventually the infection cleared up, I stopped taking the medication, and I went to a different doctor for some blood tests to make sure I didn't do any damage to my liver or kidneys and she said everything was fine (this was just last August)."
21979,"When I get sick I won't take any medication out of fear that it will kill me, so I'm just completely out until I start to feel better naturally."
21980,I used to take medication for it but that just made me want to kill myself more than usual.
21981,"I take no meds, and have received some counselling but refused further help on the basis of I don't have nigh a £100 to spend an hour telling someone I feel fucked up."
21982,"i know its a known side effect of the medication but i dont know if i should tell my psych, i dont want to unless i have to because its kinda embarrassing."
21983,"I attempted to take some medicine that was prescribed to me, though I just am unable to take it."
21984,"Hello fellow anxious people,

I was hoping you could recommend me a good beta blocker medicine and a good normal anti anxiety medicine, in terms of results and with the least side effects."
21985,"I only recently found out about these meds and am feeling quite excited knowing that I could possibly turn my life around :D

I do understand that beta blockers are for a sudden need of anti-anxiety and that they aren't a solution for a completely getting rid of my anxiety issues."
21986,"A few days later, I called my aunt and she explained to me that this issue was completely triggered by my OCD and the only thing that would make it better was getting my meds increased to a higher dose."
21987,This week was my first week back at school after being horribly sick with the flu and after breaking down at John's and getting my meds increased.
21988,I think I might finally have the nerve to call my doctor and set up an appointment to talk to him about trying some kind of medication.
21989,"As for medication I have been taking 20mg of Cipralex for the past 4 years, both to combat the anxiety, but also because of bouts of depression that I have been experiencing."
21990,"Not on and off because of my doctor, I'm just really bad about staying on any medication for more than a few weeks."
21991,"Since I can't stay on my medication consistently enough for it to really work long-term, my doctor has suggested coming off of it completely and replacing it with regular therapy in an attempt to find the root of the problem."
21992,"I decided to go back on meds, but I wanted to try something different so my general practitioner put me on Zoloft generic (Sertraline) at 50mg daily."
21993,The last time I had anxiety meds was as an outpatient from a hospital 4 years ago.
21994,"I've stopped taking any sort of ADD meds because they make me bug out, but I do take them when I need them."
21995,"When I'm on the ADD meds i cant help but remain anxious, it's like I didn't take the meds to study but to just focus on how much of a piece I am."
21996,"also i apologize for my post being headed in so many different directions, I took my ADD meds today but couldn't stop thinking about this."
21997,So I haven't touched my meds today.
21998,I'm still not convinced that I don't have Serotonin Syndrome so I'm avoiding my meds.
21999,I'm not sure if it's a side effect of the medication or just psychosomatic.
22000,"So far I've managed my GAD fairly well without medication (regular counselling, hypnotherapy etc), but after a huge anxiety attack on Monday, with the ripples still affecting me now, I was thinking of asking my Doctor for Valium or something similar for when get an attack of severe acute anxiety."
22001,I've decided not to go on regular medication (SSRIs etc) but I just need something there for the times when things outside my control make it unbearable.
22002,"After seven years of heavy heavy medication and abuse of such, i got myself drug free, and have managed for almost two years now."
22003,I'm not on medication.
22004,No allergy meds in the house.
22005,"I've been seeing a psyc and he thinks a small dose of medication could do the trick but, I would love to try alternatives."
22006,My doctor is deciding not to fill my anxiety medication that I've been on for 5 years and I haven'thad my meds for almost 2 weeks.
22007,The pharmacy won't give me anymore emergency medication I'm panicking.
22008,"Gave me some low dose med to take when the symptoms come up, but I was told that the meds could make to dizzy/lightheaded/drowsy so being anywhere besides at home made me nervous in case I had to take the meds and started feeling those side effects."
22009,I'm just not sure it's anxiety and don't want to start taking the meds for it if that is in fact not what it is.
22010,"So while shopping, my brother had a stroke."
22011,He has never had a stroke before.
22012,"Although longterm use of his medications said it might happen, and maybe the hip injections he had today could have caused it."
22013,"I was about three feet away at a different self check out when out of the corner of my eye I saw him throw the things in his hands, fell backwards and started to seize up."
22014,I did what my nurse of a sister-in-law told me to do after I had witnessed a seizure at school and felt helpless.
22015,"I ran to him and cradled his head with my hand so it didn't hit anything, but was still free to move."
22016,My other hand was on his chest to make sure he was still breathing and had a heartbeat.
22017,I put my leg under his arm to try to protect it.
22018,Had to yell at the people to call 911.
22019,"After he stopped seizing, he was having trouble breathing, his lips started to turn purple and he kept grinding his teeth."
22020,His eyes were open the whole time but he wasn't responsive.
22021,"I thought I was going to have to give him cpr, but his breathing became less labored."
22022,Paramedics arrived fairly soon and they took over.
22023,"He became somewhat coherent when the medics were there, but he just said ""What's happening, what's going on."""
22024,I told him what happened and he'll be fine.
22025,He doesn't remember anything from starting checking out to mid ambulance drive.
22026,I've had to tell this story at least 20 times to medical professions today.
22027,He chose not to stay overnight like they suggested.
22028,"He hates hospitals, he had a bad motorcycle accident in 2009 which damaged his hip/back and his partner at the time died."
22029,"They were both wearing helmets, and he had a riding jacket on."
22030,He has been upset with the hospital they took him to because of the treatment they got after the accident.
22031,He didn't feel like it was on par with other hospitals.
22032,So there was no way he was going to stay in that hospital.
22033,He's on anti seizure meds and new meds for pain.
22034,We see a neurologist tomorrow to get him check up.
22035,"TL DR: Brother had seizure, I tried to help."
22036,"Medics came, went to hospital."
22037,They wanted to check him overnight but he said no.
22038,So I'm just kinda freaking out about everything.
22039,"I luckily still had some anti-anxiety pills left, took those when I got home."
22040,This event doesn't help my other medicine that makes me kind of shaky.
22041,"After he stopped seizing and had problems breathing, his lips turned purple."
22042,I really thought I might lose him.
22043,My head just keeps replaying him throwing the food as he started to seize and fall.
22044,It was like someone getting electrocuted and falling back.
22045,It really sucks because I've been having a hard time with depression and anxiety the past months.
22046,"The meds I'm on are helping, but I don't know how to coup with this."
22047,"Off meds for a month or so, no withdrawals and everything seemed awesome, now Im getting terrible anxiety about the littlest things."
22048,I was on them for about 3 years but wanted to try to deal with my problems without meds.
22049,I really dont want to get back on my meds but Im not sure I can last feeling like this.
22050,She said it was a random thing and it was just to check and see if I'm actually using the medication.
22051,"She told me that since she now knows that I have been smoking marijuana that she thinks all of my anxiety/panic problems stem from that and that she was no longer going to give me any more medication because she said, ""it's clearly the marijuana."
22052,I'm going to try my best to find another doctor but here in KY they are so focused on people abusing the medication that they make you go through other things first...some won't even prescribe it at all!
22053,"She knows I have anxiety disorder, and that I take as-needed medication for it, but I just cannot shake these feelings."
22054,"Hey Guys, I have a GAD and even while on medication I am still having a lot of anxiety constantly (Like even typing this)."
22055,"I cannot seem ever come ""off edge"" even with the help of medicine."
22056,I don't have health insurance at the moment so medication and therapy aren't available to me.
22057,"Took some medication from the doctor (non anxiety related) and started feeling ill yesterday, made a point at the doctors not to know the 'see the doctor straightaway' symptoms but after checking that day few matched up."
22058,I am on medication for anxiety/depression and I talk to my psychiatrist regularly.
22059,"I'm in a catch-22, can't make appointments to get medication, can't get to appointments without medication."
22060,So now here's the question most of them say avoid alcohol but I drink not everyday or every week depending how I feel it could be once a month or 5 times a month but not regularly So the day I know I am going to drink I don't take my meds or if I do I take at least 6-8 hours prior is it still bad ??
22061,"I mean we all need to break monotony, So kind of like to do but not too much also I get drunk super fast sometime beer or two and I am tipsy maybe because of the meds idk."
22062,":)

 Also smoke tree once in a while same as drinking depends and I do the same thing with meds either skip or take prior."
22063,"I was on Zoloft for ~5-6 months in 2010, and it was *the* worst experience with medication that I've ever had in my life."
22064,I'm not on medication because my family does not support the idea of it pretty much.
22065,"Basiccly I stopped taking meds but told therapist I was for a year ,became a Tucker won't didn't lis my as burgers ."
22066,"I told everyone I was gonna truck and even wrote Obama and got a letter back but never told then I weren't taking my meds or left aspergers off my federal department of tranpostt physical



So  tldr:thanks obams"
22067,"She went to the doctor and they said GERD, but the GERD medication either makes the nausea worse or does not affect it."
22068,"The anti-nausea medication does not reduce the nausea, although she has not vomited."
22069,I can't take any anxiety meds obviously because I am pregnant.
22070,The medicine I am on has improve my general condition a lot but there are those days where I am really prone to panic attacks.
22071,"When I was in middle/high school I had massive amounts of social anxiety, I never said anything about it and I ended up always being the ""shy"" kid who never had any friends."
22072,"That changed later on in high school and directly after high school, I met a good group of friends and most of my activities revolved around drinking and drug use."
22073,"As time went on I stopped being such a social hermit and managed to cut back on the booze and drugs, married my wife, had kids and build up a very successful career for myself."
22074,"Over time I was hiding (not so well) a growing, massive drinking problem, I would drink all day, go into work drunk from the day before, the weekends were a massive blur ... for 8 years this went on."
22075,I finally convinced myself I was going to die if I didn't stop and I told my wife about all the drinking she probably didn't know about (on top off the massive amount she was aware of) and my desire to quit completely.
22076,"I did it, I quit drinking (now sitting at 18months sober)!"
22077,"After nearly 15 years of daily drinking, I was done."
22078,"While it took quite a while for my mood and sleeping habits to return to somewhat decent levels, I never returned to feeling ""good"" or ""normal""."
22079,I started to have very horrible panic attacks about 6 months into getting sober.
22080,This propted me to make a Dr. appt because many elements of my social anxiety I recalled from being a kid came rushing back into my life.
22081,"Work became an ungodly nightmare having to deal with people, where before I was on top of the world at work and I excelled, despite all the drinking."
22082,"My Dr. originally prescribed me Prozac, which I hesitantly began taking (my panic attacks were new to me and frightening, anything to make them go away, right?)."
22083,At the same time I was referred to see a therapist and psychologist to find a plan of treatment that would work for me.
22084,"That ended up being a combination of medication and talk therapy, I was offered several options for stress and anxiety classes, but those seemed too far outside of my comfort level."
22085,"I initially did not react to the Prozac well, it made the anxiety spike, and I came as close as I care to come to having thoughts about suicide and what not."
22086,I got off the prozac and I'm currently on 15mg of lexapro and have Klonopin to help deal with stressful times as needed.
22087,"I feel like these medications are not effective, the klonopin helps me not have panic attacks, but it leaves me exhausted and unable to function normally."
22088,The lexapro has caused me to drop a great deal of weight.
22089,"(note that before I quit drinking I was 275lbs, 10 months later I dropped to 180lbs, since starting lexapro I am currently at 160 and I'm 6' 4"")."
22090,I can not gain weight to save my life.
22091,I discontinued using the klonopin altogether and now I'm back to being plagued with panic attacks about once a week.
22092,"I just discussed the current situation with my doctors and they just want to increase my Lexapro dosage ... this just doesn't seem right to me...

Man, this sucks."
22093,"I'm a grown ass man with a family and I was trying to pull my shit together to better my life, now I can hardly crawl out of bed and make my way to the store."
22094,I grew up as a single child or a single mother who suffered from extreme anxiety and refused medication.
22095,"Thanks to anyone who reads this:

Okay so here's the deal."
22096,Ever since I was young (I think around 11 was the first one) I have had intermittent periods of high anxiety.
22097,"From what I have read, most of you seem to have either social anxiety, a specific phobia, or just a *constant* state of anxiety (and possibly depression) that can be managed long term with the use of medications like SSRIs etc."
22098,For me it's not like that.
22099,"I'll be perfectly fine - mostly normal for months or even a year (I'm not the best in situations where I don't know people, or being out alone at night but I think that's pretty normal)."
22100,"Then suddenly, sometimes inexplicably it'll start."
22101,The constant feeling of absolute **dread**.
22102,I can feel my heart pounding in my chest all day and night.
22103,Do I have a heart condition?
22104,No of course not that's illogical.
22105,But what if I do?
22106,What if I have cancer?
22107,I'm going to inevitably die and there's nothing I can do about it.
22108,"Cold, black emptiness."
22109,What if I get a mental illness?
22110,What if I get dementia and lose my mind?
22111,At any second I could drop dead.
22112,"It makes no sense at all but I can't stop the illogical, irrational feeling of fear and despair."
22113,The only thing I can do is sit and shudder through the worst of it.
22114,"It helps if I'm at home, as going out doors into public is the hardest thing in the world."
22115,I took to watching kid's shows (MLP) to distract me but nothing completely negates it.
22116,Sometimes It's accompanied with depression.
22117,I'll cry for no reason at all.
22118,I'm useless and worthless and better off dead.
22119,For a couple of weeks or a couple of months it makes life a living hell.
22120,I can't work.
22121,I can't be a good father to my child.
22122,I sleep as much as possible.
22123,"Alcohol and recreational drugs (don't worry I'm not an addict or heavy user) only make it worse during this period, so I generally abstain."
22124,"So I go to the doctor, I get prescribed Zoloft (sertraline) or given diazepam short term."
22125,Zoloft doesn't even start working for a week or two after I start taking it.
22126,And it must be taken every day.
22127,"And then just as suddenly as it came, it disappears and I'm (mostly) fine again, for many months."
22128,It's as if I was never anxious.
22129,Going on trips away from home (especially without my partner or daughter) seems more likely to trigger it.
22130,The last time it was triggered when I was stuck in a car for 3 hours with my partner's parents.
22131,One is a minister the other works in a nursing home.
22132,They talk about death *constantly*.
22133,What's the point of taking Zoloft every day of my life when I only need it for a couple of months?
22134,I don't like feeling numb over real happiness.
22135,"And Zoloft causes certain fun drugs (which I very rarely take, we're talking once or twice a year at most) to not even work."
22136,But it could happen at any time.
22137,I could be in for another couple of hellish months starting tomorrow when I am due to go on a trip.
22138,I feel a lump in my chest just typing this.
22139,"So, /r/anxiety, what do?"
22140,Has anyone had anything similar or do you all just have a constant level of anxiety where it actually makes *sense* to take drugs like SSRIs etc long term?
22141,"After a while he did suggest I start taking anxiety medication, which I do now."
22142,They always told me not to take medication because I would get addicted to it.
22143,"After I started back in my medication, I was fine."
22144,I just recently had another episode when I was switching medication.
22145,"One I got back on my regular meds, I was fine."
22146,I know that I have forgotten to take my meds for a few days before and it has never been this bad.
22147,"After the physically therapy, after taking medication for a while, and after finding out what is wrong with me I still find myself unable to do anything."
22148,I refuse to take medication because I have a history with drug addiction and have been completely sober for 4 years.
22149,"I've also been on straterra, an ADHD medication, but I stopped taking it for the same reason as I stopped taking the antidepressants."
22150,"Like I said, I've been on antidepressants before and one adhd medication."
22151,"But back then, I KNEW what was causing my depression and anxiety, I got on meds, I saw a psychiatrist, I got away from the triggers (namely specific people) and everything got better enough for me to get off the meds."
22152,"Sure enough, most things are chalked up to anxiety so I decided to go back on the meds, which help for a little while, but now I've been getting palpitations and heavy beating of my heart with the occasional hit of dizziness."
22153,"The only thing I can think of is that it's another doom circle of anxiety causing a symptom which in turn causes more anxiety - but with each test coming back clear (so far) I would hope that they, in addition to my meds, would stop this :(


At the moment I'm on 10mg of lexapro, but my doc was thinking of switching me to zoloft after my holter monitor results come back (if theyre clear)."
22154,"I know seeing a therapist is best, but I really want to avoid medication at all cost."
22155,"I am so afraid of getting on medication, as I've heard so many horror stories about anti-anxiety meds turning people into dull-eyed ghosts of their previous personalities."
22156,"This past week, I struggled with my medication, after not taking it for a few days and getting a heavy dose of reality."
22157,"So my question is, is the medication route worth going down?"
22158,I've beaten anxiety before without meds but I'm wondering if they might help speed up recovery a bit?
22159,"23, male, no medication."
22160,I'm someone who is very nervous about starting on a medication because my mother was always heavily medicated because of her issues while I was growing up and it wasn't an ideal childhood.
22161,I've read a lot of research that says meditation can help with anxiety and at this point I'll try anything so I don't have to go on meds.
22162,My girlfriend has gone to just a family doctor and they suggest taking medication to make this go away or lessen the pain.
22163,She does not want to take medication.
22164,"Right now I'm in a partial hospitalization program where I go for 6 hours, sit in a crowded room and listen to others complain about their symptoms and medication side effects."
22165,The doctors there just keep cycling me through different meds that either make the problem worse or have no effect at all.
22166,"I've been on pretty much every medication imaginable at this point with no improvement, and although meditation and CBT have helped my mood generally, they haven't helped with the agoraphobia or panic."
22167,I was put on medication and was in therapy for about 2 years and they were not working.
22168,"I do not show the top symptom of feeling as through I'm having a heart attack, as is indicative with panic attacks...No, my symptoms immediately culminated in my intestines and issues there...So it was just a lot of fun, fun, fun...

Now, I am Nearly eleven years into the agoraphobia thing, and after finding medication that was not a narcotic to deal...I am able to cope."
22169,"I am a psychologist and have done a lot with cognitive reframing, so was able to get myself off the medication for the agoraphobia...My physical body thanked me :)  But I have to work at it all the time...

An example...My husband and I went to see some of my family for a few days."
22170,I've had a significantly decreased sex drive being on medications and I was wondering what people have done to combat this?
22171,"I'm afraid if I do end up pursing medicine, I'll be a nervous wreck because my anxious mind will be bombarded by potential triggers all the time."
22172,"It's been a lifelong dream of mine to pursue medicine, so I would hate to have to give it up because of my anxiety."
22173,I'm so sick of it...
22174,I'm sick of searching for new ways to finally feel comfortable that only last temporarily.
22175,"(marijuana, medications, etc.)"
22176,"I just want to stop caring so much, every second that I'm at school I feel like there's a monster breathing on my neck."
22177,"When I see people laugh or talk I think it's about me, when I even make a slight noise I fear that everyone just heard it and hates me for it."
22178,"And then I do things like smoke weed and see what it's like to not have that anxiety, and feel so free and so confident, only to be let down right after... and I'm obviously not just going to be high all the time."
22179,So what can I do to just make it be gone?
22180,I know it won't be quick or easy but whatever I can possibly do will be worth it.
22181,I wanted to thank you all again for all the advice and thoughtful words when I originally posted about seeing a doctor and my fear of medication.
22182,"The first week or so of taking the medication I was worse than ever before - crying uncontrollably, having to leave work mid-day because I was having serious panic attacks, etc."
22183,"I am hoping this is a trend that will continue, and I am so relieved I pushed my fears of medication aside."
22184,"And finally, FINALLY, the meds seem to actually be making a difference."
22185,2-How does psychotherapy compare to medication in terms of its ability to deal with anxiety?
22186,3-What downsides have you experienced related to medication?
22187,But I'm not taking any medication.
22188,I'm trying to become more informed before talking to my therapist about medication.
22189,"If taking no medication means spending years in therapy without big improvements, maybe I'll consider medication."
22190,"The primary issue is that, since I have started the meds, I have had some performance issues in maintaining erection."
22191,I'm just not sure if just switching the timing of those meds to early morning is a good idea since I would have taken them much less than 24 hours the day before.
22192,"I've had mri's, ct scans, blood work, medication, and therapy."
22193,Or should I just get off the 20mg (or even this medication) immediately?
22194,"No meds to keep it at bay, no doctors to give me advice, no nothing."
22195,I think my medication is starting to lose effectiveness.
22196,I thought I would at least get a year out of this medication but I feel completely normal now.
22197,"I am in therapy and have been for about a year, but I'm thinking of just going on meds."
22198,I'm trying medicine and therapy.
22199,I told her I did not want any medication and she was cool with it.
22200,"IF I go far away from them, I have to make sure I have my medicine and have a fully charged battery for them to check up on me."
22201,"I've struggled with the idea of taking medication, for reasons I am unsure of."
22202,Has anyone been in this situation and if so did you find that medication did help?
22203,"But that dark hole kick started an intense journey of therapy, medication, exercise and mindfulness."
22204,"I need to get help for it somehow, whether through therapy or medication."
22205,"I know some anxiety medication makes ADHD worse, vice-versa, etc..."
22206,Advice from a post meds ( 80 mg SSRI) bloke who is going though nursing school.
22207,"She's been on medication for just over two years, after a particularly bad stretch where she was pretty horrible to me...and possibly abusive, though only now when I've begun to read up about this is that becoming somewhat clear."
22208,"hey 

i just discovered this reddit so i apologize if this is wrong of me to post this."
22209,i'm not sure if there's some sort of megathread for these kinds of things.
22210,"again, i apologize."
22211,"please point me in the right direction if necessary

anyway - to get things started, i'm a 15 yr old male."
22212,"ever since i was bullied in kindergarten, i've had a very close minded, self kept way of life."
22213,i deal with social anxiety.
22214,it's hard to talk to kids my age.. i don't know what i can do to help.
22215,"i slur words a lot and sometimes mis-pronounce and use the wrong word

i also believe i have some type of mental disability, if that matters at all."
22216,i push myself to the limits to do my best in school but i just ultimately fail.
22217,i am so hopeful but it rarely helps me.
22218,"i have talked to my mom about it a lot and she believes there may be an issue, and i wouldn't be surprised if there was."
22219,"as for medications, the only thing i've taken recently is anti depressants.. and honestly i haven't used those in over a month."
22220,should i continue taking them?
22221,i just want to know some things that i can do to improve myself and my life.
22222,i don't want to be like this forever.
22223,thank you reddit.
22224,i'm open to any suggestions or ideas
22225,Did this side effect ever go away after awhile while still taking zoloft or did it last the whole time you were on the medicine?
22226,"I'm too embarrassed that I deliberately took the wrong dose of a medication not specified for insomnia/anxiety to tell my wife who is an RN, even though I want to call her and tell her to come home from shift so she can keep an eye on my breathing."
22227,I wouldn't know where to go to be evaluated for a mental disorder as I feel I wouldn't be prepared to pay for the service or medication that came with it.
22228,"I feel uneasy about medication as I'm afraid I would turn into some mindless zombie, but I need to turn my life around before it gets worse."
22229,She said I should think about going to the doctor and possibly get on medication.
22230,"I don't really want to be on medication, but it is literally taking control of my life."
22231,"I am having a panic attack and I have no meds, I've been so depressed this past month I haven't had the motivation to study or do anything and now I have a midterm that I desperately need to pass but I don't know shit and I feel like I can't breathe."
22232,I am not on any medication btw.
22233,"I have anxiety issues and depression, I'm currently taking medication which helps reduce my anxiety but I'm still working on it."
22234,My mother in law knows about my phobia and my anxiety and seen me take some of my medication.
22235,I would keep getting a new symptom every time I would get a bad episode and would calm myself down and (sometimes) take my medication.
22236,So reddit: how do I go about explaining that her dose is not effective regarding the xanax and I'm going to run out not because I'm over doing it but because to achieve a therapeutic effect from the prescribed medication I have to use more than .5-1.5.
22237,Did any specific medication or therapy help?
22238,I took my first dose of Lexapro today at about 1:45 pm this afternoon.
22239,I hadn't experienced any side effects other than being pretty drowsy.
22240,"Prior to taking the dose (I'm starting on 10mg, generic), I had looked up reviews and generally agonized over taking it 2 days before I worked up the courage to take it."
22241,* I'm proud of myself for actually taking my medicine.
22242,"Tonight around 6 I finally fell asleep until around 7 or so for a nap, and I woke up feeling nauseous and panicked."
22243,"I kept my cool, took some Emetrol, laid down again."
22244,"I got that scary, cold, tingly feeling of depersonalization that I get when I panic, but I kept my composure."
22245,"I closed my eyes, breathed deeply, and just laid still."
22246,"After about 10 or 15 minutes, I got up, drank some water, and felt so much better just after that."
22247,* I'm proud of how brave I was to face that anxiety head on and just ride the wave.
22248,"For those of you who might be in a situation of ""should I take these meds or should I not"", I hope this story helps you decide for yourself what the best course of action will be."
22249,"For me, I was most afraid of nausea and vomiting because I have mild emetophobia."
22250,"But it happened and I lived through it, and remembered to tell myself that the anxiety was just what I was feeling."
22251,Anyone else want to share their success stories for their medicines?
22252,Let's be encouraging for the ones who are afraid to begin.
22253,I was so afraid I nearly started having panic attacks just thinking about the side effects.
22254,"What finally convinced me was this logic: ""People are more likely to share negative reviews than positive ones."
22255,"There might be side effects you won't like, but you've lived through worse and you never know how bad it'll really be until you try."
22256,"Hope for the best but prepare for the worst."""
22257,I did exactly that.
22258,And it wasn't nearly as bad or scary as I thought it'd be
22259,"I've been on and off medication, but nothing permanent that I should be taking every day."
22260,"I hear many different things regarding how certain medications should make you feel, what they do, what they're supposed to accomplish, and what the side affects are."
22261,Would anyone taking SSRIs for anxiety/depression be willing to talk about their experiences with different medications for reference?
22262,"Also, what is the ""right"" medication supposed to do?"
22263,"Is it just supposed to make you *able* to get out of bed in the morning, or is it supposed to have a noticeable change?"
22264,"I have an anxiety disorder that is being treated with meds (Citaolpram/Celexa) but I've also spent some time doing CBT and mindfulness, which I've heard good things about."
22265,Some background info on meds: I currently take 25mg Amytriptyline at night and 3 x 40mg Propranalol throughout the day.
22266,Should I keep taking the meds?
22267,"My thinking is that when I don't have the medicine, the level of anxiety is at a steady high state, so I can't tell how bad things are, because, there is no reference point for comparison."
22268,"The medicine seems to tone it down, which makes the anxiety more noticeable when the effects slowly wear off."
22269,"Are there any techniques you know of to prevent yourself from waking up as often, outside of sleeping medication (which I tried and did not like), or ways to calm yourself down after you have woken up?"
22270,I'm excited to talk to someone/get some help and I am definitely open to medication (I wasn't before).
22271,What kinds of medication are there?
22272,I think it's more of a social anxiety and extreme performance anxiety and was wondering how I go about seeking help or medication.
22273,I'm really focused for now about getting rid of my symptoms so I can talk in class because I have 2 presentations that I know I'm not going to be able to get through without medication.
22274,"I'm obese and on blood pressure medication, so it's not like I have zero risk even though I'm in my late 20s."
22275,"I don't know what my triggers are I will be perfectly fine one moment and then everything just snowballs I start having intrusive thoughts that make me feel crazy which then triggers my panic attacks, and recently it led up to me feeling depersonalized for about 10 minutes please help me I have dealt with this for so long medication is not helping me I have been on Zoloft, celexa, lexapro, citaprolam, i refuse to take prozac I would prefer to not have to take meds at all if possible."
22276,"Now I'm sitting here, equally manic that my relationship is possibly over and that I'll have to go see a doctor or therapist and acknowledge that I need meds or something."
22277,"I also want to mention that I am taking a CRAP LOAD OF PRESCRIBED ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND ANTIPSYCHOTIC  medication, I take day and night."
22278,"I go to therapy and i go to see someone that controls my meds, I think it's called a Physiatrist or something."
22279,"I talked to my dad about my anxiety today, and he thinks I should see a therapist, and he's completely against meds."
22280,"I know this medication is one that has short shelf life, aka it leaves your system quickly and it's important to take your meds at the same time every day."
22281,"Also, it's funny too that medicine you use to reduce anxiety gives you these weird ass side effects that keep you anxious."
22282,I'm also hoping to do it medication free.
22283,"Over the past month or so I've been meddling with my meds, which my Psych said was OK."
22284,Like I've been able to get this far without meds and now suddenly I am unable to?
22285,"She causes me awful stress, she has borderline personality disorder and won't get medication."
22286,"As for medication, despite the aforementioned issue, I am trying to stop taking it."
22287,Long wall of text alert.
22288,"Female, 26, Married."
22289,Anxiety since childhood.
22290,Panic attacks and sleep anxiety since 2008.
22291,No significant depression unless the anxiety gets really bad.
22292,"Diagnosed with Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia in 2011, got to therapy and am put on medication for the first time."
22293,First medication: Celexa 20 mg.
22294,Probably helped my anxiety about 70%.
22295,"Fewer panic attacks, it felt easier to ""let things go."""
22296,But I had bothersome side effects: nausea almost every morning and horrible headaches.
22297,In 2012 the doctor switches me to Effexor extended release 37.5 mg.
22298,Seems to work better than the Celexa and makes me feel calmer.
22299,"No nausea, no headaches."
22300,But I started noticing that I was sleeping about 12 hours a day.
22301,"If I didn't have anything else to do, I would immediately default to taking a nap."
22302,"Doctor switches me to regular Effexor 25 mg that I take two times a day, hoping it will help with the drowsiness."
22303,"It does, a very small amount."
22304,I'm still sleeping a lot.
22305,"Also, my sex drive seems lower and I appear to be less sensitive during."
22306,"Well, I feel so good I decide I'll try to get off the meds."
22307,Ha.
22308,Anxiety and panic return.
22309,"So, my husband suggests that instead of no meds, the solution might be different meds."
22310,I do a bit of research.
22311,"Wellbutrin is one of the only drugs that doesn't cause sexual side effects, and it's not an SSRI or SNRI."
22312,Sounds good.
22313,The doctor agrees to try me on it.
22314,I start in July of 2014.
22315,"The doctor told me to just stop taking Effexor and start taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg. Ugh, apparently he didn’t know about Effexor withdrawl."
22316,"I get dizziness, feeling like I’m going to faint."
22317,I take the Wellbutrin while tapering gradually off the Effexor instead of completely stopping.
22318,"First week on Wellbutrin, wicked high!"
22319,Motivation!
22320,Wake up feeling refreshed!
22321,"But a few weeks later, I have a bad panic attack at the dentist, worse than I can remember in a long time."
22322,Crap.
22323,"A few weeks later, I start a new temp job."
22324,More anxiety.
22325,Fast forward to now.
22326,Lots of stuff going on right now.
22327,I'm relocating to a different state at the beginning of November.
22328,I'm stressed out about my job.
22329,"Last week, I'm so anxious that I start not sleeping."
22330,At all.
22331,"Don't get me wrong, I get tired, and I want to sleep, but I can't."
22332,Three sleepless nights in the past week.
22333,"Okay, so this isn’t working."
22334,I make an appointment with the doctor.
22335,They can’t get me in until Wednesday the 24th.
22336,Curse this Wellbutrin!
22337,I'm so sick of the insomnia and the anxiety that I completely stop taking it as of two days ago.
22338,"I still have a lot of Effexor left over, so I start taking that instead."
22339,That brings me to now.
22340,I’m aware that one can have discontinuation syndrome from stopping Wellbutrin suddenly.
22341,"I’ve already had some headaches, stomachaches, and muscle aches, which might be a result of that?"
22342,But I’m taking the risk because this medication is putting me through Hell and I don’t want it in my system anymore.
22343,"I’m also hoping that maybe since I’ve only been taking it for two months, the withdrawal won’t be so bad?"
22344,"Besides, I have the Effexor in my system."
22345,"I do seem to feel calmer, but that could also be because I’m off work for a few days."
22346,So...I honestly don’t know what to do.
22347,"I’ve thought of asking the doctor if I could try another medication, maybe Cymbalta or Pristiq, since they are also SNRIs, and maybe they would help me like Effexor did without the side effects."
22348,"Then again, everything I’ve read says not to switch medications during a transition period in your life."
22349,"So, maybe I should just stick with the Effexor and suck up the tiredness for now?"
22350,"I don’t want a medication that will give me insomnia, anxiety, or nausea."
22351,Any other side effect I can bear.
22352,Any experiences/advice to share?
22353,"All they did in the hospital was pump me full of meds, send me to some talk therapy sessions, and slap me with an $80000 bill before they discharged me to a homeless shelter in a town I'd never been in."
22354,"I had to go back to my school's psychologist, get re-prescribed meds, and now finals are three weeks away."
22355,I was on medication through out my teen years but went cold turkey for 5 years.
22356,"My psychiatrist has given me this medication to take ""as needed"" because I have really circular anxious thoughts that prevent me from sleeping, or from getting out of bed and going outside and functioning, sometimes causing panic attacks."
22357,Is this medication safe?
22358,I'm on a higher dose of medication to feel alright.
22359,"On good days, when the meds are working fine and I'm feeling adventurous, I'll go outside that zone."
22360,I never used to feel so anxious all the time.
22361,"It's little things that get me all worked up, whether it's seeing someone out at a restaurant or having to talk to a person I haven't seen in a while."
22362,Big groups often freak me out too.
22363,My main side effect is this overwhelming nausea and sometimes it ruins things that could just be so fun for me.
22364,My graduation is in 3 months and I'm worried about that...even considering not going.
22365,I'm afraid to face my girlfriends parents and extended family around my college friends and my parents.
22366,"Over the past 5 years, I've gone from ""most outgoing"" to...well, I think people still see me as outgoing but I often put on a facade."
22367,"My girlfriend is really the only one who knows to what extent this affects my life, and she's very supporting but I don't want to worry about things that aren't even happening yet!"
22368,"(Marriage, family vacations, etc.)"
22369,"My parents got divorced 4 years ago and my mom also had anxiety, but is also an alcoholic."
22370,She was on SEVERAL medicines and it completely changed her as a person so I'm very reluctant to Try anything.
22371,"I am a 21 year old male so obviously I like to have some drinks with friends and I don't want to have to change my life to fix myself (as in, if I were to take meds to become more comfortably extroverted I'd have to force myself to become more introverted :P)."
22372,I really need some help...sadly it hasn't worked for me to be comforted that other people go through this.
22373,I just need a solution!
22374,TL;DR Im slowly being crippled by my social anxiety and don't want to take mind altering medicines.
22375,Please help cure my nausea!
22376,I was against medication for a long time because I should be able to fix myself..
22377,"I have no health insurance so medication, therapists and the like are not an option for me, unfortunately."
22378,Hi everyone.
22379,So my mom has finally pushed my to make the call to schedule an appointment.
22380,In my junior year of high school I gained A LOT of weight rapidly (100 lbs in around 6 months).
22381,Stopped hanging out with all my friends.
22382,I found out I had PCOS and my hormones were completely fucked.
22383,"Got that fixed, lost the weight."
22384,"I still see myself as this huge monster and I hate myself even though I'm at a ""healthy weight""."
22385,I am 21 now.
22386,I havent had friends in years.
22387,I have isolated myself.
22388,Before I leave the house (I pretty much only leave to help my mom get groceries once a week) I set the timer on my phone camera and take pictures of myself at every angle to see how fat an outfit makes me look.
22389,I try to see how to stand and position my body to look less fat.
22390,I stand in the pantry and cry because I want to eat certain foods but wont let myself.
22391,Whenever I'm in public I am constantly thinking that other people are talking about how fat I am.
22392,In middle school and early high school I saw a psychiatrist for Bipolar 1 but stopped taking meds when I was 18 because I thought it was contributing to my rapid weight gain.
22393,I have been suffering for YEARS.
22394,I am terrified any medications the doctor gives me will make me gain weight.
22395,But I am so desperate to be social again.
22396,Most days of the week the only time I leave the house is to get the mail...
22397,I just don't know what to expect.
22398,I don't know what to say to the doctor.
22399,I've never been good with doctors.
22400,Not in the sense where I use street drugs but in the sense where I obsess about my medication.
22401,"I have tried CBT for 3 years with destroying my panic disorder but the underlying problem remains, I have been on over 40 psych meds with too little effect or too many side effects."
22402,I recently decided to go on meds because everything I have been doing on my own just isn't enough.
22403,"But I am so nervous about taking medication, becoming addicted, bad side effects, etc."
22404,"Also, I know that taking meds isn't going to fix my problems, just help me cope along with everything else I am doing (eating healthy, doing yoga, the therapy and coping skills group, etc.)."
22405,"Also, I just started seeing someone and even though he knows I have anxiety and go to therapy (he does, too), he doesn't know I am starting meds tomorrow."
22406,"What medicines, if any, have you taken?"
22407,How does it help?
22408,What has worked for you?
22409,Side effects?
22410,"Turns fucking out that one of the less mentioned side effects of this medication is anxiety.... LOL

So pretty much my already anxious self, already extra shaky and fucky from actually being sick, took these meds."
22411,I've been dating a girl for about 3 months now (we are both in our mid 20s) and noticed that she had bottles for sertraline hcl and alprazolam (zoloft and xanax) on her dresser over the weekend.
22412,"I normally put my phone and some water exactly where they were, so they caught my eye this time."
22413,We also drink and vaporize weed about once or twice a week.
22414,"I've never seen her take these pills, unless she is also taking them with her birth control at 10pm."
22415,She has told me that her mother is bipolar and requires medication.
22416,I am mostly just trying to figure out the best way to talk to her about it (or if I even should bring it up at all).
22417,"I know very little about these kind of medications and have always thought I never would want to take them, but I understand that they are wonderful for other to feel normal again."
22418,What should I even ask her about?
22419,"From some reading online, it seems like xanax is more for short term stuff, and that zoloft is long term in it's use, but that you really need to keep taking it once you start."
22420,I don't know if she is/was suffering from depression or anxiety or anything.
22421,"She gets embarrassed fairly easily, so I'd imagine asking her about this could easily make her very anxious, and so I don't want to do anything to upset her."
22422,I just want to help and for her to feel comfortable with talking to me about these things.
22423,Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this too.
22424,"If there is a better place, please let me know."
22425,I am on medication and I see a therapist.
22426,I'm trying to decide weither I want to go on meds but am afraid of side-effects (go figure).
22427,What are your experiences with anxiety medication and with anxiety in general?
22428,I will disscuss with my therapist about taking medication and will take with my journal.
22429,I am also seeing a psychiatrist in two weeks to talk about medication.
22430,I'm currently waiting for surgery to fix my deviated septum to see if it helps but I haven't even got anything about it yet and no medication has worked to ease it so far.
22431,I'm from Australia and I have been seeing a psychiatrist for the last 10 weeks and he has told me to try out some medication to help with my Anxiety/Depression because I haven't been showing many signs of improvement.
22432,"When I first realised that I was sick, I wanted to stay away from medication because I figured that it couldn't be a long-term solution."
22433,My question is - what medication is out there that I should stay away from?
22434,"She told me I'm strong and I don't need meds, I can handle everything and she believes in me."
22435,My main problem is anxiety but with my medication side effects I am having trouble.
22436,Went on meds and in a week or two was straight and normal.
22437,Same anxiety happened a year later and adjusted the meds and all was good.
22438,Saw a doc today and I'm going back on my meds but that take time.
22439,Edit: on day 4 with meds and still hanging in there.
22440,On the topic of medication- didn't feel right with it.
22441,"Things got worse, and I went to my GP who changed my medicine from Lexapro to Fetzima."
22442,"I've switched meds (SSRI's) 4 times in the last 6 months, and I am getting frustrated that none of them are working."
22443,Any suggestions on which meds have worked for people or how to stay optimistic through these trying times?
22444,How do I know when I will be on the right meds or if I have already been on them but in the wrong combination?
22445,I read some people's comments on a post here and am now extremely upset.
22446,I have had GAD for over 4 years now.
22447,It's only a little tiny bit better than it was when it first started.
22448,"Despite many counselors and a psychiatrist and, therapies and medications."
22449,My condition is something that affects me almost daily.
22450,"Ranging from minimally obsessive worrying to selective mutism, vomitting and panic attacks."
22451,I need my employer to know these things.
22452,I need them to know that I might have to leave for a moment.
22453,or is life just fucking stupid?
22454,"what the fuck can I do
if I cant even work
because IM NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A DISABILITY

I'm so fucking angry and sad!"
22455,what's the point of this?
22456,"I have mild anxiety, (used to be on meds for panic attacks, off for about a year now) and lately my anxiety has been getting really bad."
22457,"My panic attacks are back, and starting to become as frequent as before I started the meds."
22458,"I really really don't want to be back on meds, but it's starting to sound like my only option :["
22459,"The medication seems to be working, but it has also increased my anxiety issues."
22460,"During that time, I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, but me and my therapist believed that I could work through my anxiety through counseling and working on coping mechanisms and that medication would not be necessary."
22461,Seriously!
22462,"I'm trying to get to know a guy, he blows me off, and all of a sudden my chest feel so tight and I want to cry."
22463,"We only talked for a few days, so it shouldn't bother me!"
22464,What's worse is when you can't figure out *what* it is that you're anxious over.
22465,"To make matters worse, I am experiencing some serious vertigo from one of my medications so that is not helping with the whole tight chest, heart racing, oh and let's add vertigo."
22466,I guess maybe I'm bothered because I feel like it was totally something I did (which is probably true).
22467,"I mean, IDK what I was expecting out of it, I was just kind of gonna let whatever happened, happen."
22468,"I hate feeling like I drive men away, but the last few years it's happened enough I can't help but feel like I'm the problem, you know maybe that's why I'm so damn anxious tonight."
22469,"I'm not mad at him for blowing me off, but then *I* don't think I really was out of line with anything right before he stopped replying."
22470,"Who knows, I just needed to vent and hopefully just get it off my chest so I can breathe again."
22471,"Thanks for listening, Merry Christmas"
22472,I'm a chronic sufferer of Derealization disorder and have only recently been diagnosed having struggled for years with no medication or support.
22473,The psychistrist increased my meds from 25mg to 50mg last Friday and I'm so dizzy.
22474,"Just
Wondered if anyone has experienced this with their meds and whether it did get better in the end?"
22475,I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember.
22476,"It was never a big deal, I'd feel all the feelings but still could make it through a day."
22477,Just felt burnt out a lot.
22478,"Fast forward, I went through a period of heavy heavy panic attacks, most of 3 years were spent in a panic attack."
22479,Very debilitating.
22480,"I thought that I could die, and I still have some phobias from it."
22481,Have had none now for like 3 years or so.
22482,"Since that time period, I sleep much better, have much more general anxiety rather than any peaks."
22483,"I can dance in a crowded place without feeling any surge of anxiety, talk to whomever... but it seems like my brain is just not so awake anymore."
22484,Like the volume is turned down everywhere.
22485,I feel less enjoyment too.
22486,It's really not so bad though.
22487,I don't feel depressed.
22488,"However, it has effected my ability to concentrate and my short term memory."
22489,"For whatever reason, these two things that were a strong ability for me in the past are GONE."
22490,Comically gone.
22491,"Alzheimer's in my 20s bad, at my worst points."
22492,"Guys, why I'm posting this right now is that I have this college class."
22493,"It's difficult, but I'm finding it to be ridiculous."
22494,I don't know what to do.
22495,I sit down to do homework and just sit there.
22496,"Not browsing reddit, not watching TV."
22497,I'm just so freaked that I can't get it done.
22498,"And I usually test in the top5%, now I literally am getting the worst grade in the class."
22499,"I take no medication regularly, but on occasions will take piracetam, nicotine (not smoking), a cup of coffee, rhodiola, modafinil."
22500,"I take low doses of every one of these, just enough to break me out of a rut because I don't like being overmedicated/not sleeping."
22501,Only take them in the AM.
22502,And I don't take them every day.
22503,"My schedule with them varies, sometimes I will take one for weeks with weeks off sometimes 1 day a week."
22504,I like to give my mind a break.
22505,"No recreational drugs, very limited alcohol."
22506,I'm so freaked out about being freaked out.
22507,My mind is like mush.
22508,And I have much harder classes coming up.
22509,What the heck do I do?
22510,I have tried medications and really nothing works for me.
22511,There are side effects like too much or too little sleep that I can't deal with.
22512,I guess there is no good answer right?
22513,You can treat this as a rant.
22514,Not sure what I'm really asking.
22515,"If anyone can relate or give me whatever worked best for you in a similar situation, that would be awesome."
22516,Thanks for reading.
22517,"If anyone is feeling this way, I hope you feel better too."
22518,"At first as I said I couldn't even leave my house without the constant anxious feeling, then I started taking some medication (stopped after 2 years), lost weight (102kg(224lbs) &gt; 69kg(152lbs)), I can go to the pool and exercise without too much anxiety and I can generally leave my house without much of an issue."
22519,"My mom refuses to allow me to get medication or see a therapist about it, but it's becoming such a big part of my life, and I need it to stop."
22520,I am going to focus my blog on anxiety for a while.
22521,There is no medical cure for anxiety.
22522,"We have medications, and I'm not convinced this is the answer to creating peace and happiness in our lives."
22523,The problem lies in our ability to handle stress.
22524,Every one of us is different.
22525,"Personally, I have anxiety about writing."
22526,I am scared for every blog post.
22527,Is it too long?
22528,Am I too verbose?
22529,Does any of it make sense?
22530,"Then I sit there and wait for something smart to say, but it never comes."
22531,I just keep writing and I turn into a dog chasing after its own tail.
22532,I continue to search for a more simple way to reach out to people but my anxiety stops me from being simple.
22533,"I have to be something else, right?"
22534,or maybe...
22535,"I have to write like no one else, right?"
22536,I guess not.
22537,But anxiety effects all of us in so many different ways.
22538,My aim is to help where anxiety creates discord in our every day functioning.
22539,If you are a person with anxiety I hope to offer you a piece of sanity or solid help when you visit Progressive Transformation.
22540,I don't want you to think I'm pretending to be smart or better.
22541,I'm not.
22542,"http://www.progressivetransformation.blogspot.com

So keep checking back, let me know you're here and I will do everything in my ability to provide you with information and clues to the difficulties we all face."
22543,Today I give myself a thumbs up because that's what I need.
22544,You can have it to.
22545,"A combination of my first boyfriend being psychologically abusive and being bullied as a teenager lead to me suffering from anxiety, coupled with depersonalisation – however, a combination of CBT and medication has helped to cope well in recent years."
22546,"Yesterday he explained that he had been prescribed medication for GAD, depersonalisation and obsessive paralysis which may explain his distant state recently, as well as silence when we were discussing things; he explained he couldn’t process what to say to me when I asked him how he felt for me, previously."
22547,He told me that he did have feelings for me but didn't seem to realize that i'd be open to the idea of waiting to see how he felt after taking medication and receiving therapy.
22548,"I try to explain that I will *never* not be anxious; that even if my anxiety required medication (which it does not), that it would only make me *a tiny bit* less anxious."
22549,"(Most anti-anxiety meds make me apathetic, at most.)"
22550,"I'm sorry that this is so long...

A little over a month ago, I had my second panic attack, after of which followed three more within the span of three weeks."
22551,"I've imitated my previous rituals (exercise, sleep, proper eating), but unfortunately this time I'm having some serious side effects."
22552,"I have heavy tension in my shoulders and in my neck, headaches that range from the back of my head to the front from temple to temple, a strong straining on my eyes, ringing in my ears, a seasick stomach,  a tight chest, and what feels like swelling in my throat."
22553,Along with this I often get very dizzy and my eyes will go blurry.
22554,"Occasionally it feels like my body is rising from the inside (much like the feeling of rising in a roller coaster), and I constantly feel as though I'm going to just pass out and never wake up."
22555,"From what I've come to understand, I *will not* die, and I know this."
22556,"I've been doing activities that relieve stress for me, as well as learning breathing techniques and taking up meditating, but the side effects seem to be increasingly worse."
22557,"I've gone to a doctor, I've been put on Valium for emergencies, but that's as far as any treatment goes."
22558,I am *not* taking any other medications.
22559,"I can manage it decently when I'm alone, but it does make it incredibly difficult to focus in school, fall asleep, and be intimate with my family and friends."
22560,It's also making my depression a bit more tricky to manage.
22561,"So as it stands, my questions are as follows:

Are these side affects normal?"
22562,How much is linked solely to my anxiety?
22563,Should I seek further medical help?
22564,What are things I can do in the mean time to help improve these overwhelming feelings?
22565,Does it ever go away?
22566,"Again, I'm very sorry that this was so long."
22567,"I'd really appreciate some help, though."
22568,"I'm not so big on looking through medical sites, either, so I was hoping Reddit would be a good place to try and start to get some answers..."
22569,Thank you...
22570,"I suffer from anxiety and depression, and while I take medication for it, I have a really hard time with constantly worrying about living up to everyone's standards."
22571,"I'd love to stay off medication, but my current life is really hurting myself."
22572,Something that has really been irritating to me is people confusing an anxiety disorder with an attack.
22573,"I've had crippling anxiety, it's how I deal with issues."
22574,"When bad things happen in my life, I start to have really bad panic attacks."
22575,"I've gone to ER multiple times, been on several medications, and have tried therapy with my limited income."
22576,Anxiety stole my life as a teenager.
22577,I lost every friend I had.
22578,I was secluded and didn't know what was wrong with me and my family was simply not there.
22579,When I see someone post or say that they have anxiety about homework or meeting someone on a date... Just fuck off with your non-problems.
22580,It really offends me and makes me think about how many people out there have to read the whiny bullshit while seeking truth.
22581,It makes an actual disorder even more lonely.
22582,I'm here now after reading some dumb hipster crap on facebook from someone who got high one time and thought they had a disorder.
22583,Made me think about people who I should be helping based on actual experience.
22584,That's why I'm on here meow.
22585,"It has been almost four years since my last visit to the ER and I've been doing good with my meds and working with my doctors, however it never gets better!"
22586,It seems like it's getting worse!
22587,"I've been going to therapy, weekly, for two years and have been on a number of medications."
22588,Currently I'm on 100mg of Lumicdol for my anxiety and 20mg of Adderall X-R for ADD.
22589,The Lumicdol has helped with my sleep a little but it still doesn't help with my anticipatory anxiety.
22590,Last night I couldn't sleep and I pretty much threw a temper tantrum because I had to get up at 6AM to go surfing with a friend.
22591,"If I have anything scheduled in the morning, I work myself up and can't sleep because I'm worried and anxious."
22592,"I have been tracking my sleep and it went from 7 hours Sunday night and got less every night, averaging about 5 hrs a night."
22593,It's killing me!
22594,I really don't have anything to be worried about but I still can't relax and unwind.
22595,What can I do?
22596,I've got an appointment with my psychiatrist next week and I might have him take me off Lumicdol because it's not doing anything.
22597,I might have to get off the Aderall too.
22598,It's helped me a lot with work but it also feeds my anxiety.
22599,It sucks though because when I get off the Adderall I get super depressed.
22600,Help!
22601,Any ideas?
22602,"And then while going to counseling I decided to go to a Psychiatric Center to try medication to calm my nerves since everything, and anything, makes me nervous."
22603,It's been a month without medication.
22604,"And so, I gave up on the idea of taking medication."
22605,I've had panic attacks for the last 15 years after a bad reaction to sleeping pills.
22606,"I have also had an irregular heartbeat for the last 8 years, so I don't drink caffeine or take any drugs."
22607,"With the anxiety, taking any sort of medication completely wipes me out, and some medications will cause my heart to beat weird which makes me even more anxious."
22608,"I go into fight or flight right away whenever I start to feel out of control of my body, with an overall sense of impending doom."
22609,So now I have to get my wisdom teeth out.
22610,"I was born with a cleft lip and palate and have been put under numerous times for surgery, and I have also had my appendix out and had surgery for a broken arm, so I am no stranger to being put under, but that is what makes it THAT MUCH WORSE."
22611,Being put under and forcefully falling asleep makes me want to jump out of my skin.
22612,"It's the worst feeling I can imagine, and anti-anxiety medication has the opposite effect on me because I hate the feeling of drugs ""working."""
22613,My panic disorder and irregular heartbeat were all diagnosed AFTER I had my last surgery which was probably 1997.
22614,"Since then I have been careful enough to not injure myself or have any sort of complications that require having surgery of any kind, until now."
22615,How do I cope with this?
22616,"My boyfriend said he would go with me and hold my hand (I'm almost 30) and I think that will help, but I need to know I'm not going to die and that it's not that bad."
22617,"I am also deathly afraid of taking strong pain medicine so I don't know how I will do once I am out of surgery :(

Anyone else with crippling panic disorder that has gone through this?"
22618,"I have never taken meds for my anxiety, but it has become out of control and is seriously effecting my life so I figured now is as good a time as any."
22619,"I'll be making a doctor's appointment today to talk to someone and start getting the help I need, but I wanted to hear from others who have taken meds for their anxiety/depression."
22620,What should I expect or look for as I go through the process of getting on meds?
22621,"I've been taking a lot of the drug kratom to help me, i just wish i had some real anxiety medication to help me (benzodiazepines) but i cannot get prescribed them due to me being labeled as a benzo addict."
22622,I just want to know if there is any type of medication you fellow redditor's have found that really helps that is non-narcotic?
22623,In the back of my mind I'm also worried about a change in medication and the problems that go along with that.
22624,Then the medication ran out and social anxiety soon took over my life again.
22625,"My old doctor is extremely open to trying new medication on me and probably wouldn't say no if I brought it up, but due to my anxiety I get really worked up asking doctors directly for a certain type of medication (I feel like I'm being judged as a pill seeker)."
22626,I HATE taking prescription medication.
22627,Or as a last chance is there any medicine I can take to stop it?
22628,"it started in 2011 and i got on meds ( 25mg of amitriptyline) in early 2012 and it was good for a while, I had my life back but it gets worse then gets slightly better then worse then slightly better... sometimes I leak a tiny bit."
22629,I haven't been on anti-depressants or medication for my anxiety in almost 6 months.
22630,I was suppose to receive counselling to help get me into some sort of therapy to take over where I was stopping at the medication.
22631,Seems I'm reacting to the medication and marijuana.
22632,"After diagnosis, I went through about five years of talk/behavorial therapy and never took meds."
22633,"Instead of taking the meds, I changed my situation at home, moved out and became much more happier."
22634,"I'm not on any medication (I was on Paxil for 5 weeks back in September, but that was it), and haven't smoked in two weeks, and haven't done other drugs."
22635,"details: 25 | F | 5'5'' | 175 | white | timeframe: Lunch time - present | area of the body: head, skin, stomach | current conditions: stress, weight issues, back pain from new job | meds: birth control and valtrex as needed |
Thank you."
22636,"So far my tactics have been to breathe, listen to my meditation app, and I'm about to take my anti-anxiety meds again."
22637,Is this a normal reaction to taking these types of meds together?
22638,"i've lost about 15lbs, which has been nice and working on my fitness alongside of the meds aiding in weight loss."
22639,The sexual problems are stressing me out more than before I was on the medication.
22640,I am currently taking a small pharmacy worth of medication to control my anxiety/depression/migraines.
22641,I have been working with my doctor to find a medication that will help my anxiety as well as curb some spasticity issues on my left side caused by a stroke.
22642,"I am taking all of my meds at night, but my symptoms are present nearly all day, especially when I am not doing anything."
22643,"I don't know how much of this could be managed with medication, or how much could be managed by learning more in depth about precautions to take to reduce exposure to illnesses on the job, etc."
22644,They told me that I had panic disorder and was prescribed more medicine to take as in Xanax from one hospital an kolonipin from another and I got no real answers from either to why this was happening so severe all that sudden.
22645,Butu problem now is that I feel like I don't need to go to therapy and don't need to take medicine.
22646,"I'm in therapy, diagnosed, on meds..."
22647,"We were in charge of administering her meds, changing her colostomy bags, and getting her food and drinks and puke buckets as she was confined to a hospital bed."
22648,"We had to get up every 3 hours to give her meds, and sometimes even in between."
22649,"I don’t want to go on medication, but I’m afraid that that will be what they tell me I need, even though I don’t want it."
22650,"But it's a temporary fix and I'm afraid that once I get off the meds, all my insecurities and anxieties will come crashing back if I don't continue with this therapy."
22651,"I deal with SA, GA and panic attacks but I have never taken medication."
22652,"I was diagnosed with ""treatment resistant"" everything, since meds will work for me for 6-18 months, then become ineffective."
22653,"I dont want to take meds to control this kind of response because I want to try something else first, but I have no idea how else to handle it."
22654,"Find a professional to talk to, learn breathing and meditation, get medication, whatever it takes."
22655,In time you will find the right combination of techniques and medication(s) to help you find it.
22656,"I took them but haven't taken them, because I hate medication."
22657,"My dad has anxiety and OCD and it runs in the family, he has been on medication for years and I am the same way he is."
22658,"I just want to start feeling better, but I'm too scared to ask my therapist about meds because I don't want him to think I'm some druggie or something."
22659,"I was prescribed 10mg of Celexa for anxiety, because I've reached a point in therapy and self-work where things are not improving much anymore, so I have decided I should try medication for a while and see what happens."
22660,I would like to try a different kind of medication but I'm a bit nervous about it.
22661,"This time, I didn't even really taper off properly and have had no negative effects in the sixty days I've been medication-free."
22662,"I was a relatively normal kid (I think), until age 15 when I got severe acne and lost all my friends and started having suicidal thoughts daily."
22663,"I'm 25 now, haven't made a single friend since 15."
22664,Social skills are abysmal.
22665,"I managed to somehow graduate from a state college, although with terrible grades, but I'm still working at a grocery store part time and living with my parents because I can't handle the real world."
22666,Never had a girlfriend in my life either.
22667,"I just work, play videogames to distract myself, and fantasize about killing myself."
22668,"I've been on about 5 or 6 different depression medications which didn't have any mental effect, they just made me tired or sick."
22669,Also tried many therapists to no avail.
22670,Any help would be great!
22671,I'm really happy to have found this subreddit!
22672,"I hope at least one person here will be able to relate or offer some advice to my problem, I unfortunately don't have anyone I can really express my thoughts to."
22673,"As a note, I am living with my husband but when I try and talk about the worries I have he never really seems to know what to say, or understand how troubled I am."
22674,I guess sometimes people just can't relate.
22675,"Anyways, I'm 27/F, my whole life i've always been a ruminator and an over-all worry wart."
22676,"I stress out easily, and although my immediate reaction is usually emotional, I've definitely become more adept at thinking before reacting to stressful situations."
22677,"I am not on any medications, prescription or otherwise."
22678,"Also, I apologize for all the before hand information leading to my current dilemma."
22679,I feel like the backstory is kind of important though!
22680,In April my husband and I relocated to a new city and I was struggling to find work.
22681,"While unemployed, I started going through some pretty intense worrying that happened mostly at night while I was trying to fall asleep."
22682,"I'd start reliving confrontations with annoying people, getting into imaginary arguments with people I haven't seen in ages, and I was losing sleep over it."
22683,"I was worried about being a financial burden to my husband, for the first time ever I was living in a city with no immediate family nearby."
22684,I was lonely and maybe even a bit depressed.
22685,I started forcing myself to limit my negative thoughts to a specific time of day to avoid going overboard and it helped a lot.
22686,"I felt better and more in control, so I was pretty happy!"
22687,"Unfortunately, a new anxiety decided to pop up."
22688,"A young man my age hit on me and gave me his number, which is nice, but you know...married!"
22689,"So while I was flattered, I shrugged it off."
22690,I don't know why but that seemed to be a trigger for me.
22691,I guess I was afraid of any awkward confrontations I could potentially have with him for turning him down.
22692,"I started really worrying about running into him again, and I found myself constantly shoulder checking when I was out jogging to make sure he wasn't around (he mentioned the street he lived on when he tried to give me his number, and unless he was lying that meant he was only a few streets away from me)."
22693,"Things escalated from there and I started getting nervous about being home alone (still jobless, so the hubby was gone all day)."
22694,"My main concern was that I'd turn a corner in the apartment and there would be an intruder or something, and I wouldn't know what to do."
22695,"This fear just kept growing and growing, and no matter how many times I'd try and talk myself down I would never truly feel better until my husband came home."
22696,A month or so later my best friend from my old home city came to visit and I was incredibly grateful for her constant company.
22697,"One morning we were making breakfast for ourselves as my husband had already left for work, when we heard someone walking towards the kitchen."
22698,"My friend already knew about my increasing fears, and we both expected to be alone all day so it was an alarming situation for her too."
22699,She had a huge knife in her hand (I can't remember what she was chopping) and we both whirled around to see my husband walk into the kitchen.
22700,"The two of us had been chatting and laughing so loud that we hadn't heard him come home to get his laptop, which he needs for his job."
22701,"My friend laughed, and I cried."
22702,"My husband apologized, thinking we had heard him come home, but it took about fifteen minutes for my hands to stop shaking."
22703,Nights continued to get worse.
22704,"Even when I started working and I had something to preoccupy me and wear me out, as soon as the lights were out I'd be jumping at every noise and generally just having a restless sleep, waking up multiple times in a panic."
22705,So now I'm at the point where I haven't slept well in months.
22706,I've had a couple of break-in related nightmares that make me sit up in bed for a couple of hours afterwards while my husband is blissfully unaware.
22707,"Last night for example, I sat awake until three in the morning because a) I was already worrying by the time my head hit the pillow and b) I heard some shuffling in the direction of the hallway, twice in about an hour."
22708,"My fears went into overdrive over the noises and both times my heart started racing, to the point that I was incredibly hot and actually starting to sweat."
22709,I mustered up enough courage to get up and turn the hall light on and (big surprise) the hall was empty.
22710,"Still, I had to kick the cat out of the bedroom for the night and sleep with the door closed."
22711,My only reasoning behind doing this is thanks to our sticky bedroom door.
22712,"You can't open it without it catching on the frame and making a groan, so I knew I would wake up if someone was to enter."
22713,"On top of that, I left my lamp on for most of the time I was awake as a sort of security blanket, which no doubt annoyed my husband."
22714,"So, how on earth do I stop worrying once the lights go out??"
22715,"I've tried looking up other cases of night anxiety and general worrying, but I can't really seem to find any decent information."
22716,I feel like there should be something I can do to make the fear go away or at least help me control it.
22717,"If you made it through all of that, thank you, a thousand times."
22718,Even if you can't offer any advice I appreciate the listen.
22719,"TLDNR: I worry about people breaking into the house (typically at night), can't shut my brain off, lose hours of sleep to my brain escalating harmless noises into horror stories and constantly wake up through the night in fear."
22720,How do you beat this?
22721,I have tried meds and other tactics to try and help myself but I still notice that even the smallest things can trigger my anxiety and make me feel down.
22722,"I'm really not in a position to pursue any professional help as far as therapists or medication goes, and to be honest I'd highly prefer not to go down that road anyway."
22723,the doctor did all the tests and turns out it was just caused by anxiety :( she offered to prescribe some meds but we decided not to for now since i am young and healthy etc.
22724,"Lately I've been having difficulties with medications, before none of them really helped or so I thought since I still couldn't handle things, but after being off medication for 4 days because of an allergic reaction to medication on the weekend, I couldn't immediately go to the doctor and other things got in the way."
22725,"Today I realized I can't live without medication, I'm so messed up, I just want to cry."
22726,"I try to be strong, push through things, not let people know how messed up I really am."
22727,But I come home and bawl my eyes out.
22728,"My clonazepam for my panic attacks isn't even working, I went to the hospital with my future MIL to visit her brother who's admitted and I could hardly breath and my heart was freaking out."
22729,"I was trying so hard to be strong, but I am just a fucked up person who can't even function in society."
22730,I barely got through it and came home and burst out in tears and hid in my room.
22731,I can't take it.
22732,I hate myself.
22733,Why do I have to be broken?
22734,Why can't I handle people or things?
22735,Why can't I get better?
22736,"I've tried 8 medications, none of them made me feel like I could handle being around people at a job for 8 hours a day, let alone 8 hours every two days, I'm just a piece of trash that can't even get better."
22737,"I could blame it on my abusive parents, or my ex that sexually assaulted me, or the fact that I was isolated from people my entire life, but no."
22738,There are people who've been there and conquered it and I can't and I hate myself for it.
22739,"I thought I was ""better"" and stopped taking the medication when my Rx refills ran out."
22740,"Apparently, he is on a six-month medication, and I know it for sure that he has been under diagnosed."
22741,"In fact, my pdoc has given me a thought-stopping medicine, to control my vulnerability to bipolar

Had it not been for my brother, I would have killed myself already."
22742,I'm starting to lose hope that any meds will ever help me.
22743,I've had anxiety most of my life which eventually turned into generalized anxiety disorder which then spiraled into depression.
22744,I was using Zoloft for 2 years with excellent success until it pooped out.
22745,I've been bouncing around from one antidepressant to another with never having total relief of my symptoms.
22746,Basically I've had it.
22747,Sick of testing out medications and dealing with the side effects.
22748,Also worried about what this is doing to my brain and body.
22749,I would like to try a more holistic route but not sure where to start and I'm concerned it won't be as effective.
22750,Has anyone tried alternative options for chronic anxiety/depression?
22751,Looking for some encouragement and would love to hear about your experience!
22752,:)
22753,"I used to have severe sadness (I wouldn't know if it was depression, I never went to the doctor), but it recently went away after stopping my ADD meds which were 30mg of Adderall."
22754,"It was bad at first with no meds, but I instantly felt happier all around."
22755,"I can't afford decent treatment for my mental stuff (and I'm on shitty medication), I'm stuck living with my dad, and I have no money to use for anything recreational."
22756,I'm considering getting help.
22757,What are some of your experiences with this?
22758,Was it effective?
22759,Worth it?
22760,Your thoughts on medications?
22761,Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy?
22762,"The thing that concerns me is this lack of acceptance of my current situation, the anxiety at all; it is part of me, right?"
22763,"Is my control only limited to how I respond to it, or can I eliminate it?"
22764,Now I'm learning that these effects can even be permanent after you've gotten off the medicine sometimes (PSSD).
22765,I sought out some therapy and was medicated until I learned to control my severe panic attacks without the meds.
22766,I would like some advice that doesn't involve medication where I can get over this anxiety of mine.
22767,"Hey all(:

I've been taking a Lexapro off-brand medication (for about 5months now) that has helped me a little."
22768,"For the last 10 years I have been on again off again on anxiety medication, and none seem to work."
22769,"Then I actually went almost 3 years without medication, where I finished high school, and things seemed to be looking up."
22770,"I've been on the very edge of panic since we moved, and my medication is not working."
22771,"So, I've finally decided to see my doctor and go with my psychologist's advice to combine medication with therapy."
22772,I guess I just wanted some advice or positive words from you guys who've got experience with anxiety medication.
22773,I posted a couple of times last year asking if I should return to my white collar job or stay in the country town with my family 4000km away (I’m in Australia).
22774,"I decided to come back to my Federal Government job, but I have found it hard."
22775,"The main reason is my anxiety, which can sometimes manifest into depression like I’ve had this last week (I know this is not the time to be making decisions)."
22776,"I have had anxiety my whole life, seen psych’s for 10 years, different medications, nothing has made much difference, although mindfulness training I’m doing now is sort of looking good."
22777,"I know I feel worse in my white collar job here (days off the anxiety doesn’t trouble me too much), but I feel I should do this job to succeed in life and to make use of my qualifications (I’m a lawyer) and there are many good things about the job (I’m working 24 hrs week for $50K a year, good colleagues, conditions etc)."
22778,"But in the country I was more relaxed, and every day I dream of going back and helping my family build sheds, earthworks etc."
22779,"on our land (of course, while over there, I had anxiety too, and depressive episodes), I just wasn’t doing as much – it’s a real sleepy place where I’d probably never have to work again."
22780,"I’ve always found any kind of office work really tedious – just the environment, working with others, and trying to pretend I find any of the work important at all."
22781,I am really happy when I am in the bush (maybe my part indigenous heritage).
22782,"That’s said, I want to succeed, and I enjoy the academic world (and would be described as nerdy), and the other problems with the country is it’s so isolated from the rest of Australia and family, friends etc  I have here (from 8 years of uni here), would be hard to find a nice partner, and that I can’t really live for too long with my dad (15 beers every afternoon - he’s still a nice guy, but it’s difficult)."
22783,I’ve spent my whole 20s moving around Australia trying to find something (got fired couple times) and I think I know now that my mental issues have been holding me back.
22784,"I’ve tried really hard last 12 months to get myself healthy because I know it’s the most important thing (I stopped drinking excessively), but, as much as I want to I don’t want to give up on dreams of having more than what I have (a good job, choice of a good partner, better doctors in city to help with my issues, eventually money and nice house etc)  to go back and feel like I’m ‘giving up’."
22785,"My mental issues have already caused enough trauma and stopped me progressing in life (caused bad decisions), and I don’t want them to keep doing that."
22786,"But I don’t know I can cope here, now or at any point in my life."
22787,So what should I do?
22788,Opinions very much appreciated.
22789,I'm an almost 24 y/o female who began working as an RN this year in one of the country's top pediatric hospitals.
22790,It's my dream job.
22791,"When I was younger, I struggled with anxiety, depression, self-harm, and eating disorders."
22792,"Throughout college, though, I threw myself into recovery."
22793,"I saw a therapist, was placed on medications, and within a year, felt completely healthy, happy, and confident."
22794,"And then a couple of months ago, I began feeling anxious again - pretty much constantly."
22795,And that turned into having mild panic attacks.
22796,"And this spiraled so quickly, that now, I can barely get out of bed most days because I feel physically ill from anxiety."
22797,The most frustrating part is that I have no idea why.
22798,Has anyone else had a similar experience?
22799,"I don't understand - I'm financially secure, live in a nice apartment, have the job I've always wanted, have a supportive family and supportive friends..."
22800,I just feel like my brain up and broke.
22801,And now I don't know how to put it back together.
22802,"I'm prescribed Zoloft for depression and generalized anxiety, and Xanax for breakthrough panic."
22803,"I really tried to avoid benzos, but in the end, they seemed to be the only medication that helped during severe episodes."
22804,"If anybody has any suggestions or advice, or even if you can just reach out and say you can relate... anything would be so appreciated."
22805,"I just can't keep feeling insane, or like I'm the only person who's experiencing this."
22806,"Sending all of my love to anyone and everyone out there struggling with themselves, too."
22807,I really hope we all find peace with ourselves someday.
22808,There are some things I want you to know about me and my condition.
22809,"I am not necessarily shy, that's not what having a panic disorder is."
22810,I am an outgoing person who often feels trapped inside a wall of fear.
22811,I get really angry sometimes because what I feel like is the real me is trapped behind my anxiety.
22812,I probably want to be affectionate and laid back and fun at any given time but you make me nervous.
22813,"It's not your fault, it's just people- it's nothing you do or did."
22814,I can only become desensitized to people by spending a lot of time with them and even then sometimes it doesn't work.
22815,"Sometimes, with some people, it works right away."
22816,I know that what I'm afraid of isn't real.
22817,"I know that the threat is an illusion and that I'm not really going to get hurt, but my body is telling me otherwise."
22818,"I try to talk myself out of it but ""fight or flight"" is one of the most basic and powerful instincts of the body, and it doesn't always listen."
22819,I am working really hard to combat my anxiety disorder.
22820,"Some days I start to give up because I've been fighting for so long and it doesn't seem to change, or I make progress and then I backslide."
22821,It's inevitable that I get depressed and may not seem to be working to help myself.
22822,Having an anxiety disorder is really hard and I promise I'm doing what I can.
22823,"Much of the fight that goes on with my condition happens inside the head, so while it might not seem like I am trying to help myself, I am."
22824,I am constantly exhausted.
22825,"If your body went through intense terror each day (or sometimes, just from time-to-time) and then crashed, you'd be exhausted too."
22826,I have to make myself move when I am crashing and sometimes I just have to sleep.
22827,"My body doesn't present that as an option; it's just an order- ""You."
22828,Sleep.
22829,"Now""."
22830,Sometimes I don't get things done because I am tired.
22831,"Please don't get mad at me if I don't always do everything I am supposed to do- it can be a real struggle to do little things that most people don't think twice about, like walking into a store, running errands, sometimes even leaving my house."
22832,Some of my behavior might seem pretty odd at times.
22833,"I might make someone go with me to places I ought to be able to go to alone because I need a ""safe"" person there."
22834,"I might come off as clingy and dependent on others, but my reasoning is not what you might assume- ""safe"" people are our anchors to sanity."
22835,"Real or not, we assume we can count on them to help us if we become terrified, and that can make the difference between fleeing a place or being able to stick it out."
22836,"We develop triggers in specific places and that place, as innocuous as it might seem to you, scares me to death."
22837,"I don't want to feel that way; it's embarrassing, but I do."
22838,How would you feel if you were terrified out of your mind in a place or around a person you know is harmless in your heart?
22839,I try many things to combat my anxiety.
22840,"If you've heard about a technique, I've probably heard about it."
22841,"I've tried meditation, yoga, acupuncture, keeping active, positive self-talk, cognitive behavioral therapy, regular therapy, and medication, among things."
22842,I've probably tried lots of different medication.
22843,"Anxiety disorder (and depression, since the two are linked- you'd be depressed if you had an anxiety disorder) often get treated with strong medication, and strong medication has side-effects."
22844,"When I am trying new medications I might be ""off"" and irrational."
22845,"Please forgive me, it's not me, it's the meds."
22846,"Also, some meds make me extra tired or dizzy or any number of other things that aren't my normal or desired state."
22847,"Most medication used to treat anxiety is something the body becomes immune to over time, so the dosage must be increased."
22848,"So, occasionally I may relapse when I am not expecting it."
22849,I don't necessarily know the cause.
22850,Please don't make fun of me when I am experiencing a panic attack- it's horrible enough without you ridiculing me.
22851,You wouldn't be laughing if you were the one whose body was revolting in fear.
22852,"I'm not making anything up, I'm not trying to use panic attacks as an excuse not to do things, and I surely don't want to be a burden on you or effect your life negatively."
22853,Knowing I sometimes am and sometimes do adds to the misery of the condition.
22854,"What I really need is for you to let me hold your hand or your arm tightly at times, and to humor me and just tell me it isn't real and I don't have to be scared, even if it's the millionth time you've said it."
22855,"Tell me you'll protect me and I might just believe you, because I want to so badly."
22856,"I want to be tough and independent and in control, but something (psychological and chemical) inside of me won't let me be free."
22857,"Panic disorders are almost always genetic and are chemically related, though they're often triggered by a traumatic event."
22858,"Before realizing what is happening to us, most panic disorder sufferers go through a terrible period of thinking that we're dying when we're having a panic attack, or that something terrible is about to happen to us, etc."
22859,"It's impossible to understand when it first happens, unless someone is there to warn you."
22860,There usually isn't.
22861,"Many of us live in terror of letting other people know we're freaking out, so while we might seem normal, in control, and calm, our insides are often a different story."
22862,It's ok to tell us we seem stabler or more confident- we'll appreciate you noticing.
22863,"Just know that sometimes it might be an illusion, sometimes true one day but not the next."
22864,"Acting like it's a result of something we didn't do is a double-blow, the first one being our own senses of failure for not being able to just ""tough it out"", ""grin and bear it"" etc."
22865,"Sometimes, just walking into a room by ourselves is the accomplishment of the day."
22866,"Sometimes, we could lead a parade."
22867,"Please, give us the credit for living with something so tough and managing to do anything."
22868,"Please, just support us and help us, and listen to us."
22869,"It's natural to get annoyed sometimes, but if you're annoyed, we're probably beating ourselves up because we're a self-critical lot."
22870,"That's part of how we got this way, by being too self-aware."
22871,"We are trying to win the battle, but some days we just want to give up."
22872,"After many years of feeling extremely worried about simple everyday things, I would like to be prescribed anxiety medicine."
22873,I am afraid if I just openly ask for medication that he will think I am just seeking drugs.
22874,"Sleep is always an anxiety trigger for me, it's like my only one at this point, and yet every night I need at least a little medication to sleep."
22875,"Has anyone else had an SSRI poop out and start to get withdrawal symptoms, or feel worse than before you were on the medication?"
22876,When neither medication was fully integrated into my system.
22877,Either way I want to go to the doctor and get medication.
22878,I was wondering if I should go to the GP and in your experiences do they put you on meds immediately or no?
22879,"I know I have to give this medication a chance, I just don't know how to do it."
22880,"By the third week, my anxiety somehow convinces me that the medication isn't working and that my body is telling me to stop taking it."
22881,This isn't my first experience trying to take medication.
22882,"I don't want to give up on this medication before I've given it a chance, but my anxiety is so strong and controlling."
22883,"I don't have a primary care provider at the moment, but hopefully will soon since I'm running out of meds."
22884,This doctor convinced me that anti-depressants work better for anxiety than anxiety medicine.
22885,"As soon as my mother found out, she started being extremely cold towards me, even going as far as saying that if I took the meds, she wouldn't like me as a person."
22886,I've been off the medicine since August and haven't been back to the doctor since.
22887,My dad made me an appointment to get my medicine back for next Tuesday.
22888,"*TL;DR My mother doesn't believe in psychiatric medicine, so I have been without medication or therapy for my panic disorder for almost 6 months."
22889,I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder about 3 years; I'm 24 now.
22890,"I've been treating it with the following medications:

Paxil 40mg/day  
Dexepine 20mg/day  
Xanax .5mg 2/day

I still have some anxiety, though I haven't had an actual panic attack in over two years."
22891,"One thing I've noticed is that after it gets dark out, I have almost no anxiety whatsoever."
22892,"Going out to a bar, walking/driving somewhere, hanging outside with friends in the evening - all good."
22893,"The same activities would definitely give me anxiety, though not necessarily crippling like they would have pre-diagnosis."
22894,Is this a common thing?
22895,"I've heard of Seasonal AD, but this is different."
22896,"My newest meds work great, they go after the unwanted thoughts obsession and calm me down (50mg Pristiq; 1.25mg Clonazapam daily), but I think there is a big problem; for the past couple of years, I wake up some mornings (sometimes everyday for a week, then nothing for a month), with the most awful feeling, purely physical; it is like someone is sending electric shocks from my brain through through the rest of my body, there is an audible high pitched frequency accompanying each 'brain-thump', and a pins and needles feeling in my face and fingers, and the feeling that I am falling, just dropping down a mine shaft, I want to go to sleep, and have a hard time walking and talking and thinking."
22897,"I've been on and off different medication for the past 4-5 years for both my anxiety and depression and have self diagnosed myself as ""good I dont need meds anymore"" I guess I just dont like how they make me feel but, I always have these wake up calls like a little earlier tonight."
22898,"So maybe I need to get back on my medication and muster through the whole ""I don't like how it makes me feel"" issue and realize that its helping me in the long run.."
22899,"I have made it halfway through the year, and have tried anxiety and depression medicine, but it just makes me feel lifeless but tolerable."
22900,Talk to a dr about different medication?
22901,My wife has GAD and has tried the non-medication route for about 2 years(6 months of actually being diagnosed).
22902,"We have had an incredibly difficult time making any kind of progress, and her dr and therapist both think that medication may help break a downward spiral."
22903,She has also asked me to be honest with her and let her know if I think she needs to start medication.
22904,They don't take depression seriously  suggest meds some shrug meaway.
22905,"I'm going through a turning point in my life right now, and I don't know where to go from here."
22906,"I have severe social anxiety and complex partial seizures and I haven't been to a doctor in a very, very long time, mostly due to lack of money."
22907,It kinda started suddenly when I was in high school.
22908,"One year I was really happy and out-going, and the next year when I came back, I suddenly felt awful and found I couldn't speak to anyone, I started having panic attacks, and when I would stress out and panic, I was likely to wind up having a seizure (complex partial seizures aren't the same as grand mal seizures, I basically go into a paralysis and can't move for a few minutes, like sleep paralysis but while being wide awake) I saw a sleep specialist and was diagnosed with Delayed Sleep-somethingorother, and was told that my lack of sleep was lowering my threshold for having seizures and panic attacks as well."
22909,"After a while, it started getting so bad, I'd have an attack the moment I sat down in class, so I had to drop out."
22910,"I got my GED and I went to a few more doctors, on my mom's money."
22911,I finally went to see a neurologist and he put me on Lamictal for a few years and had a couple EEGs done that showed that I had seizure activity.
22912,"The Lamictal helped a bit, and once I went off it my seizures were fewer, but I still have them when I have a really bad panic attack."
22913,"I went back to the sleep specialist and he gave me Lunesta, which didn't work, neither did anything else he tried so I figured I'd be a night owl the rest of my life."
22914,"I did go to one psychologist, but he wasn't very good and actually diagnosed me with Dissociative Identity Disorder based on the sole fact that my memory was bad and my handwriting wasn't always consistent... which was a load of BS so I stopped going (I don't have DID, my handwriting just gets wild when I'm panicky.)"
22915,"At one point between leaving school and getting my GED, I had a massive breakdown and saw and heard things that still freak me out to this day (for instance, I heard a voice singing to me that if I went down the hall I'd die) I immediately went to my family doctor and she was a little concerned and made note of it, but said it was likely related to a seizure and not to worry unless it happened again."
22916,Now... this was all over 10 years ago.
22917,That was when I lost my insurance and stopped seeing doctors altogether.
22918,"In that span of time I attended and dropped out of college three times, got and lost six jobs that I was fired from for missing work due to my panic attacks and was too embarrassed to tell them I had anxiety."
22919,I'm terrified of going to a doctor about my anxiety because I'm scared of getting meds.
22920,"I once took half a valium to calm myself and it gave me a seizure, ever since then I've been terrified that any other anti-stress med will do the same."
22921,"Anyway, I met my fiance online and am lucky enough to have had him support me this long, and I am now on his health insurance."
22922,"I still can't hold down a job, but I am doing online college in the hope I can major in something that can make me good money working from home (computer related stuff and all that) Our relationship is getting incredibly strained due to the one-sidedness of the money-making, and I can see how stressed out its making him trying to keep us both up and helping me with my college."
22923,"He's suggesting that I go on disability, but I'm scared that they're going to tell me that I either can't get benefits unless I go on medications, or they're going to deny me for having no medical history for the last ten years."
22924,"He says it doesn't matter how long ago I was diagnosed, if I go to a doctor now and they determine I still have the same problems, they can use my history from my childhood and teenage years."
22925,I don't know what to do.
22926,"It's been so long since I've been to a doctor I don't know where to start, and I'd feel weird telling them I was going back to doctors because I was looking into getting disability benefits."
22927,"Like they'd take me less seriously or something, because even though I can hardly leave the house because I'm terrified of the stress causing me attacks and seizures, I just don't feel disabled."
22928,"I mean, I get kinda defensive about it and always counter saying ""I'm not disabled, I just have some problems!"""
22929,"I think it's just a matter of being overly prideful :(

Sorry for this big wall of text, I'm just stressed out right now after an argument with my fiance and needed to write down my life."
22930,I'm not saying I need to be out on medication at this point but it might help.
22931,"I've been on the meds for about 4 days now, so I still have plenty left to take, but it worries me that it hasn't improved much yet."
22932,It was irritating and they're going to work up to getting me a shrink and getting me my meds.
22933,"No medication ): Live in PA, USA"
22934,Overall: Drinking on these meds aren't worth it.
22935,"Some background information: I suffer from OCD, which I am on medication for."
22936,She seems afraid of the medication and what it will do to me.
22937,"I've asked (but not requested) medicine solution, but they say that ""talking"" should be the first hand choice."
22938,"I've also never really been comfortable with asking for meds, because I don't want to be seen as a drug seeker, even when I feel I need them."
22939,Like medication wise and that
22940,"And I can't really afford to see a psychiatrist weekly or monthly (That whole hair thing was a gift not something I could afford) so I had my year check up with my GP so I could continue getting my meds, but I'm out for the month."
22941,I was on the meds for several years when I decided recently to go off the medication to see if I could function without them (The idea of being dependent on a drug for the foreseeable future kind of irritated me).
22942,I'm wondering if maybe going off the medication wasn't that great of an idea.
22943,"I keep a good handle on my anxiety for the most part and have managed to stay off medication, but I don't have any close friends I can confide to and my husband is in no position to be receptive to my negative emotions."
22944,"I have years of training for whats coming, but I still feel that all my knowledge has just melted away with the fear :( The last few weeks have been composed mostly of me just trying to manage anxiety, with lots of walks, therapy, medication use, etcetera."
22945,"I don't take meds, i think i should."
22946,"I have a learning disorder that makes learning sometimes frustrating, and I have a prescribed medication to help me cope with this."
22947,* Is there a possibility I could take meds for anxiety attacks/could I be prescribed them?
22948,"Gone through withdraws, lost health insurance, and gotten the right meds again."
22949,"Except the use of medication (antidepressants and benzodiazepines), how do you think I can regain a natural and normal sleep ?"
22950,I was contemplating on going to see a GP and requesting some anti-anxiety meds to help me through the transition.
22951,"I leave in about a month so time is a factor (I know, I should have done this ages ago...)

So yes, is it unreasonable for me to ask anti-anxiety meds to help ease my transition of living in a different country?"
22952,"I'm pretty exhausted from the anti-anxiety meds I plied myself with, and I'm gonna pass out soon."
22953,"Well, I decided rather than taking my anti-anxiety meds at night like I normally do, I'd space them out over this super-stressful event."
22954,I didn't want them to see me taking meds.)
22955,My husband and I are finally to the point where we're trying to get pregnant with our first child.
22956,I take clonazepam (klonopin) for pretty bad anxiety but everything I'm reading online says it's a class D medication that shouldn't be taken during pregnancy.
22957,I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and I was curious if there are other medications for anxiety that are safe during pregnancy.
22958,"If not, how did those of you who have gone through a pregnancy balance the health of the fetus **and** your own mental health?"
22959,"I'm scared to even be taking it while trying to concieve because you don't really know if you're pregnant until after around 10-14 days after conception and I'm worried taking the medication could harm the fetus even during that short, two week period."
22960,"Any advice, how you managed through your own personal experience and tough love (but not too mean) are welcome."
22961,"I just want to make sure I have a healthy baby while also staying healthy as the ""gestator"" throughout the duration of a pregnancy."
22962,"Notice: At the risk of sounding offensive or rude, I'm not looking for the type of advice that's similar to the whole ""but quitting smoking during pregnancy is way stressful and can be more harmful to the baby than just smoking during the whole pregnancy"" IF anxiety meds like clonazepam, ativan and xanax simply aren't safe for a fetus."
22963,I realize that sounds judgmental but I just wanted to get that out of of the way to begin with.
22964,"Basically, please don't tell me that benzos are safe during pregnancy if they're not just because you think that's what I want to hear."
22965,"I don't want to go onto more medication, I want to try and figure out what I can do."
22966,I've never tried any medication like that and I don't know if I'd really like to but there's *no way* I'm getting on a airplane again without something like that in my system.
22967,I think medication is probably a good start and will help me to overcome the physical response.
22968,Every person is different and how every person reacts to medicine is different.
22969,My google searches have all shown that this medication is generally only prescribed to bipolar patients.
22970,"But in another way, it seems like it could be a bad thing; what happens if I go off of the medication and feel like I can't cope?"
22971,I have vallium upstairs that I am supposed to take in emergencies and I'm currently on 2 anti depressants and one anti-anxiety medication and I feel like they're not doing anything right now.
22972,"I know what this all stems from, I’ve tried multiple therapists and have anxiety medication to take as needed but some days this just controls my life."
22973,So i've made an appointment with a psychiatrist to seek cognitive therapy and medication such a benzos.
22974,"Will medication give me that same ""carefree, outgoing"" feeling i get with alcohol (without the negative effects of course)?"
22975,"I'm really against medication because I'm terrified of becoming dependent, but I am also really over feeling flighty, randomly feeling like crying, shortness of breathe and my damn thoughts just don't stop!"
22976,Yes I'm on meds/ councillor and hell I'm even doing neural feed back.
22977,"Because medication didn't improved anything, i switched to  psychotherapy, i have it on a weekly basis for the last 1,5 year."
22978,"I've seen psychologists, I'm on meds, I spend all my time on self help/motivational sites, my life is on track, ...but nothing seems to be getting any easier."
22979,"Second morning of meds, i already feel like quitting, i think its more i dont feel mentally ready to be on meds, if that makes any sense, should i think of stopping, n trying again when i get more info/support while taking these."
22980,If anyone has had similar issues I'd love for a PM because I'm at the end of my wits and there's no way I'll be able to see anyone or get any medication before tomorrow and if I do end up panicking myself into problems in scared what will come of my girlfriend and friends.
22981,"I've seen a couple different therapists in the past few years, and just recently started meds."
22982,She's basically just there to prescribe and monitor meds rather than actually doing therapy.
22983,The meds are helping somewhat and for just over a week I felt really good.
22984,"On meds that are helping, but need extra help."
22985,"The problem is that the meds really affect my sex drive and ability to orgasm, and this is impacting on our relationship and putting strain on us both."
22986,"I am not ready to come off the meds, having tried just before Christmas - what else can I do?"
22987,I want to try to get some medication.
22988,"I'm under my parents insurance still, so I know that they'll know what medication I'm given, but as long as I'm the one to tell them the details, I can say that it's all for mild anxiety."
22989,"Also, is there any way I can get meds without going to a therapist?"
22990,they could provide all kinds of medication.
22991,"Each one of the listed meds haven't worked well for me, having either a complete opposite reaction ( scary!)"
22992,"As it stands I cannot afford therapy, and I've been on various types of medication and none of them helped me at all."
22993,"I've brought up, in passing, about possiblilty getting medication but my mother has always just said that I need to ""calm down and relax"", as most of my anxiety relates to university."
22994,I need to know how to really tell her that I need medication.
22995,"I'm considering medication again, but those fucking side-effects can be worse than the problem."
22996,"A daily Benzo, and depression medicine."
22997,I'm wondering if there is any good off the shelf anti depressant type medicine?
22998,"Anyway, I just want to know if anyone knows what I can do to help myself without being diagnosed or having a prescription for medication."
22999,I'm off my medication.
23000,I'm taking meds for it but it doesn't work anymore because of my high tolerance to benzos.
23001,Ive had zanax before but it makes me too sleepy to work on and Idk about other meds.
23002,I'm seeing my general doctor tomorrow to talk about therapy sessions and medication options.
23003,Since I started taking the meds I quit Caffine (i used to drink allot of coffee) I quit drinking for the most part because it did not play well with the meds made me feel really messed up.
23004,"I tried to taper the pain meds, and that pretty much sucked."
23005,Will medication help?
23006,"I don't know how he'd react and the fact that I'm from a small area means I'd be worried about others finding out, especially if I needed medication."
23007,This is my first time on any sort of anxiety medication.
23008,So back in May I made a long overdue appointment with my doctor to discuss getting on some medication to help me manage my anxiety.
23009,"While the meds have definitely helped to reduce my anxiety tremendously, it seems to have also reduced the rest of my emotions as well."
23010,I would say probably for the past two months or so I have only really felt much in the way of emotion twice… and both times I hadn't taken my meds for a few days and ended up having a panic attack on each occassion.
23011,"So, anyway, I'm now in a zone of discovering what meds will work with me (hopefully without weight gain."
23012,"If you have any suggestions on meds, please tell me!"
23013,"After being out of therapy and off meds for over a year, I made an appointment and am going back in."
23014,"I used to take klonopin to help control the panic attacks, but have been off all meds for the past 2-3 years."
23015,I can't get used to meds again right now.
23016,OK.
23017,I have terrible anxiety.
23018,I am 22 years old.
23019,"I was diagnosed a few years ago with major depression and chronic anxiety, but honestly I feel I have gotten much worse."
23020,"I'm not going into the full details of my disorders (they're not diagnosed) and medications, but know that I was receiving treatment."
23021,"I accepted the medications even though I felt (and feel) that I am letting my family down by taking them (they think all medication is BAD BAD BAD, shouldnt be taking them, etc)."
23022,I have been self-medicating with marijuana.
23023,"I have been completely anti-drugs the last 4 years, so it really hurts me."
23024,"I moved in with my boyfriend (was 1.5 years off all medications and happy), and I was offered some when I was incredibly upset and near panic attack, and it calmed me down and didn't make me feel bad."
23025,"I used it only during those times, which was every two or three weeks or so."
23026,But as the stress ramped up.
23027,I quit eating.
23028,I quit sleeping.
23029,I was offered it again.
23030,It made me eat a bunch of food and actually fall asleep.
23031,I would go days with little to no sleep or food.
23032,I just had no appetite.
23033,Marijuana was the ONLY thing that could get me to eat.
23034,I felt so guilty for not eating.
23035,"I feel like my anti-depressant is now maybe helping a little, and I feel hunger occasionally instead of never."
23036,"However, that is QUICKLY squashed by nausea within a few bites of food (which I read was pregnancy or anxiety.. my guess is anxiety)."
23037,I moved home to my parents in hopes to better myself.
23038,A lot of my anxiety and issues stem from here.
23039,I can't just smoke marijuana in my room.... they're against it and it's illegal.
23040,Just being at home makes me incredibly anxious.
23041,Each night I have been here so far I just want to smoke marijuana.
23042,"Because I can't (though I've tried), I just want to drink alcohol."
23043,And I don't like drinking.
23044,How do I deal with this?
23045,I am so incredibly embarrassed that I even self-medicate with it..
23046,I am terrified of what my very Christian doctor thinks (I've been to clinics to talk and they relay notes to Dr.)... and what my parents would say if they ever find out.
23047,"I can't see a doctor until the New Year, so any bit of advice until then would help."
23048,"I am supposed to go to two birthday parties tonight, one for my boyfriends best friend, and one for my old best friend (old as in I dropped off the Earth like an @$$hole)."
23049,Anxiety is all around.
23050,I don't know that I can do it.
23051,**EDIT: I never ended up going to either of those birthday parties!
23052,"Thank you for all those who replied, I appreciate the time you took to read and provide me feedback."
23053,I have been sneaking in the middle of the night to smoke.
23054,It's clear I have a lot of work to do!
23055,**
23056,"Ive been working my butt off with CBT and counselling, and Im finally off my most of my meds so I thought Id give it a test."
23057,"I take medicine for it, but I recently switched and I don't know if it's working all that well compared to the stuff I used to take."
23058,"I stopped medication a while ago, for one reason or another."
23059,I have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist on a monthly basis since then and taking my medication.
23060,Meaning not including benzodiazepines or short term medications and for generalized anxiety
23061,"I stopped taking these meds in november of 2014, and am still having issues."
23062,I am still having issues 6 months later after being off the medication completely and am beginning to wonder whether it's becoming a mental thing as opposed to an issue from this medication.
23063,"Content warning: throwaway because talking abt self harm and passive suicidal ideation is more than I usually reveal on my main

A little background- had various diagnoses of depression, anxiety, anorexia, etc."
23064,for the past 5 years or so.
23065,"Fortunately the ED behaviors are currently in remission though I'm still struggling with thoughts, etc."
23066,"Seeing a therapist and psychiatrist regularly, yadda yadda."
23067,I was just wondering how you guys can tell that your medication is working?
23068,"I was on Prozac and Abilify for a while, 80mg and 15mg respectively, for like 4 months-ish up until about 1 year ago, when I changed psychiatrists, and my new psych decided to ween me off that and put me on Effexor instead (the Abilify made me super lethargic and sleepy, and she thought the Prozac was just not working)."
23069,"Now, I've been on 300mg of that for about a year, and a new psychiatrist put me on buspirone (?)"
23070,a few months ago as well.
23071,"Whenever I go to the psychiatrist, I have no idea what to say."
23072,"I don't feel much of a difference in general and I still feel like I don't want to exist 99% of the time, phone calls and other things still make me anxious as shit, etc."
23073,I feel like the only thing that has helped has been physically removing me from the situation that was triggering MAJOR anxiety/depression for me (college) and learning some coping skills through DBT so as to control ED and self-harm behaviors.
23074,"So at least now I don't think of actively killing myself, but it's just a sort of passive ""If I could end my life peacefully and painlessly right now, I would definitely do it"" sort of thing."
23075,"I've kind of digressed, but the main point is that yeah, I have never been able to tell if my medications were working or not."
23076,"Don't experience a lot of side effects besides headaches if I don't take Effexor, and the lethargy with Abilify."
23077,"I've taken Klonopin as needed for anxiety attacks, and that has helped someone in the moment, but as for those medications where you need to take them regularly... well, I'm still pretty much a sad zombie."
23078,Am I expecting too much?
23079,Looking for the wrong things?
23080,Can someone help point me in a direction?
23081,"I have a psychiatrist appointment this Friday, so even general questions to bring up would be helpful."
23082,"Thank you guys so much, I love this sub and you guys are always so supportive and kind (:"
23083,"I hated the idea that I had to take meds just so I could do my schoolwork, especially when I was really happy with the other aspects of my life."
23084,"Dear Sirs and Madames,

As a long-suffering anxiolite, I've spent most of my life resisting medication and its well-established limpdickeriffic side effects."
23085,I've been going back and forth on whether I should see a doctor and be put on medication.
23086,"When I was about 18 I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism, which admittedly I'm bad at taking my meds for."
23087,"I have PTSD with anxiety and depression, I've been in therapy and meds for two years."
23088,Yet not so much that I can so easily handle the downs that happen when I come off my meds.
23089,"On top of all of this,  if I did chose to have children, and manage to conceive, I would not be allowed to take meds during the pregnancy/breastfeeding."
23090,"I'm not on meds now, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't be, and that I won't be in the future."
23091,My medication definitely doesn't help my drowsiness.
23092,"Since I can remember I've had a problem with my anxiety disorder and I've experienced cognitive, hypnotic, and regular therapy for years and have been on Prozac for a pretty long time, but I knocked medication and therapy out of my life and can confidently say I haven't had a serious anxiety attack in months!"
23093,"He's been doing therapy and taking meds for a year, and yesterday he decided he wants to quit, at least the meds part (he doesn't feel like they're working)."
23094,"I don't know, what if the meds were actually helping and it's going to get worse now?"
23095,Right now I'm trying to inform myself about his meds and such while I control my breathing.
23096,EDIT: I'm also curious about beta blockers as a medicine for anxiety and panic.
23097,She was seeing a therapist and taking meds which helped her function a little more normally but now she is on a kick where she doesn't want to be the type of person who takes medicine.
23098,"My psychologist told me I have social phobia and I am on medication 


But I am starting to doubt that I do have social phobia."
23099,"Now, I know that it takes a while to adjust to new meds but I have been exhausted...like without anything specific to do I am sleeping 14-19 hours a day."
23100,I haven't really been able to gauge whether the meds have been helping my anxiety because I'm so tired.
23101,Clearly the antidepressants/anti-anxiety meds I've been on since my early teens aren't cutting it anymore.
23102,I have been told to go on medication but I am determined beat it without it.
23103,I'm really crossing my fingers this will be the one that finally works after the squillions of meds I've tried.
23104,"Hi everyone, 

I'm 21 years old and I have had problems with generalized anxiety in the past, and I am currently on a low dose medication (20mg celexa)..My anxiety has improved immensely and it continues to get better everyday."
23105,That year i started medication and therapy.
23106,I have had medication and counseling awhile but it's obviously not working.
23107,"I'm having a fun bout of I CAN'T SWALLOW SOLID ANYTHING, so I wasted two doses of medication, which makes me worry about how I'll be judged when I refill my prescription early."
23108,I am really open to trying a new medication to try and help.
23109,"So, did this medication work for you?"
23110,What really makes me believe I have it is because I have a condition known as [Psychopsychological Insomnia](http://www.sleepmedicineeducation.com/page2/page10/page14/page21/page21.html) which basically says that you worry about having more insomnia.
23111,"So, should I just play there game and take the meds just to get to my real issue or should I say fuck them and get to the medicine cabinet?"
23112,I'm not on any anxiety meds either and asking for professional help isn't an option.
23113,"I am panicking because this medication has really helped me, and I don't know if I will be safe without it."
23114,I just forgot the medicine one day and its already a disaster.
23115,"My medication helps, but its still not enough with having to socialize."
23116,I've also tried 3 daily anxiety meds to no success as my body absolutely does not react well to changed in the serotonin levels.
23117,2) For the meds - has anyone found good daily medicine to control anxiety outside of the serotonin inhibitor family?
23118,"One method of treating panic attacks in panic disorder, as well as other anxiety disorders, is to use prescription medication."
23119,"There are several types of medications that have proven effective in treating panic attacks, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines."
23120,"These medications help regulate the levels and functioning of neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin, to help regulate mood and therefore prevent panic attacks."
23121,"Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

One of the most common types of panic attack medication is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs."
23122,"SSRIs are widely used for mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, and panic disorder."
23123,"SSRIs work on serotonin, an important neurotransmitter related to mood regulation."
23124,"An SSRI inhibits the reuptake of serotonin within neurons, thereby increasing the overall level of the neurotransmitter that is available in the brain."
23125,"Some common SSRI medications include:
•	Prozac (fluoxetine)
•	Zoloft (sertraline)
•	Paxil (paroxetine)
•	Luvox (fluvoxamine)

Although SSRIs are highly effective in treating panic attacks and anxiety disorders, they are known to have side effects, including:
•	Irritability
•	Loss of sexual desire
•	Drowsiness
•	Difficulty sleeping
•	Headaches
•	Changes in appetite
•	Weight gain

If one SSRI has not worked well or has caused side effects to a level that has become problematic, the individual’s physician might have them try a different SSRI."
23126,"Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are another type of panic attack medication."
23127,"Unlike SSRIs, which are most useful for long-term treatment of panic disorder, benzodiazepines are often used for immediate relief of panic attack symptoms and may be prescribed along with an SSRI."
23128,"Unlike SSRIs, which work primarily on serotonin, benzodiazepines affect a different, but equally important, neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)."
23129,"They have sedative and muscle relaxant properties, as well as being useful to treat anxiety and panic attacks."
23130,"Some common benzodiazepine medications include:
•	Xanax (alprazolam)
•	Klonopin (clonazepam)
•	Valium (diazepam)
•	Ativan (lorazepam)

Like all medications, benzodiazepines have side effects."
23131,"These include:
•	Dizziness
•	Drowsiness
•	Development of a tolerance over time

Benzodiazepines can also be habit-forming for some individuals."
23132,"Other Types of Panic Attack Medications

Although SSRIs and benzodiazepines are the most commonly used types of panic attack medications, there are other classes of drugs, which can also be used to treat anxiety and panic disorders."
23133,"These include:
•	Tricyclic antidepressants, including Anafranil, Norpramin, and Tofranil
•	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), including Marplan, Nardil, and Parnate

These types of medication have also proven themselves effective in reducing the number and severity of panic attacks in people with panic disorder; however, they are less commonly used and are often prescribed when SSRIs or benzodiazepines prove ineffective."
23134,Panic attacks can be effectively treated and prevented with prescription medications.
23135,"These medications affect neurotransmitters in the brain, which play a role in causing anxiety, panic, and other mood problems."
23136,The most commonly used panic attack medications are SSRIs and benzodiazepines.
23137,"SSRIs are primarily effective for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders and panic disorder, and benzodiazepines are effective for immediate relief of panic attack symptoms."
23138,Tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are generally only prescribed when SSRIs and benzodiazepines prove ineffective.
23139,#panicAttacks #medication
23140,I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder by many different doctors.
23141,A lot of general and social anxiety.
23142,I have tried different medicines but I never really felt a difference.
23143,I have also been diagnosed with ADD before.
23144,I tried taking meds before but after a while I just quit because I never felt a difference and I really don't like being on medicines in the first plac.
23145,"Lately my anxiety has been getting worse due to the fact that I have a 5 month old, my husband got orders for us to move to New Orleans soon and I will be starting college as soon as we get there."
23146,"This has led to anxiety attacks almost everyday, constant worrying, and absolutely no motivation."
23147,"Well today I needed to get a lot done, so I tried taking one of my husbands adderalls."
23148,"I've got to say, I haven't felt this good in a very long time."
23149,I actually got up and took a shower before noon!
23150,"Like I said before, I have social anxiety, but not today!"
23151,I called my friend and talked and I also ended up bringing my neighbor something that I had been meaning to but was too scared to actually go over there.
23152,I want to know if this is common while taking adderall.
23153,I don't want to go to my doctor sounding like a drug addict asking for it.
23154,I just want to feel normal again and enjoy the time I have with my daughter before I have to go to college.
23155,"I stopped my anti-depression meds about 3 months ago and thus far, it has been going great."
23156,I am no longer at the level of depression I was a few years ago and am to the point where I don't need the meds.
23157,Since that time frame I have been to several doctors and on daily medication.
23158,I experience the attacks much less now than I did before I was on medication.
23159,"This is mostly a rant, but also wondering in what ways have you personally found most effective in dealing with your anxiety, aside from medication?"
23160,"**

If you haven't gotten help yet, or slacked on therapy or your meds, go get help!"
23161,I don't want to go back on medication (16 months Zoloft-and-Wellbutrin-free) but I've been working on meditation.
23162,But this was before I sought help and got medication.
23163,"As a result, I now have to change the medication that I was FINALLY getting used to (after 3 months) because of tachycardia."
23164,What is everyones thoughts on medication?
23165,"I've taken my anxiety meds (Hydroxyl HCL), but I can't calm down."
23166,The school I was in told me I either take medication or change schools.
23167,I changed schools and went on medication.
23168,The medication increased my appetite and messed with my emotions.
23169,"I stopped taking the medication, and was **constantly** grounded."
23170,"""We love you more when you take your medication."""
23171,I have pretty severe anxiety.
23172,"For some background, I've had sleeping issues since I was a young kid and my parents medicated me in my later teen years with xanax and lunesta/ambien."
23173,I haven't used medications for years and plan on keeping it that way because they seemed to exacerbate the issues.
23174,"Instead, I exercise and meditate on a regular basis to keep my mind relaxed."
23175,"I've also used workbooks to help ""filter"" my negative thoughts."
23176,My issue comes in with my relationship.
23177,"When I start to heavily worry about something that my boyfriend doesn't think is a big deal, my boyfriend gets very frustrated with me."
23178,"He will tell me he is not frustrated, but he will grit his teeth when he talks or start to raise his voice a tiny bit."
23179,"I know he cares because he stays there with me, and will make sure I am okay in the end."
23180,That doesn't stop me from questioning whether he cares about me or not when I get my anxiety.
23181,I will tell him I just need to be told I am okay and just need his arms around me.
23182,"He usually won't put his arms around me, but he will say that I am okay, but he spends more time telling me how I need to be a more relaxed person."
23183,It causes me to get more stressed out because I really work hard to control my anxiety and feel like a failure suddenly.
23184,I must have 100 emotions flowing when I get anxiety attacks.
23185,I understand that my anxiety attacks are not easy to deal with.
23186,"Once I realize that although he is frustrated, he just cares about me and my wellbeing, I start to feel awful and get upset at myself."
23187,I apologize a million times because I don't know else to express how guilty I feel for my anxiety.
23188,It's this terrible cycle and I just want to know how to break it before it explodes.
23189,I need to squash this issue.
23190,"The medicine took quite a while to begin working, but it is doing a GREAT job!"
23191,"Recently I've gained a partner, and things begin well, but usually after 15-20 minutes the soldier collapses... Is this a common problem, I want to consult my doctor, but this medicine is working so well I am scared to go off of it."
23192,"However I couldn't give them enough space and oine set of medication made me very moody and bad tempered, another incredibly paranoid."
23193,I don't like the idea of medication and am extremely hesitant to seriously consider trying it.
23194,"I spend time in my room because when I am in my room it allows me to calm down and not panic (I am not currently on meds or seeing a doctor as I am still on a waiting list for a doctor up here, I go for my appointment tomorrow)."
23195,I know I should probably ask my doctor personally on his advice but I've gotten some duds as far as medication goes in the past so I'd like some advice before I make an appointment.
23196,I'm in the process of getting insurance and don't have a healthcare provider right now so meds or therapy aren't an option.
23197,Unfortunately my psychiatrist is booked until October and I can't talk to her about finding a new medication to help me with my anxiety and nightly panic attacks.
23198,"If so, what have you done about it without taking medication since my psychiatrist is booked for months."
23199,"I have read about ""Brain Zaps"" that feel like they go off in the head when you miss even a day of the medication as well as other side effects that I don't like the idea of."
23200,But I can't take the medicine.
23201,For the entire weekend I didn't need my Anxiety medicine.
23202,"So confused and tired...maybe I should go back on my medication...

Would that help things?"
23203,I've tried meds (and am back on them) it's a low grade dose of Imipramine prescribed after going back to the doctor to let him know i have been having anxiety and depression issues.
23204,on the flip side i have seen the effects of meds on others and it scares the hell out me to be dependent.
23205,I don't have health insurance so therapy and ongoing medication isn't an easy option.
23206,I talked to my doctor on Wednesday and she adjusted my medicine and recommended I set up a meeting with the school counciller.
23207,"I went on a low dose of anxiety medication and saw a therapist for a semester, which dealt with my problems at that time."
23208,Does anyone have experience with sexual dysfunction and SSRIs who can recommend a different medication or ways to cope with it?
23209,I take Vyvanse for ADD which increases my general anxiety so I have to avoid those kinds of meds.
23210,"I shuffle things around &amp; only do the bare minimum required
* Have had extramarital sex twice

I don't know if the medicine is changing me, or if deep down I'm just a heartless son of a bitch."
23211,I have medication that is purely for situational use.
23212,Another problem is that I am EXTREMELY nervous/anxious about meds.
23213,Even ones I have taken before (tylenol/advil/Imodium/etc)...so meds won't really help me as it is very unlikely that I could actually get myself to take them.
23214,"So here goes this story;

One of my best friends (Female, 17 year old, panic disorder, not sure of medication) has been suffering from panic attacks and this year it has gotten worse."
23215,She actively goes to the doctor's and has tried changing her medication but this time her panic attacks are happening more frequently (4 to 5 times a day) and they are lasting longer.
23216,"Then my sister says I don't need medication for sleep or anxiety or depression while my other sister's on 5 different meds, smokes, and drinks."
23217,"I'm trying my best not to get on meds, mainly because of the difficulty of getting them and my mom would know that I'm a depressed, socially anxious, bipolar mess."
23218,I stopped taking meds for months now and entered a new state: Depression.
23219,"Also, I don't have the luxury of going to a doctor and getting medication; I need a job first to get the money to make these changes but in order to get the job, I need to be anxiety free (;_;)."
23220,this happen to anybody where meds seem to do well then stop?
23221,"very intelligent, aced primary school anxiety started at puberty and it's severe, ruined highschool grades got below average so damn disappointed with what happened everything else is going shitty, grades, friends, relationships tried meds, counselling, doctors, sleep schedules, natural lighting, better eating, improvement and improvement of exercise ah fucking hell"
23222,"Without meds/therapists, is it possible?"
23223,"**Bottom line**: Without meds and without therapy, is there a chance the Generalized Anxiety would ever go away?"
23224,"I've been having anxiety for over a year now and the only medication I've ever taken is Sertraline, 25mg in the morning."
23225,"I was on spring break last week so without having to do my morning routine, I forgot to take my meds, too."
23226,"The only side effects I've had from Sertraline was loss of appetite and bloating, so I don't know whether the way I felt today has anything to do with meds."
23227,My anxiety might have exaggerated the symptoms but does the irregularity of taking meds can cause more severe side effects?
23228,I should take my meds more carefully.
23229,Im 18/f by the way and take medication for them!
23230,I am new here and I guess I just wanted to share my story and get some advice.
23231,"I have struggled with GAD my whole life, only recently finding out that I have it though, and that it's not just me being crazy and while it's helped a tiny bit having a doctor tell me I have anxiety issues and it's not a problem with me as a person, I still can't seem to control it."
23232,"I will sit and antogonize over the smallest of situations for hours thinking over every aspect of it, like who probably thinks im an idiot now, that I am an idiot, that something was embarrassing and I'll never live it down, that the small situation could progress in a million different ways and I sit there and think them all through and worry about every one."
23233,"My boyfriend recently told me I will take something and of the hundred different outcomes that could happen, I will always pick the worst possible one and be convinced thats what will happen."
23234,"I just got fired from a job where my boss was the worst most terrible person and every friend and famly member in my life was trying so hard to get me to quit, and after it happened all I could think (am still thinking about) is what a failure I must be."
23235,"I can sit here and say to myself ""your boss was terrible, she had no intention of training you, she lied about wages and time off, she was rude and demeaning"" and know all of this to be true, and yet still sit here and cry because i feel like it was all my fault and I could have done better or been better."
23236,That it was my fault my boss was so rude.
23237,I probably deserved it.
23238,I don't feel like breathing excersises or yoga will help me.
23239,I have tried these in similar situations before and it actually makes me extremely irritable and seems to have the opposite affect.
23240,My doctor is trying to get me to try medication but I'm so terrified it will change who I am in a negative way or that I will go from caring to much about everything to not caring at all about anything.
23241,I'm unsure about what to do about it all.
23242,"I'm clearly not good at controlling it on my own, since I'm always fully aware of my issues and yet cant seem to seperate myself from them and then I'm terrified to try medications."
23243,"It's affecting my relationships with people, I'm constantly on edge that my ""craziness"" will end up being something my boyfriend will dump me over and I think everyone hates me as soon as I meet them."
23244,Has anyone been in this situation?
23245,Any advice?
23246,Is medication as terrifying as I believe it to be?
23247,I apologize for the wall of text I'm just feeling extremely overwhelmed about my options and how to make my life better.
23248,The medicine my doctor put me on isn't working and neither are valiums :( Please some help I am so sccared
23249,I used to just hide my anxiety but about 6 months ago decided to try some medication to help me out.
23250,I wish I never tried medication in the first place.
23251,"in addition to my long-term, day-to-day medication or do they only do one or the other?"
23252,"I notice it pretty much goes away when I take anti-anxiety meds, so that might mean something."
23253,"I have been to many doctors and psychs, tried many medications and I haven't had a job in 3 years... Everytime I go outside, I have an attack and i'm terrified just thinking about working."
23254,"I am 24 years old and my parents have stated that, come next month, they will not be helping me with my rent, so I need to figure out what to do, or i'm pretty screwed."
23255,I was wondering if there was any way I might be able to receive disability benefits in the state of Oregon for my anxiety?
23256,Does anyone know how I could go about doing this if it is possible?
23257,Thanks for your time.
23258,"**EDIT: Also, if anyone has ANY leads on a job that I could do from my house, on my computer, that would be *amazing*!"
23259,Thank you for all the help!
23260,**
23261,I've been off medication for 3 weeks and it's been the worst three weeks of my life I can't think properly.
23262,"Last year I was diagnosed with GAD, and my parents opted not to put me on medication."
23263,I was also discussing exercise with a girl with tachycardia I work with who was describing how she gets without her meds...
23264,I have struggled with anxiety for many years and have tried numerous medications.
23265,I have had a really hard time trying to get over it.
23266,I have a panic-disorder and am most likely bipolar (the doctor isn't 100% positive yet).
23267,I have limited down my panic attacks to once every 2-3 weeks instead of 2-3 days.
23268,I am pretty proud of that.
23269,The only problem is I am overweight and have been trying to eat better and exercise more.
23270,"Ever since I have started trying to change, my panic attacks are getting worse."
23271,I am trying so hard to lose weight but I am not getting any results.
23272,It is really stressful for me and its a huge trigger to my anxiety.
23273,Does anyone have any useful advice?
23274,"Hey so I have started going to therapy and taking meds regularly to help me cope with my anxiety and other issues, but I have been smoking marijuana for 12years and I would say for at least 6years its been habitually everyday all day."
23275,"The last time I had worked actual retail was many years ago, when my anxiety was controlled by medication."
23276,"Until I began working again, unmedicated this time, I had never realized how anxious I am without the meds while working with the general public."
23277,"(26, M, G.A.D., Triggered by everything, No medication, U.S., VA Healthcare which doesn't provide good therapy, Too poor to afford therapy out of pocket)

Thanks in advance."
23278,"I have actually tried to talk to my doctor (the same doctor my parents see) about all of this, and I explained to him that my anxiety is ruining my life, but he told me he would absolutely not prescribe me ANY sort of medication for my anxiety because I would get addicted and at my age (22), IT would ruin my life."
23279,I received therapy a while back but the second I was diagnosed with something I was given meds and my case was dropped.
23280,I did find [this article](http://www.livestrong.com/article/345797-how-to-stop-weight-gain-from-zoloft/#page=1) that made me look at my meds differently.
23281,Going on my meds will be about making all of me a better person.
23282,I was prescribed medicine by my regular doctor whom I told EVERYTHING to; that (medicine) has taken care of the depression very well.
23283,I realize that medicine usually isn't the best way to handle sensitive things like this so I want to see a clinical psychologist to try and get rid of whatever is left of what I have because I'm sick of suffering and not being the person I once was.
23284,"I'd like to get diagnosed mainly so that I can start either seeing a therapist, take some meds, or just do more yoga (although arguably, I could just do that last part now) and see it as treatment."
23285,"From family who has offered to ""reward"" me with money to simply ""stop taking my meds"" to family who see me break down in crying attacks and can't breathe and emotional wreckages in front of counselors to one week later asking ""Don't you think if you were just strong enough you could be off the meds?""."
23286,My family hurts so bad and I don't want to stay on my meds my whole life but god dammit Im sick of crying over everything.
23287,I know it has to be the sudden decrease of meds but I feel like its better if I can just get them to see the mess I am without them... What do I do?
23288,"Now I just tried taking it in the morning with all of my other meds, and I'm extremely woozy and sleepy."
23289,What do you guys do to cope with the drowsiness of medication?
23290,(Obviously) I take medication.
23291,"I tried lots of things to cope with anxiety and depression over the years and nothing has worked well enough to consider it ""helpful"" I first prescribed adivan which did almost nothing, then valium which yes helped me stay calm but was quickly beginning to get addicted and build an unsafe tolerance to it."
23292,I've tried passionflower and valerian root in teas and tinctures still nothing has managed the vast array of symptoms.
23293,I even been to 1 on 1 therapy from a physiologist which again has helped but no where near enough to sustain a normal life.
23294,Why should i even trust another doctor to pump me full of some new toxic chemicals with a mile long list of side effects.
23295,from what i can tell all they seem to care about is collecting there paycheck and making sure to push all the bogus fda approved medications.
23296,The only thing I've tried that works somewhat well but could be better is smoking pot which my own mother and the rest of my family deems unsafe and say I'm going to be a drug addict.
23297,Not sure what medication if any to try next and I think I trust reddit more then any doctor atleast for some opinions and ideas.
23298,"I just want to end this mental torture and quiet my noisy mind, that ever happening seems to be more unlikely everyday."
23299,I haven't gone as far as to attempt to take my own life but I also cant say I haven't daydreamed about it.
23300,"I I I apologize for the wall of text, Running out of options, help."
23301,My next issue is meds.
23302,My brother is on meds for issues similar to mine and he's given me some in the past.
23303,"This is the first time I'm seeing the doctor for meds in almost two years, so I'm hesitant."
23304,"About a month ago, I stopped taking the medication after halving my dosage for two weeks."
23305,I've posted here before asking about medication but I'm scared that because I don't feel comfortable with counselling that I won't be prescribed anything.
23306,Any other meds that you took in addition that counteracted the weight gain?
23307,"She is on medication for anxiety, and even though the panic attacks and sporadic depression phases can sometimes be difficult to our relationship, I have always tried my best to support her and to help her improve her health and well-being."
23308,I don't take any medication.
23309,"I've never experienced hangout, so everything seems more like medicine, than anything else."
23310,"First is the meds, which I was there to talk to him about."
23311,Second was the therapy; talking to someone along with the meds would help drastically.
23312,"**TL;DR: I've been on Effexor XR for 6 months now and don't understand what the brain zaps are, nor how to go to sleep at night now that I've switched taking the meds from day time to night."
23313,"I was going to a psychologist and she decided I didn't need any medication, because I came to the point that I'm really sick and tired of how I feel."
23314,"I've been prescribed meds, but I'm also a massive hypochondriac and feel unable to take them because of the myriad side effects."
23315,I don't even have to to go to the campus pharmacy and get my meds refilled.
23316,I don't want to suffer from withdrawals if I end up taking a stronger medication and then can't get a refill in time.
23317,"However, before I broke contact they mentioned they were having a hard time socializing due to starting a new medication/ the anxiety."
23318,I did get some meds though.
23319,Would other meds act faster?)
23320,But I still feel like I need a pep talk to keep trying out the medication (I could have taken some when I freaked out today but didn't) and to prepare myself to open up to another doctor who should be better.
23321,"TLDR: Shrink wrote off my problems to smoking weed, it was no small emotional or financial feat to get myself to a doctor and I'm really disappointed, the meds she gave me don't give the feeling I was hoping for but I don't know if what I hoped for is realistic."
23322,"My girlfriend and some friends have seen some very ""reputable"" people but have all been rushed onto meds after the first session."
23323,They wanted to prescribe me something but I really am not comfortable with meds.
23324,She offered to prescribe me medication last year but I refused to take it; now I'm strongly considering taking it if she offers.
23325,Does anyone have any comments/suggestions on what to do when you first start taking medication for anxiety?
23326,"I had to stop taking my meds because of allergic reactions, and i have just been getting more and more distant.. i don't want to lose him, but i have anxiety attacks whenever he gets close to me."
23327,"I'm hopefully getting new meds tomorrow, i hope they work, and start to work fast...  i hate this distance between us... its killing me."
23328,No medication.
23329,"My next appt with my psychiatrist is next Tuesday, I've clearly stated that I've wanted to try Adderall, because it actually helped me feel happier and more talkative/more focused/less anxious (yes, boo on me all you want for trying it without a prescription), but he won't put me on it."
23330,"Because it's addictive, I don't know?"
23331,He put me on Klonopin so I don't think the addictiveness would be an issue.
23332,"Instead I've wasted hundreds of dollars on medications that don't work, or make me the human equivalent of Grumpy Cat/sleepy/dizzy/hate life (Atenelol, BusPar, Prozac), or only work for two months and just stop working (Wellbutrin, Klonopin)."
23333,"So next appointment, I want to state that either I want to be put on Adderall/Ritalin or stop my meds and find another psychiatrist."
23334,Advice?
23335,Yes I know it's bad to just stop taking meds without talking to a doctor.
23336,I can't wait to get into a psychiatrist's office soon to find out what meds *will* work for me.
23337,I need to know if it's healthy to have alternatives to a counsellor and if there's any way to tone down anxiety without medication.
23338,"However, my attacks have been more frequent and I've been taking meds (Xanax) for the past few days."
23339,"Taking anxiety meds also facilitates being anxious, I think."
23340,"Hey guys, so I've been recently diagnosed with some mental illnesses and I've been living with them for over 10 years but I'm just finding out about them and getting help, but I'm not sure how to deal with knowing that I've never been normal and that if I want to be normal and have people accept me then I have to take meds.."
23341,"I've really been contemplating suicide for a while, I really don't like the thought of only being considered ""normal"" by taking meds for the rest of my life.."
23342,I don't like the way meds make me feel and I'm not sure how to deal with it
23343,"What could therapy do for me, in this situation, if I refuse to take anti-anxiety medication?"
23344,Or anything to help the medication along?
23345,I was meant to be getting off my meds this month; 50mg sertraline daily.
23346,What were you doing with your time leading up to beginning medication?
23347,"Hi all, I have suffered from anticipatory anxiety for a while and am trying to deal with it through means without medication, but it's a struggle."
23348,"I've been taking my prescribed anxiety meds seroquel and Xanax like everyday, and it seems to not be helping me, I have no clue of what to do anymore."
23349,I am not on any medication so its not a withdrawal symptom and i have had ct scans and mri's come back clear... is it just acute anxiety?
23350,"I do not take any medication because I have found other ways to deal with my anxiety and I have essentially eradicated it, except for some random health problems that just popped up."
23351,So I am starting to get a little desperate.
23352,I have been on Wellbutrin 150mg XL for years (5-6 if I recall correctly).
23353,At the end of June I noticed that my depression was slowly getting worse and my anxiety was sky rocketing.
23354,I have finally reached the point where I need to discuss this with my doctor.
23355,I can't handle feeling depressed and anxious again.
23356,The problem is I use to see a shrink and I have been on literally 90% of every psych med available.
23357,"I can't or won't take SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics, MAOI, or antipsychotics."
23358,"I get everything ranging from weight gain, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, etc etc from these class of medications."
23359,Gabapentin for sleep and Wellbutrin for depression/social anxiety was the gold standard for me.
23360,"However, it isn't working and I need ideas and suggestions."
23361,For what its worth I am in Canada.
23362,I have a couple ideas including going up to 300mg of Wellbutrin but I know this will cause my anxiety and insomnia to worsen.
23363,"My other idea is to had on buspirone for anxiety for a few weeks, then if need be up my Wellbutrin."
23364,Ok so a little bit of background on us.
23365,We have been dating for about two years and we are set to get married on March 22nd.
23366,This will be a small ceremony (about 80 people) with a reception.
23367,This is NOT what either of us wanted.
23368,I voted for a wedding in Las Vegas while she voted getting married at the county courthouse.
23369,Her father (probably the root of all this anxiety) demanded a reception and to be able to walk her down the aisle.
23370,Her anxiety: She sees  a psychiatrist monthly and just started her personality testing from a psychologist in order to go to regular therapy.
23371,She takes xanax twice daily (shrink ordered).
23372,She does have panic attacks (I have learned worst thing to do is to tell her to relax...).
23373,"Her anxiety is so bad that if I have to stay home late from work, I will come home to her bleeding all over the couch because she picks her toenails to the point where they are severely disfigured."
23374,"That's her ""tick""."
23375,She is constantly worrying about SOMETHING (that post http://ww.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jveg/found_elsewhere_how_to_decode_a_person_with_an/ describes her perfectly.
23376,Absolutely perfectly.
23377,"Anyway, what she's worried about."
23378,We went to her family's house this past Christmas.
23379,They made her cry because they told her she was too skinny.
23380,"Moreover, they found out she takes Xanax for her disorder."
23381,Her father has even worse anxiety but deals with it via homeopathy medicines (herbs and such).
23382,Now my fiancee is a professor at a medical school so she doesn't beleive in that (did I mention she's the smartest person I have ever met?).
23383,There was a huge fight over her medications and they constantly made her cry.
23384,She is worried they will make her cry again and of course the social anxiety of not knowing everyone at the wedding.
23385,What do i do?
23386,I can't really function like this so I finally decided it was time to take the next step and ask the doctor for meds.
23387,In the past was seeing a dr and was on many medications....last meds were prozac...abilify....klonopin....want to get back on klonopin .5mgs twice a day.
23388,How can I make sure to get them.
23389,I have no insuranse and will be paying 310 for first vusit then 125 after.
23390,Dont want to pay 310 unless i know im gonna get klonopin....u know what i mean?????
23391,?
23392,Lately I have been seeing a councilor as well as a Dr for medication.
23393,So a couple of weeks go by and I get a letter in the mail saying that she tried to contact me and that since she saw me as stable (non suicidal) she was releasing me and i will now only be seeing the medical doctor there for medication.
23394,"I've been on a whole array of medication for my severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder, some of which has worked vaguely for a little while before they just stopped working on together."
23395,"Yesterday I told my doctor that my Zoloft wasn't really helping me anymore, so he prescribed me Prozac."
23396,I'm already not liking it.
23397,I feel uncomfortably numb.
23398,"Not good, not any less anxious, just kind of numb."
23399,"It's also increased my tendency toward nausea significantly, now every time I smoke a cigarette I feel like I'm going to vomit."
23400,Should I keep taking them?
23401,"I mean, I realize that often medications take time for your body to get used to, but I don't know how much longer I can go on feeling like a nauseous pile of garbage as I wait for it to actually start working properly."
23402,I'm not medicated as anxiety medication didn't help me.
23403,"I have an appointment to meet with a doctor on Monday, and possibly get prescription medication to deal with this problem."
23404,"Do you guys have any suggestions for holistic treatment, or vitamin supplements that could be used as alternative medicine?"
23405,"I'm currently taking medication and forcing myself to go outside almost daily, just to see if I can extend how far I can go or how long I can stay out, however I don't feel like I'm currently making any progress."
23406,I have to start a job search but know that meds will help.
23407,There was a fuck up with my meds which caused me to crash into a pit of debilitating anxiety.
23408,"When I asked her about medication for anxiety in the first place, I was hoping she'd prescribe me an antidepressant."
23409,"I'm also seeing the counselor at my college once a week, and plan on continuing to do so if/when I'm prescribed a long-term medication."
23410,I do have a doctors appointment set up in a week to go on medication but every day is literally hell and I'm not even confident that the pills will help.
23411,"I'm on new meds, and have check ups with my doctor every two weeks."
23412,How willing are doctors to prescribe meds if you don't want to talk about it much?
23413,What if my medicine interacts with alcohol (it doesn't).
23414,I've been with my girlfriend nearly a year now.
23415,I've been aware of the problems she's dealing with and supportive of her throughout.
23416,"I'm trying to keep this short, so it might seem a little sparse, but here goes."
23417,"She's dealt with various things, among them intrusive thoughts, low self-esteem, depression, mood disorder, and all sorts of anxieties."
23418,"While we've been together she's been making progress, trying out different medications, etc.."
23419,"It's sometimes a strain on me, but I love her, and it's never been too much for me to handle."
23420,"I hold her, listen more than talk, don't blame her, don't get angry."
23421,She says just my presence calms her down.
23422,"I've been applying for this job that would put me far out of the country for a year, and I recently got word that I probably will be getting it (not sure yet)."
23423,"With her anxious thoughts and low self esteem, she's already thought for a while that I'm merely dating her until I can find someone better."
23424,"Add that to her separation anxiety, and it's been very rough for her."
23425,"I've made it more than clear that I want to stay with her, but I know that anxiety doesn't just go away in the face of reason."
23426,The past several times I've met up with her have turned into hour long crying and consoling sessions.
23427,"I want to do everything I can to help her, but my natural instinct is a sort of ""tough love"" angle and I think that would make things worse, so I just listen and support."
23428,"I'm sure this is obvious to plenty of you here, but she does have a calm rational side that knows these things aren't true."
23429,"She knows exactly what she has to do to get better, actively wants to get better, but has mental and emotional roadblocks in her way."
23430,"I get frustrated sometimes when I suggest something and she knows it will help, but she says ""that won't fix everything."""
23431,"There's literally nothing that will fix everything, but this black-and-white thinking is holding her back from doing much at all."
23432,"Basically, I want to know what I can do or should do for her."
23433,"Like I said, she's smart and has looked into things, so she has a really good idea of what she's going through and what she should do, but I don't know what I can do if I want to be more proactive in helping her achieve her goals."
23434,Can't take it anymore so I threw in the towel and visited my primary doctor today to talk about medication.
23435,I was on medication in the past but I wasn't myself and made me too tired.
23436,"My bf says he understands but it's so illogical he gets very frustrated.i had a few  years without medication and i was fine, but lately its controlling every part of my life."
23437,"I am hoping this will help and won't need medication, but what is she suggests it?"
23438,"I've tried CBT and Propanolol, this time my checklist is to try a new, more 'aggressive' medication (I was on a very low dose before), start seeing a psychotherapist to help understand **why** I have this constant feeling of dread, and to get a formal written diagnosis."
23439,I currently have one and I have to say I don't like it very much.
23440,"I'm wondering if people here a) have had similar experiences as me, b) have any suggestions for things I could try, or c) could recommend an alternative medication I could look into."
23441,**Brief background:** I'm currently trying to finish my masters thesis and experience intense anxiety every time I try to write.
23442,"I've been seeing a therapist since October, currently attend an anxiety/depression support group, and am working on mindfulness techniques."
23443,"All of these have helped me immensely, at least wrt getting a handle on my anxiety in my day-to-day life."
23444,"But I'm still having massive issues with writing, specifically."
23445,"My lorazepam prescription is intended for use on an as-you-need basis, and normally I don't use it because I don't like it."
23446,"It's great for relief of physical symptoms of anxiety, but at the price of making me feel disconnected from my surroundings (and specifically, the consequences that I will have to endure if I don't finish this paper)."
23447,"I'm acutely aware of those consequences, but it's impossible to connect to the person who is going to have to experience them."
23448,"And therefore, taking this prescription basically enables me to engage in the same time-wasting activities that I would already be indulging in as a result of my anxiety, except that I can do so guilt free."
23449,Not exactly conducive to productivity.
23450,"So, r/anxiety, can anyone help me with the following questions?"
23451,* have you tried ativan?
23452,What was it like for you?
23453,* have you switched from ativan to a different anti-anxiety medication?
23454,Which one?
23455,How do they compare for you?
23456,"* is there anything that I could try besides therapy, mindfulness, timers/schedules (the 45/45/30 model worked for me for a while, but has lost its powers of late), and medication?"
23457,"I really need to get this paper done :(

**TL;DR don't like my ativan prescription."
23458,Experiencing intense anxiety brought on by masters thesis.
23459,Any recommendations for alternative medications (or alternatives *to* medication)?
23460,**
23461,"I go to a therapist and talk and i did so in the past, as well as take medicine, but at the moment i don't take anything."
23462,Went cold turkey off the Pristiq a few weeks ago since I couldn't make it to my doctor to pick up more meds.
23463,Does anyone else feel some of these psych meds doctor prescribe aren't really doing their intended job after a while?
23464,How much choice does the patient really have with their medication?
23465,Can I even choose my own treatment without feeling as though i'm being mocked or judged by my psychologist or case worker for choosing my own medication?
23466,I'm just wondering what your anxiety is like now that you're on your meds.
23467,What was it like before and after meds?
23468,Which meds are you on?
23469,"I am not a drug user, rarely drink and the only medication I'm taking is birth control."
23470,I been having stomach issues from yesterday morning it's 1am and I haven't been able to sleep yet and my stomach still being a bit off I wasn't sure due to getting used to the meds (sertraline) as I been on them for month now.
23471,I am on medication (Lexapro) for anxiety and depression.
23472,"I am a psychology major, and I know there is medication for episodes, but I also know that this medication can lead to a dependency."
23473,Are any of you on episode-related medication?
23474,"I guess I'm just asking about medication, and what you guys do to stop yourself from entering a major episode."
23475,"There is a long back-story...I'm sorry:

In November, I was in a terrible car accident."
23476,Someone who was texting and driving ran a red light and hit my truck on the passenger side.
23477,My car flipped and skidded into oncoming traffic.
23478,"I am lucky that a car in the oncoming traffic didn't hit me, or else I would most likely be dead."
23479,"Prior to this, I have always been an advocate for driving safety, urging everyone I know to not text and drive."
23480,"It's one of my biggest concerns in this world of advancing technology, and it just so happens to be the main form of communication for young people who believe they are invincible."
23481,"Then, these young people get behind the wheel, and accidents like mine happen."
23482,"Unfortunately, not everyone involved in those types of accidents is as lucky as I was."
23483,I had only minor injuries including a bruised rib and pelvic bone and some torn muscles in my shoulder (which I am having treated).
23484,"I can't ignore the irony, that I, a young advocate for driving safety, had an accident at the hands of a person driving irresponsibly."
23485,It took me a while to finally acknowledge that I was having trouble coping with the traumatic experience I had.
23486,"If I was driving home and noticed someone driving erratically, I would check to see if they were texting by peering into their windows as they approached my vehicle."
23487,"If I did see that they were texting, I would get physically upset."
23488,I would hyperventilate and get kinda dizzy to the point where I needed to pull over to catch my breath.
23489,I get incredibly angry.
23490,"I feel like I have been experiencing such an injustice (there is a long story attached to the accident, insurance battles and money problems...I'm in the middle of a lawsuit, as well, with the other driver's insurance company because they are trying to say it's 20% my fault, even though the other driver admitted he was texting and it's all his fault), so when I see people disregarding other people's safety, it drives me crazy."
23491,"I have never been this angry, and never felt this upset."
23492,"Each time this would happen, I would walk in the door upon returning home and immediately vent to my parents about what I saw and how upset I was."
23493,My parents have heard a lot from me.
23494,"I will say that yes, I have seen a doctor for this and I was diagnosed with minor PTSD."
23495,"He said that since my anxiety attacks occur so often (about 3-5 times a week and only when driving), that I needed to be on an anti-depressant."
23496,"Since anti-anxiety medications are taken at the onset of anxiety, that wouldn't be a good option for me since my anxiety occurs while operating a vehicle."
23497,"I'm on Lexapro and I feel better, but I still get slightly anxious and have had one major meltdown since being on it (haven't been on it for a month, yet)."
23498,"I have had two major meltdowns since the accident (aside from the typical, almost-daily anxiety ridden drives)."
23499,"One was when I was driving to work in the morning, stopped at a red light."
23500,My light turned green so I started inching into the intersection.
23501,The guy in the big SUV to the left of me honked his horn and waved at me in a way that was telling me to stop.
23502,I stopped just as a sports car went whizzing into the intersection at a very high speed.
23503,"I realized if that man hadn't warned me and honked his horn, I would have been hit (on the driver's side, this time)."
23504,"I know that nothing happened and I am safe and fine, but it still sent me reeling."
23505,"I got to work and called my mom, unable to catch my breath."
23506,I couldn't focus and I couldn't stop crying.
23507,"My mom has anxiety too, so she understands."
23508,This was before I was on medication.
23509,The other meltdown was when I was driving home from work.
23510,This was a few days ago.
23511,(I had been on medication for about 2 weeks at this point.)
23512,It was rush hour and it was on a busy street with high volumes of traffic.
23513,"In my rearview mirror, I noticed a small sports car weaving between cars and driving incredibly fast -- *just to beat us to the red light that we would all be stuck at* -- it's so moronic."
23514,He eventually ended up driving next to me along side the left of my vehicle.
23515,I looked and noticed that he was texting.
23516,"Just then, his car started to veer across the double yellow line, straight into oncoming traffic."
23517,"He nearly collided head-on with other vehicles, but thankfully he quickly swerved just in time."
23518,"I was screaming and yelling in my car, I couldn't control myself."
23519,"I got to my driveway and just sobbed, unable to catch my breath."
23520,"I went inside, and my parents noticed right away that I was upset."
23521,"They urged me to talk to them, so I opened up."
23522,My dad just kept telling me to not look at other cars and to only focus on my own driving and ignore the texters.
23523,"""Just do what I do,"" he says."
23524,He lists all the ways that he is the perfect driver and he lists all the ways that he never has issues with anxiety.
23525,Then he said something that really angered me.
23526,"""I think you go out there just *looking* for people who are texting and driving."
23527,You *let* it upset you.
23528,There is no reason to do that.
23529,"You need to stop."""
23530,"He told me I needed to go to counseling (which is fine, and I agree with) but he didn't say it in a supportive way."
23531,He said I was starting to act 'looney' and this 'isn't normal.'
23532,"""It's not right that you *let things* get to you."""
23533,AS IF I AM ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN.
23534,AS IF I WANT THIS TO HAPPEN.
23535,I explained to him that all his methods are easier said than done and he just doesn't understand.
23536,It really hurts my feelings that my father thinks I'm crazy.
23537,This isn't the first time he has said things like this to me...but this was the straw that broke the camel's back.
23538,I'm so tired of my own dad thinking I am 'faking it' or just 'trying to get attention.'
23539,He calls my behavior 'goofy' in a condescending way.
23540,He scoffs and rolls his eyes.
23541,I'm tired of it.
23542,It hurts my feelings.
23543,"EDIT: I am a 22-year-old female, dad is 59."
23544,I still live at home (post-graduate).
23545,"I don't mean just psych meds, but when I get a new prescription i obsess about whether or not to take them."
23546,I actually feel worse now then I did before medication.
23547,I just hated medication and therapy helps but sometimes it is hard to make is functional in the moment.
23548,"What it means is you need to take actions to have on you your medication, water (or relaxing tea such as chamomile or ""nighty-night"" or ""easy now""), your cell phone is charged, maybe a pocket knife or touchstone or whatever, and any relevant research and preparation for whatever it is you're going to do."
23549,"I had passed out before then, but I have a lot more general anxiety now, especially concerning taking medicine and eating new foods for some reason."
23550,I am just curious and looking for help from my fellow redditors with anxiety.
23551,What medicines have you taken to treat your anxiety?
23552,I don't care if it is anti-anxiety or an anti-depressant or a vitamin found at a local pharmacy.
23553,Just looking for new medicines to bring up to my doctor or ask questions about whether or not they would fit my situation.
23554,I've never gone to a doctor to talk about it because I'm afraid they're just gonna prescribe me some medicine that I'll become reliant on and that's not the way I want to live.
23555,"After 18 years of dealing with panic disorder I'm at the end of my rope so to speak, so I have found a place that focuses on functional medicine and getting to the root cause."
23556,"I'm on my meds and therapy, but almost everyday (if not everyday) I feel the same thing."
23557,Switched meds several times and every time it seems worse than before.
23558,"I've been off medication for about 3 months now, due to a big move, finishing school, etc."
23559,I'm going to the doctor to see what kind of regiment I can get back on with meds and/or therapy (I've done both in the past).
23560,He has a chapter about medication that details the facts/side effects/uses of some drugs.
23561,"Now I am taking meds for my anxiety (gabapentin 300mg twice a day,bupropion sr 150mg three times a day), while they do help deal with my physical symptoms, they don't remove them and do little for the mental ones."
23562,I'm tired of dealing with anxiety and having to take medicine that probably needs to be upped in dosage (again) and having to stress manage and having to go to several counselors and having to do all this other stuff that I didn't have to deal with two years ago.
23563,"But I had taken it in the morning, at 10 a.m. so surely the restlessness last night was not from the medication I had taken fourteen hours before."
23564,"My question is, could the meds have anything to do with this, only having been taken twice?"
23565,Or is this some sort of stomach virus I have caught and it coincidentally coincides with starting new medication?
23566,I'm considering being open to medication but I have a fear or being dependent on them for years on end.
23567,I suffer from GAD and panic disorder and treat them with both meds and therapy.
23568,"I'll start: I finished tapering off my meds last Friday, but I'm still going through some icky withdrawals."
23569,"I got diagnosed with ADHD six months ago and while medication definitely helps, the stresses of college pile on, leading to a lot of stress and anxiety."
23570,"Really, I could care less if I'm on meds or not."
23571,"I've though about going to a doctor to get medication, but I don't have insurance, and I don't have the money to go right now."
23572,What if I can't afford medication that he thinks will help... Will I have a few good months after starting it then fall spectacularly to pieces afterwards when I can no longer afford it?
23573,It's partly my fault for waiting until I was almost out of meds before getting a refill.
23574,Despite my attempts at medication and therapy I cant escape it.
23575,Taking my meds.
23576,"Supposedly this has been helpful for many people, especially those who are trying to avoid prescription medication (which I am trying to avoid)."
23577,"I asked my therapist his opinion on how the medication is helping me, as he sees many more people with anxiety than I do."
23578,"So, that leads me to my question - what medicine has helped you with anxiety the most?"
23579,"I have tried meditation with little success, I think my only option is to use anti-anxiety meds and/or sedatives if I can get them."
23580,"So, a few days ago I went to the Doctors, I essentially had the option of staying on my medication Celexa 40MG, however it made me feel extremely unwell, at least I hope it was the medication making me feel this way."
23581,"I stopped that right away to start taking 10MG of Sertaline the next day, I started that threw days ago, today I woke up feeling good, as o progressed through the day I was having trouble speaking to people, which is why I was put on the medication in the first place, now I'm feeling really nervous, dizzy, I'm quite scared, I'm worried I'm going to die."
23582,"I am feeling more and more like I need a medication to help control my ridiculous anxiety, and then I also should start therapy on the side to help myself get to a place where I eventually don't need the medication any longer."
23583,"**Edit:** This is why I am so scared to try meds, because their effects are varied and unpredictable!"
23584,* Who prescribes medication and how do they decide if you need it?
23585,* How much do therapy and meds typically cost?
23586,"I had been on medication the past six month, I had been doing so wonderfully the first semester."
23587,"Now I am just back to worrying about everything, my medication runs out in a few weeks."
23588,My husband suffers from crippling anxiety.
23589,"We've been together 6 years, married less than 1."
23590,So many posts on this subreddit sounds exactly like him.
23591,What can I do to help?
23592,"In a perfect world, what would your loving partner do to make you feel better?"
23593,"He's already been seeing a therapist for years, has been taking various types of prescribed medications and has been attending various addiction programs."
23594,"We get couple's counseling too, sometimes it seems to help, sometimes I feel like we're just spinning our wheels."
23595,"He says he doesn't remember a lot of the stuff we talk about in counseling afterwards, like it doesn't sink in."
23596,I am not nearly as supportive as he needs and I want to be better.
23597,I'm optimistic and happy-go-lucky about pretty much everything.
23598,"He probably feels his self-loathing even more acutely in comparison, and I don't like that, but I don't want to get dragged down into his depression either."
23599,"How come I can't ""drag him the other way""?"
23600,"The thing I regret the most is how when he complains to me, my immediate reaction is to freak out taking the horrible things he says at face value."
23601,"Then it dawns on me that he's just venting - and I get angry, I feel like I'm the butt of a joke, like I'm being used."
23602,"Before our counseling sessions I also used to lecture him trying to fix his problems all the time, now I know he just wants a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on and hugs."
23603,Is that the best I can give him?
23604,"Please help me, reddit!"
23605,"To everybody else out there suffering from anxiety, I feel for you."
23606,I want to give every one of you a long hug and a pat on the back.
23607,It'll be ok.
23608,Somehow.
23609,Sometime.
23610,Soon.
23611,"I stopped medication about a year after, willingly and I was okay for a while, but in the past year and a half I've been shaky."
23612,Hi r/anxiety!
23613,"I've been diagnosed with Depression/Anxiety for a little over 12 years now, and I've had it pretty well under-control with therapy and a series of medications (Paxil, Zoloft, Lexapro, in that order)."
23614,"But in the past couple of years, I've found myself suffering increasingly from the irrational fear that my husband is cheating on me."
23615,"We only just got married in January, but we've been together since 2007."
23616,"In the tenure of our relationship, he has given me ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to believe that he would EVER cheat on ANYBODY."
23617,"He's the sweetest, kindest, most honest individual I've ever known."
23618,"Hence, marriage."
23619,"But sadly, the logical part of my brain does not have the high ground in this situation, and I find myself frequently panicking that he is cheating on me."
23620,"Each new female he meets, if she even remotely resembles a friend, I assume that she is out to steal him from me, and that he has every reason to want to be with her, because normally they are prettier, more feminine and (most importantly) skinnier than myself."
23621,Here's a little background: I've been overweight since I was 8 years old.
23622,"Now, at age 26, I weigh about 215 lbs."
23623,"I think I'm fat and disgusting and no one, not even my incredibly supportive and loving husband can convince me otherwise."
23624,"I'm starting to tear up typing this, but it's true."
23625,I hate myself.
23626,So there's that.
23627,"I didn't have a boyfriend until I was 19 years old, when I lost my virginity to a friend in college."
23628,We started dating.
23629,Everything was awesome.
23630,We even threw the idea of marriage around after about a year.
23631,But then it turned...bad.
23632,This guy was an asshole.
23633,"I mean a true, pompus fuck."
23634,But of course I didn't think that at the time.
23635,I was in love.
23636,He stole my virginity and gave me HPV.
23637,"Ours was a long distance relationship, so we went weeks, nay months, without seeing each other."
23638,"He was 2 years older, and went off to grad school for Theater."
23639,"Long story short, he may or may not have cheated on me."
23640,"Regardless of what actually happened, it came to light that he had spent the night with a girl, in his bed, and lied to me about it."
23641,"I had been calling him and texting him, without answers."
23642,"I stayed up all night, waiting for him to call me."
23643,"Finally, at 6am, he texts something to the effect of ""oh sorry, I fell asleep on the couch."""
23644,"The next day, he explained to me that he had been hanging out with this girl, drinking wine and watching TV at his house."
23645,"After a lot of beating around the bush, he eventually admitted that they fell asleep snuggling on the couch."
23646,I forgave him.
23647,He was drunk.
23648,Whatever.
23649,"But then, a few weeks later, I came to visit."
23650,We hung out with the infamous girl.
23651,"At some point in the evening, she let this bomb drop ""Oh yeah, you have really soft sheets."""
23652,I flipped out.
23653,"I took him into the other room, and asked him what that meant."
23654,"In a befuddled sort of way he said ""Oh yeah...uh...I guess we fell asleep on the couch, and I kind of woke up and took her into my bed...so...sorry""

And, like an idiot, I didn't dump him."
23655,"He then later dumped me, over the phone, and started a relationship with her."
23656,A beautiful story for my first love.
23657,Fast forward to now.
23658,I'm married to basically the polar opposite of this guy.
23659,But that experience tainted me.
23660,I feel like I don't deserve happiness.
23661,"That if one person cheated on me, why wouldn't everyone else."
23662,"I pride myself on not being clingy and ""overly attached girlfriendish."""
23663,"If I don't get an answer to a text or call, I leave it alone."
23664,"But, my brain does NOT leave it alone."
23665,"I can sit for hours sometimes, reeling with anxiety that at that moment, my husband (or fiance, depending on how back we're looking) is fucking some girl that is skinnier and prettier than me, because I'm not good enough."
23666,Does anyone else have a problem like this?
23667,What are your coping mechanisms?
23668,"I feel better already, having typed this all out, actually, but it's still something I need help with."
23669,"I saw a counselor at grad school, a psych student, who certifiably made things worse by trying out [Imaginal Exposures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolonged_exposure_therapy) with me."
23670,"Basically, what she did was made me think about my fiance cheating on me until I became numb and unemotional about it."
23671,It was the worst.
23672,"TL;DR - despite all my better reasoning and facts to the contrary, I assume that my husband is cheating on me because I feel ugly and unsatisfactory."
23673,HELP ME stop the paranoia!
23674,"Things have been going perfectly smooth the last 3 months, im on a new medicine that has leveled me back out to normal."
23675,Doing so totally threw me off and I forgot to take my meds.
23676,"I am no longer on medication because I was convinced I had the tools to deal with my anxieties and depression myself, but I clearly do not."
23677,"Ive had anxiety for a couple of months now and started getting anxiety attacks which completely freaked me out, 
I went to the doctors and they prescribed me citalopram which completely knocked me out for a week, it increased my anxiety attack and generally made me alot worse, i then switched medication to Sertraline and that seems to be working okay since then, however when I have free time at the weekends I seem to get very anxious/ depressed and i'm just not sure what I can do about this situation so reddit any tips for dealing with anxiety and depression during down time or just in general?"
23678,I'd like to try other options before I go down the medication route.
23679,"6) If all else fail, try medication!"
23680,"I want to start on medication, but I'm concerned that the first two weeks might spike my blood pressure up to a dangerous level(it already spikes when feeling anxiety, so pretty much all of the time these days)."
23681,I have never been to a psychiatrist/psychologist and am not currently on any medication
23682,"I will probably be talking to my psychologist soon enough to get on some medication, I know it's different for everyone, which works best etc."
23683,"I'm afraid of taking medication because I think it ~~will~~ could make me worse (mood swings, suicidal thoughts, depressed, more anxious etc etc) But, I can't live like this anymore, I need to do something about it."
23684,"sorry for the huge texts;

TL;DR - When did you know your medication was working?"
23685,Or is it just the meds kicking in?
23686,"First of all I'm male, 20 and have had anxiety since I was 14 although I was only diagnosed about 14 months ago."
23687,Since then I have tried a variety of different medications which have either not worked very well or not worked at all.
23688,"Since I started CBT 3 months ago I have noticed that my anxiety has not changed that much from when I was 14 and that whilst I am currently taking 150mg of Effexor daily, I feel like this is not working either."
23689,Is it possible that no medication will ever work for me?
23690,Am I just expecting to much out of them?
23691,I understand that medication isn't a fix but it should at least help.
23692,It this point I just want something that will make me 'half dead' I would just like to feel nothing...
23693,"Okay guys, my boyfriend (who was recently diagnosed with anxiety) refuses to take his medicine because he's afraid of all the side effects."
23694,Did any of you go through something like this where you were afraid to take your medicine because you thought it would do more harm than good?
23695,"I've recently been dealing with a lot of anxiety, and while there are many different ways of dealing with it, medication, meditation, therapy, or the million other things you can do, I have found a really easy way to take about 1% of the edge off, and I'm sure a lot of people do it."
23696,"
This may seem like a rant but I really need advice."
23697,Please forgive any shitty spelling/grammar errors as I haven't slept in 24 hours.
23698,I've maybe gotten 12 hours of sleep in the last 6 days.
23699,I am frustrated.
23700,I am exhausted.
23701,I am desperate.
23702,Any advice or support will help.
23703,"Little background on me:

I have anxiety, PTSD and short bouts of depression."
23704,I have been treated as bipolar but I guess my reaction to the bipolar meds showed my Psychiatrist that I wasn't in fact bipolar.
23705,My issues with sleep have been since high school.
23706,My anxiety worsened after graduating in 2007.
23707,My ability to sleep almost literally went away overnight.
23708,Pun not intended.
23709,I  have tried so many medications.
23710,"Here are a few and my reactions: 

Trazadone: 50mg made me dizzy and nauseas but no sleep."
23711,"100mg made me throw up before I fell asleep, slept like a rock for about 4 hours, woke up and threw up for what felt like forever."
23712,Couldn't walk straight.
23713,It was awful.
23714,I tried it two years later with the same shitty reaction.
23715,Never again.
23716,Seriquil: Can't remember the dosage.
23717,"Gave me a hellish headache, made me dizzy.."
23718,"Took about two hours to fall asleep, woke up a few times with a progressively worse headache."
23719,Finally woke up with the absolute worst migraine of my life..
23720,Hangover from hell.
23721,It kicked my ass the entire day the following day.
23722,I spent a few weeks working with the dosage with my Psych to no avail.
23723,"OTC everything: 

Melatonin (up to 50 mg at once) literally no reaction."
23724,Not even tired.
23725,Valerian Root (500-800 mg at once sometimes coupled with 50mg of melatonin) a bit dizzy.
23726,No sleep.
23727,OTCSleep aids:  Nothing.
23728,None of them worked.
23729,Even taking wayyy more than recommended.
23730,I feel a bit tired but I do not sleep.
23731,Lunesta: Didn't work at any prescribed dose and I was too scared to up it myself.
23732,It left the most god awful taste in my mouth for 24 hours.
23733,Trying that pill for a few days was bad.
23734,I couldn't taste anything but death.
23735,Even water was disgusting.
23736,Hate it.
23737,Hate it.
23738,Hate it.
23739,Ambien: I had the hardest time falling asleep.
23740,I hallucinated but I was aware that it wasn't real.
23741,I felt anxious.
23742,After a few hours I slept AMAZING and woke up just fine.
23743,"After trying it a few more times (different doses) and having to go through the same thing, I ditched it."
23744,Unisom: I fell asleep rather quickly (within two hours) but woke up two hours later every damn time.
23745,Xanax: Currently what I take.
23746,I LOVVVE this pill.
23747,"Thing is, I need more and more."
23748,I currently need about 4/5 mg to get me to sleep (started on .25).
23749,This can not be good for me.
23750,But god the sleep is good.
23751,My dr only prescribes me 2mg a night and it's a very very controlled pill.
23752,So I run out quickly and can't refill for weeks.
23753,"Those are just a few..
Over the Past 5 years I have combined them, upped them myself, experimented  with anything.."
23754,I have tried what feels like every damn natural/unmedicated remedy That exists...
23755,"Here they are and here's what happened: 

Hypnosis, tapping (bilateral stimulation), ambient noise, different light settings, smells, temperature Of the room, no sex, yes sex, no tv, yes tv, type of pillows, different schedules, different sleeping positions, my ex boyfriend would even massage my back every single night."
23756,None of these things made a difference in my sleep.
23757,Some things did however help my anxiety a ton.
23758,"Current Remedy: A strictish sleep schedule coupled with Xanax(when I have it), OTC stuff and every natural thing I've listed above.."
23759,Result: My work schedule makes it impossible to keep it strict so I give myself two hours of slack depending.
23760,I lay(lie?)
23761,in bed for hours and hours and fall asleep when my body finally gives out.
23762,Usually after 8 hours of being awake and bored.
23763,Sometimes after 36+ miserable hours of no tv no phone.
23764,Just ambient fan noise and a dull nightlight in my bathroom.
23765,I sleep for maybe 4 hours and I feel DISGUSTING and exhausted when I wake up.
23766,I have the worst nightmares ever.
23767,I am at my wit's end.
23768,I have had people suggest a sleep study.
23769,"I do not have any sort I breathing issues, even if I did, being woken up by something like sleep apnea, it isn't my problem."
23770,Falling asleep is my problem.
23771,"If I were to try to do a sleep study, it'd be hours of me not sleeping."
23772,"I've spent soo much money on drugs, Doctor appts, gas, pillows, lights, books.."
23773,"I have seen regular physicians, neurologists, psychiatrists, therapists, I even went to my OB to rule out any hormone or birth control problems.."
23774,Most nights I get so frustrated after about 3 hours of nothing that I give up.
23775,I go on Reddit until my body and mind can not be awake any longer.
23776,What the fuck is wrong with me?
23777,"Hello, here is my experience with medication and my anxiety/depression."
23778,"(I know only my doctor can make this choice, so I am purely asking for opinion and to broaden my horizons and possibly bring up certain medication names with my doctor.)"
23779,"My question is:

Is there a medication like Wellbutrin that does not have stimulant properties?"
23780,By that I mean: A medication that treats anxiety/depression that has less chance of sexual side effects that is NOT a stimulant?
23781,"And I'm trying to be positive about the therapy process, and that it will help, or that I'll get on medication that will help me."
23782,"I have never taken any prescribed medication for my anxiety as its been too specific and short-lived (although very intense, not symptomatically but emotionally and mentally) and I've dealt with my depression my entire life so I haven't bothered with that either."
23783,With the help of therapy and medication I feel reborn.
23784,And there is medication that can calm those thoughts.
23785,I'm not currently on any medication because I've been able to manage my anxiety up until recently.
23786,"First, I don't have health insurance so I don't take medications or visit a therapist."
23787,But I have had doctors tell me I might have anxiety.
23788,I just don't follow up because no insurance.
23789,I've tried telling my family and they don't really understand the severity of it.
23790,"They tell me to meditate, do yoga, eat well and drink lots of water."
23791,"I try to do most of those things, but it's hard to be relaxed in my house and it's also hard to eat healthy because my parents eat a lot of meat and tortillas."
23792,"(I'm a Mexican college student home for the summer)

I keep a journal and it helps a lot, but I hate writing down my terrible thoughts."
23793,"I smoke weed and drink occasionally while in college, but here at home I don't because I just hang out with my family."
23794,"(So I'm like 2 months sober) 

Most days I'm fine and don't let my anxiety get to me, but today is just one of those days."
23795,I can't stop crying because I feel as if something horrible is going to happen to my parents at work.
23796,"I think that almost everyday, but today I couldn't brush it off."
23797,My school has free counseling that I'm thinking about using but I won't be back for another month.
23798,I believe that when I'm home my anxiety gets worse because I'm constantly worrying about my sisters and brothers and nieces and parents.
23799,Even though I know they'll be okay.
23800,I hate it because I only have so much time to spend with them before I have to go back to school and I don't want to be worried the entire time.
23801,As soon as I leave I miss them terribly.
23802,I want to be able to enjoy my time with them.
23803,Please help me.
23804,"I'm still taking my medication and trying my best, but it feels like a slippery slope."
23805,I've been going to therapy for over a year now and while that and medication seem to help nothing really changes very much.
23806,"Out of all options, I started to see a gastroenterologist who was trained as a functional medicine practitioner, as recommend by Dr. Greenblatt."
23807,who is also trained in integrative medicine has helped me a lot.
23808,"Yeah, giving up gluten sucked....but there are days that I wake up, without taking my daily psych meds and feel right as rain."
23809,This might be a little long--I apologize in advance.
23810,"Some background, I'm a second-generation Korean-American (that is, my parents emigrated here and had me) and I have a sister who was born sick with a condition that I don't feel the need to describe but just know it doesn't prevent her from living her life completely normally."
23811,She is in her mid-twenties and has graduated high school and college and is now starting to apply for grad school.
23812,"But yeah, the fact of the matter is that my sister is perfectly capable of taking care of herself."
23813,"However, fall of last year my sister happened to get really sick and was hospitalized for an extended period of time; I had to withdraw for a term etc and my whole family went home to support each other through it all."
23814,Now switch gears to my mom.
23815,My mom has always had anxiety.
23816,I am almost positive because I have researched a ton of symptoms and my mom matches almost every single one.
23817,"I have talked to her about it, but the problem is that my parents don't believe in anxiety or any sickness that isn't ""dire"" (i.e."
23818,emergency room visits).
23819,"As a kid, I was raised on a lot of weird eastern medicine."
23820,"Not to say Eastern medicine isn't valid (the stomach-ache finger-prick thing, anyone?"
23821,hallelujah!
23822,"), but I think there are times that western medicine prevails."
23823,I really just want to get my mom on an anti-anxiety med.
23824,"Now you might ask what kind of symptoms she has... Well, here goes."
23825,"For one thing, my mom can't sleep."
23826,And she's one of the skinniest people I know so that rules out obstructive sleep apnea.
23827,"So when I say she can't sleep, I mean like she will get about 3~4 hours tops a night."
23828,Wherein she'll wake up and start menial tasks that she has lined up in her head all day.
23829,She's obsessive with her cleaning and how she prepares her lunch for us etc...
23830,There's just too many little things.
23831,She micromanages absolutely everything.
23832,But what topped it off happened recently.
23833,"Last year, my mother was supposed to go to South Korea to visit her family, but then my sister got sick and all that airplane ticket money went right down the drain."
23834,"Fast forward to this year, and we bought another airplane ticket to South Korea for September 22nd, 2013."
23835,"And well, I think last year's experience sort of destroyed a part of her that lets her enjoy her life and relax."
23836,"For the past year, her anxiety has been the worst it has ever been."
23837,"A week before her departure, my mom started getting really sick to her stomach and couldn't eat and ended up going to the ER on the 21st."
23838,She had a CT scan done and everything was clear--I'm positive it was her anxiety.
23839,"But really, this had been going on even before I left for school (~August 24th)."
23840,"We had just bought her ticket and she couldn't stop talking about how she was ""scared to leave my sister alone at home."
23841,"What is she going to do without me"" etc etc."
23842,"And she had mild stomach problems then, too."
23843,"We extended the airplane ticket a week, so she left today but we had to pay another $300 to get it postponed."
23844,I want my mother to get her symptoms checked up but I don't really know how to go about it.
23845,"I know she's going to go to Korea, and get told to try some more eastern medicine."
23846,How do I convince my mother that her anxiety is a real condition?
23847,"Even her ""family"" doctor (whom she only visits in dire need), doesn't give her the right stuff, or maybe doesn't see the real problem."
23848,"Even worse, I'm over 2000 miles away from home in college."
23849,I wonder if any redditors have had similar situations.
23850,"I'd gladly take any help

TL;DR mom has anxiety but doesn't believe it."
23851,keeps taking random eastern medicine in hopes of trying to fix herself but its not doing anything.
23852,now she's in Korea looking for even more eastern medicines.
23853,help
23854,I used meds and they helped but felt like it was just a band aid.
23855,I have been taking on my anxiety without meds now for a few years and  just don't want to go back.
23856,One of my recent posts I made was right before a panic attack I had because my doctor refused to fill my anxiety medication and he still is refusing to fill my prescription because he wants to see me but has no reason to.
23857,"My therapist and I were working so well with everything, I was going to work regularly and school getting fair grades but after the other night and being off my meds I'm defeated."
23858,My manager doesn't understand my condition and will get furious if I call in but even thinking about being in that environment right now is making me start to hyperventilate... my mother is thinking of taking our doctor to court because this isn't the first time he has refused me medication just to have me come in.
23859,"He also started me on anti-depressants and decided to stop filling them 2 months later because he changed his mind, but did so without informing me or my mother and without giving me any other form of medication."
23860,"I really think medication (Xanax possibly) is the only solution to my anxiety, I don't think I will be functional without it."
23861,I've been battling anxieties for as long as I can remember.
23862,"Hell, I can remember being in grade 2, seven years old, and already tripping out about things."
23863,"I've tried so much, and nothing has ever worked."
23864,Recent events have refocused me.
23865,Last week my girlfriend broke up with me.
23866,More context [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2xnflm/first_relationship_serious_just_ended_i_dont_know/) but it's not necessary to read.
23867,She was my first girlfriend.
23868,She was my best friend.
23869,She was my safe support when I needed it.
23870,"It was serious; we dated for three years, two of them living together."
23871,And now it's all gone.
23872,In part because she didn't want to deal with my issues anymore.
23873,I've tried medications.
23874,I've tried therapists.
23875,I've even tried Jesus.
23876,Nothing helps.
23877,Everything makes it worse.
23878,Medications sap my sex drive.
23879,Therapists cost a fortune and never seem to understand anything or help.
23880,"Church, well, a good amount of my anxieties (the social ones) are related to the church experiences in my youth."
23881,These things derail me on a weekly basis.
23882,They destroy my quality of life.
23883,They impact my job.
23884,And now they've stolen the most important part of my life.
23885,"I can't handle this anymore, and I won't handle this anymore."
23886,But how do I get over it?
23887,How do I stop being triggered into anxiety spirals around memories from years ago?
23888,How do I stop obsessing over tiny meaningless details?
23889,How do I stop alienating my friends and loved ones?
23890,How do I *be ok*?
23891,Where can I find resources that actually help?
23892,What can I do that I haven't tried yet?
23893,Why am I like this?
23894,"Please help, if you can."
23895,I'm grasping at straws
23896,"I think with the right CBT, I could make some improvements, or maybe even medication?"
23897,I wanted to post here to encourage those thinking about trying meds or in the process because I feel it saved my life in a way.
23898,Sure I may find the right meds and I may find nice coping mechanisms but I will never be normal.
23899,"For now, all we can do is cycle the meds and live to battle another day."
23900,Would they insist I go on medication and see a therapist?
23901,I have GAD and haven't taken any medication for anxiety and depression for over a year now.
23902,I discontinued the medication in December and went through about a month of withdrawal.
23903,"i'm 21, and i've only tried meds once and that was when i was 16. it left me feeling drowzy all day, every day so i cut it out."
23904,"my mom picks up, ""mom, i'm having a really bad reaction to my meds, i think i'm dying, what the fuck do i do."""
23905,"she tells me to calm down, it's probably just the meds."
23906,By the way I don't want to take meds and I already am seeing a therapist.
23907,"I have struggled with anxiety since I can remember, and it has been extreme the past 4 years."
23908,I have managed to hide it from my parents because they would not understand and see it as weakness.
23909,I finally could not live with the burden of the secret and finally broke down telling my mom.
23910,She was completely understanding and even shared that many of our family friends struggle with anxiety and take various medications.
23911,I'm away at college and just want to get through the next couple weeks the way I've adapted to living.
23912,I'm going home for the summer and she is going to help get me in to see someone.
23913,"My question for you all is what meds have you taken, what has worked for you, what are side effects?"
23914,"The thought of going to the next training put me into panic mode, and I tried to work through it, I really did, telling myself it’s all in my head, doing deep breathing, taking my anxiety medication… but I couldn’t bring myself to actually leave the house, so I just quit."
23915,"The job has been going alright, but the health insurance doesn’t cover anything until I hit my ridiculously high deductible, so I can’t afford my therapy or medication anymore."
23916,"Other than work and social situations, the meds are helping a lot."
23917,"I stopped the medication and am no longer sick, and I'm getting attacks pretty much daily."
23918,"F/26/US/insurance covers therapy (going to my third session tomorrow), medication and doctor visits."
23919,"I looked it up today, and some people are saying that the tinnitus never goes away even after they stop taking the medication, and now I'm afraid to take it."
23920,"Also, what other medication should I ask my doctor about if I'd like to get off of this one?"
23921,"This past December I was put into an institution for being suicidal...long sory short, my narcolepsy meds made me a little crazy...Im on different meds now, but I cant seem to shake this feeling of wanting to die."
23922,"I suppose my reason (if any) for wanting death is so that I dont have to worry about my medication anymore...so my parents never have to worry about me, so that I have no more responsibilities, etc...I am just so sick of everything."
23923,I ended up beating it without medication afree getting a job and telling myself I have to get on with my life even if it means dealing with the symptoms.
23924,"(Since I started meds [currently my psych-relating meds--meaning not all were meant for psych, but all can be psych meds--are Topamax 200mg, Klonopin 2mg, and Wellbutrin 200mg] the dreams ""branched out"" a bit from the constant death, fighting, chasing, being chased, and so on."
23925,I should note however that my mother has depression and takes medication for it.
23926,"The doctor reassured me that everything was fine, that she wasn't pregnant and that I didn't need anxiety medication, so I went on but the fears continued."
23927,"I know sometimes it can take time for the meds to work right, and I want to know what tips you all had for managing the physical symptoms, because at this point they are practically unbearable."
23928,My SO picked up some Quiet Life tablets and asked me to give them a try until my medication is ready for pick up.
23929,"Hello, 

This is my first post and yet, I felt obligated to tell my story and to obtain some insight as the changes in my life have been both harrowing and drastic."
23930,I am in my late 20s and I am prospective PhD student in the UK (although I am American and have been in the US for the past year).
23931,"Moreover, I am a frequent traveler - often to East Africa where I carry out my research (although I have not been in Africa for over a year)."
23932,"I have always had some form of anxiety - however, it has usually been through work (ie ""being the best"" or achieving the highest marks)."
23933,"Anyways, I graduated with distinction following the completion of my masters (last year) and I moved back to the US for a break before I go back to grad school for my PhD (which I will be doing in January)."
23934,"Anyways, since being back - my anxiety has gotten worse."
23935,"Last winter, it was just so severe that I couldn't leave my house (I was also getting off of a medication)."
23936,"After getting off of this medication -  I was put on a number of other medications - all with paradoxical reactions (for example, I was put on lexapro and it simply made my anxiety worse)."
23937,"So, I got off all of the medications that I ""tried out"" for my anxiety as they made my symptoms worse."
23938,I am currently back on the medication that I was trying to get off (Klonopin 1 mg a night).
23939,"Later during the year, I was diagnosed with several strains of Lyme disease and rocky mountain fever."
23940,After months of antibiotics - I am finally cured (as of a few weeks ago).
23941,"Lastly, it should be worth mentioning that I have not lived in the area that I currently reside in for five years and it is quite stressful (actually, I moved out of the area because of the stress)."
23942,"Right now - I have been experiencing anxiety that I have never really experienced before..these symptoms are completely new to me:

1. waking up feeling ""panicky""
2 ""the feeling of blood pumping through my veins""
3. noise and light sensitivity 
4. a loss of sense of Euphoria (I don't get excited as much)
5. just overall feeling panic-like throughout the day and night...making it difficult to work."
23943,These are new symptoms for me and they make me worry because I am not enjoying life as much.
23944,What is strange is that they appeared right after I moved back to the USA.
23945,I feel like a shadow of my former self - (I used to be quite charismatic and well - less fearful).
23946,"TO Sum: the following has occurred since moving back to the USA

1."
23947,"I moved to a very stressful environment that I have been trying to avoid for years (I will be moving away again in a month)
2."
23948,"I got off of a medication (Klonopin) only to be put on medication that made my symptoms worse..only to be put back on Klonopin
3."
23949,"I had Lyme

If you have read this far in...I am curious whether you feel that this anxiety is permanent."
23950,"I did not feel like this a year ago, and I don't know why I feel like this now."
23951,I am afraid that this anxiety will take up my life and prevent me from enjoying life while continuing my research as a PhD student.
23952,Some people have stated that the high stress environment that I am living now (which stirs old and bad memories) might be the root cause behind this new anxiety - combined with the Lyme.
23953,I am not sure.
23954,Has anyone experienced anything similar?
23955,Please help...I am truly confused and afraid of being well..permanently afraid.
23956,I'm not sure if this is just a really unstable time and therefore I'm more anxious or maybe my meds don't work as well?
23957,"I've done it briefly in the past, but have never been on the meds and talked to someone."
23958,"I don't want to be on these meds forever, but I can't function off of them at this point."
23959,I started taking Sertraline (Generic form of Zoloft) and Trazodone on May 3rd.
23960,The first two weeks were great.
23961,The Trazodone was prescribed for sleep and it worked amazingly.
23962,"I woke up feeling fantastic, even when my son woke me up about 5 times during the night."
23963,"Lately, it's all gone away."
23964,I feel exhausted when I wake up and it's very easy for me to slip into major depression.
23965,"Things I would normally be able to brush off, now through me into major crying fits."
23966,"Also, I have not seen any results with my anxiety (which was the reason I was prescribed these medications) and I'm wondering if Sertraline isn't right for me."
23967,It's only been a little over 2 weeks and I'm not sure if I should wait it out until I complete a full month or stop taking it.
23968,"Of course, these are things I would love to ask my doctor but he's on vacation."
23969,I would really appreciate some advice and thanks in advance!
23970,EDIT: I'm taking 50 mg of both medications.
23971,"Hello, I'm debating on taking anxiety medication."
23972,tdr; Would like to try anti-anxiety medication over the counter before going to family doctor to see if it helps and if I actually need it.
23973,"So, like the title says, I've been trying to get off of anti-depressants/anti-anxiety meds for nearly a year now."
23974,"My issue is that, on top of my thyroid meds I find that I need to drink 1-2 cups of coffee a day to stay awake properly, which causes my anxiety to kick into overdrive and I find myself worried, and nervous and all that fun stuff over nothing or tiny issues that normally I would just be mildly anxious about."
23975,"If so, did meds help?"
23976,"After I turned 21, maybe because I got on medication (Paxil) or maybe just by random chance my life began to change and I developed the social life I had always wanted."
23977,"In 5 years I've had 5 different doctors try to help, been on tons of different meds, including 4 this year, CBT with and without a doctor, other workbooks, mindfulness, exercise, breathing, etc."
23978,"I have no history of abuse or trauma in my childhood, except for a needle phobia which I am working on and recovering from, however slowly it may be going."
23979,There is no known family history of anxiety disorders.
23980,"Basically, I hit puberty at 13, and within weeks of starting my period, I was having severe panic attacks several nights each week."
23981,"Doctor diagnosed me with panic disorder, and a few years later, generalized anxiety disorder as well."
23982,"I have had a few bouts of depression since then, at age 17 and 19, and I took Zoloft for that, but it didn't seem to do much for the anxiety."
23983,I don't take any medication for anxiety other than propranolol for when I have to do class presentations - so maybe 2-3 times per year.
23984,I really have no desire to get on any medications if I can avoid them.
23985,"Currently I'm 21, and my anxiety has been extremely shitty for the last few weeks."
23986,"I always have a few more panic attacks for the month before school starts up again, but it has been so much worse this year and I do not feel stressed about anything at all that I can pinpoint."
23987,"I had some bloodwork done today and they will be checking my thyroid hormone levels as well as all the other basic stuff, but if that doesn't show anything weird then I really have no clue what's going on."
23988,"Regular exercise does not seem to help, and I eat a healthy diet with caffeine once or twice a month."
23989,"I was just hoping someone might have some information about possible causes of anxiety disorders, just to give me something to look at to see if there is anything I could have missed that might be related to my case."
23990,I have heard there was a genetic link for panic disorder but I have not seen any actual studies about it.
23991,**TL;DR - I'm looking for scientific literature or currently proposed/accepted theories pertaining to the causes of anxiety disorders in people with no past trauma.
23992,Can anyone help me out here?
23993,** Thanks :D
23994,"We go through these cycles of therapies and meds and fads and ideas, but we're only ever knocking the wind out of it for small periods, it's a losing battle."
23995,Also going to see the school psychiatrist to see if I can get medication that would help enough to make job hunting more doable.
23996,Yesterday evening it was apparent that my anxiety just isn't improving from medication; at least not to an extent that allows me to function normally and enjoy a healthy social life.
23997,"I am obsessively focusing on the possible negative side effects of his meds, and reading horror stories on the internet, and even though I know I SHOULD NOT, I can't stop myself."
23998,So my question is... is it ok to take this medication sporadically?
23999,I don't want to take medication.
24000,I ordered her some worming medicine off Amazon and ended up telling my parents about it so we could get her help.
24001,I suffer from chronic depression and have been fighting for the past few years to get the right balance of meds and therapy.
24002,"It's gotten much better, and my current meds (bupropion--generic welbutrin) has made me more confident and energetic, however it's come with crippling anxiety attacks."
24003,"So far we think it's the meds, because I have had 0 history of panic attacks before this."
24004,I had low vitamin D so that was partly the cause of the muscle weakness I am on meds for Vitamin d deficiency and while I am not as weak im still somewhat weak and still get jelly legs often especially now that I am home from school.
24005,"To talk about my anxiety, and ask about medication."
24006,"I want to go on medication, but I don't know what it will do to me."
24007,I'm afraid that anxiety medication will change who I am so much that she will leave me.
24008,TL;DR: I want to be a better person for the woman I love so I want to get some anxiety medication.
24009,"Anxiety people who are on meds, do you remember taking your first pill?"
24010,"•diagnosed with bipolar II and everything starts making sense
•adjust depression and anxiety meds."
24011,Any so proud or advice about using potentially habit forming medication regularly under doctor supervision to assuage the rest of the pain?
24012,"Due to my inconsistencies in taking my medication, I'm in withdrawal."
24013,I just thought I'd post this as a reminder to be diligent with taking your medication and working in therapy.
24014,"I know everyone is different and that meds and therapy are generally the best route, but is there any unique way YOU or someone you know has gotten over these attacks?"
24015,How long till the medicine has an effect?
24016,I've been getting treatment (meds &amp; therapy) for anxiety and depression for a few months now.
24017,I'm not sure what my intentions are with this post.
24018,"Maybe I need advice, or sympathy, or just a place to anonymously vent."
24019,I apologize in advance should I end up rambling incoherently.
24020,Take it as you will and respond accordingly.
24021,"I'm a 36 year old male, and I've been struggling with anxiety issues, as well as depression and possibly other undiagnosed problems, for quite some time."
24022,"My mind is a chaotic mess, thoughts always racing from one to another, completely out of my control."
24023,"No matter what I'm doing, I'm never completely there in the moment."
24024,Part of my mind is always off somewhere else worrying about a thousand other things.
24025,"It's distracting, stressful, and I feel like it's driving me crazy."
24026,And I don't know how to make it stop.
24027,"I can't tell if that's a symptom of anxiety, or a cause, but it seems to be one of the central points in all of my issues that I keep coming back to."
24028,A lot of my anxiety is also socially focused.
24029,Interacting with people that I don't know extremely well makes me extremely uncomfortable and awkward.
24030,"I don't have much of a social life, and it's causing me problems at work, not to mention feelings of loneliness and isolation."
24031,"I've been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for almost two years, and I've been on more medications than I can remember, yet I've continued to slowly get worse the entire time."
24032,I'm currently prescribed Ativan and Adderall.
24033,"They seem to help suppress the symptoms to a level where I can drag myself through another day, but they aren't helping me get better or slowing the decline of my mental state."
24034,I'm so tired of feeling like this.
24035,I think about killing myself all the time.
24036,"I'm not at risk of actually doing it, yet, but I feel like that's where I'm headed if something doesn't change, and I'm at a complete loss of how to change it."
24037,"It seems like I'm fighting a losing battle, and more and more frequently I get the feeling that it's just not worth fighting anymore."
24038,"No medication at moment, none has ever helped."
24039,I stumbled upon this subreddit on my search online for help with anxiety/panic attack disorders.
24040,"I first would like to say, this is an amazing place as I've already read through a few of the latest posts and the community at large seems very friendly."
24041,"I'm hoping for some help, and I will tell my story in hopes somebody out there can help me cope with my anxiety and panic attack issues."
24042,"I'm 28 years old, former Navy, on a medical discharge back in 2007 due to anxiety/panic attacks.."
24043,"I have suffered from severe anxiety for roughly 8 years now, the onset of which happened when I was married."
24044,During the Navy I was put on a multitude of different medications but for the last 5 years have been on 0.5mg of Klonopin.
24045,"To be honest, it only helps ""chill"" me out and also has become a sleep aid more than anything."
24046,I still get severe panic attacks even on this medication.
24047,"I've been divorced for two years, without getting overly detailed about her, she was a horrible person who destroyed my credit, cheated and lied like it was no issue."
24048,This of course only led to further my issue.
24049,"I currently live alone with my children, as a single father of two young kids (Boy &amp; Girl)."
24050,"I get a generalized anxiety on and off throughout the day, and when having conversation with people my face can get bright red for no reason whatsoever."
24051,"I get very shaky, sweaty and the whole onset toward panic then begins."
24052,"When I get into full panic mode, my brain is on overload."
24053,"Body goes numb, I feel like I'm going to die, I have in fact even called 911 a few times because I thought I was going to have a heart attack."
24054,"EKG's always came back ok, and physically they said I was fine, other than at the time of going to the Dr my pulse rate would be elevated and such."
24055,"At times this disorder is so difficult for me to cope with, especially when a lot of people just dont understand and think you're paranoid."
24056,"Aside from medications, what else can I do?"
24057,"Nothing really helps, sometimes I will watch my favorite sitcoms or shows that bring back happy memories to help soothe or calm myself."
24058,Some music also helps at times as well..
24059,"I just have ran out of ideas, how do I cure this devil of a disorder?"
24060,Thank you for reading!
24061,"If you have further questions about my particular situation feel free to ask, I may have rambled a bit but this is very important to me."
24062,Just wondering if anyone has taken this medication and what I should expect.
24063,Does anyone have any positive things to say about this medication?
24064,"Anyway, we have adjusted my meds."
24065,"But, their goal is to get me away from the ""rescue"" meds."
24066,I don't think this doc is good at adjusting meds.
24067,"I've had horrible anxiety for the past 10 years or so, on and off different medications."
24068,"I'm currently taking Pristiq, and it seems to help, but I still get very nervous in any public or social situation, usually causing my face to sweat and therefore severely increase my anxiety even more to the point were I just want to disappear."
24069,I decided not to finish college and work the trades because I couldn't handle the daily anxiety of so many people and interactions at school.
24070,"I have no clue how I'm going to go to school for my current job which I need to complete a 4 year apprenticeship, not to mention I have to do the schooling in another city 1 and a half hours away."
24071,I just wanted to get some of this off my chest since its hard to talk to someone about it in person.
24072,Please share your experience with what has worked to calm your anxiety
24073,Hoping the meds help with this...
24074,"I'm in the middle of a medication transition right now (six months of trying to find something that will work again), I'm 27 and I live at home with my parents due to anxiety and a chronic illness, my parents (mom and step-dad) are separating/divorcing but we all have to live in this house until September, my mom has a boyfriend in Turkey and is talking about moving there eventually, I haven't had friends that aren't exclusively online friends since high school because of isolation from the illness and from my anxiety, and I feel like my world is blowing up in my face and I have no one to talk to."
24075,"Also, I'm 17, Female, no medication, no previous history of any serious medical conditions =P 

Thanks for reading my wall of text!"
24076,I must have made a bad impression because he pretty much told me there was no point in talking unless I took his expensive meds (Pristiq).
24077,"Granted it doesn't always work, especially when I'm having a conversation with someone etc but as far as walking around in the grocery store, getting meds, whatever it is, the hair helps me."
24078,"So after a rough six months of panic attacks,anxiety,therapy,doctors and trying different meds I'm on a low dose of klodapin 0.5mg half pills twice a day and 10mg of paxil."
24079,While im feeling good because of these meds is there anything I do besides take more meds to get back to my normal self.
24080,I'm at a point where I understand my anxiety is caused by stress at work and on the homefront and I want to make a good life change but I dont want to make that change with just medication.
24081,"I am also a recovering addict, so I try to stay away from anti-anxiety meds (I smoked pot for a few years, but now I am off of that too)."
24082,My parents made me feel guilty about how expensive all my meds are.
24083,How do I deal with the knowledge of how expensive my meds are ?
24084,I'm in and out of drs and trying out meds and see if one can fit with me as I keep getting some more severe side effects on ssri
24085,Has anyone else noticed increased dream recollection since starting anxiety medication?
24086,I have finally decided to get medication.
24087,"I have not explicitly asked her for another anxiety medication (currently taking 50 mg Vistaril/Hydroxyzine as needed--for me, it does nothing), although she is well aware of the frequency of my panic attacks."
24088,On and off meds (currently off) and just gaining a better understanding of what this is and how to keep it at bay.
24089,"He mentioned he has somewhat of the same issue but to a lesser degree of public speaking, and that his own son is a bit worse off than myself with multiple meds."
24090,Basically the guy is dealing with a wife in depression who continues to occasionally try and ween herself off of medication without doctor/therapist interaction.
24091,Ive been trying to get treated for severe anxiety and depression for about 5 years now.
24092,"I have been on a bunch of different meds (welbutrin, paxil, prozac, etc)."
24093,"Last time I went to the Dr, she prescribed me Welbutrin and Buspar."
24094,Ive been taking it for about a year with minimal anxiety relief.
24095,"So I went to the same Dr office recently, and my Dr was not working there anymore."
24096,The main guy (guy with his name on the front door) met with me.
24097,"When I told him what I was on, he laughed."
24098,Laughed!
24099,He rolled his eyes and talked about how bad of an employee my last Dr was and that she should have never prescribed those meds for me with my symptoms.
24100,He asked if they were working and I said the truth- minimally.
24101,I could go to work and talk to people without my hands shaking and my face turning red and me getting dizzy.
24102,But I was  (and AM) suffering from severe anxiety.
24103,"He just wrote me a prescription for the same thing I was on and said ""make an appointment for 3 months""."
24104,I thought I was gonna cry.
24105,This is so frustrating.
24106,Ive tried to get a new Dr but no one in the area is accepting new patients.
24107,Im going to talk to my General Doctor about it.
24108,I just dont know what to do!
24109,I feel so defeated.
24110,*Update: I went to my GP and he said to not worry about that Dr telling me I was on the wrong meds.
24111,"He said if its working a little bit, that's good."
24112,"He said instead of giving me a referral to a Psychiatrist, he would just administer my medications since I don't do counseling."
24113,"Also, he gave me an Rx for Xanax for my ""bad days""."
24114,So now I don't have to pay the higher copay and my totally awesome GP has saved me from the tortures of finding a new Psychiatrist I like.
24115,Go Dr Pareek!
24116,So I ran out of my anxiety meds on Saturday.
24117,"Bad thing is with no meds until I get a refill from my doc, I have no hammer to beat the anxiety back, and none of my other methods of dealing with it are working except...

Alcohol."
24118,"I currently do not take any medication, haven't for 6 years or so."
24119,"Hi, I am a 22 year old female who has learned to control my anxiety."
24120,"After stumbling upon this subreddit, I really want to share how I was able to get myself under control so that I could live normally again."
24121,I really feel for all of those who are struggling and want to help in any way I can.
24122,"These are the three things that have helped me:
1."
24123,I first stumbled upon anxiety when I was 17.
24124,"I had constant panic attacks, got no sleep, couldn't go to school, my life was falling apart."
24125,"This stemmed from my friends thinking I would be crazy, the sudden panic of finding a perfect college and being forced to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, moving away from home, and death."
24126,"I had heard medications could help me but as a healthy, active 17 year old athlete, I hated the idea of medication."
24127,"My mother had convinced me to talk to a doctor, that he wouldn't force me to do anything I didn't to do."
24128,This was my first step.
24129,I talked to the doctor and of course he suggested medicating me.
24130,Is this addictive?
24131,can I stop using it whenever I want?
24132,Is this going to affect me mentally?
24133,"These were all the questions I had and they were answered; no, certain medications are not addictive, I can stop, and it won't do anything to me mentally besides halt my anxiety."
24134,"He told me to try a sample, if I didn't like it, I could stop but just take it for three days."
24135,Three days later I felt great.
24136,"A new person, waves of anxiety stopped, I could interact again."
24137,2.
24138,"Although my medication helped me with the sudden random panic attacks and constant anxious feeling, certain topics would still stress me out and flare my anxiety up."
24139,One of these topics was death: I had just put it in the back of my mind to deal with later but that only made it amplify.
24140,While in college I had to fulfill some core class requirements one of which was diversity.
24141,"I took a religions class for this just because it sounded somewhat interesting (and I did get made fun of by some friends, but whatever, right?)."
24142,"I didn't meant to take anything from that class, but learning about buddhism, daoism, and others of the like, my entire perspective of life began to change."
24143,"I took another class focusing on asian religions where we read books by these people (Diamond Sutre and Wandering the way most notable) and I was able to grasp a firm, spiritual control of myself and learned to control my body."
24144,This calmed me down greatly and I no longer have any concerns with death.
24145,3.
24146,"School still stressed me the hell out: I was a junior, trying to graduate in one of the hardest majors."
24147,"I like free credits, we have physical activity courses that give you this so I thought what the hell, took yoga and pilates."
24148,I gained more from these than I thought possible; learning awareness of your body really helps you deal with stress.
24149,I personally enjoyed pilates more (it is very strong with breathing exercise and gives you the best ab workout ever) but they both dealt with the idea of your body being only yours.
24150,I learned many destressing techniques and it was a great release for end of day classes with midterm exams.
24151,"I learned to control my heart rate, close my eyes, and just release my stress and live in the here and now when I get too stressed out."
24152,I do this when I feel a stress induced panic attack coming on.
24153,"Buddhism texts may have helped me a bit with this, but I really realized myself through these silly classes and have been going strong ever since."
24154,I did have full support from both of my parents this entire time and I never did have to see a psychologist for this.
24155,"But I found my way through this difficulty and realize that living with anxiety isn't something I can just throw away, you have to learn to live with it and control it."
24156,"Humans are facing far more stress in this new technological age (with having to stress about decisions for college, making decisions that effect the rest of your life, job ops, etc.)"
24157,and we didn't all adapt to deal with this properly.
24158,Its nothing you need to feel too hindered by and remember there are always people trying to overcome it :) Don't feel afraid to ask for help!
24159,I would like to note: Almost no one knows about my anxiety.
24160,I tell no one that I have a strong spiritual side (because that sounds a bit silly) and I never really encourage it unless someone has problems with anxiety.
24161,"People know that I am a little athletic, but I have it so under control that people ask me ""Don't you ever get nervous in a large crowd like this?"
24162,"You are really outgoing"" I just smile :) I just didn't want to sound like a religious nut!"
24163,~
24164,"Last two days, with the thoughts of losing the battle to the pain meds went fantastic."
24165,"TL:DR - had high motivation, started getting a bit of anxiety, led to full blown GAD and likely hypochondria, been against taking meds for it as I feel its admitting defeat."
24166,He gave me a prescription to a low-dose anxiety medication which I STRICTLY use for on-set anxiety attacks.
24167,"I was diagnosed with GAD and trichtillomania caused by the GAD, and I decided that I did not want to go on a medication."
24168,I was wondering if there is anyone (preferably in the UK) who has been prescribed meds for their anxiety and if it has to be formally diagnosed and how they went about getting a prescription.
24169,"I don't want to go to another doctor, explain my entire story again, and take something for a few weeks until my doctor comes back and then have her change that medication."
24170,"For the better part of the past fifteen years, I've been taking meds &amp; seeing counselors to deal with my generalized anxiety disorder, specifically panic attacks."
24171,I've been off of meds for over two years &amp; have not had a panic attack in a very long time.
24172,I don't take anxiety meds.
24173,I am now with out anxiety medicine for almost 3 weeks now And I am a mess.
24174,Also I'm having horrendous and vivid nightmares as a side effect of withdrawing from some meds I am on.
24175,"The meds I was prescribed when it started to get bad made me unmotivated and suicidal after a while, so I got off of them."
24176,"I am soooo nervous to change meds again, because I had a few weeks of a REALLY positive experience with Paxil."
24177,I got prescribed Celexa and xanax today and after a long day of anxiety about taking meds I finally gave in and took half a tablet of Celexa and .25mg of alprazolam.
24178,"Idk how to explain it, has anyone else felt this way when they got temporary relief from meds?"
24179,"I've never been to this sub, but after a search led me to you...here goes:

my friend suffers from GAD, and is currently in the process of adjusting to new medication, which as you may know, can be pretty tough."
24180,I am probably about 60 to 70% of where I was before the medication.
24181,My body is apparently getting used to this medication!
24182,I've finally got to a point where I'm mostly anxiety free without the use of medication and it's scary watching myself spiral over something as silly as naked pictures of women on the internet.
24183,"Finally after over a year now on solid meds , and my family and friends being the most helpful ever, I have done more in 30 days then I have in 5 years."
24184,"I'd almost prefer a low dosage of some sort of medication to keep this in check as opposed to just being told to ""go see a therapist"", mostly because I'm afraid having that on my medical history could affect my firearm ownership or my chances of getting on a paid department."
24185,It has taken almost three years for me to admit that I needed to get on medication full time.
24186,Getting onto the medication was taxing and I felt like a zombie while I was on it.
24187,"When I decided to cold-turkey the meds, I was sick for about two weeks."
24188,I am so glad I admitted I needed some help and I don't plan to get off these meds anytime soon.
24189,I hope that anyone out there that is debating if they should or should not should know that there are so many different doctors out there and that there isn't just one medication for you.
24190,"You would take antibiotics if you had an infection, so why not take anxiety medication for your anxiety?"
24191,"Never took medication for the anxiety, but I was on zoloft for about 3 years for depression; I just got off the zoloft this past summer and I feel great other than having slight seasonal affective disorder symptoms from November-December."
24192,I'm really excited about it and I hope it will help; my first presentation is this coming Thursday and I feel like I'll actually break down and cry from sheer joy after the speech if the meds help.
24193,"I know I need to get back on medication to get this under control, but my last psychiatrist I was seeing last year was terrible and I haven't been able to bring myself to find a new one."
24194,"It's helped with the anxiety, but now I think I'm feeling more of the depression, which is what led me to try the meds in the first place."
24195,You don't magically get cured once you take meds or take to a mental health professional.
24196,Anxiety causes me to be afraid of going to the doctor to get meds.
24197,"I don't want to talk to a therapist, I just want meds that will take away the constant fear and anxiousness so I can finally make it over the hurtle of talking to people who have always known me as someone who doesn't talk."
24198,I was given some heart medication to slow my heart rate down.
24199,Am I going to need medication for this?
24200,Long story short im going to see the doctor sometime this week and im probably going to get prescribed some sort of anxiety medicine.
24201,I've been on different types of meds over the years.
24202,"I'm not currently on meds or receiving any assistance, though I'm about to go register with the doctors."
24203,"I'm not interested in taking medication day to day, taking something specifically for this ""event"" may be an option, but I'm a little worried about functioning before and after the flight."
24204,"What kinds of medication might help, should is it normal to ""dry run"" a drug I'm prescribed so I know how it will affect me if I can't really test the stressor?"
24205,if a medication is the answer of course.
24206,"I'd like to try to do self improvement on this over getting anti anxiety meds, but I'm not sure where to start or what I can do."
24207,"I've run the SSRI and mood stabilizer gauntlet, tried pretty much everything after years of being stubbornly against medication under the premise that I was ""strong enough"" to cope and deal with it myself... but nothing worked, many just made it worse."
24208,I couldn't keep track of my meds.
24209,"You try keeping track of that when they give you a prescription of 120 at a time...

Long story short, I have always had difficulty keeping track of these meds and have had a history of having to call in refills a *little* later than I ""should"" have."
24210,I figured it would be better than dealing with being accused of drug-seeking/distributing and booted out of the Medical Center when I was trying to get the medicine they made me dependent on.
24211,"For 3 months following my withdrawal last January, I was off meds completely."
24212,"It's making me more panicky, more anxious, more paranoid **and NOW** I have barely enough meds to deal with a problem that they made about 20x worse."
24213,I've considered just buying the meds off the street.
24214,"Let them waste their resources on a fucking agoraphobe that rarely leaves his house and lives with his parents, **anything** to exonerate me and allow me to actually get the medicine I currently need."
24215,Does anyone else experience these?
24216,I know they're not real seizures or else I'd be suffering some major consciences.
24217,"What I mean by this:

That feeling you get as you're half asleep and you think about tripping... that times about 100 without thinking about anything."
24218,"I'll be laying there drifting to sleep, thinking about absolutely nothing and then BAM my entire body jolts so hard that I sit straight up in about .5 seconds, it feels like someone just electrocuted me."
24219,Pulse skyrockets.
24220,This will happen over and over for an hour or two nightly.
24221,"I'm on medications for nightmares and hyper-alertness because of this, which seemed to have helped in the beginning but it becoming less effective now."
24222,The doctors and nurses I've explained this to say it sounds like a seizure but I would basically be brain dead the next day if that were the case.
24223,So far none have said I should do a sleep study.
24224,"They're happening so often now that I'm almost afraid to go to bed, which of course makes them worse."
24225,"Naturally, being anxious makes it very difficult to see a doctor (what if he thinks down on me, what if he tells someone I know and they pity me or think I'm weird, what if he gives me meds that make things worse, what if the meds make me an emotional zombie without me realizing it due to the comfort of not feeling anxiety and then proceeding to live my life as an emotional zombie, what if im not infact anxious and i end up on meds)."
24226,"I was on meds from the time I was 13 until I was 17, I ended up being on 250mg of zoloft a day and knowing nothing about how to come off medication I just stopped taking it, then the downward spiral came and I some how developed agoraphobia."
24227,"Ok so sorry, I know the title isn't super well worded."
24228,"Basically, I have a broad array of mental issues (depression, anxiety, OCD, and what my psychiatrist has called ""a sprinkling of everything else"")."
24229,Sometimes I will have to change medicines or periods of time will just be worse than others for awhile.
24230,"Not like days that are rougher than others (although that happens too), but periods of a month or more where things are worse."
24231,This leads to daily arguments with my SO (together about 2 years and living together).
24232,I'm trying to do everything I can to address it and be better about vocalizing things or heading off some of it by talking about it.
24233,"I'm trying to communicate well and all of the shit I'm supposed to be doing, but sometimes it gets so bad that the part of your brain that tells you to do those things just shuts off."
24234,"It was described to me as ""it's like if you had to consciously be telling your body to pump blood and breathe and all that""."
24235,It is like that.
24236,"There's so much rational stuff that seems so easy for normal people and is even easy for me when my mental health is more on track, but sometimes it just doesn't come together."
24237,"We talk about it a lot and have addressed anything we can both be doing to better the situation, but I know it's exhausting for him."
24238,"He's really understanding about it for the most part, but I can see how tiring it is to have to have lengthy conversations about why I feel like he's mad at me because he was slightly annoyed for a second when I stepped on the back of his shoe."
24239,"To be honest, it's not fun for me either."
24240,I hate being this way and it makes me feel actually crazy.
24241,"It has gotten to the point that I wonder about the honest likelihood that we can maintain a long term relationship in terms of like ""settling down"" or whatever because this is just pretty intolerable."
24242,It has also started me on a path of worrying about if a) I'll ever find someone who can truly be 100% ok with all of this and b) if I am even well equipped enough to do things like be a part of a marriage or have children.
24243,The whole thing just has my head spinning and I wanted to know if anyone out there had a similar situation or knows of good ways to deal with this.
24244,"I don't really want like a bunch of insults attacking my SO either, because that isn't particularly helpful, but really anything else would be great."
24245,Thanks!
24246,Since trying meds none of seemed to really make a big change in my anxiety either.
24247,Or have I just not found the medication that is right for me?
24248,"Helloooo, so I have always thought i've had some kind of anxiety disorder but never really went and was tested for it, though I am diagnosed and perscribed medicine for my ADD."
24249,"I think I am also a hypocondriac so, when I take meds, my mind flies."
24250,"How do I make him understand that when I get like that (which isn't often anymore thanks to a cocktail of medication and my own techniques for diffusing my anxiety during a situation), that I don't want to talk and I want to be left alone and it is unfair to me that he expects me to just get up and get over it (which I do more than he does when it comes to keeping my problems away from my daughter)."
24251,I've been taking some medication (sertraline) for the first time for 3 weeks now.
24252,"Also, what other long-term meds are people taking?"
24253,"I look at this subreddit, and google searches, and the stuff/medicine out there for all of us, and it kind of pisses me off that people are making so much money off of us."
24254,I stopped taking my meds like a week ago because the side-effects were getting to be too much to handle.
24255,I haven't built up the courage to call and set an appointment with my doctor to see about trying new medication because along with the side-effects that were bothering me I don't feel like they were helping with my anxiety.
24256,"If I take anymore of my meds, I'm pretty sure I will fall asleep from them."
24257,My weight was all the way down to 90lbs and I some how pulled myself out with no appointments or meds.
24258,I've been successfully treated for my bipolar disorder with Lamictal 200mg daily during this time and have responded well to the medication.
24259,"I’ve considered trying a benzo or getting on an anti-anxiety medication, but I also want to be able to have a few drinks on my wedding day."
24260,But if I’m on a meds I don’t want to mix drinks and turn into a lunatic!
24261,Any certain types of meds to try out or stay away from?
24262,"I'd like medication for my anxiety, I tried Xanax, but I have the paradoxical disinhibition effect when I take benzodiazepines."
24263,Does anybody else know of a good anxiolytic/anti-psychotic medication that could treat my anxiety but let me stay awake?
24264,"I don't smoke and rarely drink but I did bite my nails which turned into biting my knuckles :( 

Never been on medication or seen a doctor for it I just thought it'd get better but a friend showed me this subreddit and yeah /r/skincareaddiction helped with my bad acne so maybe someone here could help me out with my anxiety."
24265,In high school I was treated for depression and anxiety and after about a year of taking the medicine I stopped taking it on my own.
24266,"I'm currently seeing a psychologist for therapy and a psychiatrist for meds, both of which think the best course of action is exposures, exposures, exposures."
24267,What meds have helped for you?
24268,Have you turned to stomach meds instead to help your anxiety?
24269,Does anyone else take this medication for insomnia?
24270,I have had anxiety around people my whole life.
24271,Wasn't too bad until middle school where I went to a huge school and just shelled up.
24272,I am 27 now.
24273,I made it though high school and college and made a few friends but was a bundle of nerves the whole time.
24274,It is so tiring when things as basic as getting a haircut or going to the grocery store cause panic.
24275,My dating life and friendships have suffered.
24276,Long story short I had a 2 month period of unemployment between my old job and one I am just about to start.
24277,I really shut down and almost stopped leaving the house in this time.
24278,The more I am around people the more I can cope and after being a virtual hermit for 2 months I am worried about being relaxed enough for job interviews and working with new people.
24279,I am also about to move which gives me anxiety.
24280,"I eat pretty good, 80% vegetarian, exercise, and meditated and sit with a group."
24281,I am pretty closed minded to anxiety medications because I was on then in my teens and lead to a manic episode.
24282,I take a few supplements but don't get any real relief.
24283,I came across an old picture of me on FB yesterday from about 4 years ago.
24284,"I was smiling easily in a group of people, and looking at it I realized I haven't smiled like that or felt genuinely happy in at least 2 years."
24285,"If you meet me today I probably come off more depressed and emotionally flat then anxious, but thats my coping mechanism."
24286,Thanks for reading!
24287,Any help would be great.
24288,"Now I'm in therapy and taking medication, but I still feel totally incapable of making friends."
24289,I adjusted my asthma meds and voila - I'm sleeping s ton better and waking up refreshed.
24290,"I was on meds for a few months a couple of years ago and they worked wonders, but I got off because of pressure from my parents."
24291,"Please, no negative comments about how meds don't solve everything and the withdrawals are awful, because I'm very aware of both."
24292,"I tell people that I have an anxiety disorder, that something they're saying/doing is giving me anxiety, that I take medication."
24293,I feel i should stop taking the meds.
24294,these meds also have withdrawal symptoms so you have to keep taking them.
24295,I'd like to know about wellbutrin and what side effects you have on ssri's and how you deal with them and if your meds are helping.
24296,I'm not on any medicine right now.
24297,They said I had to have at least 4 visits with my counselor before I could see the doctor and get medicine.
24298,"It's only been a couple weeks, and I haven't decided if medication is the right path for me."
24299,When we fought we would say we loved each other even when we went to bed mad and days before he started the medication he told me he loved me more than anything and appreciated me so much for being such a support system in his life.
24300,When I told him the drugs were affecting him he refused to believe me but I'm convinced its he medication because he's never been a good liar and I know he wasn't feeling distant from me before he started the medication.
24301,"Now, I've been off and on medication and in and out of psychiatrist offices in my career of suffering with OCD, but I've been without meds for a long time and thought I was stable."
24302,My experience with meds hasn't been a bad one.
24303,So we'll guess this is all just in panic attack mode because I'm in one.
24304,"This isn't  my normal state of mind, but the general unease you are about to feel is usually present."
24305,I don't believe doctors diagnosis.
24306,"Well, it's not only that I distrust the information they're giving me so much as it is that maybe they missed something, or didn't get something right."
24307,We'll chalk it up to human error and move on.
24308,So It's 3:24AM and I'm noticing a few things.
24309,1)  I'm not asleep.
24310,2)  My body feels odd.
24311,I could list but that would be a lot.
24312,"Panic this, that, yadda yadda."
24313,I dislike anxiety medications because I believe my brain becomes dependent on them to work out the panic situations and deteriorates my ability to logically remove myself from the situation.
24314,I was given 15 klonopin by the ER a few weeks ago.
24315,"I took these and they are no longer with me (it sounds like a person died, doesn't it?)"
24316,I see a therapist regularly.
24317,"I am switching therpaists because my old therapist moved to a less than convenient location, and I'm seeing a doctor for psychiatric medications on Friday."
24318,I do not want  to be on them.
24319,I could list a million more reasons why I do not want to be.
24320,I have / am accepting the fact that I am too panicked over health and life in general + too depressed at times to not be on medication right now.
24321,I can live with that.
24322,What I don't like living with is my mind.
24323,I have read up on many panic books and materials.
24324,"I have read a lot of zen philosophy, which I think helps me immensely."
24325,I consider this part of me a part I should be able to pick up and put down in my head.
24326,"I can pick the anxiety up and roll it around through the thought process for a little way, or I can put it down on the table and watch it and see how it goes."
24327,This is the latter.
24328,"I don't know what this is a rant about, or what I need help with."
24329,I just know that this stuff pisses me off because it takes up a lot of my mental energy (I'm looking toward you health anxiety and toward you self acceptance) admitting that I am pissed off and I do need help and neither are bad things and are perfectly okay.
24330,I do not like living with anxiety.
24331,I live with it.
24332,It doesn't live with me.
24333,This is a huge problem.
24334,I have anxiety.
24335,It does not have me.
24336,"I need to switch my thought process around like that so I can have control of it once again, but it's a lot easier for me to grasp that on paper than it is mentally."
24337,"So, help me..  how do you do this?"
24338," I'm a student in nursing school, and sometimes, it gets really stressful."
24339,"Most days I can handle the stress, by breathing, or working out."
24340,"I've given up coffee, I try to eat right."
24341,"But sometimes the stress is just a little too much and I end up shaking, sweating, and feeling ""not quite right""."
24342,"I can try to work through it, sometimes I do."
24343,"The problem is, sometimes I don't and nursing school is just going to get harder from here."
24344,It's the sweating that really gets me.
24345,"I notice it, and that makes me self-conscious, which makes me sweat more..."
24346,I continue down this path until my hands shake and I need to step outside.
24347,I'd like to talk to someone about medications to keep this at bay while I go through school.
24348,My insurance situation is kinda crap right now.
24349,"I have insurance through the VA, but that is a mess, so I'd like to avoid using them, if I can."
24350,"If I can talk to someone and pay for meds out of pocket, that would be easier."
24351,I recognize that no one is going to want to give me meds and just send me on my way... and I'm fine with that.
24352,I'm 100% okay with the idea of working with someone... but I need to find a way to cut this shakyhand/sweating problem ASAP.
24353,Is there a way I can talk to someone without using my VA health insurance?
24354,How do I find someone who will let me pay out of pocket.
24355,How do I approach the topic of medication?
24356,**TL;DR** How hard is it to talk to medical professional about my anxiety issues without using health insurance?
24357,Who can I talk to about it?
24358,"My backstory: I've been depressed and anxious as far as I can remember, last year finally got on some medication that worked really well killing my then near daily panic attacks."
24359,"Only, I've now managed to triple the dosage on my meds over the past year to keep the anxiety off, and has in general done nothing for the depression."
24360,"The first couple of weeks I was on Xanax, I felt no difference and had anxiety like I had never even taken the medicine."
24361,I am proud of myself...the medicine I am taking is helping me to see I can't run from all of my problems.
24362,"Honestly my SO and I have been having weird arguments about nothing, and she says she's positive it's the new medication, and if so, I'm not sure I want to stay on it."
24363,"He has been taking this medicine for about a week now, and he keeps telling me that it typically takes up to 6 weeks to adjust to a new medication..... And I'm adjusting to it just as much as he is, if not more so."
24364,"I know that it's really not his fault and he was prescribed this medicine from his psychiatrist, but i think it would be in his best interest if he were to get off of the medicine before he gets addicted to it (as it is highly addictive) and ends up depending on the medicine to control his minor anxiety, instead of trying to  take his own actions and procedures to control his anxious behavior."
24365,"To be completely honest, I would rather have my boyfriend be himself with minor anxiety, rather than continue this medication and act so differently."
24366,I've been on meds for over a year now and I still feel like crap and like I can't handle anything.
24367,I've switched meds twice and got my dosage upped twice.
24368,"I am taking meds, and just started my fourth kind in as many months, so my body is still adjusting."
24369,"Ive been to therapy, taken meds, read a bunch of self-help/anxiety/confidence stuff, and the conclusion is, I still feel like shit."
24370,"He's not on any medication, he's convinced all his anxiety/depression stems from withdrawal from being on klonopin for a little while, and he's not seeking therapy."
24371,I keep trying to remind myself that the transition from meds is part of the issue and it will soon even out... but I just am not coping well at all.
24372,And please don't direct me to any medicine or drugs.
24373,"I'm 16, a junior in high school, and I have ADHD - Inattentive (professionally diagnosed) and suffer from anxiety attacks."
24374,"I have a panic attack at least every 2-3 weeks, however, when my stress level is higher, they become much more frequent and problematic."
24375,"To the point where it interferes with how I function day-to-day (work, school, sleep, etc.)"
24376,I've told my mom but she doesn't believe me just because I haven't had a seriously traumatic experience.
24377,She humors me and tries to help.
24378,She's pretty granola so her help pretty much involves therapy and holistic medicine.
24379,"I have tried every herbal tea, supplement, and diet/exercise routine under the sun."
24380,"She claims my anxiety and ADHD are because I have to much gluten, sugar, and carbs in my life."
24381,"Not to mention, she is very against ""Big Pharma prescribing medicines people don't need"", I'm barely allowed to take my ADHD medication as it's always an argument when I need to get my prescription re-filled."
24382,Anyways my question is: how can I go about scheduling an appointment with my doctor without my parents knowing.
24383,"Should they prescribe me something at that appointment that I decide to take, is there any way to get that scrip filled without my parents knowledge and consent?"
24384,"I live in Colorado and, despite the research I've done, I can't find any answers on laws regarding these questions."
24385,I didn't have anxiety so much anymore but my doctor said it would be good to take medication ''just in case''.
24386,Should I change my medication?
24387,"Just the other night I had my first panic attack (even though it was mild), since starting my medication."
24388,What kind of things could I try to calm down until I get on meds?
24389,It feels like I'm going back to how I was before meds.
24390,Somehow my dad pretty much convinced the doctor that it was a stomach problem and probably due to my acne medication.
24391,So the doctor said he would switch my acne medication and see what happens.
24392,I always  obsessively research every medicine I take and always end up in a panic over it.
24393,The school made my sister put him on medication.
24394,"Other information: I'm on my period and two days ago, I had too much to drink at a party (first time drinking on my meds)."
24395,Does anyone have any ideas to help with the side effects of not having my medicine?
24396,"I'm okay with it now, because I know what's cussing it and it's not too bothersome, but my question is will this go away, or should I start looking for other meds?"
24397,"I quickly made an appointment with a psychiatrist and counselor, and was put on a low dose of meds."
24398,"After a couple of weeks, I started feeling even more anxious, so I decided to stop taking them (I've always been skeptical of medication, so that didn't help)."
24399,"Like I used to be on meds for it but, I got off of all of my meds, and I get anxiety attacks from everything now."
24400,My life is being overcome by this monstrous anxiety and I don't know what to do and I can't get on meds anymore.
24401,"She hadn't had an anxiety attack for about a month, she was off her medicine."
24402,"How do I get her to understand my severe anxiety/depression is a physical disorder, not something that can be fixed without medication."
24403,my friend has severe anxiety that he takes medication for and goes to therapy for.
24404,"I was taking the off-brand of Celexa, but Halloween weekend I was out of town for 4 days and I forgot my medicine, so I was off of it."
24405,"Once I got back I took 2 days worth of the medicine (over two days, not all at once) but I haven't take it in 2 or 3 days."
24406,"Is there anyway I can significantly lower my anxiety both now, and in the long run, besides taking my medicine."
24407,"I'm not worried they're thinking that I'm abusing my medication, I'm worried they're seeing all my medication and drawing a (probably correct) conclusion about how messed up I really am."
24408,"Does anyone have any advice about the medication or anything really, be it college or ways of dealing with anxiety?"
24409,"I'd rather die slow and ignorant than have to freak out and take medication every morning to remind myself my body's slowly shutting down and I'm dying, all the while working at some dead end job with no pay raise in 4 years and increasing costs of benefits (Which would be the only thing keeping me alive at that point."
24410,I'm also really concerned that I may have to be put on a new medication.
24411,"Sorry for ranting, I'm just excited to be getting off of this medication!"
24412,"I do not currently have a psychiatrist, because before the marijuana panic attack happened, I was doing great and looking to get off meds all together."
24413,"[long and boring story alert]

[it's probably not worth the read, I just wanted to vent but this wouldn't feel right without giving you any background]

I was born in a lower-middle class family in a poor Eastern European country and my dad hadn't been getting along too well with my mom for as long as I can remember."
24414,"He was binge drinking up until I was 5 or so (I can hardly remember anything from back then, but the bits and pieces of my memory suggest that he was beating my mom and emotionally abusing both of us)."
24415,"Eventually he managed to curb his drinking habits, but his attitude towards us essentially stayed the same."
24416,"My mom, a caring woman of a rather traditional upbringing, was madly in love with him so she's been putting up with his ""little quirks"" up until I was 6."
24417,"I had to go through a painful operation which turned out to be a huge physical/social setback and a major source of bullying later on, and apart from that she found out that dad started cheating on her up to the point of having a child with a different woman; it's easy to imagine that it rendered their marriage unbearable."
24418,"This made my mother switch her entire focus to me, the embodiment of her hopes and dreams (which only made my father more furious): mom stopped buying anything that would make our flat a nicer place to live in and everyone became careless up to the point of not washing the dishes properly."
24419,"Mom wanted to secure a chance for me to get out of this mess (and as ungrateful as that might sound, she invested herself a bit too heavily in my material well-being and too little in helping me become a well-adjusted child); her expectations skyrocketed, she didn't want to get a divorce with my dad because that would mean having to sell the apartment, and... yeah, that's pretty much it."
24420,"I had to endure 10 more years of occasional arguments, screams and being guilt tripped for not being masculine/friendly/caring/persistent enough in my studies (every achievement of mine eventually became treated as a norm)."
24421,"I used to cry at primary and middle school every now and then because of the bullying, but to be honest neither the bullying nor my father's overall nastiness were too serious - I was probably overreacting all the time."
24422,My mom explained every instance of bullying by saying that my classmates envied me (and I bet you see where this is going: I started believing that I have to desensitize myself completely and work even harder to achieve any sense of self-worth).
24423,"After becoming one of the best students in the entire city I started burning out and my everlasting enthusiasm (hell, I was a walking encyclopedia back when I was a child and I actually enjoyed it) and curiosity for knowledge turned into a weird compulsion."
24424,I could never focus on the tasks at hand and instead I either drowned myself in MMOs or had been procrastinating in the worst ways imaginable (/b/ with its zealous glorification of nihilism turned me into an irredeemable douchebag).
24425,"I had an emotional (or in fact any kind of) maturity of a little child: I was **extremely** clingy, anxious, moody, hedonistic and spineless (these qualities keep haunting me to this day, and it looks like my personality is just a huge mish-mash of flaws and harmful patterns I adopted from whereever I could)."
24426,"Predictably enough, I was still being ~~forced~~ encouraged to study as hard as I used to, which in turn caused severe sleep deprivation and made me even more reclusive and anxious around people."
24427,My anxiety peaked at the age of 16 (when I was just about to finish my high school): my limbs and neck were twitching whenever any eye contact/potential conflict/social interaction ensued; my mind was basically empty (unless fear is worth mentioning) throughout the day and I've been very absent-minded all the time.
24428,"My dad had no idea how emotionally (although I hardly felt any emotions except fear and a weird kind of excitement back then) taxing his ""benignly patronizing"" ways were becoming; at some point he tried to disown me on my birthday because I didn't exercise or take out the rubbish."
24429,"At this point I finally got my mom to acknowledge my ""anxiety"" and I ended up taking Magnesium+B6 which gradually but surely diminished my somatic symptoms, although that might have also happened because of my lifestyle changes."
24430,"I moved to a neighboring country to get a decent degree in a field that I'm not particularly fond of but which my mom picked for me because of the job opportunities (it's not that I hate CS, it would just take ages to reach the point when I'm able to do anything meaningful, i.e."
24431,research).
24432,I've met some truly amazing and inspiring people; my symptoms are no longer as crippling as they used to be and one could say there is some hope for becoming an actual human being now.
24433,"I'm 19 and there are only 2 semesters left until I get my diploma, but I've grown to be less and less enthusiastic about the whole thing."
24434,There's no way I can become fully self-sufficient in less than 5 years from now (my mom is making some subtle allusions to applying for a M.A.
24435,and eventually for a PhD and then opening a business together which would involve stuff I'd rather avoid).
24436,There's so much I have to go through before I'm able to get any sense of enjoyment from life that I want to give up.
24437,"I've spent the last 3 years in a rather low mood (the only thing that kept me from noticing it was my urge to become part of this new social circle I'm in and to keep my mom from feeling that her efforts were all in vain), but lately this situation has been really bothering me."
24438,I've been having more troubles taking care of myself than I used to; I'm having 1.5 meals and 12 hours of sleep a day and I haven't been cleaning the flat I'm renting for about 2 months already.
24439,"A month and a half ago I realized that I had to do something about it just to pull through the remaining year of studies, regardless of whether it would involve taking anti-depressants (my family has a strong bias against ""unnatural"" medications and a rampant fear of having an ""addict"" as a child so they are unlikely to pay for those) or going through therapy."
24440,"I didn't tell my psychiatrist the entire story but rather kept blabbering on and on about how I want to express my emotions more freely and be less afraid of judgement (because these two issues and a couple unfortunate accidents with women pushed me into therapy), but it's safe to assume that he got the idea of my state of mind."
24441,"It turned out that I don't have any particular disorder that I've been so desperately looking forward to be diagnosed with (you know, being pigeonholed and then given a failsafe solution to all my problems seemed very appealing to me), so he recommended that I try psychodynamic therapy to get my stuff together."
24442,There was a long break between the sessions at the very beginning of my therapy; coincidentally my procrastination was becoming unbearable and I was looking for ways to get things under control.
24443,I spent that entire week cutting my arms with my kitchen knife and only at the end I decided to reach out for help.
24444,"I wish my friend's advice and the 4 pages long ""battle plan"" we coined that afternoon kept me going for longer, but nevertheless it was a revelation: I realized how much my friend meant to me and the feeling of being loved even at my absolute low was blissful."
24445,I haven't been crying in front of other people since high school.
24446,The tears of joy I had on the next therapy session and a brief moment of hope were worth more than my entire life up to that point; feeling anything different from emptiness was a feat in itself.
24447,"It wasn't long until I delved into my past and it became a focal point in my therapy (which has actually helped me alleviate the burden of judgement and become honest with myself/my therapist), but things became awkward whenever I was asked to talk about my present."
24448,"I teared up once more when I realized how sad and lonely I am and that there's nothing that can change things anytime soon, and I had been binge crying every once in a while since then."
24449,I want to be around people but I'm afraid of scaring them off with my unsubstantial problems and my overreaction to them so I end up having one or two awkward conversations with my best friends per week; at some point I even wanted to leave my therapist before she gets tired of my musings (but I realized that giving in to this urge would be plain unhelpful so we discussed it on another session).
24450,"I've gone through quite a lot since then, including a weird ass existential crisis that only lasted for a couple days and an intense talk with my mom in which I managed to find ways to actually talk to (and understand) her."
24451,But here's the thing: although I gained a ton of insights on the inner workings of my mind I feel that this awareness is not enough for any fundamental changes in my life.
24452,"I'm afraid that I will never get out of this vicious circle of frustration, fear and excitement (combined with alternating bouts of emptiness and moodiness) and I'll keep running away from myself until it becomes unbearable."
24453,"The only way I can distract myself from all this and feel in control of my life (without being too destructive) is by reading something that requires a lot of abstract thinking which I happen to be good at, i.e."
24454,"lurking on math/philosophy subreddits, and waiting until my mind gets too tired and a headache sets in."
24455,I keep fantasizing about having a time machine that I could jump into and fast-forward until the next therapy session.
24456,I'm feeling very sleepy and confused right now.
24457,Lately I've been looking up some things about the legal status/ways/rationality of suicide and I want to have some certainty on that issue because it seems a very important topic to just ignore it completely.
24458,Yesterday I was very close to cut myself again and I don't like where this is going.
24459,I need to somehow last through the holidays until the next therapy session and I'm in a lot of pain now.
24460,"Sorry for my Engrish, for my dry writing and for making you read this."
24461,I'd be grateful for any advice.
24462,Anxiety medication has always hit me pretty strong.
24463,Especially two certain side effects: weigh gain and decreased sexual energy.
24464,"And when I say hard, I mean it (I gained 50 pounds of fat over one summer, going from 150-200 total weight."
24465,Are there any anxiety medications that don't have these aide effects?
24466,I just don't want to feel trapped anymore.
24467,"My anxiety medication doesn't help much, and I'm just really worried that I screwed my life up with smoking."
24468,I've decided to try medication for anxiety.
24469,"The idea scares me (makes me anxious of course), has anyone tried medication?"
24470,I've tried medication (anti-depressants) and nothing has helped.
24471,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but the fear of bad side effects is making me not want to try out different meds."
24472,"I'm also going to therapy so I don't think medication is the end-all cure, but I was wondering how much is a normal dose."
24473,Deep meditation isn't really helping and I don't want to go on any medication to treat this problem right now.
24474,"Or, you know, it could just be that the new meds don't work for shit."
24475,I've been taking medication for about a year now and seeing specialist after specialist for no reason I guess.
24476,"Therapy and medication have really helped by decreasing the frequency and intensity of said attacks, but I still feel lost when they happen."
24477,"Therapy, meditation, medication, books, plenty of sleep, healthy diet and gym 4 times a week."
24478,My girlfriend and I have been seeing each other since February; we officially began dating in March.
24479,She's always had problems with anxiety and I have always tried to help her with those problems.
24480,She has had severe religious anxiety over the last nine months and she has anxiety about our relationship.
24481,"She's gotten a bit better with the religious anxiety, but here's what she says about anxiety relating to us:

- She doesn't have significant feelings (towards anything in life right now) and she is afraid that her not feeling those feelings towards me is a bad thing."
24482,And then her anxiety begins eating away at her and she wonders if she actually loves me because of the uncertainty she feels (about us or anything in general).
24483,"Here's what I know:

1."
24484,"She has her good days and bad days with ""us"" anxiety."
24485,She says that she wants to marry me (and I want to marry her) and she often will tell me how much she loves and cares for me.
24486,2.
24487,Her anxiety pops up in waves and I believe is combined with depression.
24488,She goes through time periods where her anxiety is through the roof and her depression numbs her down.
24489,3.
24490,She just began taking Lexapro a 2-3 weeks ago in an effort to help the anxiety.
24491,"She was doing *decent* for the first part of the medication, but now she's having significantly worse depression and anxiety around week 3."
24492,Last night she told me that she feels numb and has for a long time.
24493,She says that she feels numb about everything in life right now.
24494,I'm not sure if the Lexapro has made it worse or if it's always been that severe and she just hasn't mentioned it to me.
24495,Can anyone share their experience with treating depression and anxiety?
24496,What are some things that we can try doing?
24497,Are there any other medications we may want to look into?
24498,Right now she's only tried Lexapro and my first thought was that perhaps 1) either the dosage isn't right and needs to be adjusted or 2) we should find a different medication to try.
24499,I've told her that anxiety requires time and patience to treat as medication often needs to be changed or adjusted and also requires time to take effect.
24500,Thanks so much guys!
24501,"I went to my therapist, I started medication, I started going to church, I started working out, I looked for support (online and family) and I completely cleaned out my room."
24502,"Anyways, I then started to take medication for my anxiety, and because I was so desperate to feel better, it became the only thing I would think about, and I would be obsessed with it."
24503,"Anyway, I'm now getting off the medication."
24504,I successfully got over anxiety 2 years ago and was doing so well my doctor took me off my meds.
24505,I'm back on my meds but don't know how to cope.
24506,I haven't even taken my meds (fluoxetine) since Friday and I feel better than I do most days.
24507,I've been without my medication for six months now.
24508,"Before I tell the whole story, I'll say this: I'm a 22 year old female, currently not on any medication."
24509,"=)

I'm coming off my anti-anxiety meds right now and I'm on day 5 without them."
24510,"I'm explaining what all is going down because if someone is out there who wants to quit their meds, I want them to know what can happen."
24511,"Every since I've stopped taking my meds, my urge to eat the house down has basically calmed down."
24512,"I actually gained weight when I started taking the meds, so I thought that might be something interesting to mention."
24513,**TL;DR:** I'm having SSRI withdrawal symptoms due to me going cold turkey on my meds.
24514,I got prescribed meds for it but I'm scared to take them because i don't want to think differently i don't wanna be in a dull mood i don't know if that's what happends but that's what i think it does.
24515,have you tried any natural medicine or something?
24516,I made some appointments to see a therapist and to get refills on medicine (something I've been forgetting to do for a while) and I was talking to him about it and I asked if in the future he would come with me to one of my therapy appointments so he could get a better understanding of what I'm dealing with.
24517,"I can't go home home as I can't afford the bus fare, and the last buses have stopped now anyway, but I'm without medication etc (non-anxiety related) but I missed it this morning so that makes two days now and I don't fancy getting ill. On top of that, I may have screwed up my degree."
24518,It's now been 3 months of unemployment.
24519,My confidence is crushed and my motivation is nonexistent.
24520,I just go through job listings.
24521,Even the stuff I qualify for doesn't seem interesting or requires credentials that I don't meet.
24522,I no longer know what to apply for.
24523,"I feel that if my work isn't rewarding in someway, it's just going to make things worse, which is why I've avoided labor or retail positions - that's all I've ever done."
24524,Last summer my depression was worse than at any other point in my life.
24525,"I have a much better social life than I did back at home while I was working, but if I do not get a job and make money within the next month, I'll *be* back home again."
24526,My education was in Social Sciences and TESOL (teaching english).
24527,I don't have my TESOL certificate yet since I need to complete one more course online - i can't afford it right now - but even completing the course doesn't mean much to me.
24528,"I know I can teach, but any day I had practicum, literally the whole day leading up to the block where I taught was a mess."
24529,I felt nauseated and uncomfortable in the hours leading up to the teaching.
24530,"Once I taught, I was fine, but leading up to it destroyed me and made it very difficult which is why I don't know if I can really stand to do that as a job."
24531,"Within social sciences, my education was mostly in anthropology, I have an undeclared basic theological studies minor."
24532,"My education dealt mostly with human behavior and history, and had quite a bit of media studies intertwined as well since journalism, story telling, etc has long been one of my interests."
24533,"Political stuff is very interesting to me, but I'm more interested from the sphere of looking at political events and phenomenon from a distance, why things happen, what led to it looking like this, etc."
24534,"I'm a very non-confrontational person, which is why I feel really ill suited for social work."
24535,"I have good interpersonal skills, but I'm bad at genuinely meeting new people."
24536,"In the past two weeks since moving back to the city, I've just been hanging around talking to homeless folks and vagrants, which is nice, but I don't think one can turn that into a career really."
24537,What also has become a very big interest of mine as of late is botany and mycology.
24538,Originally I got interested in the subject because of my on going interest in drugs.
24539,"It was fascinating to me to see the wide variety of psychoactive chemicals in the world and in learning about things like DMT or LSA, I became interested in knowing where they came from."
24540,"While my interest has since extended beyond just hallucinogenic plants, I've found I'm very interested in examining the history surrounding various cultures uses of natural medicines, as well as looking at the use of psychoactive chemicals in religious and social practices in the past."
24541,"It's just so cool to me to think that, long before we could put chemical identities to the alkaloids present in plants, people were still able to utilize them in medicine, as flavoring, in intoxicants, etc."
24542,It's so cool.
24543,"Again, no idea how to find work in anything at all related to this, don't even know where to start considering beyond the historical/modern applications of it, all of this falls outside of my discipline

 
Anywho;


TL;DR I need a job something bad, but I can't get over the wall of anxiety that comes with that."
24544,"So much work seems stressful, so much of it seems like everyone takes themselves way to seriously."
24545,"I feel like I want to write, and every day I tell myself I will, and then I never act on it."
24546,"I'm an unmotivated and un-confident 22 year old, and my sole aspiration in life right now is to sleep under the stars."
24547,"Every night I go on walks (I live in a quieter part of the city, a pretty open green space is just west of me) and I'm frustrated that I can't see the stars."
24548,"During school, until winter at least, I would just go out and camp somewhere."
24549,"I'd drive out of campus at 1 in the morning and sleep in a parking lot, or I'd walk into the woods near campus and spend the night somewhere."
24550,"That's all I want to do, but I have financial responsibilities to meet and right now I can't meet them and I don't know what to do."
24551,I'm slipping into my old habits again and don't really know where I'm going to end up.
24552,This is a side note; take your mental health seriously.
24553,"In speaking with the vagrants and homeless that populate Winnipeg, I've come to realize that mental health is a huge factor in their lives."
24554,It can affect people profoundly.
24555,"Even if when you end up on the street you don't have mental problems, you'll likely have something eventually."
24556,"That life hardens the skin, but living on societies fringe isn't kind on the mind."
24557,"**Tl;DR** I've lost the willpower to try new things, I guess."
24558,"I don't know where to go with my life, which is frustrating cause I'm really young (only 22)."
24559,"I have my whole life ahead of me, but I can't even take a step in any direction right now."
24560,"I need a job, I don't want a job, I don't know what I should be looking for in work since I don't have a clue what kind of career I'd like to work in."
24561,"I don't understand how people are okay with working the hours that they do, it seems so strange to me how many hours of the day we trade to things because that's how we survive."
24562,It's frustrating to me that money plays such a significant role in influencing peoples comfort and happiness levels.
24563,"I want to be satisfied with life, but I can't be satisfied when I only have enough money left to pay off next months rent, and the only jobs that get back to me are minimum wage positions that will have me living from pay check to pay check."
24564,"I won't get out of debt, I won't be able to further my education, I won't be able to explore the country and the world like I so badly want to."
24565,"My heads an unfocused mess and I just tell myself ""no,"" all day long to the things that I want, I've just assumed everything is outside of my reach and that I'm going to settle for something ordinary."
24566,"After finally getting an appointment and going in today and speaking with temporary doctor there, she was afraid to prescribe me medication because of a bad experience I had with celexa (citalopram) that caused me to forgo treatment three years ago."
24567,The fact that it generally takes multiple tries before a medication that works if found and 4 weeks or so of taking a medication before one can know it works or not means that it will be long before I get any help while life goes on for everyone else.
24568,Now the problem I have is every now and again I will forget to take my medication for a day or two.
24569,On the second day when I finally realize that I forgot to take my meds I can feel it in my body.
24570,"When I finally go back on my meds after a few days everything goes back to ""normal."""
24571,My question is that should I be worried that I'm missing something else going on with my body and the medication is numbing it down; or like everything else is it just in my head?
24572,"**But a couple of years of therapy, medication and self-forced exposure therapy** and i'm a much more social and like able man."
24573,"*For those curious about what meds i'm on, it's cipralex 20 mg and mianserin 10 mg.*"
24574,"yogi - kava stress relief ([kava](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kava#Effects) is a for real drug)

24575,Long story short I've been on Xanax since I was 13 for anxiety (19 now) and now I take 4mg a day.
24576,I'm seriously psychologically and physically addicted to benzodiazepines.
24577,I understand the horrible withdrawal and I am going to talk to my doctor about a tapering regime to avoid seizures and (I don't even wanna type it) death.
24578,"However, I never go in to my psychiatrist and just ask to change my meds without researching every little thing we may discuss."
24579,"In the past I have been put on so many anti-depressants and bipolar meds and mood stabilizers that I would try for a month or two, have horrible side effects and no good results, and then go onto the next one."
24580,I have lost track of the names of the medications I have and haven't taken in my adolescence.
24581,I don't want to do that again.
24582,"I finally am seeing a different doctor who determined it was a misdiagnosis (which is what I had been saying all along) and I am neither depressed nor bipolar, but I definitely have insomnia which I take a very low dose of Ambien for (12.5mg) as well as 2mg of Xanax."
24583,The other 2mg of Xanax are to be taken only if I have a panic attack that day.
24584,"I have however, always had panic attacks even before I became dependent on the benzos."
24585,"**So, my question for you guys &amp; the tl;dr of it all:**


Are there any medications that I could ask my doctor to prescribe me after I taper off of the Xanax for good that are ***neither*** benzodiazepines (e.g."
24586,"Xanax, Valium, Klonopin) nor serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] (e.g."
24587,"Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft) that are effective for managing generalized anxiety?"
24588,"She has meds for it, but she doesn't always take them, because she's feeling fine."
24589,"She ended up having to drive home and get her meds, and I was worried if she would get home okay."
24590,"Now she's home safe and sound, but I'm wondering if there's anything else I can do in the future to help her without having to get her home to get her meds."
24591,"Good: dr. Al-Tariq in Middletown ny
Horrible: dr. Wolfson in goshen ny this man told me to get a labotomy and wouldn't give me different meds when mine weren't working"
24592,"The medicine wouldn't have taken full effect just yet, as I'm well aware it takes time, but in the interim, I've noticed some of my more inconspicuous triggers."
24593,I have been on my medication for almost a year and all of a sudden my hair has been falling out in clumps.
24594,"At first I thought it was the meds but its been a year, side effects don't usually pop up after so long do they?"
24595,Is this very common (I'm male) and will it return with continued reduction and offing of my medication.
24596,I'm worried that for some reason that the medicine will have killed my sex-drive forever which I hope isn't the case.
24597,I began to get diagnosed with anxiety and the depression had seemed to be at a level manageable without meds around 20.
24598,"However, self-medication and unhealthy lifestyle combined with my meds (I believe) gave me a psychotic break and I ended up in the mental ward after a manic episode and suicide attempt around age 23 which resulted in a bipolar diagnosis which was retracted once I had gone off all meds and managed my anxiety in a more natural way with Xanax occasionally when I would be getting legit panic attacks."
24599,"My ideal goal would be to use the Xanax as needed and hopefully reduce the need while pursuing exercise, diet, and spiritual practice rather than pursue long-term medication although at this point I need help as my anxiety has come back to affect my ability to care for my son and work at times, which makes me more anxious and leads to panic attacks...you know how it is."
24600,"Long story short, I developed a severe anxiety and panic disorder at age 20, for which I sought treatment in therapy and medication."
24601,It helped immensely and by 22 I was feeling better every day though I did gain some weight from the medications.
24602,"Oh well, can't have a healthy body unless you have a healthy mind, right?"
24603,I'm still on meds though the amounts have been reduced and I no longer take klonopin at all (I'm also not napping three times a day anymore!)
24604,So I'm 23.
24605,Everything's cool.
24606,My rituals and anxiety attacks are mostly gone.
24607,I feel good.
24608,"And then one day while peeing I noticed that if I stayed sitting on the toilet for a while, a tiny bit more pee would come out."
24609,So I started doing this every time.
24610,And then I felt like I NEEDED to do it.
24611,Ok whatever not a big deal.
24612,"Except over time it turned into ""I have to pee before bed and I'm tired but I have to sit here for 20 minutes until I feel I have peed sufficiently."""
24613,If I get up before then I always have to go back and pee more.
24614,This does not happen during the day.
24615,I do not feel as though I have to pee for 20 minutes during the day.
24616,I pee and hen maybe squirt out a bit more and then I get up and go.
24617,Only at night does the ritual become intense.
24618,"If I start thinking that maybe I didn't pee ""enough"" I have to get out of bed and go back to the bathroom to squeeze out a drop or two."
24619,I don't think I will wet the bed at all.
24620,"I'm not sure what I think will happen, I just can't ignore the urge."
24621,Why have I developed this strange new ritual/ fixation when I feel pretty good in general about everything else?
24622,How can I stop this?
24623,I literally cannot sleep if I think I haven't peed the correct amount.
24624,Please help.
24625,":( 

Also: it is NOT a UTI or anything like that."
24626,I am 100% positive this is a psychological problem.
24627,My doctor just prescribed me celexa for my anxiety yesterday (first time ever taking meds) and today I decided to do a little research on it.
24628,I feel that if I continue this medication and come home unable to satisfy her it will destroy my relationship.
24629,"Also, she doesn't know I have anxiety or I'm taking meds, and I don't plan on telling her or anybody."
24630,"It's everyday now, the meds worked for the first week it seemed but now 2 weeks in its back to how I used to be before."
24631,It's gotten to the point that I'm considering going on medication again to cope with my anxiety.
24632,Can anyone recommend an anxiety medication without these side effects?
24633,Eventually she gave me medication for 2weeks only.
24634,"I thought I would be nothing more than a lonely cat lady, drinking coffee, watching tv and popping RX medicine."
24635,"I was seeing a new psychologist today because I am out of my anti anxiety medication, which allows me to function like a normal human being."
24636,Like I was some drug addict trying to get a fix and not a sick person who wanted medication.
24637,"Cognitive therapy has been clinically proven to be as effective as medication for depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues."
24638,I've went to see a psychiatrist and he said it seems like its manageable without meds just told me to read self-help books and exercise.
24639,I feel like i should resort to meds at this point because i feel i need to re-develop habits in social situations.
24640,I have to admit i kind of fear of the side effects that come with meds but I think those can be manageable now that I've struggled so much with other symptoms.
24641,"Today, I am fully off medication...still dealing with anxiety but I am learning to tell it to ""take a hike"" without resorting to medication."
24642,"At this point, I feel like I would benefit from therapy and possibly medication again (I've been medicated before) but in the act of trying to 'self-help' my way back to normalcy, I spent hours and hours obsessively reading about psychopaths and personality disorders on a website aimed at helping their victims."
24643,"I'm going to be frank I self medicate as much as I can buying lorarazepam, diazepam really any fucking type of anxiety medication I can find just to get a few hours of relief but it always comes to an end."
24644,I was on meds (mostly Celexa/Lexapro) for about 13 years.
24645,I started taking it on Friday at just 2.5mg (I'm ridiculously sensitive to all medication) and I've been in hell ever since.
24646,"I really, really want/need this medication to help, but I can't deal with not sleeping and spending the first two hours of my day in the bathroom, not to mention feeling like I'm jumping out of my skin with anxiety (which is why I'm taking the medication in the first place)."
24647,"I don't take any pain meds, but I do take Omnicef (antibiotic) and an antifungal to prevent yeast infections."
24648,I also have hypertension that is somewhat controlled by medication.
24649,I don't like talking to my wife about it because she gets so worried and seeing me in pain and swollen and sick from herxheimer response from my meds takes enough of a toll on her.
24650,I'm a 31/M and I don't take any meds for my anxiety.
24651,I am currently taking Xanax .5mg in the morning and .5mg total throught the day as needed and Prazosin (a heart medication to control the physical symptoms of my anxiety attacks) 1mg 3x a day.
24652,"I have also been seeing a great therapist for the past year, seeing her does help but not enough to stop medication

My psychiatrist was resistant to put me on Xanax because it runs the risk of dependency, but now he won't take me off it even though it has done nothing for me."
24653,"Things were fine until she suggested I look into homeopathic medicine, which is something I don't believe in at all (except as a placebo), but I was too shy to say anything about it."
24654,"I have my anxiety under control otherwise with a therapist and medication, and have for several months, but this is my first time dating since I got help."
24655,"I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, and I've been on medication for a few years."
24656,I really would like some opinions on my symptoms and under which category I fit under the best.
24657,I plan on seeing a psychiatrist eventually.
24658,I am very sorry for the incoming block of text.
24659,"Anxiety
I've had anxiety problems for about 9 years I think."
24660,"I thought it'd be as simple as googling anxiety disorders and selecting from the list which one was most like my own, but the thing is, I feel like a grab bag of symptoms from every anxiety disorder."
24661,What do you think sounds more likely that I have?
24662,"(obviously not searching for a diagnosis but I want to go to the Dr with the most precise/useful information)
 

Social anxiety - I find it very hard to interact with people in general."
24663,"Not just strangers, I even have a hard time being around ""friends"" and as such I basically have none."
24664,"I barely leave my room except to go to class and come back, but I don't feel like the social worries are the root...


Panic - I have had 3 very scary panic attacks in my life, but when I read about panic attacks, they sound like my extreme anxiety symptoms which occur maybe once a week."
24665,So I feel like I can't possibly be having a panic attack once a week or I have become so accustomed to them that they are my normal response.
24666,"At my worsts I sweat, my heart races, my thoughts race, my chest feels like it is collapsing in on itself and I can't possibly breathe."
24667,I feel those things a lot.
24668,Agoraphobia - This goes back to my whole hating to leave my room.
24669,I can't drive.
24670,I'm too afraid.
24671,I'm 23 and with no driver's license because of the fear.
24672,"I hate going places alone, it causes me to become incredibly scared."
24673,Sometimes I can't even leave my room when my roommate is home and I can't even give you a specific reason WHY.
24674,"OCD - I don't believe I have OCD because I do not have rituals or anything like that, but I have a very severe problem with perfectionism and was wondering if that could be a form of OCD?"
24675,"I am so hyper focused on perfection I will write posts like this and then delete them, or I get so overwhelmed I won't even spell check because I'm afraid if I see an error I'll be stuck proofing forever; alternatively I do proof and spend inordinate amount of time on it IE tests where I have to review my entire exam a good 5+ times before I can hand it in."
24676,My perfectionism is so bad that anything that doesn't meet my expectations instantly means I am a worthless sack of crap.
24677,"Depression
My depression really got going when I moved to my dorm 4 years ago."
24678,I hit a critical breaking point 2 years ago when I was 90% leaning towards suicide.
24679,"I got medication for my depression; funny thing is the medicine helped my anxiety, but I still felt depressed."
24680,I changed medicines and now both are back!
24681,It makes me feel hopeless about actually getting both conditions under order.
24682,"After a rough first day at my new job (First panic attack in months, left crying) I decided to come back and do my best which took a lot of courage."
24683,My new boss and HR were very understanding and asked what helps me with anxiety.
24684,I said chewing gum helps tremendously.
24685,"I work at a gambling institution where the customers are smoking and drinking so they permit me to chew gum as an exception as long as I don't spit, smack, or blow bubbles at the table (I don't work with food, I work at card tables)."
24686,I generally keep to myself and I don't go out of my way to cause any drama.
24687,I just had that ONE attack on my first day.
24688,"I started medication again, eat low carb during the day time when I work, and I chew gum."
24689,The sides of my tongues are raw and swollen and it hurts to talk and I've developed several mouth sores from chewing.
24690,"I'm still fighting tears and attacks, but I'm still working and doing a great job."
24691,"I generally just do my job and I am friendly with coworkers, but I am not close with them."
24692,Most of them are really nice and try to get me to have drinks with them.
24693,Except one girl.
24694,"This girl, or woman in her 30s, came up to me while I was working."
24695,This is how our conversation went.
24696,"Her: ""You're chewing gum and that isn't allowed."""
24697,"Me: ""Yeah, I have something worked out with the bosses and HR temporarily to ease my anxiety."
24698,"Hopefully next week I will be comfortable enough to not use it, but they permit it temporarily as long as I am not gross with it."""
24699,"Her: ""I have anxiety too and I got written up for chewing gum a few weeks ago."""
24700,"Me: ""You have anxiety diagnosed by a doctor and chew gum to cope and they still wrote you up?"""
24701,"Her: ""I haven't seen a doctor about it because I don't believe in medications or crutches."""
24702,"""I don't believe in medication or crutches because unlike some people I have will power and don't need them."""
24703,(she said this VERy condescendingly and was very obviously her way of calling me a baby who cries to get her way.)
24704,"Me: ""So you aren't diagnosed with anxiety and you weren't chewing gum to cope AND you don't take medication?"""
24705,"""Wow I wish I was you, but I'm not, I""m me and I need medication for my diagnosed anxiety disorder and I need to chew temporarily."""
24706,"""My tongue is raw and I talk like I have a tongue ring, but it keeps me from having an attack."""
24707,"""Maybe you should see a doctor then talk to HR if you are diagnosed and gum chewing is actually a coping mechanism."""
24708,"Her: ""I don't like the people at HR and I don't wish to talk to them."""
24709,"I fought tears that whole conversation, but I'm glad I stuck up for myself."
24710,I was trying so hard not to leave crying.
24711,The whole time she was there my body felt numb and like I was sinking.
24712,Luckily she left shortly after that and I only had an hour left of my shift.
24713,I don't know if I should tell on her or just avoid her.
24714,"It helped to think to myself that she probably doesn't have good rep with HR because of her attitude, but I still am afraid to have to work with her again."
24715,"My Pdoc is switching my medication, so I'm hoping that this will help."
24716,"Then when I was diagnosed, I was getting help from a psychiatrist who got me addicted to medication (10mgs of ativan literally whenever I wanted so I took it like candy) and refused to get me actual therapy and refused to explain side effects, so I thought I was going psychotic when in actual fact the medication was making me hallucinate and totally fucking up my thought pattern."
24717,"Then they sent me to a psychiatric ward and I was able to leave after a year of absolutely no real therapy besides aforementioned medication on the condition that I go to retarded classes at my highschool, where I developed severe anxiety disorders from having to deal with being locked in a room with a retard banging on a door and screaming at me through the other side."
24718,I talked to my therapist and I am going to set up an appointment with my family doctor to ask about medication.
24719,But I am also scared to take medication.
24720,So obviously I can't keep doing this but I'm scared about meds.
24721,I took a vitamin a while back and I had a panic attack about it so I'm scared the same will happen with meds.
24722,Also I've never had to ask a doctor for medicine like this since I've never had this kind of problem before.
24723,"I'm taking my medicine everyday, trying to be mentally healthy but I am falling apart and have nowhere to turn."
24724,"&amp;nbsp;

Up until today I've been completely against SSRIs, but this analogy on my self-medication has left me questioning my refusal to take prescribed medication."
24725,"Why do doctors frown upon my self-medication, even when I explain it's success for me, and continue to advocate me useing SSRI.&lt;/rant&gt;

edit: paragraphs"
24726,So a few months ago I decided that I needed help and I wanted to go to the doctor to get on meds.
24727,Side note: the meds are working wonderfully and my doctor said that I was taking the tranq a normal amount and if I need to up my dose to come see her anytime.
24728,Suddenly she doesn't like the fact that I'm on medication and she almost begins to shame me for how I am.
24729,Anyways I took one of the meds that stops my attacks.
24730,"We drop the subject for a while, but she notices that I'm a bit sleepy and then gives me a lecture on how I've been abusing my meds and need to stop taking them because they change me."
24731,She tells me I'm weak and shames me for not being able to deal with everything without meds.
24732,"I don't know if hearing about how my anxiety made it hard for me to do things I love made her realize that anxiety disorders are real, and I need medication at least for now."
24733,"Even if I know I've induced them myself, even when I repeat to myself ""You've ingested a medication."
24734,"I am not addicted to anything, I hardly even like to drink, and chose weed because I try to avoid other meds like benzo's whenever possible."
24735,But I have always been apprehensive about being on the medication forever so about two years  ago I tried to come off it.
24736,"So today, I just took 10mg of a medicine that, just a week ago, I celebrated that I was no longer on."
24737,"I don't wanna go on medication, I've tried several antidepressants in the past and they didn't work for me."
24738,"So I get a call back from my doctors nurse and she instantly jumps down my throat as well saying ""we need to alter your medication (Zoloft or sertraline as it is labeled) or you need to see a psychiatrist"" again, doesn't let me explain my situation and I'm pissed off so I request to talk to my doctor, who is unavailable and with a patient....I'm waiting for him to call me back in hopes I can explain my fucking situation to him finally."
24739,"My insurance doesn't cover much of my meds, so it's $30 a month...I know that doesn't seem like much but I'm very broke right now, so that's a huge difference for me."
24740,I took my medicine and told my boss I had to leave.
24741,"I also suffer from migraines, which a year ago, I ended up having to take my pain meds every single day which adds up to quite a lot of codeine."
24742,I use to be on meds years ago for anxiety but I started to not need them anymore.
24743,I'm worried what the meds will change about me.
24744,(Without meds)
24745,I've been on antidepressants/anxiety meds for a long time.
24746,She recommended after the first session that I see a psychotherapist for medication.
24747,The doctor glanced at my file for a few seconds and told me about the three different types of medication he could prescribe me for my apparent depression and generalized anxiety disorder.
24748,"Even if I have a reaction, I figure it's better to know i'm allergic and get the meds I need."
24749,"When something happens like going out in public, or when my parents have been gone for a while and aren't answering, or a multitude of other things, it's like I'm not even on any meds."
24750,"So, the medicine works for general worrying, but it doesn't remove everything."
24751,"I tried to get on lexapro and that was a mistake for me, I guess me and that medicine just didn't mix."
24752,"My mom thinks I'm getting better and I thought I was too, so we lowered my meds."
24753,Ive been seeing a counselor every week and im going to be put on medication this week or next.
24754,The medication has changed my life and added joy back to things in my life.
24755,So they prescribed me some anti anxiety meds 1 mg lorazepam.
24756,"In any case, I'm going to a doctor on Monday, but I'm tempted to go to that clinic again and get more meds (or at least try)."
24757,"I'm really scared to take medication, and I don't know how I'd even see a doctor here in Korea."
24758,"I guess if i have social anxiety it must be kind of bad, because i'd rather skip the counseling and just get a medication."
24759,"When he was released, we focused on getting his counseling to a more therapeutic level and the VA reevaluated his meds."
24760,"I'm not sure what more to do for him, aside from continue to encourage his counseling and medication."
24761,"I don't know what to do and I've been browsing here for a while and I finally just got fed up with it and decided to post

EDIT: Decided to talk to mom about it again, she doesn't believe me and thinks all I need are a couple of relaxers (some liquid you put on your temples after you've had a stressful day, I forgot what it's called) she says all doctors are corrupt and no medicine will do much besides get me addicted."
24762,"So they're a no go, considering reading more on prescribed medication and reading how much a prescribed amount is for a person like me and buying them illegally, I just want to get rid of this"
24763,I know I need meds and I have a few friends that are on them and strongly recommend them.
24764,I won't be able to seek professional help or meds until late-August.
24765,"I'm currently not on any medication, I was on something to bring my blood pressure down but it was causing me extreme breathing difficulties so I quickly stopped taking that."
24766,"Read many self help books, books on anxiety, been to doctors, used SSRI medication and gone to psychotherapy."
24767,Is there a better medicine other than SSRI to deal with my problem?
24768,"They've been really nice to me, and even offered to take me to the doctor to get some kind of medication, but they're usually busy, and can't really help me when I'm hyperventilating on the floor of the school bathroom while they're at work."
24769,After all this CBT *AND* anti-anxiety meds...I still couldn't do it.
24770,When I was a teenager my family tried to get me to take medication and keep me in therapy but I fought them most of the time.
24771,The pain meds aren't working so well and its making me so anxious.
24772,Now I only get anxious and miserable at work and I told myself that if a job situation got so bad that I needed to get back on meds I'd quit the job but that's not realistic.
24773,I can't just up and quit &amp; I'm not in a positive job hunting state of mind so I guess I'll have to get meds to deal with my miserable job.
24774,Anyone else just take meds to deal with work?
24775,So where to begin.
24776,I'm terrible at not going off on tangents so I will try to stick with this.
24777,"tl;dr backstory, I've worked at the same place for a long time."
24778,March 2008 is when i started.
24779,I was 21 at the time.
24780,"While the beginning of my work here was stressful, I could deal with it."
24781,Then I got a promotion and was put into a position that I loved doing.
24782,"I didn't mind work, I didn't dread it, it was fine."
24783,I'd made more money at other places but it was negligible and in another city so it sort of made sense.
24784,I was and am with someone who is very supportive of myself (as much as he can be without completely understanding the things I go through).
24785,"Anyway, I guess I should jump right into it."
24786,Since 2010 I have been on and off random meds.
24787,"First started on paxil, then after that zoloft, then paxil again, then lexapro, and currently wellbutrin."
24788,"I really thought wellbutrin was doing very well for me, much more than anything i'd taken."
24789,I also at that time was prescribed xanax for emergencies.
24790,I've always had anxiety issues but finally was able to start culling it somewhat.
24791,"My current predicament is a little... weird, I guess."
24792,"I see a psychologist and psychiatrist and have for a year and a half, and I feel it has done wonders."
24793,"If not for those two, I wouldn't probably be very uh... functional, I suppose."
24794,"this is really convoluted, isn't it?"
24795,"I apologize, I am really really bad at this whole keeping-on-track thing..."
24796,"So, due to my therapist's help, I have finally decided to move away from the city I've stuck myself in for 8 years."
24797,I hate it here.
24798,There is nothing for me to do and all of my really good friends moved away so I don't do a damn thing but hole up at my apartment and play video games.
24799,"When my boyfriend gets home we eat dinner and then I go back to my computer, either playing by myself or with him."
24800,"I am so ready to leave, but money and my lease agreement keep me here until June 30th of next year."
24801,"(for those who know Texas cities, I guess, I live in Lubbock now and am moving to Austin, I am unsure if this really adds anything but eh)

I really, really thought I could stick it out."
24802,"Unfortunately, at my work, about a year and a half ago they hired a new person who I have to essentially work directly with."
24803,"The person prior to him retired, and everyone in my department was very upset as he was excellent at his job."
24804,So... the person they replaced him with... is an absolute bumbling moron.
24805,Everything I get from him is a problem.
24806,"He won't fix anything either, he always blames someone else, even if it is blatantly obvious that it was him that messed it up."
24807,And it's not even little just annoying messups... it's costly or customer-losing messups.
24808,Just this last month he was very close to costing the company $55000.
24809,No single regular employee (and my immediate manager) likes working with him at all.
24810,"He is rude, has made customers cry, works maybe half to 3/4 of his actual hours a day, etc etc etc."
24811,Any business that gave a half of a shit about their customers would have fired this man.
24812,Or at least I thought.
24813,He is still here after all of this.
24814,Multiple customers and employees have complained.
24815,The general manager was informed of his latest snafu and laughed about it.
24816,LAUGHED.
24817,Just today I was tasked with calling an angry customer to fix a problem he started.
24818,I can't do it.
24819,I can't deal with any more angry people over shit I didn't mess up.
24820,"I can only do so much and that's all I seem to do at my job anymore, is just fix his problems."
24821,"We've tried to make him fix his problems but he doesn't do it, or if he does, he just does it wrong again."
24822,Put this on top of doing all his legwork - I am so behind with my actual work that I am now having issues with that too.
24823,"At my job, since starting, not only do I do my main thing, but I also have to help working receptionist at some times of the day (where I can't really work on my actual job title work)."
24824,This takes out 1-2.5 hours out of me being able to catch up.
24825,I can't ask my immediate coworkers for help because unsurprisingly they are also completely swamped with their own things and also fixing the things our dumb coworker messed up.
24826,I want to get out of here so badly but I can't.
24827,I don't want to get another job for ~8 months that will pay less and look bad on my resume to just jump ship to another place for that short a tenure.
24828,I also don't want to work for a company and then turn right back around and leave them after they put faith and money in me working there.
24829,And!
24830,For the wonderful icing on the cake.... my boyfriend's place of work is closing in December.
24831,"He should be able to get unemployment, but my health insurance is through his job (my job's is trash and doesn't cover shit, AND is like twice the price as his) and I can't afford to see my therapist every twice a week like I do now, plus my medications."
24832,Especially since we're trying to save for the move.
24833,I'm not done though....
24834,I've had an issue with a second molar for the past 2 years.
24835,I had a root canal on it in january which cost me $900 even with insurance ($300 was sedation but I can't do the whole dentist-needle-pliers-oh god i can't even think about it ughghgh).
24836,Well... turns out it's still fucked and I need it pulled now.
24837,"And a biopsy for the gum around it because there's a growth above it, so that's worrying me greatly as well."
24838,Yay!!!!!
24839,How much will this cost me?
24840,About $3k.
24841,Out of pocket.
24842,My insurance will cover $300 of this.
24843,My medical won't cover the biopsy because the doctor is out of network but there are no oral surgeons within 200 miles of Lubbock that take it.
24844,"I was told I can appeal, and I intend to when the claim gets denied, but god that is a lot of phone calls and dealing with people I really, really am dreading."
24845,I don't really know what to do other than continue to medicate lol.
24846,"This has been a huge stressor, all of these things, and I am finally just done."
24847,I can't deal with it anymore.
24848,I come home from work crying.
24849,I want to quit so badly.
24850,"(Funny thing is because of the company i work for, every department is understaffed so there are people they'd make work 10-12 hour days to cover me, as I've had to do in the past."
24851,I don't want to subject the people that I do like working with to that.)
24852,There are just so many things that I keep coming back to as far as work.
24853,I have so much backlog that I can't get to.
24854,I try to focus on one thing and get that done but it all comes back at me anyway if I haven't done it as my job is very very time sensitive.
24855,AAahahh!!!!
24856,I don't know what to do.
24857,I thought about just driving off and hiding somewhere for a week but my job worries keep me from doing that.
24858,Oh and the fact I can't do shit alone because lol social anxiety as well.
24859,"Advice is welcome, but this is more of an 'oh fuck what the hell do i do it never ends oh god let me crawl into a hole and die'-esque rant, I guess."
24860,Trying not to make this sound very pity party-y either.
24861,I hope I did so.
24862,I try really hard not to feel sorry for myself and have tried to pick my ass up off the floor many times during this but I'm starting to just lose hope and give up.
24863,"I can elaborate more on some things if need be, I am awful at forgetting random very important information lol."
24864,Aaaa!!
24865,Thanks for reading this.
24866,I realize it is long as hell.
24867,:/  Though it was cathartic to write out.
24868,&lt;3
24869,"I've already been in the other much scarier type of hospital twice, both essentially from running out of meds."
24870,"She's currently under medication, and one of the pills that she's taking is an anxiolytic called tranxene (clorazepate dipotassium) It helps to keep her from going into a panic and entering a downward spiral but we're running out of stock."
24871,I'm taking the medicine for them but they won't be gone for like a week.
24872,"My question is: If I do get put on medication for it, how will it effect me personally?"
24873,Part of me thinks it would be better to suffer through the next 4 weeks regardless of the consequences on my grades just so I don't need to take these meds.
24874,But at the same time I know taking the medicine would probably really help me academically for the next few weeks while therapy may take a while to have an effect.
24875,"I sleep far less now due to being put on Ritalin (which so far has not contributed to my anxiety, surprisingly enough) in addition to my anti anxiety meds, and I do have more energy."
24876,"I researched on this subreddit, but most of the experiences are value-based, as in, ""this medicine is horrible"" or ""this medicine saved my life""."
24877,I'm going to ask about getting my medication adjusted.
24878,It's time for medicine.
24879,I feel like I'm almost ready to go off my medication.
24880,God I can't wait for my therapy appointment tomorrow and hopefully medication soon afterwards again.
24881,"Right now, I am struggling to get myself to use medication while going through therapy."
24882,"My therapist, and several doctors, have discussed short term medication as a possible solution to my problems."
24883,I really struggle with the idea of a medication that will change the way i act or think.
24884,I also don't use any medication.
24885,"I have GAD and social anxiety, and have tried pretty much all meds possible and working on taking control of anxiety myself."
24886,I am willing to take meds.
24887,Usually I feel a chest tightness and I can feel the panic attacks coming on and can take my meds to counteract that.
24888,Now that I know it exists and I experience all the symptoms I made a doctor's appointment to get help and have been prescribed a medication to help cope with both the anxiety and depression.
24889,It's hard enough to get out of bed without one of my biggest supports completely abandoning me (I only started meds yesterday - lexapro).
24890,"I've made some notes, goals, what meds I've been on."
24891,I can't sleep even when I take medicine.
24892,I've been diagnosed with three types of anxiety and am taking my medicine.
24893,"I'm working with my medical team on my anxiety, but I have a background in cellular biology and am wondering if anyone knows what meds work for panic attacks, and why they work?"
24894,I'm still not sure if the depression is a result of the medication or just because of the entirety of the experience.
24895,"I have only had one anxiety attack in my entire life, I will admit it is scary as hell."
24896,I honestly thought I was having a heart attack and was about to die.
24897,I called an ambulance and went to the hospital after which I was told I had an anxiety attack.
24898,It was the most afraid I'd ever been.
24899,I count myself luck that I don't deal with it every single day as many of you do.
24900,My SO suffers with a panic disorder stemming from an allergic reaction to medication among other psychological factors.
24901,I was reading an article about the topic when I came up with an idea.
24902,Feel free to share your feelings on this idea but maybe give it a try because it costs nothing and at very least you'll be fitter and healthier.
24903,"I've noticed that many of you are in poor health, have poor diets and generally don't sleep well."
24904,Anyway getting to my idea.
24905,In America your food is generally choc full of chemicals/hormones which contribute to the physical stress on your bodies.
24906,Mainly your circulatory system which is heavily involved in the delivery of chemicals which affect your anxiety.
24907,You would eat a reduced calorie diet involving less meat and supplementing the lost iron with certain vegetables.
24908,Basically generally improving your diet to reduce physical stress on your body which should in turn help to manage your mental stress.
24909,Couple this 'diet' with exercise that would improve your physical health and leave you tired enough to sleep properly at night which would also reduced your anxiety or help you better manage it with your respective medications.
24910,With improved physical health and rest you would be able to better manage your anxiety and it may even disappear all together.
24911,My idea is still very loosely formed as you can probably tell from the clusterfuck that is this post but I'm currently developing it.
24912,The main principles of my idea are all there.
24913,"I still have some research to do on hormones/chemicals involved in food productions, mental and physical stress etc but I believe I may be onto something."
24914,Your help/input is greatly appreciated.
24915,My SO and myself are looking to test my idea after Christmas.
24916,"Basically I don't believe that anyone should have to deal with GAD, it's fucking horrible and if I can help a few people then I will be happy with what I've achieved."
24917,Maybe you can help with your input.
24918,Nobody should have to spend hundreds or thousands per year on drugs that do a poor job of controlling symptoms but do nothing to treat the underlying cause.
24919,She's also recommending that I see my family doctor right away and get medication.
24920,I also have some meds.
24921,"(I have ADD as well, and I suspect maybe OCD...) I know the primary course of action isn't medication, but... just how do I deal with this?"
24922,"I can't stand being given all this medication with all these side effects, when the medication I had in the past may have helped me, but now they won't give it to me..."
24923,"I would need a diagnostic report including:

* A specific diagnosis stating that I do have anxiety
* A description of current functional limitations
* Information regarding medication (none)
* Information regarding current treatment (will probably be only cognitive behavioral therapy)

Have any of you used your university’s disability accommodations and did they help you?"
24924,"But at the same time I'm battling mental health issues, including social anxiety (which I'll start medication for this week) and depression, which I've been managing."
24925,"I used to smoke pot daily, and drink only every other weekend or so, but pot slowly started making me anxious to the point of derealization and heart palpitations, so I had to quit that cold turkey."
24926,"Since then I've had debilitating Health Anxiety and constant Palpitations, I've grown pretty used to it but thats mostly if I'm just alone at my house."
24927,"Alcohol manages to completely melt away the anxiety and my worries if I drink enough, Im very skeptical about medications, and have been trying other natural remedies, with limited success, nothing seems to work as good as alcohol."
24928,"I am in a blues band, and when we play out I HAVE to get drunk first, or my heart rate goes up to like 150 no matter how hard I take deep breaths, I cant relax, so it really saves me from just like quitting my band and having all my friends hate me..."
24929,"I also have insomnia to the point of no end, alcohol is tricky when it comes to insomnia, It makes me fall asleep great, but I end up waking up really early anxious and dehydrated.. Never the less I drink daily now usually 2-3 40 ouncers of beer, and on the weekends I can drink allll day."
24930,So TL;DR - Who else has become an alcoholic because of Anxiety?
24931,Ten years of medication and therapy has done nothing.
24932,"For the past year or two I've felt that I've recovered pretty well from my anxiety, with a few attacks here and there but nothing too prolonged, and actually tend to consider myself a very social person."
24933,"I never went to therapy, and I've never been on any medications, I just... kind of dealt with it until I learned how to manage."
24934,"I've had a bad experience with a therapist and I'm still a bit wary, I think."
24935,"This is after years and years of adolescent depression and anxiety, and I've really come into myself since then and feel more comfortable."
24936,I still have issues but nothing inhibiting me.
24937,But lately I've been thrust into social situations that I would normally really enjoy that have been throwing me into huge bouts of anxiety that seriously impact my daily life and social interaction.
24938,"To give an example, the past three days have been absolutely grueling, and I don't understand why at all."
24939,"It started with a close friend's birthday party being held at my boyfriend's house, that I hadn't necessarily been looking forward to because of some unrelated issues with my friend who was throwing the party for him."
24940,But I knew everyone at the party and really liked them and normally would have loved it but I found myself zoned out and stressed and panicked all night that I would do the wrong thing or say something horrible or stupid and everyone would hate me.
24941,"I also have some disordered eating habits that I'm still dealing with presently that are definitely connected to the anxiety, and those were brought up really horribly at the party where we all ate together and made jokes that normal people could have handled well but I freaked out internally because I was convinced everyone thought that I was a fat slob or something."
24942,I know that I am objectively not that.
24943,I understand that I am actually fairly thin for my height but I still have this voice in my head that screams at me that if I eat like a normal person everyone will think I am worthless and disgusting.
24944,So that was... not a great time.
24945,I spent all night afterwards thinking about everything I had to have done wrong.
24946,"The day after the party was a meeting for a community theater production I'm involved in where we did our final read-through and it was just excruciating sitting in a room full of other people who wouldn't shut up long enough for us to get through the whole script and they kept talking about really boring stupid stuff that I know probably isn't boring and stupid but I felt like an actual alien, like I just did not understand why they kept saying these things and it didn't make sense and I hated them all so much and these are people that I'm normally very fond of."
24947,I just wanted to escape all night and I couldn't.
24948,I know I get mean or angry when my anxiety crops up and I always feel so guilty later.
24949,And then tonight was the worst.
24950,"I hung out with my best friends all day, and it was okay but I was dead for a huge chunk of the day and they knew it too, I was just off and zoned out and quiet."
24951,"Later in the evening I went to go see our friend's band with my boyfriend in the city, and normally I love going to these shows and seeing everyone, but tonight I had one of the worst anxiety attacks I've ever experienced."
24952,"I couldn't breathe right, I was dizzy and scared and hated everything about myself, I kept thinking that everyone there hated me and wished I would just die, just leave them alone forever, that I was ugly and stupid looking and I hadn't dressed right and my hair was wet from the shower and I hadn't done my make-up because we had to leave early and I'd run out of time and it was one of the worst nights I've had in a long time."
24953,"I had to borrow a friend's inhaler just to be able to inhale enough that I felt I wouldn't die, and my face just... wouldn't smile."
24954,"My boyfriend could tell I was freaking out and tried so hard to cheer me up but I just couldn't even be there, I wasn't present at all."
24955,"He kept trying to touch me and hold my hand and hug me to make it better but I just couldn't, having him hold me made me want to vomit and cry."
24956,I feel so horrible.
24957,I'm so scared and out of control and I have so many commitments that I cannot back out of and I don't know what to do.
24958,"I've been chain-smoking for the past few days because it's the only thing keeping me even a little bit grounded, it'll pull me back from the brink for a moment when I'm falling apart."
24959,I feel awful though because I want to quit and I finally told my boyfriend that I was smoking and I know he hates it but he's not even disappointed but I'm just so scared everyone will leave.
24960,I'm sorry this is so long.
24961,"**tl;dr: I'm having the worst anxiety attacks I've ever experienced in a very short period of time with little explanation, I think I might be losing my grip on reality, I'm constantly terrified and nervous, and I need help."
24962,**
24963,"No meds; started therapy for the first time a week ago) 

Hey everyone."
24964,"The worst part is that she HAS anxiety, and takes medicine for it."
24965,"I've had SEVERE strep that isn't responding to treatment and therefore I've been on heavy pain meds and I can't make the usual 45 minute drive which he never makes anymore.. when his recent lack of communication was brought up, I got this; ""Sorry if textin hasn't been one of my major concerns lately the only the only topic seems to be your illness which blocks the conversation because you can't visit me and there's a reason I can't visit you that I can't tell you because it puts me in a lot of danger but also puts at us an impass meanwhile I'm finding myself more and more attracted to thinner more available women all around me and your insecurity and lack of motivation is making me unattracted to you therefore less reason to want to hold conversations with you MY sex drive is out of control and at this point you can't satisfy it in lake charles"" I can't stop shaking.. no one can calm me down.."
24966,"If I'm ill then I take medicine, get rest, drink water and wait... then it's fixed."
24967,"No, I haven't tried medication and very possibly will soon but I've got the same reservations as many, the feeling being artificial, any other affects it might have, becoming dependent."
24968,"Basically this weekend he decided he needed to get help, we (or more accurately he) decided we shouldn't move in together yet, and he made a doctors appointment (we live in Canada, insurance covers all appointments and most meds)."
24969,"I don't take meds, I never have done and I don't want to."
24970,"I can't keep not sleeping, I can't talk to my mum, and I can't ask her about making a doctors appt, as she is very anti-western medicine."
24971,"She thinks that because she gets past ""anxiety"" without medication, so should I."
24972,"BTW, I've been around the medication block several times, I'm currently on Lexapro 20 mg, and clonazepam .5 mg."
24973,"I do not take my anxiety meds before work because I am worried that it will affect my ability to concentrate and be a successful, hard worker."
24974,I went to counselling and was taking medication every day.
24975,"But because she had studied physiology as well as medicine she knew how the body functioned normally, as well as when diseased."
24976,"I knew it was related to my anxiety, and since learning how to deal with myself I no longer take the immunosuppressants or any other type of medication."
24977,"I feel so helpless.... Also, I'm afraid of what meds he'll be prescribed."
24978,Had one course of cbt a few years back but am not on medication or in therapy currently.
24979,Or should I just forget about meds in altogether?
24980,"I've changed medication several times, and it only seems to amplify those feelings of anxiety and depression."
24981,"Currently, I'm not taking my medication, as it just makes it really hard to sleep and amplifies whatever I'm feeling at the current time."
24982,"I was thinking that it could be due to my hypothyroid, since I stopped taking my meds about a year ago."
24983,I visited with my doctor last Wednesday knowing that I needed to get back on medication {I was on Prozac at one point in time.}
24984,"I read about all the terrible side effects before starting this medication, and even about the withdrawal horror stories."
24985,"I struggle with the pride of knowing I am reliant on a couple pills to keep me stable, but I must remember that just with any other medical condition, it's not my fault and sometimes medication is the best option."
24986,The first 5 days on this medication sucked.
24987,I am on medication to help regulate it and I live a pretty normal life.
24988,Taking any meds is out of the question because they knock me out and I need to be able to drive.
24989,"I tried psychiatry, psychology, various meds, until finally I found a combination of therapy and meds that worked."
24990,"I weaned myself off the meds 4 years ago and have been blissfully free of panic attacks until last night, out of the blue at 3am...WHAM."
24991,So I'll try to make this as short as I can...
24992,I've been dealing with a lot of crap for a few years and it's lead to both very prominent depression and anxiety/panic attacks.
24993,"Things were looking up for a while in 2012 and half of 2013, but the rest has just been a rebound of horrible things and feelings ripping the rug out from underneath my feet, and I wasn't prepared for it at all."
24994,"First a bump appeared on my nose that a doctor said might have been a type of skin cancer [though it was later proven to be just a normal growth and is looked at every once in a while] but the fear of 'what if' brought my anxiety back, and things started going downhill from there."
24995,"The initial nose bump fear was out of my mind, but then everything else started to get to me whether it be my dysfunctional family who wonder what I have to be depressed/anxious about despite years of me having to deal with alcoholism/fighting/horrible school bullying, or now a current and more pressing problem of how I cannot get my mind off of my breathing."
24996,"It's hard enough to get used to the shaking, the cold feeling in my chest, the rapid heartbeats-- the stupid questions of whether or not I'm dying or if someone I love is alright... questions that have nothing to do with the situations I'm in pop up like weeds and no matter what I do I can't shut them off."
24997,"I'm now feeling like I'm never getting enough air, on top of everything else."
24998,Usually I'd just feel like that during panic/anxiety attacks but now I feel it ALL THE TIME... And I can't stop consciously breathing which I'm sure is the cause.
24999,"I've tried breathing exercises, channeling my thoughts, trying to distract myself..."
25000,"It just keeps coming back, and that whole 'fear of dying' thing doesn't make things any easier."
25001,"I don't know what to do-- I'll be going to the clinic tomorrow to speak to a doctor, but lately it's hard to even get out of bed."
25002,"If I sit up I feel out of breath, and if I involve my family they act like it's all a big inconvenience to them and refuse to understand why I'm feeling the way I do, so I can't involve them."
25003,"I've been looking into anti-anxiety medications like Xanax and such, but from what I've seen on reddit while reading people's experiences with them, it all just seems so... scary."
25004,I don't know what to do; I feel like it's taking over my whole life.
25005,"I'm sorry that this wasn't very short as I'd hoped it would be, and I hope I explained it enough.."
25006,"So I got on some meds, started eating waaay better and exercising and it really worked!"
25007,"Because it's a supplement, not a medication - i.e."
25008,"I was lucky to keep my job and have a wonderful family to stand by me as I took a month to get my head back in the game, let the meds stabilize, etc."
25009,BACKSTORY: About two months ago I began taking a SSRI medication to help with my anxiety.
25010,We started off on an insanely low dosage for two weeks until I got used to taking the medicine.
25011,(I was SUPER anxious about side effects and I was terrified of taking medication to begin with.)
25012,There were a few side effects but they calmed down after a week or two.
25013,"However, once we upped the dosage to something more helpful that's when a really aggravating side effect eased in and has taken root in my life."
25014,"I have a distinct lack of sex drive, but more importantly, I rarely can experience orgasms anymore."
25015,I've always been very .... eager to engage in sexual activities but I have just slowly lost interest more and more from a purely physical stand point.
25016,Actual intercourse just feels numb half the time and the other half it feels awesome but there's no bang in sight and I feel frustrated which just ensures nothing will happen.
25017,I still have a lot of sex with my significant other but I think that's because it satisfies me emotionally and mentally more than it does physically.
25018,"I've discussed this with him (actually, even before I started taking the medicine since I knew it could do this) and we both agreed that my peace of mind (and his since he worries about me) was worth anything we'd need to work through."
25019,He's been a champ too.
25020,He's gone out of his way to learn some new techniques to help me out in the bedroom but I still feel.... less attractive?
25021,now that I'm unable to orgasm.
25022,I'm not concerned about my relationship or anything and I know I could try other medications but I don't have any other side effects so it doesn't seem worth it to start over when I feel AMAZING otherwise.
25023,"It just helps to talk about it, you know?"
25024,Has anyone else had a similar experience?
25025,How did it make you feel and what did you do about it?
25026,"Once it was diagnosed, I was on anti-anxiety meds for a while, and had an MRI, and everything cleared up."
25027,I never took medication or had a session with a therapist.
25028,I'm also off my meds (Concerta) because they were not doing anything for me.
25029,"TL; DR:  I started having crippling Anxiety and Panic attacks about a year ago, I dealt with it thanks to my doc, and meds."
25030,I'm not on any medications for my anxiety as of right now.
25031,I am in nursing school right now so my anxiety has shot through the roof.
25032,Today I had a test where I had to use needles.
25033,"I calmed myself down before the test and didn't feel too nervous during the test (usually my heart is pounding, hands sweat, etc), but my hands were still VERY shaky."
25034,Which is embarrassing and dangerous in my future profession.
25035,Any ideas on how to keep the hand shaking to a minimum?
25036,I appreciate all input!
25037,"But since im on effexor I can't have any fun, a couple drinks send me into madness, and I'm always worrying about being on meds all the time."
25038,"Long story short - I'm on a few meds, a daily anti depressant, and ""as needed"" benzos, and just recently seroquel for sleep which barely works and it not working even at higher doses pisses me off because it knocks most people out with 25 or 50mg, I'm doing up to 300mg at night and not sleeping through the night."
25039,"It had been two years since I had my last (small) panic attack, and I'm currently on the process of suppressing my long-term meds (1 month to go)."
25040,"I've noticed with anxiety I see the world differently than many around me, my parents believe anxiety is something you grow out of, and medication is not the way to go (idc what they think)."
25041,"Hello, I have a question about medication."
25042,"In times like these, babying ourselves can be the best medicine."
25043,I've given up looking for cures to the pain and panic attacks because no medicine or therapy works.
25044,This is the third medication I tried in six months time.
25045,"I'm going for a review of my medication on Thursday, so I'll be begging my GP for something to help alleviate the pain, but I'm already on a high dose of very strong painkillers, so I'm worried that it's something I'm going to have to put up with."
25046,Would meds be helpful?
25047,"Im already taking xanax, which takes the edge off, but i think this is beyond what medication can control."
25048,So now I am anxious because my anxiety meds are stuck in my esophagus.
25049,"They gave me medicine, and told me to lay back and try to relax my breathing."
25050,"I go home that night, calm as can be with the medicine coursing through my veins, and just sit on the couch and try to understand what just happened."
25051,I hate how anxiety makes me so paranoid.
25052,I hate how anxiety makes me second guess every fucking relationship I’ve ever had.
25053,I hate how anxiety makes me lose friends over tiny little things.
25054,I hate how anxiety never lets me have a full night of sleep.
25055,I hate how anxiety fuels my depression.
25056,I hate how anxiety make me sick.
25057,I hate how anxiety cancels my plans for me.
25058,I hate how anxiety made me go so far as to think about killing myself everyday.
25059,I hate how anxiety medications think they can solve everything but once one thing goes away another thing shows up.
25060,"But most of all, I hate how anxiety makes me hate myself and how every day is just so hard to keep going."
25061,I try so hard to make progress and to get over my fears but every night I still wake up and the voice in my head tells me I’m not good enough.
25062,Maybe I am crazy.
25063,Maybe all these thoughts in my head are right.
25064,Maybe I should just give up.
25065,"I'm getting some mild side effects, but I'm also feeling a lot more depression and no anxiety (the meds make me more anxious for whatever reason)."
25066,Did I screw up the one and a half weeks I've been taking this medication by waiting so long in between doses?
25067,"Basically my last doctor won't give me any sort of benzo-type medication because I have really bizarre reactions to them (for example, hallucinations), but I have terrible feelings of panic and anxiety that last for days and days and seriously damage my quality of life."
25068,"I neglected to ask about alcohol and the medication, since I am typically a light drinker."
25069,"If I avoid the medication for hours/days ahead, would that be enough to safeguard against incident?"
25070,"Please make it stop, I can't do anything anymore, all I can do is worry, I took the medicine but it isn't helping, this anxiety is literally going to kill me."
25071,Was prescribed some sort of medication but my parents threw it out after i made a joke (complete joke) that i was going to sell it in school.I went to the hospital twice convinced i was going to die or have a heart attack.
25072,"I have also been diagnosed with depression and have been fighting it, without medication, for the past 6 months."

25099,"Also, there's a 0% chance of me getting meds to take care of this, so any advice involving meds is useless for me."
25100,"I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for roughly 6 years now, on and off."
25101,"I've been on Zoloft, Prozac &amp; Ativan."
25102,I managed to escape to France two years ago to teach &amp; my anxiety and panic attacks magically disappeared; I was able to stop taking my medications &amp; enjoy the world as it was meant to be experienced.
25103,"&amp; then 3 or 4 months ago, they returned."
25104,"It started with a stretch, pulling a muscle that made my inner hypochondriac think ""ohmygod, it's your heart."""
25105,"This progressed quickly, and I relapsed into that cycle I was in during high school of ""what am I dying from today?"
25106,is my heart going to fail?
25107,"is my headache a brain tumor?"""
25108,It's silly.
25109,"We all recognize the silliness of it, yet we still let these thoughts overtake us regularly."
25110,The cycle of thoughts came with the anxiety.
25111,"The blurriness, fuzziness, dream-like state, complete discomfort with life, wondering why I have to feel like this &amp; why I can't feel like a normal human being."
25112,Why I can't live my life happily.
25113,And I finally found this subreddit.

25122,"Baby steps, my darlings."
25123,Any input on meds at all would be greatly appreciated.
25124,I went to see another doctor who said that he thought that that medication was a heavy handed way of dealing with my anxiety and prescribed me propanolol when I felt anxious.
25125,"I was on the following meds at one point or another: Zoloft, Seroquel, Xanax, Klonopin."
25126,I am not too concerned with side effects as I can tolerate meds pretty well.
25127,I have ADHD but my medication does not help my anxiety.
25128,I have been to counselling and CBT to help myself get through everyday life and for the most part it has really helped- I refuse to be on medication however due to a bad past experience and I personally believe I can work through the problems with enough brain power.
25129,"(That is not to say anyone who IS on medication doesn’t have the brain power, it is a personal thing for me."
25130,I would urge anyone to try medication if they believe they really want it and their doctors give them the option.)
25131,I don't know how to tell my parents that I probably need to see a psychiatrist and possibly get on some meds.
25132,"She had a very bad time at around age 12, hospitalised for two weeks at one stage, but things seemed to get better when she got medication and some therapy."
25133,They also don't have much money for expensive medication or therapy.
25134,"I have made myself as educated as possible about the insertion, but as usual it only helps so much

TLDR; I'm anxious about timing of anti-anxiety medication"
25135,I just got a rx for lorazepam just in case I need it tomorrow while I'm flying.
25136,I get extremely anxious flying (especially during take off).
25137,I am already on 10mg escitalopram and I'm wondering if anyone has experience with using these two medications.
25138,I'm just so nervous about having a panic attack and I'm going by myself so I have no one with me to help calm me down:(
25139,"It's been at least 6 weeks since I started on the medication and I have went from 5'11"" and 165 lbs to 152 lbs and have noticed changes in my stool."
25140,"If it works out, I'll be bumped up to 20 mg

Who's been on this medication?"
25141,I've gone through so many meds.
25142,I would like to be able to handle my anxiety without the aid of medication(Mostly because I can never remember to take my medication anyway) Anyone have any good techniques?
25143,"I will say that these meds helped me (saved my current relationship, in all likelihood)."
25144,I know some people do not like taking their meds and will find any excuse to discontinue but since switching from Zoloft to Lexapro the side effects are minimal and I don't mind taking it at all.
25145,"I am petrified that without my medicine I am going to get overly mad at either my work kids or my own, or that I am going to become so anxious that I won't be able to be around them and end up fired."
25146,"But today I got some medicine with simethicone (otc stomach almost all has this) in it and my stomach got quiet, and I'm really relaxed right now."
25147,I'm hoping this will go away because I love these meds.
25148,I'm hoping this is my body getting used to the meds.
25149,The medicine helps somewhat and the relaxation stuff my therapist has recommended helps a little but only short term (I feel better for an hour or so).
25150,"P.S  I know my meds are working, my heart hasn't jumped out of my throat nor is it racing."
25151,"My insurance from the new job has only been in effect for about a month, and my dr. appointment to get back on my meds is tomorrow."
25152,In the last week or two I have dropped my medication dosage of escitalopram (lexapro) from 20mg a day to 10mg.
25153,Os this dangerous when starting fluoxetine or doing it at all on the medication?
25154,"I'm going to ask for her professional opinion on medication and therapy, particularly if he has any recommendations on someone he thinks can help me."
25155,"Birth control interferes with my medication, so I don't take it and instead use the more conventional methods of birth control."
25156,"After two years on medication, I'm feeling more stable than ever in my life."
25157,"I am schizophrenic (a mild case and it's under control with meds) and a double amputee (makes walking a chore and driving impossible for now, so getting around is a huge hassle)."
25158,Are the meds really necessay/helpful for me?
25159,I told my husband i want to try a new medication and he got mad and told me i just need to stick with something.
25160,My first day on the meds I wrote 2 and a half term papers!
25161,"I lasted just 2 months on these meds because the insomnia was pretty bad, but also I started building up this extreme agitation and social avoidance."
25162,"I saw a psychologist for six months, and was put on some meds that seemed to work at the time."
25163,"I know that my pharmacy will give out a few days' worth of emergency pills for things like blood pressure medication, but I have no idea if they'll do that for me."
25164,Its really getting out of hand and I don't want to take anxiety related medicine unless I'm truly forced too.
25165,"My second year in therapy I felt basically no better, I decided to try medication as well."
25166,"After six months on this medication I stated being able to be social again, I still had symptoms of anxiety but the full blown panic attacks were gone, so my confidence rose each time I went for a walk or caught up with a friend (which was still very rare and included a lot of last minute panic bails on my part)."
25167,She was on medication but worked very hard to get off of it.
25168,I don't know anything else I can do at this point to help myself other than medication.
25169,"I personally see nothing wrong with medication, but all the stigma that goes with it scares me."
25170,I also have friends who talk about meds being a 'crutch' only weak people need.
25171,I'm hoping that a mix of counseling and medication will help me enough that I won't need to do either for the rest of my life...
25172,"Please don't tell me to see a psychiatrist or take meds, because neither are options for me due to financial strain."
25173,Why do anxiety medications make us tired?
25174,Is it the idea that if we are tired we won't have the energy to have an attack?
25175,Because being tire makes it more likely that I will have an anxiety attack.
25176,I'm at work and I forgot my Anxiety medicine at home...I can't leave work to go get it.....
25177,I am seeing a psych and taking meds but it doesn't seem like it's helping.
25178,I started medicine but went off of it when I moved back home.
25179,Made me feel like a drug addict cause I know people can abuse anxiety meds.
25180,"I'm on new medication, but I would love to find another way to try and fix these issues."
25181,Mental illness runs in the family ( mother is bi-polar but the truckload of meds she is on now enables her true good self to now be exposed....and our relationship is good ) I  have been an extremely anxious and self conscious depressed individual since as far back as I can remember ( even kindergarten).
25182,"The anxiety and BDD runs my life,  I am on a medication now after finally accepting that i have to try something again, and was on a slew of meds all throughout my high school years...to no avail...only tranquilizers seem to help....but i take them sparingly because they can be habit forming."
25183,"I ended up getting prescribed to a few anti depressants and anti-anxiety meds (such as celexa, lorazespam)."
25184,"I wish lorazespam would help with the shakes but nothing has helped yet, meds like novo pranol make me want to fall asleep."
25185,"All the other medication is far too long-term to be effective, and I've yet to see any lasting results from it."
25186,"I'm willing to take any other medication a doctor tells me to take in conjunction with it, but antidepressants alone aren't going to fix that."
25187,I took time off to get my meds figured out and got to a good place early this year.
25188,I am still seeing the psychiatrist and the psychology and taking medication.
25189,"I was considering switching doctors a few months ago, but we finally found a medication that was showing a lot of promise, so I decided to try to stick it out and get to the right dose."
25190,I already scheduled an appointment with another provider and requested a release of all my medication information.
25191,Many years ago I discovered for better or worse that heroin was a fantastic medication for many of my difficulties.
25192,"Now, because I am stupid enough to be honest with my doctors, when I moved away from the doc who prescribed my anti-anxiety meds, I was unable to find a doctor to believe that I needed them."
25193,Being on medication in the past hasn't helped.
25194,I do not have health insurance and have run out of my anxiety medication.
25195,"I'm 18 (a guy), I can't drive, get a job, or go to college."
25196,"I shake constantly, unless I'm in my room by myself."
25197,"I get sweaty and paranoid, frequently have to urinate, get restless and can't sit still, can't sleep at night, have a shy bladder if I'm not at home."
25198,"Every time I step out of my parents house I feel like I'm making a complete idiot of myself, and I bomb anything under pressure, especially if someone's watching."
25199,"I usually just do work for my parents, but even working in my yard is hard for me, I always feel like my neighbours are watching/judging me from their windows."
25200,"Haven't gone to an actual high school in two years, since I switched to an alternative one, and haven't talked to any of my old friends since then except two, and I get pretty anxious texting them, let alone going somewhere with them."
25201,"I've tried lots of different medications, meditating, counsellors, even neurofeedback, but I still feel the way I did then."
25202,"I want more than anything to turn my life around and be independent, be proud of myself, but it's just so discouraging because I can't function enough to do it."
25203,"Anyways, that was my rant..."
25204,Thanks for listening.
25205,Maybe it's too soon to really be sure and the medicine isn't working at its peak yet.
25206,How bad is it to actually drink while on medication?
25207,"i went to a shrink once a month, occasionally took meds."
25208,I have been seeing a specialty doctor for 4 months now and all he does is prescribe me medication and up my doses.
25209,"I dont have meds to take, deep breathing only gets me so far, and theres usually something I need to go get up and do right then and cant relax and lie down."
25210,I've been on anxiety meds for more than 5 years now and none of them worked.
25211,"I've been turned on to these cannabis strands though and it's peaked my interest, I honestly don't like taking meds, my goal is to get off of them and function normally."
25212,I hate the idea of taking narcotics and prescription meds...
25213,Are there any other kinds of medication I could try?
25214,Is the nausea just a phase in adjusting to the medication?
25215,"When I was prescribed the medicine, my Dr said I could go off a 50mg dose with no side effects at any time, but after looking it up online, it looks like that might not be true."
25216,"Straight anxiety meds I can only use as a bandaid because unless I'm acutely anxious, they put me to sleep."
25217,"Today my therapist said that I'm pretty much out of options, medication-wise, because I've tried everything."
25218,It's 4:46 in the morning.
25219,I haven't slept all night.
25220,All I can think about is how I want out.
25221,"I'm living in this mental prison, trapped by my perceptions and lacking control over my destiny."
25222,Nothing feels real.
25223,"Everything seems to all be so close, almost as if everything exists within one single one dimensional point in a multidimensional landscape, yet at the same time everything seems so distant."
25224,It's as if I'm stuck perceiving fleeting sensations at these undefined points in an imaginary universe unable to break free of this function that I am bound to with no real sense of time or space.
25225,The only thing that feels real to me is music.
25226,I can't explain it but it seems to be the one concrete thing in this constantly shifting false projection of a world that I am stuck in.
25227,"I'm not really sure why I'm posting this right now as I am almost sure that everything I see and hear and feel isn't really there, but perhaps something or someone here may be able to lend some clarity to my situation."
25228,My memory is very fragmented and difficult to access.
25229,Even trying to remember things moment to moment is almost impossible.
25230,It seems like no matter what nothing exists before or after the precise point in space/time that I am currently in.
25231,"If I really try hard I can grab bits an pieces, small millisecond snapshots of other things that may or may not have actually happened to me but I never feel like I can trust these."
25232,What I believe is true at this point in time is that I am 18.
25233,I live with my parents in my little brother and I am in my fifth year of high school due to my academic failings resulting from a number of factors.
25234,At a young age I was diagnosed with severe ADHD and hopped from one medication to the next until my freshman year of high school at which point the side effects had become too much and I abandoned medication in an attempt to learn self control and deal with my misgivings on a personal level.
25235,"As a child I was tested and shown to have an incredibly high IQ, if I remember somewhere in the 150's-160's although I can't remember the number specifically."
25236,"In fourth grade I was transferred to a special school that had a highly gifted program for other ""exceptional"" children."
25237,Nearly from birth I was essentially raised by a babysitter being that both of my parents worked full time jobs in retail meaning that I only saw them on their days off and briefly in the mornings and evenings.
25238,"As a child I was always incredibly outgoing but was ultimately rejected socially both due to my lack of socialization as a child, my intelligence and my height."
25239,"My entire life I've been incredibly short and young looking, often being mistaken for an elementary school student even into my freshman year of high school."
25240,I was mistook for a thirteen year old just yesterday when I tried to open a checking account at the bank.
25241,"The bullying and rejection over time turned me into a rather solitary individual, eventually resulting to me keeping to myself more often than not."
25242,"Even amongst the other gifted children I was an outcast, being physically and verbally bullied up until my sophomore year of high school."
25243,"I was always incredibly underweight as well, a clear side effect of my medication."
25244,"Up until this point all of these things may seem completely irrelevant to anxiety, but alas here is where it comes in to play."
25245,"As a child I was raised in a fairly agnostic household, attending a Unitarian fellowship as a child (my mother being catholic and my father being generally non-religious) and religion was never forced upon me or even really discussed with me."
25246,"Right around the age of seven or eight, I began having extreme anxiety and panic attacks."
25247,These were a result of my recently acquired fear of death.
25248,"I wasn't a pronounced atheist until middle school, but I was always fairly sure that there was no afterlife."
25249,I can remember having terrible nauseating panic attacks sitting in the bathtub alone at night while my parents were off reading or watching television.
25250,These intensified once I began taking higher doses of various medications.
25251,At school I would suddenly be afraid to do anything lest I were to injure myself.
25252,I wouldn't be able to touch paper for fear of getting cut; I would be unable to eat for fear of choking to death.
25253,I couldn't play games in gym class out of sheer fright of tripping and breaking my head open.
25254,For these reasons I began therapy.
25255,"I can't remember exactly when it was that I started, but I began seeing a therapist somewhat regularly all the way through my sophomore year of high school."
25256,He suggested that I may have had Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Attack Disorder.
25257,Right before we were going to look into treatment I for whatever reason stopped having these extreme anxiety attacks.
25258,"They eventually came back, gradually consuming my life once more, but for one reason or another I had already stopped going to therapy at this time."
25259,It should be noted that at this time I was also an extreme germophobe and a compulsive hand washer for a good two years straight.
25260,"At any rate, I can't really remember much of anything after going off of medication."
25261,"Everything sort of became a haze at that point, but from what I remember I was somewhat happier."
25262,Which brings me to now.
25263,I've been experiencing the feelings mentioned at the beginning of this post for as long as I can remember now.
25264,I don't know when they started but they consume me.
25265,I don't know what is wrong but I just want out.
25266,I want to break free of these mental chains.
25267,It's as is I'm sitting here forced to experience life through this hazey fogged up lense with no real control over everything and everything feels completely surreal.
25268,"Difficulties with memory, frequent anxiety attacks, feelings of hopelessness, depression, lack of control."
25269,Help me Reddit.
25270,I want a way out.
25271,"EDIT: I forgot to mention as well, my entire life starting in childhood I've had extreme insomnia and problems with night terrors."
25272,"I want to succeed in school, and it seems like this medication is wasting my time."
25273,Any tips on how to conquer this without meds?
25274,"The only way I can describe the comparison is using the following videos:

[Before the Celexa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cVlTeIATBs&amp;t=7s)

[Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv_JTjYYaQI&amp;t=32s)


My hopes with this post is that someone who is on the fence about trying medication will see that meds can actually help."
25275,"I am in therapy, I am on meds, I try to eat right but I can't get any consistent rest, except on the weekends I sleep until 2:00 in the afternoon because of the depression."
25276,"Some lingering problems seem to have permanently raised my baseline anxiety, but therapy and medication have helped me keep moving forward."
25277,I have been off of the medicine i usually take (Paxil) for a few days while i wait for the perscription to be renewed.
25278,"I don't know if this is anxiety, and if anyone is curious about what meds I take, I take vyvanse for ADHD and maybe this plays a factor in anxiety, but I just wanted to know if anyone else experiences this?"
25279,"It's taken me so much therapy and medication to get this far (applying for a job, getting an interview and accepting it) and I can't screw it up because financially I need this job."
25280,I don't know where to even start but I guess I'll just go down my list right now.
25281,I have been trouble getting to sleep like it take 1-3 hours to fall asleep for me.
25282,If I wake up in the middle of the night there goes another hour of me trying to get to sleep.
25283,I have just started to change medications from paxil to viibryd It is too early to tell if that is going to work.
25284,I have also quit smoking so thats just another thing that isn't helping me right now since I use to go outside have a cigarette and take a few moments to just think.
25285,I failed 2 exams last week and am worried about my gpa.
25286,I have been taking my klonipin almost daily and some days it doesn't seem to help at all.
25287,I have lost interest in video games and tv shows that i use to love.
25288,And the worst of all I think I'm losing one of my best friends at college.
25289,She has been distant from me and won't even hold a conversation with me anymore but acts the same that she use to around most of her other friends.
25290,I just feel like everything is happening at once and I'm just about to break down and cry.
25291,a month ago I felt fine and my anxiety was pretty low for me.
25292,It wasn't a daily thing like it has been.
25293,I guess I just needed to finally get that all out there and vent and look for some help/Advise.
25294,"I'm a writer who's all out of words when they're constantly running through my head, a painter who's vision is simply that of my own sanity stitched together with my own thoughts rather than the medication that the doctor perscribed me."
25295,"So what I want to ask is, should I talk to my doctor about upping my medicine?"
25296,I don't even think he fully understood and suggested medicine for high bp.
25297,I'm on medication for depression and anxiety and have noticed that during the few days leading up to my period my anxiety goes through the roof.
25298,About 5 years ago I attempted to put on weight (I was 105lbs and 5'10'' at the time).
25299,"Shortly after attempting to do so I started feeling very nauseous in the mornings, particularly on mornings where I would be out and about."
25300,"I had extreme trouble eating anything throughout the day, 0 appetite and gagging when attempting to eat."
25301,"These symptoms would reduce as the day progressed, until I could eat in the late evening."
25302,"I approached my doctor who conducted various blood tests, but unsurprisingly there was nothing wrong with my digestive system."
25303,"Fast forward to today, currently 22yo male 125lbs."
25304,I'm finding that social scenarios (particularly involving food) reduce my appetite to 0 and prevent me from eating AT ALL.
25305,"Anything i try to eat makes me physically sick, even sometimes the smell of food will make me throw up (especially if I'm with other people)."
25306,"I have not been out for a meal in many many years with friends as I know that I will not be able to eat anything, and sometimes just the thought of interacting over food makes me feel nauseous."
25307,"I do not worry, or panic."
25308,I am very relaxed which is perhaps why it has taken me 5 years to really start trying to fix this.
25309,"Recently I have lost my appetite for 3 weeks, I cannot eat anything before around 11pm in the evening, and even then I have to force myself to eat."
25310,I'm losing weight at an incredible rate and even fluids during the day are a hassle.
25311,"I am groggy and slow, I have to stay inside for the majority of the day as going outside will make me unable to eat even in the evening."
25312,"Thinking about it, over the last 5 years I have never desired food, or felt hunger."
25313,"I have asked my GP about Remeron/Mirtazapine in order to stimulate my appetite, but this medication seems to be aimed at people with major depression."
25314,"I am not overwhelmingly sad all the time, perhaps becoming increasingly numb if anything."
25315,Is it likely that these medications will help me?
25316,I am now on a new medication for management of my panic attacks and anxiety problems.
25317,"As it is a strong and immediate acting medication, I can say that it has already helped me in a very positive manner."
25318,"This new medication has helped me realize his advice, and I am having less anxiety and stress since taking what he has given me."
25319,"I've been advised that sertraline is the best medication to deal with my anxiety and depression, since fluoxetine didn't really work for me, but I've also been advised that propanolol can be used to treat the physical symptoms of anxiety."
25320,I initially had fears of meds.
25321,I have so much empathy to you guys - especially those who have difficulties finding the right meds and have suffered this their whole life.
25322,I'm 29 and have been off meds since I was a teenager.
25323,"I'm trying to get back on medication now, but my works insurance is spotty so it's been hard getting a prescription."
25324,"I don't even know why I'm writing this 

Does anyone have any success stories with meds?"
25325,For the past 2 years I had it under control with no need of medication until recently.
25326,"I am not suffering from a rash-presumably due to my anxiety medication, but I am having a terrible time catching my breath."
25327,"I've never taken medication for my anxiety, but I'm open to anything."
25328,"I also had bad acne (I would eventually have lazer and take medication,you wouldn't really know it as bad now.)"
25329,"Hello everyone,

My sister has been diagnosed with anticipatory anxiety, she has some medication for it that she takes at night."
25330,Is there anything that can help me relax that isn't medication?
25331,"Hi guys, I ended up seeking help with my doctor for the first time and I ended up getting prescribed paxil as my first medication to try."
25332,They gave me anti-anxiety meds and I felt a million times better.
25333,"By the end of high school my anxiety reached the point that it became a serious problem and I received some counseling, exposure therapy, and medication."
25334,"I was put on medication (Celexa, then Prozac), and had individual and group counseling (primarily CBT, and some Acceptance Commitment Therapy)."
25335,"I weened myself off of the medication, and I feel that I am once again productive and making good progress."
25336,"As one might expect, getting off medication has brought up my anxiety level a bit."
25337,The various anti-anxiety medication I've been prescribed doesn't help and often triggers panic attacks or increases my anxiety.
25338,I'm kind of wondering what I do next if therapy isn't working and medication isn't working.
25339,He finally had the balls to prescribe me medicine.
25340,"Anyways the meds started working so I began the Hell that is coming off of klonopin... became agoraphobic, but eventually I was able to go out without any klonopin."
25341,anyways the viibryd was about the same as when i was on the other meds.
25342,so that brings us to what meds i'm on currently.
25343,Basically the ADHD meds are not doing anything right now cause the anxiety is just to much to handle anything.
25344,Last night I did probably a big no no and took 2 of my anxiety medication (that's prescribed) and a half a Xanax an hour later when I realized my meds weren't working.
25345,After the first two years I gave in and went on medication (Citalopram) it seemed to be working.
25346,I'm not on meds right now but I'm seeing a psychologist.
25347,"Anxiety, you've taken over my childhood, my adolescence, my life."
25348,"At just 17 years old, you have me bedridden and quite literally, paralyzed."
25349,You have been with me since kindergarten and back then I was naive enough to think all children felt how I did.
25350,"As i've gotten older, you've only gotten worse."
25351,You are resistant to relaxation exercises and medications.
25352,"You've put me in the hospital more than once, but even the doctors couldn't help."
25353,I feel so helpless laying in my bed as you make my thoughts race and breathing shallow.
25354,The daily nausea you create is unbearable.
25355,"You have driven me away from a social life, school, and anything else that represents a normal life."
25356,You make me snap at everyone around me and I feel like my brain is fried.
25357,"Anxiety, you have won."
25358,You have defeated me.
25359,"Because of you, I have decided to end my life."
25360,Thank you for never allowing me to experience normality.
25361,Thank you for ruining my life.
25362,I am not taking any medication yet but I feel like I might want to try.
25363,"I find that the medicine have lowered my basic symptoms, but when something like either a depressive mood or anxiety attack comes, then it's like the medicine isn't in my system during that time."
25364,"But besides that, i like my medicine for how it helps me in my everyday life."
25365,I'm on meds but they don't help (anti anxiety meds).
25366,"I've struggled with anxiety my whole life but not really realized it until this year, recently started sertraline and it has made a WORLD of difference in my life and I'm finally able to confront my anxiety and start looking at non-medication solutions for the long run."
25367,I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to approach talking about medication with a therapist.
25368,I'm trying to get a referral for a psychiatrist while I'm home for a while and I want to make it known that I interested in adding medication to my treatment but just the thought of brining it up makes me super anxious.
25369,I'm not exactly sure what I'm worried about other than my parents have always been big advocates of not needing medication in order to get better (that and that my anxiety is me just being dramatic but that's a different story lol).
25370,"Anyways, I was just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to talk about medication."
25371,"Title pretty much clears everything up - I'm 17, I don't like the sound of any medication that people take and I don't know where to start with therapy."
25372,"I'm 23f and not on any meds (probably should be, but afraid of approaching therapist)."
25373,I've always had chronic anxiety problems but my parents are against medications.
25374,"I'm not American, so in my country even in college we depend on our parents and live with them."
25375,My mother is my main and only support as my father is a very rough and carefree person who has always looked down upon me.
25376,"3 months ago my mother had a sudden ""high pressure"" incident, her blood pressure went from 120/70 to 150/100 on a pinch, and I thought she was about to have a heart failure and die."
25377,She was taken out of the hospital that same day since she was out of risks and doctors told her she might have hypertension because of her overweight.
25378,Since that day I started thinking about death every time.
25379,"Before that, I was much more relaxed and happy, but now I see ambulances, funerary cars and cancer and heart disease information everywhere."
25380,"I started obsessing with her condition, and saw she could have one of many types of cancer and/or heart diseases."
25381,"Tho some of her symtomps are overweight-related, the tought of her dying of cancer or a heart disease always returns, and I ask her every time of the day how's she feeling."
25382,"I grew to see even the slightest cough or hiccups as a sign of a killer disease, not only in my mother, but when it happens with a friend I immediately feel uncomfortable and think of death again."
25383,The tought of death goes everywhere with me.
25384,I can't relax since now I relate my favorite activities to that awful feeling of anxiety; enjoyment in my body feels wrong and painful.
25385,"I don't enjoy playing League of Legends, my favorite game."
25386,I don't enjoy watching my favorite anime.
25387,I can't laugh at my favorite comedies.
25388,"Going out with my friends makes me feel in a hurry every time to know how my mother's health is, and then I think that my friends will eventually die and I only feel gloom."
25389,"Heck, I'm going to my first midnight sale next week and I can't help to travel with ""death"" at my side."
25390,"My mother doesn't wants to make herself studies to check on her body, and she's already mad at me since I try to be her ""doctor"" and check diseases on internet."
25391,"I've grown so anxious and ""familiar"" with this gloom that I've even considered killing myself."
25392,You have 3 months of continuous anxiety are unbearable and they're starting to become physically painful.
25393,I just need some help.
25394,So I have had anxiety for three years now and I just started a new medication a month ago.
25395,Back when I was a junior in high school I told my parents I'm going to pursue medicine to become a doctor (preferably a veterinarian.)
25396,"He began his lecture about how medicine is highly competitive, I can't possibly do it, it's not practical and a science degree is useless without pursuing graduate studies."
25397,"I know everyone is different, but I'm wondering what your experiences have been with Zoloft (or other SSRI medicines) and dosage."
25398,"I was put on 50mg, which had a very pronounced effect for the first few weeks, but since then, I'm not so sure."
25399,"It's definitely effective still, I'm just wondering if my anxiety would be better on 100mg instead."
25400,I still get anxiety flare-ups on this dosage.
25401,"My weight is about 130lbs, male, late 20's."
25402,What dosage are you on?
25403,How effective has it been?
25404,What kind of anxiety still happens on your dosage?
25405,That kind of stuff.
25406,"Other things I've tried:

Motion sickness medication
OTC Anti-nausea
Beta-blockers

I started 20mg Fluoxetine a week ago which I hope will help when they start kicking in."
25407,"I have been strongly urged by doctors to use medication but I decided to try counseling (I have been seeing the counselor every two weeks for about 5 months) in conjunction with changing up my lifestyle as far as eating, sleeping and exercising goes."
25408,"I don't have anything against medication, I just want to try everything I can to mindfully manage my anxiety and be able to rely on my own strategies to relax or redirect my emotions in a positive way."
25409,"That said, I would use medication if need be but I feel like I've made progress in understanding my anxiety and what to do when I begin feeling anxious."
25410,"The medication has helped me relax, be open minded and ignore that negative voice in my head."
25411,"I told her this was not a routine follow up or a new issue but more of a ""I need to get back on my meds because things are getting worse type of deal"" (I'm waking up in the middle night having panic attacks) She didn't seem to care and continued to deny me my appointment."
25412,"All I got was a ""of course not, but.."" Anyway, she treated me, gave me meds to last three months and now I have to find a new doc."
25413,My therapist told me at my appointment last week that I was going to be prescribed hydroxyzine and xanax very soon for my anxiety.
25414,"However, I'm also being treated for alcoholism, so that may complicate the process a bit."
25415,But does anyone here have experience with these two medications that they can share?
25416,"How are the side effects, what was/is your opinion of these drugs, and would you recommend something else?"
25417,"I've been suffering from them for about 6 months, but they usually hit me at home(which is why I don't take medication)."
25418,I have anxiety that seems to stick with me 24/7 (Whether I am anxious about something specific or simply anxious about the next time I will be anxious).
25419,I have been seeing a counselor for about 6 weeks and today she suggested that maybe we start some meds.
25420,"On Monday, I will be going to get a prescription for my anxiety."
25421,I don't know exactly what to expect and I am not incredibly excited about being on drugs (it scares me).
25422,What should I expect?
25423,"By starting meds, will I have to continue them for my whole life?"
25424,What medications might a doctor prescribe me so I can do some research and come prepared?
25425,"i developed extreme anxiety for a solid 6 months (this story is not for karma whoring, just thought I'd explain), medication did NOT work for me, as I was very prone to abusing it, so I decided to go off it entirely and just brave the squalls, I went back to the E.R."
25426,"I expressed my concerns regarding medication (used to self medicate many years ago, worried about.addiction) but let her know my.boyfriend and friends were keen to support me and prevent anything like that."
25427,I just started taking hydroxy-zine pam 25 mg for anxiety and wanted to know what others have had this medication and your experience with it.
25428,I was also wondering what experiences everyone has had on this medication and others for anxiety?
25429,"I recently started taking ADHD medication, and it helps so much."
25430,When I felt like I was strong enough I tapered off the meds and was mentally healthy for the following year.
25431,It hasn't full come back yet so I still believe there is hope that I wont have to go back on meds or anything.
25432,"My blood pressure was a little bit high going in, but I've never been big on medication, so instead of taking any anxiety meds before the operation I told them no, I think I'll just do some breathing exercises."
25433,"I felt obviously weird, and for a few minutes I felt like I kind of had to focus on my breathing, but again...without anxiety medication...I relaxed and kept a good attitude, joked with the nurse, etc."
25434,"I even accepted some pain medication, which hit me IMMEDIATELY and  made me feel pretty weird, but I took a short 20 minute nap after they gave it to me no problem."
25435,Is there medication that can help this?
25436,"tl;dr my anxiety and depression symptoms are becoming unbearable, but i'm afraid of becoming addicted to the one medication that can calm me down."
25437,"anyway, i guess this is seeping into the rant/meds/depression categories, but i just needed to reach out...thanks for reading"
25438,I've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks for 4 years and I've recently decided (with much reluctance) to try meds while also going through CBT sessions.
25439,"I feel like the anxiety is out of my control, even when it's tempered by my meds, and the only reason *I'm* not out of control is because I don't have anything to obsess about at the moment."
25440,"I am unable to take medication, not because I don't go to a psychiatrist or I can't afford it but because it makes me ill, I guess I was just wondering if anyone else is / was in my boat and what they do to combat anxiety?"
25441,"I don't even want to think about talking to my psychiatrist, because I really don't think he could help me; I'm already on bipolar medication, and I can't go on any others because of money issues, so what's the point?"
25442,I'm just sharing that it has been exactly two years today since my last panic attack.
25443,I do not know why they started and I do not know why they stopped.
25444,"Therapy, medications and self help were involved to a degree though."
25445,"For all of those out there who are going through some of the worst times of their lives right now:

From experience I KNOW there is always hope."
25446,Things will get better.
25447,I didn't think they ever would for me and I am here now promising you that these moments will pass and you are never alone.
25448,Through counselling and medication I got myself out of this.
25449,"I fully intend on attending therapy again, but medication is something I would rather stay away from since I had a bad experience in the past that I would rather not elaborate on."
25450,"Her uncle is a psychiatrist and prescribed her anxiety medication under her dad's name a few years ago, but her father made her stop taking it because it only made her drowsy."
25451,"Some quick info about me:

* Age: 19
* Gender: Male
* Type of anxiety: Unknown."
25452,"Depression, anxiety, OCD, bipolar, perhaps others such as ADD."
25453,* Trigger examples: Anything?
25454,"I'm not sure :(
* Medications (if any): Currently Zoloft (150mg)

-----

During my first year at college I decided it was time for me to man-up and do something about the challenges I had faced throughout my life."
25455,I seeked out help through my school's counseling and wellness and was able to meet with a counselor and doctor each week to identify my problems and try to combat them.
25456,"Over the past year I have done trials of Effexor, Zoloft, and Xanax, while taking vitamins B and D to help in any way."
25457,These medications have shown no change in the way I feel whatsoever.
25458,"Heck, I would have been satisfied with feeling *anything*, but it's as if I wasn't using the medications at all."
25459,"A few times I even doubled, tripled my dosage; I was afraid of something bad happening but of course it was as if I hadn't taken anything (I should clarify that this was action was only performed by me maybe 5 or 6 times over the course of the year, it was in no way a common thing)."
25460,"The doctor was baffled when I said I didn't notice anything from Xanax, even when I multiplied my dosage several times in an effort to feel something."
25461,"Currently, although I say that I'm on Zoloft, I decided to stop taking it a few weeks back and noticed no difference in dropping from 150mg to 0."
25462,"I guess I'm completely unsure of what I should be feeling, if anything?"
25463,Should I literally feel a difference with my thinking?
25464,It's also extremely frustrating not knowing what I actually have.
25465,Depression?
25466,Anxiety?
25467,What kind of anxiety?
25468,Bipolar?
25469,OCD?
25470,ADD?
25471,None of these?!
25472,How do I even know?
25473,"I would be interested in continuing to see a counselor, therapist, or psychologist, but unless these are provided for free through the school I'm unable to afford it."
25474,"In my effort to try to ""make myself better"" I went from the top of my class (with the ability to be accepted nearly anywhere) to nearly failing out of college."
25475,"I had decided I was sick of being the bitch to my grades, I didn't want to be like I was in high school..."
25476,"I wanted to finally make friends; I came out of school with no friends, no grades, now I literally have nothing to myself."
25477,I thoroughly feel that I made a terrible decision.
25478,"At this point I'm feeling suicide isn't a matter of if, but when (although by no means will it occur soon, I have at least another half dozen years planned out as long as things no longer fall apart like this year)."
25479,I'm unsure what else I should say.
25480,Now that I'm home I need to somehow work up the confidence to see a new doctor to continue trials.
25481,"I should also be applying for a job and for college for this coming year, but I'm too afraid to even begin, I fear for another repeat of this year, and I feel it would be best for me to cater to my mental and physical health before I continue on."
25482,I honestly think I just need to be put on some medication.
25483,"Hi Everyone,

I was wondering if anybody has had a positive experience taking a small dose of anxiety medication, who can share their experience."
25484,One of my biggest concerns is weight gain; I am absolutely terrified of this side effect and have heard of horror stories of people gaining 50+ pounds without changing their diets on certain medications.
25485,At the same time I am in a desperate situation and know deep down that medication could be a life changer.
25486,Please share positive experiences only.
25487,Thanks :)
25488,I'm not on medication but my mother wants me to see the family doctor to get perscribed (terrified of prescription drugs).
25489,Hi everyone.
25490,So I'm seeing a few doctors.
25491,"I have narcolepsy, and severe anxiety, depression (although I'm too scared to mention it)."
25492,"I take nuvigil, which basically helps me stay awake."
25493,There was a few back and forths of me might being prescribed anxiety medications.
25494,What does it feel like to be on these drugs?
25495,Are they safe?
25496,Are they OK to be taken with stimulants (Narco meds)?
25497,I think medication will help make it more manageable in addition to CBT.
25498,Did the meds miraculously kick in or is there some other factor at play?
25499,"I am on meds, though

edit2: Mania is diagnosed when three of more of the following symptoms are present; an elevated, agitated, or irritable mood, a decreased need for sleep, an increased need to talk, racing thoughts or lots of ideas, abnormally high self-esteem, difficulty focusing attention, an increased in goal-directed activity or difficulty sitting still, and reckless involvement in pleasurable activities (like sexual indiscretions, or excessive spending)."
25500,I'm supposed to be on anxiety/depression meds (Pristiq) but I can't afford the medication atm so I've had to ween off them (I only had 4 left this week) until I get paid next fortnight but before this week I've been pretty steadily on them for a couple of periods and while it makes socialising easier I still don't seem to make friends.
25501,"Your brain can play some awful tricks on you and I've experienced all of these over the years in some form and duration:

Dizziness, feeling faint, feeling short of breath, feeling as if not able to take a full breath, feeling as if close to blacking out, pounding heartbeat, skipped heartbeats, rapid heartbeat, spots in vision when blinking, fuzzy ""fogged"" vision, excessive afterimages in vision, numbness/tingling in fingers, feeling unsteady/shaky, insomnia, sudden waking due to breathing issues, metallic taste in mouth, twitching in a muscle, feeling as if muscle movements are ""jerky"", intestinal pain, chest pain, certainty in that I was going to die if I fell asleep, and on and on...

Anxiety ruled me for almost a decade with these symptoms -- It took medication and a lot of mental work to end the cycle."
25502,Or is it time to find a new medicine?
25503,Nowadays when I have the anxiety attacks specially on social occasions it reminds of how simple and smooth life was on meds.
25504,IAMA 21 year old female university student with serious social anxieties and I am terrified of how medication is going to affect me.
25505,"I tried meds briefly a few years ago, but did not like how they made me feel."
25506,"First though, this isn't medical advice or a substitute for meds."
25507,I'm not on any anxiety meds but I sure wish I had some.
25508,"I just got out of a psych hospital where they were adjusting my psych meds daily and shouldn't have been discharged when I was, I was not ready."
25509,"I hate that everyone here goes through the hell that anxiety and panic attacks can be, but I love that you are here."
25510,I've dealt with anxiety for years.
25511,"I get horrible panic attacks that have, in the past, escalated to the point where I have become agoraphobic for months."
25512,I don't go into gas stations.
25513,I only go to the grocery store early in the morning and only to grocery stores that have self checkouts.
25514,I'm in college and manage to go to class most days but I spend some class periods unable to focus out of a fear that the professor might call on me to answer a question.
25515,I have a panic attack most days in another class because there are long moments of silence as the professor waits for someone to answer a question and that silence frightens me.
25516,I want to get back on medications but I'm afraid to go see a psychiatrist.
25517,These things that I deal with make absolutely no sense to so many people.
25518,My wife tries to understand but if you don't deal with panic attacks you can't really understand how it feels.
25519,I love you all because I can come here and I can see that there are people that feel how I feel.
25520,I can see that there are others that are afraid of going to the grocery store.
25521,I can come here and feel a little more sane when I see that I'm dealing with the same kind of crazy as other people.
25522,Anxiety makes life feel like you are living in a world that is somehow slightly removed from everyone around you.
25523,You feel isolated and alone.
25524,Coming here lets me know that I'm not truly alone.
25525,There are others like me.
25526,I'm not the only person in the grocery store practicing a breathing technique to avoid an attack.
25527,I'm not the only person who wants a snickers bar but can't walk into the gas station.
25528,I'm not the only person that hopes that the drive through got the order right because I don't know what I would do if something was wrong with it because I'm sure as hell not going in the Taco Bell and standing in line.
25529,"(I'm afraid to stand in line haha) 
I come here and I read your stories and I see how you're problems mirror mine."
25530,I read your successes and also your failures and I know that my struggle is not unique.
25531,I love you all for being here.
25532,I would give you all a hug except that would be too many people in one room and I would have to leave =)
25533,Which means it is getting worse or my medication never really helped in the first place.
25534,"I think I might need to go see someone, maybe seek some counseling, perhaps even start some medication."
25535,"He is on medication and seeing a therapist but it doesn't seem to be helping, especially since he's been missing a lot of appointments lately, which I know is connected to the anxiety."
25536,"After unsuccessful attempts with both therapy and medication, and being in a place where I was satisfied with the way my life was going, I had resolved myself to just roll with the punches and live with my anxiety and hope for the best."
25537,"A lot of people coming in asking about what we think about medicine, and depending on who is online at the time, they will get mixed answers."
25538,"Overall, this subreddit seems to be pro-drug, but I do know that many people have found relief without."
25539,So I want to know your medicine story.
25540,"(Or lack thereof)

There are two main types of drugs that they give people with anxiety, SSRIs and Benzos."
25541,"Long term and fast relief, respectively."
25542,"If possible, please note the name of the drug you have taken (for ctrl+f purposes) and whether it was self-medicated or prescribed."
25543,Then share your general experiences with it.
25544,"*

*NOTE: All medicines affect different people in different ways."
25545,"Which is why prescribing medicine is so difficult, and such a long process."
25546,Ok I have had anxiety/depression for a while now and wasn't really sure if medication was the right option.
25547,Has anybody taking the anti-depressant medication called Pristiq?
25548,My Mom has been suffering from debilitating anxiety for probably 6 months now and just called me to tell me that she has to go back to the mental hospital again for the 4th time.
25549,"Each time she gets out, the amount of time it takes her to have to go back in is getting shorter and shorter."
25550,This time she only lasted from last Thursday until today.
25551,"The doctors have been constantly trying new medications but nothing is helping, and she is now saying things like ""I don't know how much longer I can go on like this"" and ""I don't want to live anymore if it has to be like this"" so I am very worried."
25552,"I feel powerless to help her, and she is beginning to feel like she will never be well again."
25553,Does anyone have a happy ending to a situation like this?
25554,"Then again, I think that meds may be my only hope for a semi-normal existence."
25555,I can't really access therapy and it turns out I'm allergic to the medication my doctor prescribed me.
25556,"**tldr**; i'm a 19 year old, genderqueer person in the USA without access to therapy/medication who can't get any sleep because of my anxiety - i'm wondering what you guys have done to help yourselves and what your experiences have been like."
25557,She has gone to see psychologists and psychiatrists and she is currently on a few different forms of medication.
25558,"I've been really proactive as far as dealing with it- reading lots of books, going to groups, using CBT techniques, therapist, medication, journaling, etc."
25559,Around this time I began seeing a therapist and a couple years later I began meds.
25560,I don’t take meds nor do I see a therapist.
25561,"Hey folks, I don't drink or take recreational drugs, nor am I on medication."
25562,"You can read my last thread I made here for some background [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gy3mn/meds_i_feel_like_im_having_withdrawals_but_i_take/)
but basically, I am having severe xanax withdrawls (extreme anxiety, general uneasiness, weird head pressure where I feel like I am about to seizure, and a general disconnect with reality like I feel as if I am going crazy.)"
25563,"I dont think I will be able to get off some type of medicine completely, but the xanax is affecting me weird and I dont like it."
25564,I feel like I will probably need some other type of medicine while I am weening off of the xanax (whether that be another benzo or maybe even an SSRI).
25565,Any help about traveling tips of Ativan medication would be helpful.
25566,My medication isn't working and I am at my wits end.
25567,Or medication just ISN'T working?
25568,"When my sister left i was beginning my senior year, testing out accutane (which you may know, is a skin medication that has a crazy side effect of depression."
25569,I'm currently not taking any anti depressants or any anti anxiety medication.
25570,I'd really like to be able to breathe... how bad is it if I take cold meds with paxil?
25571,"I was depressed, on meds for anxiety and depression and spent months researching online on how to help myself."
25572,I was curious if anyone else has ever gone off their medication and what their experience was.
25573,"About 3 weeks ago, I noticed that every night I took my medication, I was having terrible panic attacks the next day."
25574,"In between having started the pill, I found a great counselor and had some pretty profound breakthroughs that I think are at least *as* responsible as the medicine ever was."
25575,"As a result, it's been hard to discern what is the result of going off the medicine and what's the result of panic that makes sense (y'know: guilt and fear over the ensuing ticket and court date and all that)."
25576,"Overall though, I feel like I don't really feel a difference without the medication."
25577,"Has anyone else ever decided to quit their medicine, and what was their experience with that?"
25578,I've recently started taking Prozac in an attempt to ease long-term anxiety and obsessive issues.
25579,"I'm 19 years old, and I haven't been taking the medication long enough for it to ""kick in"" yet; I've only been on it about 2 weeks."
25580,"However, the thought of tolerance crossed my mind today."
25581,"If it does start to work for me, and I keep taking it, what will happen down the road?"
25582,Is tolerance an issue with SSRI medications?
25583,I don't want to get used to this medicine and depend on it and then one day wake up to find out that it stops working.
25584,It was sort of a scary thought for me.
25585,I really don't want to have to worry about constantly upping doses and cycling medication to keep it working.
25586,Does anyone have any personal experience or medical data related to SSRI tolerance?
25587,I would really appreciate any advice or insight.
25588,Thanks.
25589,i must stop my meds to start body bodybuilding?
25590,Does anyone here have experience with Trileptal and hormonal birth control?
25591,I have been on Trileptal as a mood stabilizer for almost a year.
25592,While doing some research on other medications I came across studies saying certain anti-epilepsy drugs like this can reduce the effectiveness of birth control.
25593,I can't talk to my psychiatrist right now and I am concerned about this interaction.
25594,"Even though I am getting things done, this is NOT good energy because I do not have the ability to calm myself down unless I take my medication."
25595,"Just curious if anyone had any suggestions for help, besides medicine, or if anyone else has gone through something similar."
25596,"I am trying to deal with all of this through therapy, medication, talking to friends, meditating, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and exercising."
25597,It sounds stupid but worked better for me than medication and many different psychologists.
25598,"I was recently diagnosed with ""Cluster C"" avoidant personality disorder and im very aware of how it affects me and my psych has confidence i can get through this without medication but im finding that its very hard for me to face ""reality"" and under stress i tend to drift off into fantasy worlds or i become ready to drift into a fantasy world to cope/avoid the stress."
25599,I've tried medication (Cipralex) which I don't want to go back to as it was not a good experience.
25600,"I haven't been able to obtain my medication because I can't just take an anxiety med, I have to also take a mood stabilizer, and the one that works best for me is expensive."
25601,"I have tried everything but meds, I have suggested to my parents about anxiety pills but they say they cause alot of problems/addiction."
25602,"They ran tests and said ""fuck it"", and put me on meds to calm my brain."
25603,I live with chronic pain and depression.
25604,"And I am newly bar age, but I have a horrible time being at bars."
25605,I just tried once again tonight to go to the bar with my boyfriend and his friends.
25606,"I was okay for half hour, and then the anxiety set in."
25607,"I get scared, shaky, panicked, you name it."
25608,"I left to hide in the bathroom to clear my head, but as soon as I walked back out, it happened again."
25609,"I get full on panic attacks, and my boyfriend always makes me feel bad for needing to get out of there RIGHT NOW."
25610,He never understands and I keep putting myself in this position only for it to get worse every time.
25611,I cant handle doing it any more.
25612,I don't know how to overcome that feeling and to make him understand.
25613,I feel like a bitch when he leaves with me but I never ask him to.
25614,"Of course I'm upset at him after he tries making me stay, but he doesn't have to leave with me."
25615,I NEVER force him to.
25616,Ever.
25617,How the fuck can I get over this shit.
25618,"I'm sitting here crying, feeling bad, and I don't know what to do any more."
25619,I only do this for him.
25620,I can't drink alcohol.
25621,Extra info?
25622,"I am 19, with an iffy diagnosis of Anklyosing Spondilitis."
25623,I have been in pain since I was 8.
25624,"I found out it has spread, and the top half of my body is starting to go, but they don't want to do the treatment yet(biologics?)."
25625,"I can't drink alcohol, due to medications."
25626,"I have depression, never gets to the point of self-harm or thoughts of suicide."
25627,But I am miserable due to the constant pain and no relief.
25628,"I have had nothing but bad experience with alcohol(mainly me being sober, around drunks)."
25629,please help me.
25630,So that's why i'm doing therapy and taking the meds.
25631,Should I ask for a different medicine?
25632,"i saw some of the posts here talking about medication but my therapist has never mentioned it except in the first visit, and i don't want to bring it up because i feel like i don't know whether i really ""need"" them or not."
25633,I just quit another job and I am going out tomorrow to get some medication for the first time ever and then write yet another resume for another job.
25634,"Ninja edit: I'm looking at getting medication this week, but I don't know how to find a psychiatrist in my area."
25635,"**EDIT: the formatting didn't turn out right, and it seems I cannot fix it."
25636,I apologize to your eyes in advance.
25637,"**


I'm a 27 year old unemployed girl in Texas with an untreated (and *technically* undiagnosed - clarification upon request) lifetime of anxiety disorder/panic disorder/depression and anger issues."
25638,"Today was ""one of those days"" for me, that I seem to have gotten every symptom of all of the above."
25639,I'm mentally and physically exhausted.
25640,I'm in a horrible mood.
25641,"I was an ungrateful bitch today (*opening presents from family members who hate me; which begs the question of why they gave me anything in the first place, as I did not attend the family event."
25642,"My husband brought the ""gifts"" home*), and I don't know if I even want to live here anymore."
25643,"I guess a short back-story on me:
    -Mother gave me away to (my) great grandparents when I was 6 months old."
25644,"-Mom has been in and out of jail since '87, and is currently serving a habitual felon sentence that ends in 2016
    -No idea who my father is
    -No brothers or sisters."
25645,"-Great grandmother is physically, verbally, and mentally abusive all my life (ruined my childhood/teens)
  -Great grandmother has her own mental issues (OCD, Anger issues, *EXTREMELY* strict) and was ailing in my final years living with her."
25646,"Which meant that I (a teenager) had to be a caretaker for an elderly woman, while trying to have a job and go to school."
25647,"-I dropped out of school at (the end of) grade 10
  -Tried to lead a normal life by having a job, and living with a roomate (good friend from high school, who also didn't graduate, but is wildly successful these days)
  -Met a guy, fell in love, moved to colorado, moved back to texas, off and on relationship with guy for 6 years."
25648,-Guy ruined my life and caused the onset of the major anxiety/depression symptoms that I didn't realize I had until me and him started having major issues.
25649,"-For about a year after that, I continued to live in the town where all the BS with guy went down."
25650,"It's a small town, and he knows I can not afford to move."
25651,He threatened my life on several occasions by phone and even showed up at my work.
25652,"-I finally am able to move on, moved away from the town I lived in for 2 years that did nothing but bring back awful memories and scare me every day (which did not help the anxiety)
  -Move in with new man who is the most amazing one I've ever been with, and am still with him after nearly 5 years."
25653,"(currently married to him)
  -New man understands my issue, is considerate, and helps me in any way he can."
25654,"-His family dislikes me from the get-go
  -Things started off well with working and trying to get our own place, had a very rocky, roller-coaster type time with finances and such (we lived in a 16' camper trailer for 3 months at one point, and were homeless a couple of times for a short period)."
25655,"Car breaks down, we get it fixed, then some other financial burden hits."
25656,It just seemed it would never end.
25657,"-We somehow manage to get on our feet, then new man gets laid off."
25658,For no reason.
25659,By his own father.
25660,From the company he has worked for since he was a teen.
25661,"(You couldn't *imagine* the rage I felt when he came home and told me this)
  -We lose our home, nearly everything in it, and have to start all over."
25662,Again.
25663,"-He finds a job, and is doing 'ok'
  -I start having anxiety issues at work (random, painful, debilitating migraines [*I can't take medicine for headaches/pains anymore because when I do, I feel sick for days and can't eat which in turn gives me a headache amongst other things.....*],inability to speak to customers because of an overwhelming feeling of wanting to vomit, and what I can only assume is high blood pressure...my heart would beat hard and fast and I would get headaches and dizziness...In fact, this is probably what caused my migraines most of the time."
25664,-End up quitting job because I simply just *cannot* take this crap anymore.
25665,"-Boyfriend is fine with this, continues working, while I sit at home and do nothing."
25666,"-Pursue options of financial assistance because boyfriend cannot afford to help, and I've lost jobs and quit jobs before because of this anxiety and simply am sick to death of it."
25667,-Failed.
25668,-Learn to live with what I've got.
25669,Avoidance of stressful situations.
25670,"Don't go out much, no friends over, no going to friends or neighbors house, not much phone calls or anything."
25671,"Basically [agoraphobic](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001921/) for a long time (still kinda am)
  -2 years later someone informs me of ""Social Security Disability"" - worth a shot I guess
  -Still fighting it with appeals and all that after (as of jan. 2012) 2 years with no success, despite the fact that I more than qualify."
25672,-No family close-by me anymore (my great grandfather passed away in 2000 and my great grandmother is a vegetable in a nursing home after 2 strokes.
25673,-No real friends anymore (close-by me).
25674,Only 3 friends that I talk to by phone/net and one of those visits a few times a year.
25675,-My sex life is non-existent because my libido is literally completely gone.
25676,I always wanted to be the perfect wife if i were to ever get married.
25677,"Which meant that I had to do the opposite of what society says happens after a couple get married...""the sex stops"" But here we are."
25678,"No sex in like 6 or more months, and before that it was 3 - 4 months in between sessions."
25679,I blame this partially on the fact that i've got some issues with my lady parts (that we can't afford to have looked at or treated if something actually is wrong.)
25680,"-I don't sleep well and sleep medications make me sick for days, as well as they do not work, and the ones that have a slight effect make me so groggy for days."
25681,"It takes me about 2 hours to get to a comfortable place to get to sleep (our bed is crappy) then, 30 minutes after i get to sleep i wake up gasping as if my airflow was cut off (yeah i know, sleep apnea, can't afford it.....)and if that for some reason doesn't happen, i wake up with a strong urge to pee but when I get in there it's not a lot."
25682,"All of these things plague my mind on a daily basis, memories haunt me and I desperately want to forget them."
25683,"I've nothing to do but sit here and think about how shitty my life is, and how I'm 27 and have nothing to show for it."
25684,This is not how I envisioned my life to turn out at this age.
25685,*So whats bothering me today?
25686,"*
  Feels like everything is."
25687,It's Christmas (an *extremely* overdone overrated and fake ass holiday that businesses use to make money off cheaply made items that no one can afford nor needs.
25688,"), I'm an atheist."
25689,"Which, simply put, means I don't believe in supernatural beings."
25690,Others are very closed minded on this issue and think less of me because of it.
25691,This is only part of the reason his (my husband)family hates me.
25692,"The other reason they hate me is because I am not working, and they think I am just using him for support."
25693,"This (his family hating me)only bothers me because I hear about it a lot...well, I used to."
25694,I asked my husband to stop telling me if they said bad things about me at family gatherings.
25695,"(which is why i stopped going to family events, i only went to one - 4th of july 3 years ago, after that, on thanksgiving, my husband comes home and tells me all the bad things nearly everyone including the children had to say about me.)"
25696,"I know they were talking about me today, and I can't help it, it bothers me."
25697,"Now, we don't celebrate christmas for the same reason other people do."
25698,We don't believe in a god or jesus or anything like that.
25699,"But since christmas is so so very *shoved down our throats* this time of year, fuck it, exchange gifts with people, eat and try to be merry...My husband spent $200 (that he really shouldn't have) on gifts for these people."
25700,Including 2 family members who used to be hardcore drug users/makers/sellers (that are *supposedly* clean now) that made our lives a living hell off and on for about 2 years while we were having our own hell on earth.
25701,"He knows I dislike these people, they never apologized for the death threats, manipulation, downright disrespectful, and ignorant shit they did to us during a time when we really didn't need any more shit."
25702,And he basically rewarded them for it.
25703,So I'm not happy with him.
25704,At fucking All.
25705,"Allll these people he bought thoughtful gifts for, and we got 2 boxes of candy, and a walmart gift card and a cheap novelty knife."
25706,"($5 at the dollar store) It just seems to me, that if you go through all the trouble to buy and wrap a gift, the gift should be worth more than the paper it's wrapped in, Don'tcha think?"
25707,"To me, giving gifts and the like comes back around to what that person thinks of you."
25708,"$5 gift from a friend = ""you're cool and all, but i'm broke."
25709,":)"" Multiple $5 gifts from rich family = ""meh, I'm just getting this to be nice"" I hope you understood all that, but that's just the way I see it."
25710,Hmm... well it's getting late and I feel like this has gotten way too long.
25711,"I feel a little bit better now that I've written it all out, and would feel even better if someone actually read it and gave some kind of insight/response/something."
25712,"I know there were technically no questions, but i don't know...i guess it was just good to vent."
25713,"If you need clarification on anything, quote the part, and then state what you need clarified."
25714,I have no life so I'll be off and on frequently.
25715,"Also, medication is not an option for me."
25716,I've seen too many friends turned into emotionless zombies because of medication.
25717,"Plus, I just hate medicine."
25718,"I bitch every day when I take my birth control, if I'm sick I have to be REALLY REALLY sick before I even think about medicine."
25719,I'm a big baby when it comes to medicine.
25720,Not judging anyone who takes medicine.
25721,"I've had terrible social anxiety and GAD for all of my life, I've never been prescribed any medication for it because I was too scared to ask my parents or call a doctor."
25722,This makes me think if i am depressed and if medication might help?
25723,I am usually against medicine and being on pills but i'm starting to wonder if this will help.
25724,At the time of my diagnosis (which actually took several years to get to the bottom of) i was put on anti-depressant and anti-anxiety meds.
25725,"I didn’t like the meds ultimately, and over the years i found a substitute (making music) which actually worked a lot better than any medication I was on, so i slowly (under my doc’s guidance) weaned myself off."
25726,"My fear of medication, especially psychiatric, also really enabled my stubbornness."
25727,"She ended up recommending I see a doctor to discuss other options, such as medication."
25728,"She has GAD and she was on Celexa for a couple of years, but she came off of the meds around November because our life was calming down and she has been totally fine for several months."
25729,I used to be on medication a year ago but I decided to try to handle it without medication.
25730,I want to go to counseling very badly or get back on medication but the nearest real town is a 1hr bus trip and I don't know how long it would take to get a counselor.
25731,"I'm on meds, but they don't nearly solve the issue completely (they do help a lot)."
25732,all the benzo's/ anti deps/ anti psychs /calm meds they put me on?
25733,I have been back on medication for 3 weeks and doubled my dose a week ago.
25734,I don't know if it's the medication causing this but I feel very alone and scared.
25735,"I have no idea what I'm getting at here, but I feel like I need help, but I'm scared of taking medication and every time I try to talk to a professional I feel like we are wholly incompatible."
25736,I'm not on any medication.
25737,To be on medication I have to have money and insurance.
25738,"Point is I think that since when I see her I can express myself so well she thinks, I can overcome it without meds and just meditation and self awareness."
25739,"I was on meds for a while but when I lost my job I could no longer afford it, so I'm off them for now."
25740,"Anxiety is something that I struggle with daily, and I have been on and off meds for it."
25741,I've had a lot of discussion lately on here and with supportive family members and friends regarding the nature of my panic attacks/anxiety and whether or not going back on meds for my panic attacks is a good idea.
25742,"In every situation, whether I act on it or not, I find myself feeling like I have to *justify* why I feel I need these meds."
25743,"Whenever I bring up the medication to my family, they give me all these alternatives that I could be doing (meditation, exercise, diet, etc)."
25744,"To stem the tide before anyone says anything, I simply want the meds as a fail-safe in case my attacks get out of control, just a safety net to fall into."
25745,"Overall,  I have a thyroid problem, and so I got my medication adjusted."
25746,"For Years I wondered why I was getting more and more afraid of going to the dentist, but it's pretty easy to understand, if you know that this medication is used."
25747,Should I switch meds?
25748,"Between the psychiatric medication and a history of enigmatic pain, I worry that I can never see another doctor without enormous amounts of anxiety."
25749,"I've been taking meds for a while now, and before I go back to uni, my Dr recommended mentioning this to my personal tutor/supervisors."
25750,Anyone have experience with being off your meds for a few days?
25751,"), I experienced serious anxiety for about 2 years and have happily relapsed through counciling and a little help from medication."
25752,Hey everyone.
25753,"I'm glad to have found this sub - after reading through a few posts and get a feel for everything, I have to say that you seem like you're a helpful bunch."
25754,So I figured I'd try my hand in all this.
25755,"I recently developed an anxiety issue, and I'd classify it as moderate to severe, depending on the situation."
25756,Anxiety doesn't exactly fit into 'who I am' so to say.
25757,"I am 23 years old, I've always been a strong &amp; independent person, totally able to function and handle any situation."
25758,"As of late, that has all changed."
25759,"In September, I started a new job in a field that I have 0 experience in (I am a maintenance tech for an apartment complex in a nearby city)."
25760,"Normally, that wouldn't be an issue, as most of the time I can pick something up rather fast and hit the ground running with it, and succeed."
25761,"Since, I'd say, mid October really, I've been waking up feeling extremely nauseated and stressed out."
25762,"I find myself overthinking a ton of situations involving my job (and irrational things, like something will happen to my wife or my dog when I'm in there and I won't hear it, etc) while I'm in the shower getting ready for work, and that's when the nausea settles in."
25763,I have never been one to handle stress well despite what was said above - I borderline obsess over the issue until its resolved.
25764,"My anxiety lasts until I get to work, and although it doesn't 100% go away, it kind of just, subsides, until I start doing something that I know I can do, something that'll boost my confidence (that's another new-found issue - lacking confidence all of a sudden."
25765,Not like me).
25766,"The anxiety revs back up once I'm called to go fix something I haven't exactly done by myself before (I am basically shadowing the head guy every day, but he's a very busy man and I only get so much time with him) and it gives me a hell of a time."
25767,"Pounding heart, the taste of metal in my mouth, cold sweats."
25768,I hate it.
25769,Some days I feel like I am going to have a mental breakdown.
25770,"Today for example, I thought management brought someone in for a working interview to be my replacement.. turns out it was just my main manager's husband (who I hadn't met before) who had some extra time to help us out since things are so busy with people moving out after the 1st of the year."
25771,"Days like this, and days where I have a huge workload, really push my anxiety over the top and leave me feeling stuck."
25772,"I do my best every day and sometimes it just isn't enough, which also drives it through the roof."
25773,"I recently had a day where I was exhausted by noon because of my anxiety, it was just running rampant over everything."
25774,"Basically, for the past 3.5 months, this anxiety has been getting progressively worse; to the point where my mind is making me think that every day is my last day, and that I will be fired."
25775,It is extremely hard to deal with.
25776,All I can think about is how bad it would be if I lost my job.. what would happen to us?
25777,How would we eat?
25778,How long until I'd find another job?
25779,"What if its the same situation, do I take the job?"
25780,"Its nuts, as you can surely imagine."
25781,"Unfortunately, I feel that I have developed an issue with depression as well."
25782,I constantly catch myself feeling down or sad for absolutely no reason.
25783,"I go through mood swings (I am a guy, figured that should be said lol) daily."
25784,Some days I just wanna get back in bed and do nothing.
25785,Other days I'm more meh than I am down.
25786,My 'good' days are very numbered.
25787,"But when I am having a good day, I roll with it until something comes along and derails it."
25788,"Again, I have no reason to be feeling these kinds of things at all."
25789,"I got married to my best friend, my high school sweetheart, in June 2014."
25790,We rent a very nice 2 bed/2 bath apartment in a nice part of town.
25791,We don't live paycheck to paycheck.
25792,We have an awesome 5 month old beagle puppy.
25793,My wife works full time too and makes decent money.
25794,Life could be a hell of a lot worse.
25795,I have a problem and I want &amp; need the help.
25796,I am going to see my doctor on the 12th about all of this.
25797,"I'm sick of feeling this way, and **absolutely** sick of fighting an ongoing battle against myself every single day."
25798,"What kind of medication(s) should I seek out, considering my depression?"
25799,"I have read a little bit of info pertaining to side effects, and there's some scary shit out there."
25800,Its worth noting that I am not currently on any kind of medications for anything whatsoever.
25801,"Also, I would be so appreciative of any self-help tips any of you could pass along to me to help me get through my days until I see my doctor (and afterwards)."
25802,"Thank you so much for reading through all of this, and for any help you can offer."
25803,Lets get through all of our anxiety issues together!
25804,Please feel free to ask me whatever is needed in case I forgot something throughout this massive wall of text and commas.
25805,"And if I do get help and go on medication, I'm a guy... with a mental condition!"
25806,Standing in an isle at my job packing items onto a shelf.
25807,Four others in the isle doing the same when one older crotchety lady gets all our attentions and reminds us (In an admittedly harsh way) to put the item number in the right place on the box because we have been doing it wrong.
25808,"For some reason, this guy standing two feet away screams at the top of his lungs that she should shut the fuck up."
25809,"She responded angrily and walked away, end of incident."
25810,Well at least for them it was.
25811,I spent the remaining four hours of work doing every thing in my power not to burst into tears.
25812,"My hands were shaking, I felt like I was about to have a heart attack, and I am truly astounded I didn't have a panic attack as I usually would in a similar situation."
25813,When I finally got out I spent half an hour lying in my back seat crying and trying my absolute best to get calm enough to drive my self home.
25814,"This happened last night (I work over nights) and I spent the entire day awake when I would normally be sleeping, and was on the verge of falling asleep standing up when I went in tonight."
25815,Thank christ it was only a four hour shift.
25816,"I have been to about eight therapists in my short life, I have tried two medications, the meditation thing, working out, breaking things, basically everything to stop this kind of reaction when people get mad or yell but nothing works."
25817,I worry all day but things like this are the things that push me to the edge.
25818,"If there is anything that works for you, or if there is any one who reacts in a similar way to this kind of thing, I could really use some kind of knowledge that I'm not alone."
25819,Does anybody have any experience with this medication?
25820,I've been having anxiety for about a year now and was faced with taking prescribed medication.
25821,I did a lot of research on this drug because this is the first time I've ever been prescribed mood altering medication.
25822,"From what I can tell, if the medicine works, it's basically a miracle drug."
25823,"However, from what I've read on the internet, if the medication isn't a good fit, it's a terrible one to be on (terrible side effects, and pretty horrible descriptions of what the withdrawals are like; in many cases it causes hospital stays)."
25824,"Also, if anyone has any advice about Effexor as an antidepressant/anxiety/long term panic medication, feel free to bestow your knowledge and insight onto me."
25825,"i don't want to sound like a stupid pathetic idiot, i also don't want to just get put on meds and turn into a vegetable."
25826,"Till my father puts me on welfare for not getting a job, he doesn't understand that even though I am on Paxil (Neurological meds for anxiety) I still get panic attacks during interviews."
25827,I'm on a depression/anxiety medicine called Cymbalta and my doctor recently lowered the dosage.
25828,I really hate anxiety and I can't wait to get on a medicine that truly helps me without stupid side effects.
25829,"Then, near the end he's like ok so you have General Anxiety Disorder and you can take medicine to make it better."
25830,He then goes on to say that most people don't want to take the medicine.
25831,"I then asked a few more questions and he's like you can either take the medicine or exercise more, i'm not a councilor."
25832,"I remember searching through forums back in the day desperately looking for success stories or suggestions from people who had overcome anxiety, and not finding a lot of reassurance."
25833,I think a lot of people who do get better just quit thinking about anxiety and quit returning to message boards and stuff.
25834,So here's how my anxiety went.
25835,It started about 6 years ago.
25836,Obviously there is anxiety present in everyone's life but 6 years ago is when it came into the forefront for me and became a really big problem.
25837,"Possible factors that contributed to it were alcohol, graduating from college, and a death in my immediate family."
25838,"It manifested both as a general anxiety, and a strong social anxiety."
25839,It was maybe intertwined with alcoholism.
25840,"It got so bad that I felt like I was losing my mind, frequently considered suicide, developed an insane tinnitus in one ear, had to quit a job, could barely hang out with people and had to skip multiple gatherings such as Christmas so I could be alone."
25841,A lot of mornings I would wake up at like 330 am with my heart racing and get stuck in a thought loop and be fried for the whole day.
25842,"Things I tried to help it:
therapy - couple different therapists, and I think they were nearly useless
medication - got on lexapro 5 mg and still am on it
exercise -  started working out, especially lifting weights 
supplements - vitamin D 5000mg daily,  fish oil supplement 
meditation - all based on Jon Kabat Zinn's audiobook recording of ""Wherever You Go, There You Are""


My improvement was painstakingly gradual."
25843,"Good weeks, bad weeks,  but basically an inch by inch gradual improvement."
25844,I wanted a breakthrough but never really had one.
25845,"If I had to put a number on it now, I would say my anxiety is at 15% of what it was back then."
25846,I almost always sleep through the night.
25847,"Sometimes I still get mild social anxiety, sometimes none at all."
25848,Sometimes I'll still get worked up about a random issue.
25849,I feel pretty chill at work.
25850,"I would say I'm now within the bounds of a ""normal"" person and wouldn't be classified as an anxiety disorder sufferer anymore."
25851,Most of the time that I have bad anxiety now it is post alcohol bender so I kinda deserve it.
25852,I think that exercise (lifting especially) and meditation were totally key to my recovery.
25853,"If you're in a dark place, get these bases covered."
25854,A massive piece of the anxiety puzzle is a lack of self confidence and I feel like these routines help address it.
25855,"I'll never know how much my mild dose of lexapro is helping, but it feels like it's doing good."
25856,There were years where I feared my mind was totally fucked and that I had no chance at leading a normal life again.
25857,Now I feel like.... mostly fine...
25858,Occasionally sketched or depressed but manageable.
25859,So yeah there's my experience.
25860,There should be a massive log of success stories somewhere online.
25861,There probably is.
25862,I just remember being so disheartened surfing anxiety boards and seeing all these lifers who had been on 50 medications and never improved.
25863,I don't think that's an accurate reflection of the experience most people have.
25864,I usually smoke weed and drink alcohol about twice a week but since I've started the meds I've been afraid to.
25865,"For the most part, I can say that the meds have helped a lot, though I still have a long way to go."
25866,"It worked for a few months, but over the last two months the medication stopped working, so I was switched to 75mg of Effexor."
25867,"Hi everyone, I’m hoping to get some advice (this is my second reddit account for posts like these)."
25868,I suffer from severe social anxiety/anxiety in general for a few years now (just like you guys :P).
25869,"It’s the racing thoughts, fear of what others see/think of me, etc."
25870,etc.
25871,"that leads to isolation, which leads to depression, repeat."
25872,A vicious cycle.
25873,"My anxiety prevents me from socializing, which is the one part of my life that NEEDS to change."
25874,"It’s driving me insane…
I’m currently on a few medications: lamictal 100mg, 30mg Adderall, 10mg viibyrd (just started a few days ago) and was prescribed klonopin on Thursday (today is Monday) .5mg."
25875,"i didn’t take the klonopin 2 days out of the 4 and have been breaking the .5mg into halves most of the times, except for night I took 1.125mg, which I shouldn’t have done, but I was incredibly anxious."
25876,"Also, I smoke pot at night to calm my nerves, before bed."
25877,"Anyway, I have been provided with such great relief from the klonopin."
25878,"I’ve been waking up very refreshed, even if I’m tired with a long day ahead of me, I’m not zombie-like, anxious, or irritable so far."
25879,I took .125mg last night for sleep.
25880,"I’m trying to keep the dose low &amp; take it only as needed since I don’t want to build a tolerance because I need this medication to work when attempting to socialize…
Can anyone give me their experiences with klonopin &amp; how they handle their anxiety/social anxiety?"
25881,And answer a few of these questions I have regarding klonopin?
25882,: how fast does one build a tolerance?
25883,When should I take it &amp; how long does it last?
25884,I know the half-life is very long… does that mean its effects will last for as long as the half life?
25885,"Also, for those who take it only as needed, has that worked so far for you?"
25886,Thank you guys.
25887,I’ve been trying to gather as much info/advice as I can about it since I don’t want to be dependent on it.
25888,I've considered medication because of this.
25889,My two GPs want to put me on bipolar medication or antidepressants.
25890,I'm terrified of bipolar medication and antidepressants never worked for me.
25891,"I feel like it's a safe medication for me, and really worked."
25892,"They look at it like a band-aid, but I have been going to counseling and I determine taking medication EVERY DAY is worse."
25893,"A lot of my life, I have felt that I have been in a fog and coming out of it thanks to medication and therapy."
25894,"Unfortunately, anxiety runs in my family and my mom is on medication for it still currently, she knows I have a problem with anxiety but I don't think anyone really knows the extent."
25895,This has all effected my life and I know most of y'all can relate...I don't want to go on medication and I wish I could just talk to someone like a close friend but not even my boyfriend takes it seriously.
25896,"I really don't want to go back on my meds, but I'm far too scared to even approach the counselor at college."
25897,Been on multiple medication cocktails.
25898,"Hi everyone,

I could use some help with my boyfriend."
25899,I have to be a bit vague because he is also on this site and he doesn't know I'm doing this.
25900,"My boyfriend is on several prescribed medications:

-Low dose anti-psychotic for sleep (only drug he's found that allows him to sleep)

-SNRI anti-depressant for depression (I don't know if he's diagnosed)

-Stimulant for his ADD (his tolerance is high but he doesn't abuse it for fun)

He has been semi-regularly smoking marijuana since college and has now increased his usage significantly, smoking everyday."
25901,He only abstains when at  work.
25902,He's had bad experience with psychiatrists and currently doesn't have one.
25903,"His currently gets his prescribed meds from a GP which I think, of course, is a bad idea."
25904,"My concern is that he is semi-constantly plagued with anxiety, fear and depression."
25905,"It is usually in response to stressful life events but it's so excessive that at times debilitating, where he can't even get out of bed."
25906,He uses weed to reduce the anxiety.
25907,"He also has a fear of abandonment form past girlfriends leaving him, usually because of his psych issues."
25908,"I've told him gently but repeatedly asked him if he can accept the possibility his marijuana use is actually hurting him in the long run, both in negatively affecting his prescribed medications and causing stronger anxiety/depressive episodes because weed only temporarily eliminates his symptoms."
25909,His response is that it is too scary to try and change anything right now medication wise.
25910,He has a psychiatrist appointment in 2 weeks where he says he will talk to the doctor about everything.
25911,And I'm optimistic because I had asked him to see a therapist (I see one too) and he actually did it.
25912,Unfortunately it doesn't seem like a good fit but he continues to go for now.
25913,Am I right to suspect that perhaps his current cocktails of medications is no longer working for him (or at least they need some modification) and/or that the marijuana use is exasperating his symptoms?
25914,"It is also important to note that my girlfriend has been out of the country for 2 weeks and wont be back for anothee week, and I miss her tremendously, and my mind just wanders.......

My question really is, how do I control this without medication?"
25915,Been on and off many meds since I was 14 or so and with many different counselors since I was 11.
25916,And my hypochondria/paranoia mostly revolves around medication.
25917,The medicine was affecting my joints and causing me pain and diarrhea.
25918,"I decided I'm gonna go to the clinic, ask about stopping he medication, and get myself a good checkup."
25919,"Speaking to my psychologist and psychiatrist, I've started taking medication (zoloft) for the first time in my life."
25920,"I have no idea how to calm myself down without medication, does anyone have ideas or suggestions?"
25921,I went off my meds a couple months ago because I was working on an intense film project for school and kept forgetting to take them and I ran out.
25922,"I don't want to go back on the medicine because the side effects are ridiculous and it's expensive to keep having to go back and forth to the dr, and I rarely have time to do so, especially so often."
25923,My mom had ADHD but didn't realize it until she was so old that all of her relationships had been built around that personality and the doctor said she'd be better off not to take medication.
25924,The benefits don't seem to outweigh the costs with the meds I've tried.
25925,My only thoughts are that my meds are in the fiance's Jeep.
25926,I'm thinking about taking advantage of my Short Term Disability insurance so the bills get paid and so the doctor and I can work on some different supplemental meds to go with the Welbutrin.
25927,"TLDR: had a panic attack at work because I can't find my meds, start having the ""I'm going insane"" thoughts and disassociation from my body feelings."
25928,Reading about other peoples struggles on this sub I realize that I could have it a lot worse as I am fully able to function in society and do not take medication or necessarily see any need to.
25929,"it took me to go see a therapist what was really wrong with me, ive always had depression, but im a rather positive person, even with these drawbacks, i geuss the worse thing about it is it trick your mind so much that danger seems real, its truely amazing if you think about it, im far from 100 percent, but im working on it, im currently on no meds, its hell but im trying to overcome things naturally, the only meds i take is for blood preassure, but its only because my family is very rpone to high hp, and mine has been perfect for a long time, and physically im am as helathy as i can possibly be, dont smoke or do drugs and drink very little, i wanted to give anyone going through the samething advice."
25930,I've been seeing my therapist for almost one year....talk therapy has helped me so much..but my therapist has suggested anxiety medication.
25931,Will anxiety meds help?
25932,I am not currently taking any medication.
25933,"They overdid the first pain meds because (1) while I may be small at 100lbs, (2) pain that leaves you squealing with every movement and unable to straighten your body so they can examine you will get treated."
25934,"Hi Reddit,

I have come to the point where I'm ready to look into medication for my anxiety."
25935,"However, I want to know what the procedure is at the doctors (in the UK) when someone comes to an appointment and explains they might need anxiety medication."
25936,"When I first got on my diabetes meds, the blood sugar lows felt to me like panic attacks."
25937,I have forgotten to take my meds the past few days (although I took one this morning.)
25938,A little background on me first.
25939,I'm a 24-year-old white male.
25940,I've had issues off and on with anxiety and panic attacks for the last 3-4 years.
25941,My anxiety was at its worst a year and a half ago.
25942,For a lot of that time I was taking Lexapro.
25943,"First at 10 mg/day, then up to 20 mg. A couple of months ago my anxiety started getting worse again, so my psychiatrist changed me to 40 mg/day of Celexa, but after 6 weeks there was no change, so last Friday she switched me to Paxil."
25944,I'm currently in a transition from Celexa to Paxil and on Saturday I will be fully on Paxil.
25945,My girlfriend said that I've started kicking and hitting the bed in my sleep.
25946,She said it sometimes happened in response to noises.
25947,"Apparently she noticed it Sunday and Monday night, but didn't say anything until this morning."
25948,I fell asleep a while before she did last night and she had more time to observe what I was doing.
25949,I was completely unaware that I was moving around like that while I was sleeping and I rarely remember my dreams (I don't remember my dreams from last night).
25950,So of course as soon as I got into work today I started Googling things about sleep disorders.
25951,The closest thing I could find is [Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_behavior_disorder).
25952,It's interesting that the article says that clonazepam has a 90% success rate in stopping RBD.
25953,I took a 0.5 mg clonazepam last night a couple of hours before I went to bed.
25954,I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced something like this.
25955,I don't know if it's because I'm transitioning between medications right now or what.
25956,I have a doctor's appointment next Wednesday and I'll definitely bring it up then.
25957,"I might wait a couple of weeks to see if it resolves itself once I'm finished transitioning to Paxil, then think about a sleep study."
25958,tl;dr Kicking and hitting the bed in sleep.
25959,Any thoughts?
25960,I elected to not be on medication because I don't like how spacey it makes me feel (especially when I need to focus).
25961,I had gone to therapy and was on meds when I was a pre teen after my parents divorce in 2002.
25962,"I tell her what meds I used, what helped, what didnt, how I really would rather not take something daily because I did not like the way the zoloft, prozac, Celexa made me feel."
25963,"I haven't seen a doctor in years, I would never go doctor to doctor trying to get medication."
25964,"I've taken every anxiety medicine, they all interact with me in odd ways, i've tried every self help exercise, they do nothing."
25965,"I have already had a session with my therapist, he doesn't prescribe meds and said that I would have to make an appointment with my regular doctor."
25966,I'm not on medication at the moment because I haven't found anything that works very well.
25967,I disclosed the situation to my landlord and found she has been dealing with similar medication thefts.
25968,And to whoever stole my medication: fuck you.
25969,I do not want to start medication or anything if I don't have to.
25970,"When i do maintain it for a bit my lower back muscles begin to ache a bit as if they've been worked out all day but other than that, the twitching/tremors its oddly relieving, 

Some additional information about me:

24 male

I'm not currently taking any medication

Again, I hate to come here without an actual doctors diagnosis."
25971,So my dog passed away 2 days ago.
25972,Since then I've been having crippling anxiety.
25973,I'm not on any medications for it either.
25974,"I cannot stop pacing back and forth, crying (obviously) and my stomach just constantly hurts."
25975,"I cannot eat no matter how hard I try, even smoothies wont stay down."
25976,I've thrown up twice.
25977,"Usually breathing in and out for a while helps, but it's not at all."
25978,I'm so desperate I may even go to the hospital eventually because at this point I just want to be sedated.
25979,Only time I feel peaceful is when I go to sleep.
25980,"I wake up, and it all starts again."
25981,I just feel like throwing up all the time.
25982,I need help.
25983,What are your coping methods?
25984,"Anyway, I declined the medication for now."
25985,"He tried prescribing medicine (SSRIs), but I was fearful of the side effects/withdrawal if I missed a dose so I never took one, until he convinced me to try a very low dose of Lorazepam (not an SSRI)."
25986,"This is real,  it was a positive test result,  I have medication that can **fix** it,  instead of being up all night crying with the pain and worrying about getting into work when I can't leave the toilet or when I do I can't cope with the discomfort,  only to go to the doctors and it be a negative result."
25987,This is mainly down to me running of my medication and I can't get anymore till Monday.
25988,I have been suffering from anxiety since when I was 9/10 (due to bullying amongst other things) and have always been extremely anxious about everything.
25989,It started off with school anxiety i.e.
25990,"constantly worrying about my performance at school, worrying about getting the highest marks possible in every exam and feeling inadequate if I don't etc."
25991,It didn't affect me as much and it wasn't very strong but basically perfectionism had already started to control my life.
25992,However since October 2013 (when I came out as gay to myself) or so my anxiety levels have shot up to an extreme form.
25993,"I have awful social anxiety now and I can't talk to someone new without stammering, repeating the same thing over and over amongst other things."
25994,"Worst of all, I cannot study at all without crying and hating myself completely because I feel worthless and hopeless and I feel like I'm moving towards becoming an inevitable failure."
25995,I really need to study :( I have A Levels (important uni entrance exams) in 1 month and 21 days and I still have loads to cover.
25996,"I could have finished ages ago but my attempt at studying always turns out like this:

1."
25997,I end up waking late because I wouldn't have been able to sleep the night before.
25998,10/11 am and I haven't started.
25999,"I hate myself for waking up late, have a major panic attack."
26000,2.
26001,"I try to start asap, make a list of things I want to accomplish by the end of the day, realise I am far behind and probably won't finish on time or finish the right way to get the grades I need for Medicine (AAA)."
26002,3.
26003,"Have another horrible panic attack, one which lasts for several hours."
26004,"I get chest pains everywhere, blinding headache, dizziness which escalates to a lot of self-hatred and can even trigger suicidal thoughts (ugh they're awful)."
26005,4.
26006,I try to find a way to calm down; I try to listen to a song or two but it makes it worse because I realise that time is flying and I am still far behind on everything and can't get a grip of my life and that I'm going to end up getting anything but the grades I need.
26007,5.
26008,"Since the calming technique wouldn't have worked, I try to take a nap but end up hating myself more because by this time it's 6/7/8 pm and I still haven't done much."
26009,This activates yet another panic attack which lasts till 11/12 until i cannot take it anymore and go to cry in bed till 2 am or so.
26010,6.
26011,The cycle repeats itself.
26012,":(

Nothing seems to help: breaking it down into small goals made me panic even more because it doubled the material in my head, setting a timer for 30 mins then taking a break didn't work either because during this time I still panicked."
26013,Calming techniques like music or going for a short walk next to the sea don't help at all either and only seem to make it worse.
26014,I have so much to do and I've fallen so far behind because of this.
26015,"I have past papers to work out, material to revise and still have some notes to make."
26016,I cannot do this anymore ugh I just want to study and go to my exams feeling prepared and confident and revise without hating myself and wanting to throw myself off the roof.
26017,"I don't know if I have enough time to study two years' material for four subjects (Bio, Chem, Physics and Philosphy) with enough/proper revision to get me the grades I need."
26018,I've started a few things over the last few months but it's not getting me anywhere and I haven't been able to actually completely and fully finish a single topic.
26019,This has been going on for ages.
26020,"During my two years of sixth form, I missed so many tests due to anxiety and it's extremely worrying but I feel so overwhelmed and hate myself so much all the time because of this and I just don't know what to do anymore."
26021,I've been seeing a counsellor for a year and a half but I think she's given up on me and has no idea what could help me anymore.
26022,She also diagnosed me with depression two/three weeks ago and said that my anxiety paved the way for it.
26023,I was supposed to see a psychiatrist but I waited two hours for him (on the day when my appointment was scheduled) and by the time he arrived I had to leave.
26024,I'm not sure if medications would actually help me at a point which is very close to the exams and I'm terrified of the side effects.
26025,"My sister, who knows about my state, warned me against them and told me to fight it myself but it feels very overwhelming and I have no idea how at this point."
26026,"My parents are completely unaware of everything because the last time I told them about my anxiety and depression they gave me a horrible horrrible horrible time for trying to get them to help me, so I have to do it alone."
26027,"**TL;DR Anxiety is ruining my academic life, my social life, everything."
26028,I just want to hide somewhere and hopefully stop living.
26029,What do I do?
26030,"**

EDIT: I would like to add that I have been paralysed in this non-stop panic mode since January and have been unable to calm down regardless of how much I try to self-talk positivity into my head etc."
26031,I would rather see a psychiatrist because I’m interested in trying medication.
26032,"How do I do that, other than seeking heavy medication?"
26033,"I take escitalopram and it really helps my anxiety but it makes my depression (not taking meds for it) a lot worse, it also makes me a really angry person."
26034,When I'm not on my meds I'm too busy worrying about things and thinking it's all my fault but when I take the pill I tend to get really on edge and angry and start blaming the other person.
26035,"Also note, she is taking medication."
26036,"In general, my anxiety has been under control through the combination of therapy and medication, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this sort of thing."
26037,"Because I have problems regarding taking drugs/getting high, I can't bring myself to take any form of medication out of fear that I'll end up high."
26038,I didnt have insurance and I couldnt afford to keep up appearances with the therapist or dr or meds so I stopped going.
26039,I am going to be making a appointment with the APRN there to talk about meds.
26040,My psychiatrist is at the point of putting me on meds i have taken before.
26041,i have gained 65ibs since i've started on anti psychotic meds and its accelerating.
26042,meds make me feel tired and stimulated at the same time.
26043,I really don't think these meds are supposed to be used for prolonged use.
26044,i feel like i'm going crazier on these meds because i know ill eventually get dietbetes from this unhealthy weight gain.
26045,Adding to that im starting to hallucinate visual and having a hard time concentrating on these meds.
26046,Thinking about going off meds and start smoking weed.
26047,"I sprawl out all the things I use day to day: bobby pins, remotes, cups, medicine, etc etc."
26048,It has gotten so bad that once I tried to kill myself with the same medicine that is suppose to be saving me.
26049,"I've tried therapy for years, many different meds, and now all I have is Xanax which helps at least prevent panic attacks (but my lovely doctor wants me off them cause it's not ""long term"" but doesn't have me on anything else, so I'm starting to get worse again and he don't seem to care)."
26050,"Listening to stop worrying tapes and lectures, meds, therapy (had to stop, new insurance has a 30 co pay and that, on top of dr visits, just isnt affordable to me), hypnosis, the whole mirror thing (both positive and negative attempts to convince myself), motivational post-its, and so on."
26051,So I was recently diagnosed with REM Behavioral Disorder and my doctor is wanting me to take medication for it.
26052,Does anyone have experience with taking a drug like Zoloft and another drug for a sleep disorder?
26053,I know they're can be a lot of side effects with these types of medications.
26054,"Since then, was a mix of medication (zoloft) and later CBT."
26055,"I went to see a doctor for my anxiety, and she has referred me to see a psychologist, and suggested I take medication (specifically sertraline, i.e."
26056,"Zoloft)

I'd like to try medication as my anxiety is quite severe, but I'm more than a bit scared of the idea."
26057,"I'm seeing my doctor again tomorrow so am going to ask her more questions, but could anybody share their views on medication, or experiences they've had personally with sertraline or other SSRIs?"
26058,Any tips on how to be more comfortable taking medication or your experience with Ativan or flying with anxiety?
26059,"We got it under control with the meds but now I'm finding it easier to get really, really mad, externalize my anger and lose it."
26060,"However, the medication has made my anxiety EXPLODE."
26061,"I called my doctor, and they told me cut the medication and half, and that definitely reduced the issues a little bit."
26062,"First of all, thank you for taking the time to read over my experiences, and thank you in advance for any contributions or advice."
26063,I would like to warn you now that this post will discuss several triggers which may cause anxiety.
26064,"If you're feeling on edge already, please come back and read over my story later."
26065,I remember having my first existential crisis at the age of six.
26066,It bothered me that there were questions without answers.
26067,The concept of death caused me to enter a very panicked state.
26068,"My chest burned, my breathing sped up, and my muscles contracted in waves."
26069,As a young child I only knew how to handle that in one way; by sobbing and crying.
26070,"I wasn't aware it was anxiety disorder, neither were my parents."
26071,"Natural disasters were my first trigger; earthquakes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions etc."
26072,"Anxiety would keep me awake even as a young child, sleep and I don't have the greatest relationship to say the least."
26073,Fast forward twenty years.
26074,I am sitting here at work right now struggling with anxiety.
26075,Everything seems pointless and hopeless.
26076,"If death is inevitable, then to my anxious mind there is no point in delaying it."
26077,I have suicidal thoughts constantly throughout the day.
26078,I haven't gone 10 minutes today without thinking about ending my life.
26079,"I have compulsive thoughts about death, hurting others, or hurting myself."
26080,"I have never actually inflicted injury upon myself or anyone else, and I don't think I ever would."
26081,I couldn't harm a fly.
26082,"( in fact killing a fly would send me into a panic attack as it forces me to compulsively struggle with the meaning of life and death )

I think about terrible things that could happen constantly."
26083,"For example, if I walk past someone on the street I vividly envision multiple ways they could murder me."
26084,"If I ride the bus home I inevitably conceive every possible worst case scenario from crashes, to suicide bombers, to the overpass collapsing onto the bus."
26085,"There is no escape to these thoughts, I have just learned to push through life and endure them."
26086,Happiness is a fleeting emotion; a distant memory of my youth.
26087,I have multiple panic attacks daily.
26088,"Symptoms range from a tight burning chest, to hyperventilation."
26089,I've experienced every anxiety symptom I've ever read about.
26090,The extent and symptoms of the attacks vary.
26091,"Even when I'm not having an attack, my base level of anxiety is high throughout the day, and fight or flight mode triggers very frequently."
26092,"( oddly enough, with the actual threats that have presented themselves in my life, I have always been a fighter )

Through years of experience and anxiety management I have learned how to function with anxiety."
26093,"I have a full-time job, a wonderful relationship with my beautiful girlfriend, a house of my own, and two dogs."
26094,To everyone else I'm just a happy guy who's living a comfortable life.
26095,"If I stay asleep for longer than 45 minutes, it is a near miracle."
26096,"During the day my mind can keep the anxiety at bay, but when I fall asleep I have nightmares and wake up in the middle of an anxiety attack."
26097,This happens 10+ times during the night on average.
26098,I usually get bursts of 30 minutes of sleep.
26099,Somehow my brain manages to have nightmares and dreams even during 30 minute naps at work.
26100,"I didn't think the brain could enter REM that quickly, but I am not extremely knowledgeable when it comes to sleep, dreams and the REM cycle."
26101,"Whenever I wake up from sleep I don't know where I am, what time it is, and sometimes I don't know who I am."
26102,"This makes sleep a terrifying ordeal at best, and I tend to try and avoid it as sleep makes me miserable."
26103,"I need help, but therein lies my problem."
26104,I have tried everything I can to ease the anxiety that plagues my life and drains all happiness from it.
26105,I have tried several therapists.
26106,Usually they tell me things I already know.
26107,"I have studied my anxiety extensively, and I haven't found a therapist yet who has told me anything I wasn't aware of."
26108,"Medication wise, I've tried just about everything."
26109,"I'm currently prescribed 4mg of klonopin, and 300mg of luvox daily."
26110,"I have weened myself down to just 150mg of luvox daily because even when taking my full prescriptions, the anxiety was terrible."
26111,All medications I have tried have helped very little.
26112,Most had a negative impact.
26113,I eat a very anxiety conscious diet.
26114,"I focus on cutting out sugars, I rarely take in caffeine, I cook all my own meals with the healthiest ingredients I can find."
26115,I make sure I have a thiamin rich diet.
26116,"I drink herbal tea regularly, and supplement the tea with kava or St. John's wort depending on if I am feeling especially anxious or depressed."
26117,"I exercise regularly, and I am in good shape."
26118,"I do daily breathing exercises, I have tried meditation, and I have taken up multiple hobbies to try and keep my mind busy."
26119,"Longboarding, aquarium keeping, wood working, computer programming, music composition, and cooking to name a few."
26120,"So my purpose of posting is to find new coping methods or ideas, and see if anyone else has experiences similar to mine."
26121,What works for you?
26122,Will I ever find any peace and solace?
26123,I'm grasping at straws.
26124,I want to enjoy my life.
26125,"Thanks,

John

EDIT: Fixed words."
26126,I have had very minor anxiety even on my meds but for the most part it was working pretty well.
26127,Go to the doctor and get medication.
26128,"Horror stories come with every type of medication or therapy, and in the new age of conspiracy medical faults turn into diabolical schemes."
26129,"I just saw a therapist for the first time, and they suggested that I get back on medication for my anxiety."
26130,"So I took medicine, felt better and forgot about it for a few days."
26131,"But the next week the cramping came back again, so I went to the doctor and took another bout of medicine."
26132,"No matter how much medicine I've taken, I just feel so so wrong."
26133,"I'm set on an actual psychiatrist since they can actually prescribe medication (and I'm pretty sure that's what I need), but it seems that psychiatrists don't like to work evenings and weekends."
26134,"I found an office that has a psychiatric nurse practitioner who can prescribe meds, so I'm headed that route for now."
26135,I’m glad I can take it only when I need it but the idea of medication is still freaking me out.
26136,I have anxiety and live in NYC.
26137,I am on medications but I still want others who deal with this problem to talk with.
26138,Would anybody be interested in a group meet-up?
26139,I think it'd be a great way to discuss our lives surrounded by people who understand your problem.
26140,"Also, hanging out with other anxious redditors would be fun!"
26141,Just wanted to know how to talk to a doctor about anxiety and getting medication to manage it.
26142,I didn't find it necessary to go on medication until a traumatic event 2 years ago really threw me into the deep end.
26143,"He told me that they don't prescribe those types of easily habit forming drugs much anymore, and instead put me on Pristiq after discussing my problems with past medication."
26144,Can anybody recommend anything to help with the transition onto a new medication?
26145,Ever since taking my meds this AM I have felt like my muscles are connected to a generator powered by the sun.
26146,"Last week I had my first visit with my new therapist and I'm having a dilemma... 
My old therapist told me that the first thing she does when she starts seeing someone new is tell them to stop taking anxiety medication."
26147,TLDR can't decide if I should take anxiety medicine or not
26148,I have very sensitive anxiety and lately I've been on medication (5 weeks and counting) and today just thinking about a scary preview that came on TV got me worked up.
26149,"The medicine is helping in the fact that I'm not going all wigged out, but it's still there:( Just needed to vent."
26150,"I'm on medication for my anxiety, and it usually helps me to calm down in anxiety provoking situations, but not this time."
26151,I'm kind of opposed to taking medication because I've heard of horror stories of the addictive properties of benzos and how hard it can be to get off them.
26152,"When I feel normal I dont want to seek out counseling or medicine, but when I feel crappy I feel like I need it."
26153,"The doctor said he could prescribe some medication, but at 19 years old, I don't really want to be taking medication for the rest of my life."
26154,I was prescribed vistaril a few days ago and it makes me basically pass out for hours on end.
26155,"This is the second medication that I have tried, the first being seroquel."
26156,What medications have you been on that don't cause drowsiness?
26157,Edit: I didn't mean to mark NFSW.
26158,Still out of it from the Vistaril.
26159,"I feel something like xanax which is more of a situational medication, such as a date or an interview,  would better suited for me."
26160,"i'm 16, and i'm a (closeted) bisexual polyamorous girl and an (not closeted) atheist."
26161,my relatives are southern baptist elders and pastors and ministers.
26162,"i have generalized anxiety disorder (i also had a big problem with depression for 4 years, and i havent been depressed since october-ish, even if i still have to try hard to fight off my depressive tendencies) (and ADHD, but that's not important) and christians (particularly southern baptists and fundies) cause me REALLY intense anxiety because of stuff that's happened to me involving christians."
26163,"my parents finally stopped making me go to church last year because i kept having panic attacks and if somebody tells me that they're gonna make me go to church or some other place with a lot of christians i still have panic attacks it's really bad

like, i know it's a really irrational thing but there's a lot of trauma there, and like, what am i gonna do about that?"
26164,"it's not just gonna go away

my relatives are SUPER homophobic fundies, they live in a small town in texas inhabited almost entirely by conservatives over 60, and they fucking scare me and i have to go visit them on saturday to help them clean stuff up and i cant get out of it oh god oh god oh god help i feel like i'm gonna die i reallllly dont wanna go

i'm not on any anxiety medications because i had a REALLY bad experience with abilify and a creepy psychologist in middle school (i think 7th grade?)"
26165,"i was thinking, like, i just got a job, so i could maybe tell my parents that i just got my schedule and that i have to work on saturday maybe?"
26166,"i could go see a movie or get my best friend to hang out with me but i'm worried about whether or not that's a good idea
like my parents might get suspicious or something"
26167,The insomniac medicine they give me at least helps me fall asleep.
26168,"She was not like this before the meds,  she would overschedule sometimes, but not nearly this bad."
26169,My medicine (Citaloprame) does nothing and when I went to the doctor to change it they just increased my dose.
26170,I'm scared to take pain medication afterwards.
26171,"I've had pretty severe anxiety most of my life, and as a result I've mostly been on some medication (buspar 3x daily and xanax as needed for full blown panic attacks)."
26172,"After a month, I can ask my doctor about different medication or something."
26173,I don't really know what to expect since this is my first time on medication.
26174,"It was a Godsend when I first went on the meds, but the side effects have begun to outweigh the benefit I get from them."
26175,"I recently started doing some research into natural supplements, and made the decision to go off of the prescribed meds and begin a more natural treatment plan."
26176,"I knew the side effects from going off the meds were going to be bad, but I had no idea they were going to be like this."
26177,"The most ironic part is that I'd probably give in and go back on the meds at this point, but my research has shown that once you mess up the cycle (even by missing the timing of your dose) the medicine is less likely to work and is MORE likely to have negative side effects."
26178,I've been referred to a psychiatrist to determine my proper dosage of anti-anxiety meds.
26179,"Fell asleep in my bedroom mid-day yesterday after having a shower... as I was falling asleep, I was thinking that I shouldn't be sleeping mid-day, and that I should get up... felt like I was out for 5 minutes (turns out it was half an hour).... then I woke up and stumbled downstairs."
26180,"The thing is, I was still half asleep.... literally.... when I got downstairs, I didn't have enough energy to stay awake, so I fell down on my couch."
26181,"My girlfriend was on the phone at the time, and she noticed me plop down on the couch, so she got off the phone and started talking to me, at which point I got myself up.... but everything was dream-like."
26182,I still had the feeling of lack of control that I have in dreams.... and my consciousness was fading in and out while I was talking with my girlfriend.
26183,"She realized I might be having a panic attack, despite my lack of panic, and she came over and started giving me shoulder massage, but it wasn't keeping me conscious.... she went to take care of her laundry, and I was cold due to the recent shower and my lack of shirt.... so I quasi-sleep-walked up stairs, and ""awoke"" while getting my clothes on, but I was still in the dream-like state.... it was at this point that I *actually* started to panic..... next thing I remember (literally, I don't remember going down the stairs), I was downstairs telling my girlfriend she needed to take me to the ER."
26184,"We drove to the hospital, and about 30 mins after I had woken up (I was strangely cognizant enough to keep track of time), my messed up brain had started to function somewhat normally."
26185,"[edit] Should add, didn't stay at the hospital, because there was a 3 hour ER wait, and I didn't feel they'd find anything worthwhile, and would probably shrug it off as a panic attack, even if there was something else going on[/edit]

Throughout the experience, I had an overwhelming feeling of being in auto-pilot, and having a lack of control over my actions, which is common in my panic attacks, but I also had short periods of lost time.... which isn't so common.... and lack of physical coordination, feeling like sleep."
26186,Anyone have any clue what happened?
26187,Was this simply a panic attack?
26188,Was it some strange combination of sleep-walking and sleep paralysis?
26189,Has anyone else ever experienced this?

26194,Hey guys.
26195,"So I have anxiety in most social situations (especially with women), unless I'm with someone I'm completely comfortable with."
26196,"Now, I have a prescription for Ativan, am looking to buy phenibut and l-theanine (and possibly more nootropics) and am thinking about alternating them on different days."
26197,"For example, I might take l-theanine on a Tuesday, phenibut on a Wednesday, Ativan on a Thursday, and so on."
26198,"My goals with this are to minimize tolerance, avoid addiction and withdrawals (by spacing them out enough and limiting dosage), and allow for me to skip a couple days to rest, safely have a few drinks with friends, etc while still allowing me to live with less anxiety."
26199,"My questions are:

1) Will this work?"
26200,Does anyone have experience with these supplements/Ativan?
26201,Any suggestions for backup supplements/medicine/treatments if something doesn't work?
26202,2) Is this safe?
26203,"Even though on average I might be taking each once a week (twice at the most and only ever rarely), is this still taking a big risk?"
26204,Are there any long-term effects of these supplements/medicines?
26205,Is it possible that I could develop a cross-tolerance?
26206,Thanks guys!
26207,"I had been taking the generic for lexapro (on prescription), but recently, I have been wanting to try and get off meds because they really weren't doing anything."
26208,"He gave meds a very brief try, same with therapy, said they did not help and were expensive."
26209,I've had anxiety pretty much all my life.
26210,I have bad nausea and often vomit when I have attacks.
26211,I'm very scared of talking to people and often have attacks when thinking about my future.
26212,Also when my girlfriend goes out with her friends I have bad attacks worrying about her safety.
26213,I can't study for classes or eat much of the time because the anxiety takes over.
26214,I went to therapy for about a year last year which didn't seem to help.
26215,I'm considering seeing a psychiatrist but I'm worried about medications and side effects.
26216,Any advice reddit?
26217,EDIT: Typo
26218,Anyone know of meds that are known to work like Cexela ( It really worked for me but the sides sucked) with my happiness and Valium with my nerves/panic attacks but w/o the side effects?
26219,**TL;DR** Need input on meds out there that won't cause sexual side effects (Celexa) or make me passout (Valium) so I can research and talk to my Dr.
26220,"None of those things have really worked and now I am 19 years old, I am on no medication, I have no therapy and I feel completely lost."
26221,I did try various meds.
26222,PS: I refuse to take medication.
26223,"Okay, so here's my situation."
26224,I have generalized anxiety disorder.
26225,I worry about things constantly.
26226,Example - Driving to certain places does it for me.
26227,I've avoided having to go to family functions on my wife's side because of this.
26228,There's other things as well.
26229,"I'm not a hypochondriac, but I'm border line.."
26230,"I'm more of an alarmist, where I have something minor, and blow it out of proportion, thinking the absolute worst."
26231,"Well, about 6 months ago, my primary care doctor prescribed me Lexapro, and I was too scared to take it because of possible crazy side effects (ha!"
26232,"anxiety over taking anxiety meds... awesome..)

Fast forward to April, and out of nowhere, I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my lung."
26233,Diagnosed with a genetic condition.
26234,I'm on a blood thinner as well for 6 months.
26235,With all that said..
26236,Here's my question.
26237,"I was prescribed Tramadol for the lingering pain of the blood clot, and after looking into it, I found out that it does something with serotonin as well as pain."
26238,"I noticed that when I take the Tramadol, I feel like a million bucks."
26239,"I feel ""normal."""
26240,"I don't have anxiety - I have a boost of energy, I just feel all around great."
26241,It's like a wonder drug to me.
26242,"I know everyone is different, but for me, it's done wonders."
26243,"The only problem is, it's not used for anxiety, and I can't take it forever."
26244,"I'm wondering if the Lexapro may have similar effects, being that it also does something with serotonin."
26245,Am I right / wrong in thinking this?
26246,"I know they're not the same drug, and I'm aware that everyone reacts different to certain medications, but if I feel better when I get that boost of serotonin from taking Tramadol, is there a chance that the Lexapro may actually make me feel ""normal?"""
26247,"I've been putting off taking it, but I'm having second thoughts now."
26248,"Also, I'm aware that if I start Lexapro, I'd stop Tramadol."
26249,"I don't want too much serotonin, and I don't know how they interact with each other."
26250,Just wanted to throw that out there in case someone was going to say it for me.
26251,"&amp;nbsp;

A year ago I started my first project about nano medicine in chemo therapy and it turned out to be really stressfull."
26252,"I ***do*** take medication, which does help quite a bit in retrospect, but obviously that can't cure everything and I still get anxiety about certain things- i'll just start with my job story now..


About a month ago I got hired at my very first job ever, retail at an amusement park."
26253,Now before this I had tried every stomach medicine I could get my hands on in a store.
26254,"I have been taking an anxiety, nausea medicine that has a helped a little."
26255,I am also scared that the doctor would put me on some medication when I really don't need it.
26256,"I've always been against medication due to my anxiety(scared that it changes the way you think,act etc and also side effects)  I started celexa 2 days ago on a 10mg doss for 2 weeks then up to 20mg until the summer where i willl go off it and see how i feel."
26257,The reason i finally decided to get on meds were severe stomach aches caused by anxiety.
26258,"Taking the meds arent helping psychologically though (because i know they haven't started working yet) but im getting negative thoughts, my stomach feels worse just knowing im taking the pills."
26259,"I was on cymbalta 30mg for 3 weeks before I went off it four days ago, I've also recently started taking Ritalin for my ADD."
26260,"Yesterday I took 50mg Ritalin over the course of the day and felt no cymbalta withdrawals, but once the ritalin wore off at night time I got intensely upset (I'm also fighting with my boyfriend at the moment) and felt flat/depressed until I went to sleep."
26261,"Today I took 60mg of Ritalin and by 5pm when the Ritalin had worn off, I felt extreme anxiety/depression."
26262,I did not feel this way at all prior to starting my new medications.
26263,I really don't know what to do or what the cause of this night time depression/anxiety is.
26264,"Do you think if I have a couple of drinks I will feel a bit calmer and more sleepy or should I avoid alcohol all together (I don't want to get drunk, just calm my anxiety)."
26265,I'm feeling really scared by all this.
26266,"I don't take meds, I do take high doses of B complex and some calcium and magnesium."
26267,"Hi there, I am new to Reddit and am a bit nervous about my first post."
26268,"Anyway, I have had anxiety my whole life and in the past few years it has gotten progressively worse in the past three years."
26269,After 5 different medications I found one that works with minor side effects *yay!
26270,* The only problem is that it completely wipes me out and I cannot make it through the day without napping - and being a Senior in high school means my schedule does not allow for that.
26271,My Dr. said I should avoid caffeine due to it reacting poorly with the medication.. Any advice on how to stay awake?
26272,!
26273,"While on it, I've also discovered that caffeine, imitation sugars, and many allergy meds (which I need to not be miserable..) make my anxiety hit hard."
26274,And here I am married to a heart attack survivor who's on 5 diff meds...
26275,"I KNOW the answer is therapy and medication, but that's not doable right now."
26276,"Starting meds for the first time, only been on them a week."
26277,"So Torn…Dealing with Sexual Side Effects

I am a 22 year old woman, and I suffered from awful GAD before starting on meds."
26278,"When my boyfriend gives me head, my reaction is hardly affected by the meds, and him touching me with his hands feels only slightly less good."
26279,"I try hard to tell myself “If you feel better, it’s because the meds are working” but I’m not convinced."
26280,"Maybe it’s because it’s getting sunnier that I’m feeling happier, and the fact that I am now on meds is just a coincidence, or maybe it's because my first year of teaching is coming to an end, and ahead lies months of relaxing vacation and then a job at a better school."
26281,"I'm only an 18 year old guy, I'm not on any meds at the moment."
26282,"The medication did not, however, help with my anxiety."
26283,"Got meds for, I want to say lorazopam?"
26284,I take my medicine before I leave for work (2 hours late) but I can already tell it's going to be a bad day.
26285,"I went to the doctor and she put me on Xanax and Zoloft and it's only been a few days so nothing has changed and I'm trying not to rely on the Xanax too much and this is my first time on meds so it makes me nervous and all I can really do now is wait and see what happens but until then I feel kind of helpless, you know?"
26286,I've never taken any medication so I'm a bit worried about the side effects.
26287,I have been put back on medication and I guess it's starting to kick in.
26288,I've got some homeopathic medication (Bach Rescue night spray) and Seroquel (which I was prescribed during immediate withdrawal but just made me really tired) which will suppposedly help me sleep but I am still just so fucking terrified of the night and would rather just keep playing games all night but I know that will just make everything worse (two nights in a row with no sleep would obviously not be benifitial).
26289,I've always had anxiety but it's gotten progressively worse the past year so my doctor prescribed me medicine.
26290,"The last time I saw my doctor, she said we would discuss whether or not to take me off the anxiety medication I am on."
26291,"We decided this before I started taking the medication since I don't want to be dependent on it forever, I just was having such bad anxiety I wasn't functioning almost at all."
26292,I never noticed truly how much anxiety I had until I toke the medication and it calmed it down by like 90%...
26293,"The problem is I'm really scared, I don't want to depend on medication my whole life to deal with anxiety, but I'm scared that if I get off of it, I will feel how I did before."
26294,"The medication is helping me through a lot of past issues since now I don't get horrible panic attacks every time I think about my past so I know that I won't be as bad when I get back off of them, but I'm still really scared."
26295,"TL:DR - I'm probably going to get off my anxiety medication in May, but I'm nervous, is there anyone who has any stories about getting off their medication?"
26296,I've tried a few meds and I'm on Fluoxetine (Prozac) right now and have been for maybe 7 months?
26297,I've had severe anxiety and depression for the past 12 years and haven't gotten on any meds up until this past month.
26298,I was finally able to make an appointment to get medication for my depression and severe anxiety this past month.
26299,Go to support groups get on medication or go see a therapist!
26300,I'm basically going to go with self-help and meds.
26301,-Have only been prescribed meds after my first panic attack and have just got some through friends after that as needed.
26302,"I started taking Zoloft 50mg on the 26th on November, it is now December 17th making it a day shy of 3 weeks on this medication and I can't even describe how terrible I feel."
26303,"I find it difficulty to even leave the house, I've never had any of these problems before but my psych keeps telling me to stick with the medication for another few weeks and that I need to get out of the house."
26304,For whatever reason my anxiety is especially bad today which is funny because this is supposed to be an anxiety reducing medication.
26305,i called my doc and asked him if maybe i should just take 200mgs at night instead of twice a day but he said no and that i need to stick it out and get used to the medicine.
26306,im so done with switching meds (ive been doing it for over a year and a half and have tried just abot everything on the market) that i hope this is the one that will help.
26307,"He has a general anxiety disorder that he admits to, has seen a therapist for in the past and takes medication (*Ativan*) for."
26308,"Hi, I was diagnosed with GAD back when I was maybe 13."
26309,"Tried various SSRIs for several years after, all of which made me worse."
26310,"Fast forward to college, find out I have bipolar disorder and am now on Lamictal for that and it has helped with mood stabilization greatly."
26311,"I used to have pretty bad panic attacks, but now they aren't so frequent, however I have mild anxiety almost constantly throughout my day and takes a pretty big toll on my life."
26312,It gets to a point where I am in a feedback loop of constant anxiety about my anxiety.
26313,"I also have some paranoia issues, and what my therapist calls OCD traits."
26314,I know a lot of people prescribe various anti depressants for GAD but I can't take any of them.
26315,"I see a psychiatrist on campus and she says that they can't prescribe benzos just due to the population they serve (kinda stupid, they do the same with ADHD meds too though.)"
26316,She pretty much just gives me antihistamines and beta blockers but they really aren't helping.
26317,Do any of you have experience with some other sort of medications that might apply in my situation that I could at least bring up to my doc?
26318,I feel like she doesn't really even take my anxiety seriously but I'm not really in a position to be able to easily see someone off campus at the moment.
26319,"No more therapist, medication has ceased."
26320,"I'm on Paxil and I have a therapist, but the meds aren't helping and I don't have an appointment for a while."
26321,Is there a daily medication for anxiety -- one you'd take once a day which relieves anxiety throughout the day?
26322,"I realize there's medication like Xanax which you use for temporary relief and which lasts relatively briefly, but is there something for anxiety control for the entire day -- similar to how one would use a daily antidepressant?"
26323,"Hi everyone,

I need help."
26324,"Whenever I'm anxious my hands and legs start to shake a lot, everytime I eat in front of people I don't know or when I present in front of the class or when people stare at me or when I pick up small objects my hands shake and people notice and comment on it all the time."
26325,"Its like the more I get nervous the more I shake, my neck sometimes locks up also and my heart rate goes up like crazy."
26326,"Its been going on for a while now but now that Im graduating high school I really need this to stop, I can't shake everywhere I go and at my job."
26327,"I've tried doing meditation, I've watched many youtube videos and read tons of articles to learn techniques to suppress anxiety, none of them really work."
26328,I tried purchasing L-theanine and it didnt work.
26329,"Im starting to give up now, I asked my parents to take me to a doctor and they keep putting it off."
26330,I really dont know what to do now.
26331,I was wondering if anyone has experienced the same and maybe knows how to stop it or what medications could really help?
26332,Thank you
26333,So I've recently started taking an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication.
26334,"But the medication made it go away completely, and since I'm not taking it anymore, it's come back."
26335,I really really really don't want to take the medication again.
26336,I took some xanax once and that helped stop it but I don't have any anti-anxiety medication.
26337,I've never been diagnosed with any type of anxiety disorder.
26338,I've also never sought out help for any issues I've had.
26339,"I've never been sure if I should get help, if I have the money, or if medication is a good idea or if my symptoms are even worth seeking help for."
26340,So I'd love to hear others' experiences and how the process started for you.
26341,"Background about me: I started having some kind anxiety issue a few years back, about halfway through college."
26342,"I'm graduated now, 23 years old."
26343,"I've had what I consider a panic attack twice in my life: once on a very crowded metro on the way to my first day at an internship, and one day at a different job while sitting at my desk randomly."
26344,"Both times were terrifying, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, lightheaded, scared, almost like I was having a heart attack or something."
26345,"The second one I cried a lot and had to call someone, the first one I got off the metro and hovered over a trash can for 10-15 mins."
26346,"Now, I worry a lot."
26347,I over think about everything in my life.
26348,This morning it was hard to get out of bed because I spent an hour running through scenarios of what could happen.
26349,"I analyze everything people say to me, worry about how I reacted, how to reapproach things, and losing people in general."
26350,I think my best friend and my boyfriend have to deal with a lot of these issues/symptoms/whatever they are.
26351,"Then I feel bad about asking for their help or to talk me through my fears, then I worry about what they are thinking and if they are annoyed/being burdered, bring that up, immediately feel guilty, get worse anxiety that I brought it up at all, etc."
26352,"It's a vicious cycle, and I struggle with ways to clear my head."
26353,Being around people helps a lot: my mind is a lot clearer when I'm physically near people I care about.
26354,But I can't just depend on the ones I love to be there for me 24/7.
26355,I guess I just want some insight: when did you finally decide to seek help?
26356,How did it help you to deal with your anxiety?
26357,Are you on medications?
26358,Any other comments appreciated about anything related to anxiety.
26359,I do have anxiety problems and have been prescribed meds.
26360,"A decade ago, I went through pretty much all the major classes of anti-depressants under two separate psychiatrists, and none of them worked at all, so I have more or less zero belief that further attempts at therapy or medication would be effective (on I think reasonably good grounds, though of course it's hard for me to know how warped my own thinking is, and I know that thinking this is a common delusional aspect of severe depression)."
26361,I'm wondering if medication might help.
26362,Last week i started with the meds that come along with it.
26363,"I'm sitting here, all dressed and with my make up on for the first time since i started my medicine, but i'm frozen."
26364,I'm getting sick of feeling unlike myself and I don't know how to go about getting medication.
26365,"I have to take Xanax for my anxiety, and I am incapable of being able to handle problems without medication."
26366,Should I talk to my GP about switching meds?
26367,My bottle of Zoloft has been sitting on the table for a week now.
26368,I've been on/off meds over the past decade.
26369,"I should have started a diary a long time ago, to record which kinds I've taken, how they affected me, and any adverse reactions."
26370,"When I left my hometown to go to college, I also left behind the only psychiatrist I've ever been able to trust, someone I could really talk to."
26371,My next visit to a psychiatrist broke my faith in that profession.
26372,"This doctor refused to renew my prescription, and dismissed me as a patient, with the excuse that he only treated people with ""genuine"" problems, not someone with anxiety issues."
26373,"The withdrawal symptoms I went through were terrible, something I'll never forget."
26374,"I've been through a gamut of medications since then, prescribed by m.d's in each town I've lived in."
26375,I've had bad reactions and very little satisfaction.
26376,"I'm now seeing a ""shrink"" again, on the advice of my current m.d, but he seems to be a pill-pusher."
26377,"I agreed to accept medication again, but as my title says, I'm afraid to start, afraid of it not working, afraid of it making me sick, afraid that I will be denied my meds and end up in withdrawal again."
26378,First time on r/ anxiety and man do I wish I would have come sooner.
26379,"I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and eating disorder at 18, I am now 23."
26380,I had my anxiety under control for a long while after going to CAMH and finding an incredible cognitive behaviour therapist that really understood me.
26381,"Until I met the guy that I've been with for the past two years who is absolutely amazing, my anxiety was all good and dandy and he was actually making me better, until he fibbed...and I conveniently started birth control."
26382,"The anxious thoughts came back slowly and then the birth control started affecting my emotions very badly so I stopped taking them, then it started to get more out of control."
26383,"Anyway,  we just went on an incredible 6 month trip to New Zealand and I've come back worse, in new zealand at least once a month i would have a week of out of control thoughts and anxiety, for the rest of the month it was controllable anxiety."
26384,"I've been home for 4 days and its just been uncontrollable crying, two panic attacks in one day and consistent minor anxiety attacks."
26385,"I freaked out on my s/o because he was drunk (300km at his parents until we move) and ignoring me on Facebook chat (he doesn't have his cell hooked up yet), and when he was answering he was being a jerk and made no sense."
26386,In his defence I was accusing him of lying and being deceitful...but I'm still upset he was mean.
26387,"My issue is is once I started I couldn't stop the thoughts ""he's drunk."
26388,He's cheating on me.
26389,There's something wrong.
26390,I'm not good enough.
26391,Ill never be good enough.
26392,All my other boyfriends cheated on me so why would he not.
26393,I cant breath.
26394,He having sex with someone else.
26395,I cant do this.
26396,"He's lying"" and on and on and on while sobbing uncontrollably to the point my mum came to lie down with me until 4 am, I'm 23 *ugh*."
26397,I am embarrassed because I sound like a 16 year old having a hissy fit her boyfriend isn't answering her but its so much deeper than that...
26398,"Anyway, this is very long..."
26399,"I think I need to go on medication to at least take the edge off while I get back into therapy...my boyfriend and I are going back to university 2700 km away from home...(him for law and me for biology), I don't exactly feel ready for the move or for school."
26400,which is definitely part of the massive anxiety problem.
26401,"I need to get under control again so I can succeed in school, not loose the man that I love very much, and honestly just be happy again and enjoy my life."
26402,"Those who are on meds, do they really help?"
26403,Are they worth the side effects?
26404,"I don't take any medications, not even Tylenol...unless I have a migraine."
26405,Is it possible to go onto the meds for however long I need them and stop taking them when I feel therapy is enough?
26406,"I'm going to see my therapist this week, so I'm sure she will be able to answer these questions...just want some advice from people with real experience with anti anxiety medication."
26407,Sorry this was so long and kinda scrambled...brain is all over the place.
26408,"Thanks for reading and the possible reply :) 

TLDR: My anxiety is out of control, hurting my relationship with my boyfriend, worried it will hurt my student life and that I won't be able to handle moving to another province without having a total meltdown."
26409,Think I need meds to take the edge off while I get back into therapy.
26410,Wondering if side effects are worth it and if I can take them temporarily to help while in therapy.
26411,About a year ago my girlfriend told me she has severe anxiety and takes medicine for it and sees a psychiatrist and everything.
26412,I can't take medication in fear of becoming manic or something similar.
26413,I'm sorry this is probably going to be a long rant.
26414,"I don't know if this will really have a point, I just don't know what to do."
26415,I have been a fucking wreck lately.
26416,I have been off my medication for about a month.
26417,I decided I don't want to take medication anymore.
26418,I've tried four different medications.
26419,I hate the way I feel medicated and I hate the way I feel unmedicated.
26420,I always feel crazy.
26421,My boyfriend and I have been fighting constantly.
26422,Because of me.
26423,Because I can't control my anxiety.
26424,I've been trying so hard.
26425,I've been going to therapy.
26426,I've been cutting back on smoking pot.
26427,I've started exercising.
26428,I've been trying to eat right.
26429,I've been TRYING to think positively.
26430,Just because I am not succeeding does not mean I AM NOT TRYING.
26431,"When I got to my boyfriend's the other night I was being negative, because I was feeling anxious."
26432,"This lead to yet another fight, and he said that he has not seen me take any steps to try to getting better."
26433,"He said that I've been better before, so why aren't I better now?"
26434,"This tore me apart, because I have been trying so fucking hard."
26435,"I've been fucking trying to think positively, and not be negative, and I tell him all the time how hard I am trying."
26436,But it's not good enough.
26437,I know it's not.
26438,I know I am bringing my boyfriend down.
26439,He said that my anxiety is wearing on him.
26440,I know it is.
26441,"I know this, and I hate myself for it."
26442,"He says he doesn't want to break up, but sometimes I really want to break up for his sake."
26443,I want him to be happy and I know my anxiety makes him unhappy.
26444,I hate that I can't control myself more.
26445,I hate that I am so unhappy.
26446,I hate myself so much.
26447,This past month has been the most anxious I've been in a really really really long time.
26448,"I spent most of the day crying yesterday, in fear of something I cannot grasp."
26449,All I understood is that I was afraid.
26450,Afraid and wanting this horrible feeling to go away.
26451,I feel like I cannot handle my anxiety anymore.
26452,It's ruining my life.
26453,I have been thinking about death so much.
26454,"I don't really want to die, but I do at the same time."
26455,It's so hard to explain.
26456,I can't do this anymore.
26457,I can't keep going on knowing I disappoint my boyfriend so much.
26458,I can't go on knowing I am causing him so much pain.
26459,"I have apologized a million times, but it doesn't change anything."
26460,I don't know what to do anymore.
26461,I don't want to deal with any of it anymore.
26462,I can't.
26463,Does anyone know of any decongestant/cold medicine that's safe to take with Luvox?
26464,"when I mentioned that they had helped (years ago, and I've tried several types of meds, too)."
26465,I guess I didn't seek help because of the anxiety itself and fear of the side effects from meds.
26466,I'm willing to put up with medication if it can help set my life back on track...
26467,"I basically stay at home everyday which is a rather stressful environment...
 

**Maybe medication can set me on the right tracks**

My thinking is maybe it can help me sleep better instead of lying awake anxious and feeling fatigued the next day."
26468,"**The medication I'm looking into**

I've done some basic research..."
26469,Which specific meds should I look into (and perhaps the typical dosage)?
26470,I went to my psychiatrist after months of unsuccessful counselling and I've been put on medication.
26471,I start taking the medication tomorrow.
26472,"I know maybe I shouldn't feel bad, but I had no idea medication was this expensive."
26473,I had an appointment with a physciatrist a few days ago and she's given me a prescription for Zoloft because of severe social anxiety (I can't go to my classes at school.
26474,"), health anxiety (I have food allergies and I am incredibly paranoid about everything I touch and eat, but only at school."
26475,"), and generalized anxiety."
26476,I've had anxiety for about 5 years.
26477,I've also had depression (it has gotten much better) for about a year.
26478,"I know that this was a stupid decision, but I looked up Zoloft on this subreddit only."
26479,Now I'm absolutely terrified to take it because of the side effects.
26480,"I'm also incredibly afraid of medicines and anesthetics/sedatives because I'm afraid that they'll kill me, so looking up the medicine on the subreddit wasn't such a great idea."
26481,"The things I'm most scared about are vivid dreams (I HATE dreaming), suicidal thoughts, and feeling ""flat"" and ""empty"", especially feeling ""empty"" and suicidal."
26482,I'm already at risk for suicide and I do not want a stupid chemical to convince me to kill myself.
26483,"As for feeling empty, I make YouTube videos (Not under queen_hylia so don't bother looking me up, haha!"
26484,It's not like I'm well known anyways!)
26485,and I do charity events and I feel like the medicine would just ruin all of my fun.
26486,I'd much rather feel anxious than empty!
26487,So is there any advice you could give me on what to do?
26488,"My parents have already paid for the medicine and everything so I don't think I'd be able to switch to another, as if there happens to be another that's better."
26489,I really don't think I need a medicine.
26490,I hate that my parents and doctor completely ignored my requests to not be on medication.
26491,I feel like a dog.
26492,"**TL;DR - My parents and doctor are pressuring me to get on Zoloft, and after reading the side effects, I quickly became even more afraid of taking any medication at all."
26493,Any advice to deal with this whole thing?
26494,**
26495,Maybe that's what was holding me together because my anxiety meds don't seem to really do anything.
26496,My doctor thought I definitely needed meds so she put me on Effexor extended release and lorazepam.
26497,"I don't want to just be on meds, that only puts a blanket on my issues, it doesn't exactly make them go away."
26498,"I don't want to take any medication, I'd be frowned upon as everyone here seems to expect the 'ideal' family, and having to break with that image would dent my image even more."
26499,"Bottom line, considering some history of mental issues on my mother's side, she decided to schedule me an appointment in April with a psychiatrist to see about anxiety meds."
26500,My therapist says people with OCD generally benefit from medication but I would like to try some natural remedies.
26501,I am not currently taking any medication.
26502,"I'm sick of using medication, although it helps to a certain degree, but there are always side effects."
26503,"I'm worried that if I start taking medication and it makes my anxiety much better, then I'll have no reason not to get forced into an awful job that I'll hate."
26504,On the meds I felt like I had my whole schedule lined up and I knew everything that needed to be done.
26505,Went to a doctor to get medication but he wouldn't prescribe me anything and instead referred me to a psychiatrist.
26506,"After I stopped my meds, I was okay for about a week, but now I get them everyday."
26507,"I refuse to go back on medication, for 2 reasons, I don't want to rely on them, the fact that I'm relying on medication for it can sometimes be a trigger for anxiety itself some days."
26508,"The other reason being that I don't want to experience the side effects that one gets when you go back on medication, in my case Prozac."
26509,"If youve stopped your medication, could you tell me if this is normal?"
26510,"I do take a medication for my ADHD, Concerta 36 mg but if anything that makes my sounds trigger sensitivity worse, I live in the US ."
26511,"I'm 2.1mo off klonopin, which means I'm flying high without any specific anti-anxiety medication."
26512,"Ive tried meds and i couldnt keep on them, i been seeing a psychologist for almost a year now but made very little progress."
26513,"I want to pursue therapy and going on medication, but the problem is that money is tight in my family right now and our insurance sucks so I don't think that we can afford it."
26514,"If anything I'd like to go on an effective medication for now as a short term fix, until our financial situation improves."
26515,"Now I'm working on it but I'm wondering if meds for blood pressure will help me in long term, or will they just cover my anxiety??"
26516,"Back in January I saw a quicky-clinic doctor because of a sinus infection, I wasn't feeling very well and was taking and over the counter cold medication."
26517,I'm sure we all know what happens when you simply search for any medication stories.
26518,I have had anxiety my whole life.
26519,Everyone in my family is on some sort of SSRI.
26520,"I have panic attacks, anxiety that lasts for days."
26521,"I'll be on edge, high heart rate etc."
26522,I was put on celexa only 10mg but stopped taking it due to loss of sex drive.
26523,"Sex is something, the one thing that actually makes me feel very good and I don't want to lose that."
26524,I have called my doctor on and off nervous about my symptoms .
26525,I ways think negative.... (Very negative) thoughts when I go through these spouts of whatever is happening.
26526,"Anyways, he wanted to put me on paxil!"
26527,I read terrible and scary reviews about going on and off and the in between.
26528,Can anyone contribute or offer advice on what I'm going thorough or possible medications to help?
26529,Or even just your own experience if you can relate.
26530,Thanks reddit
26531,So my parents aren't really supportive of me.
26532,I'm 23 and live at home with my mother who's disabled.
26533,I've had anxiety full blown now for the last 6 years.
26534,"I'm on medications for it that work okay but sometimes, like always, my thoughts overwhelm me."
26535,"As I said, my mother and father both don't seem to really think this is a big issue."
26536,"My mom tries to tell me to just ""relax"" and calm down while my father will call me a ""big baby"" if my anxiety reduces me to tears."
26537,"Couple that with fighting depression with GAD and hypochondria, and my life feels like one big mess - I've been trying to slog through this disorder on my own with some success."
26538,"I saw a therapist a few years ago but left because she was pressuring me to ""get well"" at her pace, rather then my own."
26539,Sorry if this seems rambly.
26540,I just am wondering if this is just me or if others have had to endure the same situation.
26541,"They gave me medication that I'm only supposed to take if I have really bad chest pains, or another episode."
26542,I don't want to be on medication and depend on something else for a personal issue.
26543,My mother is extremely against medication for mental illness.
26544,"I have suggested to her that I try a psychologist first to hopefully learn how to deal with this without medication, but she's even against that."
26545,"I'm on Prozac, but I'm thinking about asking my psychiatrist to up/add meds for the week that ill be there."
26546,"I guess that puts to rest any question as to whether it's effective, but I'm just curious if anyone has experienced the same thing when you miss a dose of anxiety meds."
26547,Or is this a side effect of my meds?
26548,"Antidepressants, benzos, beta blockers, natural meds, will not be outright cures, but will raise the emotional bar significantly to create a positive space where you can work through your issues."
26549,I have struggled heavily with this when adjusting meds.
26550,Knowing that reduces my anxiety about being dependent on meds.
26551,"**Hi all,  
A large part of the cognitive behavioural therapy I'm undergoing currently is challenging my behaviour and not using any of the safety behaviours I've learned over the years."
26552,"I was wondering what challenges have you been set, did you manage to overcome them, and did it help your anxiety?"
26553,"**

*Edit: Behavioural experiments challenge you to remove your safety behaviours and learn that the situation is a normal one, that you have done it on your own and without your safety behaviour, whether it's self reassurance, medication, taking water with you everywhere, a friend etc."
26554,"*

A little background on myself and my current situation:  
I'm 24 and female."
26555,"Diagnosed GAD and panic disorder at 16 when I couldn't leave the house, where I was taught to take the things that help me feel safe out with me to cope with the panic attacks."
26556,"I gradually progressed to being able to go out and see friends, eventually getting a job, moving out to London with a big job and studying as well."
26557,"Been on more medications than I can remember for anxiety and depression since 12, and therapy since 10."
26558,"I recently relapsed in December, and my previous safety behaviours used to overcome the anxiety no longer worked."
26559,"Had to leave my job and move home, struggling with everyday life now."
26560,"One of the behavioural experiments I've been set is to look at the ""rate my vomit"" website due to my massive phobia of vomit....and the concept in itself is terrifying."
26561,"Other experiments involve inducing panic-like symptoms, going out, eating certain foods, travelling alone etc."
26562,What have you been through?
26563,"I am interested in CBT though I don't know a ton about it, I definitely do not want to be prescribed medication, and maybe I would like to start by just doing a general consultation?"
26564,"I've explained repeatedly that I already have a therapist, that I don't want a new therapist, that the cost concerns me, that I'm only interested in medication management."
26565,"I just started a my first ""real"" job and don't feel like it's a good time to shake anything up, but no time is really that great to get off the meds."
26566,"I've tended to be anti-medication in the past but have heard stories about how pharmaceuticals have done a lot of good, though only with anti-depressants."
26567,Has anyone here had any experience taking anti-anxiety meds?
26568,"The doc wants me to try Celexa, and if it works just have it be a short term solution (3-4 months), then return to no medication."
26569,I currently have anxiety but have been trying to forgo meds in favor of CBT.
26570,"My original anxiety symptoms were chest pain, throat tightness and fogginess so it's hard to distinguish between withdraw from the meds or a return to baseline."
26571,"And either way, even when I do get the meds figured out..."
26572,Prior to last week my symptoms decreased and I felt that I was able to control the anxiety and depression well with breathing meditation so I was starting to ease off of my meds (.5mg Xanax - 50mg Zoloft.)
26573,"Just as a side note, I personally suffer from depression, which manifests mostly as severe anxiety, and I am prescribed Prozac but struggle with my own feelings about medication and how if affects my personality, as well as my family's attitudes about depression and the stigma in society."
26574,Still they gave me meds and I took them but I stopped after a few months because they made me feel weird.
26575,"For the record, I am diagnosed and currently taking medication for Bipolar Type 1/Rapid Cycling."
26576,"I am usually pretty well controlled with meds, but also suffer from depression because on top of my anxiety I have physical pain that drives me insane."
26577,"No med change (in fact, no meds, because my doc is on a goddamn sabbatical) , no change in eating habits or in any coping method I would normally try."
26578,"If I DID need medication, can a therapist prescribe me something?"
26579,He is on medication for his anxiety and has been for about 8 years.
26580,"I stay up at night, wondering if he has grown dependent on the meds or if hes suffering in silence, or if I'm overreacting?"
26581,I thought my medication was in the way of my feelings.
26582,Edit sorry.
26583,"Forgot tags:

[help][rant] maybe [meds] (I am sure tags won't work in the body... sorry)."
26584,Hey now.
26585,New to this sub.
26586,I'll try to go thru my story pretty quickly.
26587,"I live in Mexico/California, am 36, married with a 2 year old daughter."
26588,My first panic attack happened the night my grandmother died when I was 15.
26589,"That night, we were in a hotel in San Diego, CA (she lived there) and when I was falling asleep, right before sleep came, I felt I was dying."
26590,"I was so scared and anxious, thru myself in the tub thinking I was going to die."
26591,"These sleepless nights were with me for years, making me barely able to finish high school and drop out the first year of college."
26592,Anxiety and panic attacks continued every few weeks or months.
26593,I had no idea what was happening but I was sure something was wrong.
26594,When I was 21 we were throwing my brother a going away party since he was going to work as a chef in Italy.
26595,"During the get together I had an anxiety/panic attack (can't breathe, sure I was going to die, chest pain or tightness, every uneasy, etc)."
26596,I went into my parent's house to try and calm down and watch some DirecTV.
26597,"I zapped thru the channels and ended up in an infomercial for some audio tapes that ""help"" with this disease."
26598,"Lucinda Bassett or some shit like that was her name, for $600 bucks you get the tapes and your life changes."
26599,Well I didn't get them or anything but my life did change.
26600,That moment I understood what was wrong with me.
26601,I was not the only one.
26602,"There are millions of people in the world suffering like me and, like me, thinking it was only them."
26603,"I started seeing a psychiatrist, and went thru a few of them."
26604,I got prescribed Klonopin in a dropper and an anti-depressant.
26605,Not sure if it was Prozac at that time.
26606,"I started feeling much better, but not 100%."
26607,"I went thru various psychiatrists since none of them was ""the one"" for me."
26608,"One night at a friends house, he told me how his wife suffered like me."
26609,He told me about her psychiatrist and that she was taking Klonopin in tablets.
26610,That's it!
26611,I am being given kid's medicine!
26612,I need the real cure!
26613,Tablets.
26614,"I quickly booked an appointment with her, not know she would be the best, then the worst thing to happen to me."
26615,I was told to stop drinking (which maybe at that time I might've thought I had a drinking problem since for almost a year I drank beer daily).
26616,"I had no problem, i switched to non-alcoholic beer and followed her instructions to the letter."
26617,I was also put on an antidepressant (Paxil) and now taking Klonopin in pill form.
26618,"I think the dose we started with was .5/.5/1.0 (morning, noon and night)."
26619,"I started feeling well most of the times, but there were times it was really bad."
26620,After about a year or so I felt I was great and stopped going.
26621,Still took the meds but now I didn't care too much and had beers on the weekend.
26622,There was a time I didn't leave my house (home office) in about 45 days.
26623,My friends nicknamed me the boy in the plastic bubble.
26624,I felt safe at home.
26625,Not much anxiety.
26626,I had been in a long and sick relationship thru high school.
26627,"Seven years, on and off... one of her friends got engaged and she pressured me to get married which we did when I was 24."
26628,"I paid for the whole big wedding she wanted, even had to help out her family during the marriage because her dad had a bad reputation and really didn't to well in work."
26629,"Once I even got a distribution of a new cell-phone service that was going to open in my state, and my then father-in-law quit his job and made himself my partner."
26630,Without asking.
26631,I was a chicken shit.
26632,I still worked with my father and made a decent weekly check and had to support my inlaws while the business started.
26633,Shame on me.
26634,My relationship was never good but I was too introverted to talk.
26635,I kept a lot of my feeling to myself.
26636,My ex was neurotic or possessive.
26637,She was the jealous type and a dramaqueen when I needed to go out.
26638,Even if it was a business trip or just to see my friends.
26639,A sign I did not really see when we were dating.
26640,Around 2005 we got pregnant.
26641,In the seventh month I woke up to weird noises coming from the living room.
26642,She was having a seizure.
26643,I ran to my mother's house that was behind mine and she got my neighbor the doctor.
26644,"It was alarming, she was foaming in the mouth."
26645,I thought she was dying.
26646,The doctor raced over and said she was having a preeclampsia.
26647,"My mother drove her to the hospital while I drove there too (one of my anxiety habits, pretty much to this day, is that I mostly drive alone, hardly have people riding with me and I NEVER ride in someone else's car."
26648,"Control, I guess)."
26649,In the hospital she had an emergency C-section and my son was born as a premie.
26650,"Cutting to the chase, he did not make it."
26651,He was in the ICU for two week until he finally had a respiratory stroke and died.
26652,After that we kind of recovered.
26653,I had quit smoking seven months prior when she got pregnant and started again.
26654,I reached out to other psychiatrists which kind of helped.
26655,Things got worse and worse after that.
26656,"Not related to the baby, but she started to her old ways again until I couldn't take it and told her it was over."
26657,I think we lived in the same house for around 4-6 months before we finally signed the divorce.
26658,"No lawyers, no drama."
26659,"I told her I'd give her $300 a week until the end of the year, she could keep the car I got her and we split things in the house and she left."
26660,"After she left, I didn't leave the house for around 3 months, I think."
26661,"I called my old psychiatrist, the lady, the one that had helped me more."
26662,She did a few sessions in my house and got me on my feet and out to the street.
26663,I also started seeing a psychologist she recommended.
26664,"Timewise, I am not sure, it might have been 2006 or 2007."
26665,Life went on as normal for a few years.
26666,"Going out, being single again, spending time with friends and more importantly with myself."
26667,Suddenly in 2008 the anxiety came back.
26668,Hard.
26669,I had met a girl on the internet and we were sorta-dating.
26670,"She had similar problems, some phobias, some anxiety, etc."
26671,She understood.
26672,Things got worst to the point I hadn't left the house in a week.
26673,Then in a month.
26674,Then it was 3 months.
26675,"In total, I was a house-bound agoraphobe for 18 months."
26676,I called the old lady psychiatrist and she started treating me at home and charging an arm and a leg.
26677,"She had me (like before, which I skipped) on many medications."
26678,"Antipsychotics, anti-seizure, anti-anxiety,  antidepressants, and anything else she could think of."
26679,"Adding more and more medicines and upping doses, to the point I was taking 8mg of Klonopin a day and still felt anxiety all day long."
26680,Rough anxiety.
26681,Tried to cry and the antidepressants stopped that.
26682,My only escape what this girl I had been seeing and a couple of other friends that visited or I chatted with.
26683,"Since I was a graphic designer I could still do jobs, some were via email, some the clients visited me, friends and family helped me going for checks and depositing."
26684,My mom buying food or this girl as well.
26685,I'd give her cash and she'd do some shopping.
26686,"In a fit of anger I told my psychiatrist to fuck off, in so many words."
26687,"She was just charging and charging, medicating and medicating and there was no progress."
26688,None.
26689,I felt worst.
26690,She left.
26691,"After a week of feeling soooo bad, I gave her a call and she said that I had broken the doctor-patient relationship."
26692,She would recommend another doctor.
26693,When we hung up I received a call from another psychiatrist I had left a message to.
26694,He had been my doctor for a time and I remembered it wasn't bad at all.
26695,"He went to my house, changed my doses and medicines."
26696,Low doses.
26697,Came back a week later and I was feeling awesome.
26698,"Then 3-4 days later, at 2am I was chatting with a friend and told him."
26699,I am gonna try to to to 7-11 for a coffee.
26700,I went.
26701,Got there.
26702,Going home; let me take the long way.
26703,Then this other street.
26704,Then this bridge.
26705,I drove around 2 hours.
26706,Every time getting a little farther and farther from my comfort zone.
26707,"Next morning the same, I went out to drive."
26708,And that is when I was and felt free.
26709,(almost done).
26710,Well I stayed with this psychiatrist for a while.
26711,Doses and medication were in the norm.
26712,".50mg of Klonopin, 20mgs of Lexapro."
26713,I still didn't travel or drove in open spaces (e.g.
26714,"highways, long lines in the border)."
26715,"Even if in 2010 I did travel by plane, the red-eye and the doctor was in the plane as well."
26716,He was going to a conference and I joined to go to the same city to a concert and to visit friends.
26717,Then I felt stuck.
26718,I changed psychiatrists with my current one and things got a bit better.
26719,I started travelling.
26720,For work.
26721,"Now more as a photographer, had a client that sent me to Colorado, then L.A., then Alabama."
26722,Paid great.
26723,"I was driving from city to city, flying, felt great."
26724,I got married a bit before that with the girl I talked about.
26725,We now have a 2 year old girl.
26726,"------

(almost done, really)."
26727,"About a month back I have been feeling not much of the anxiety (that never left me but was low and manageable, even ignorable."
26728,Depression is what has been over me this month.
26729,Feeling down.
26730,Unmotivated.
26731,"Wanted to drive the 2 hours to San Diego, CA and couldn't even get near the border."
26732,"It wasn't much anxiety, it was more depression."
26733,"There's a saying here, not sure how factual, that medicine in Mexico is 25 years behind the US."
26734,I am an American Citizen.
26735,I have private insurance.
26736,So I just made an appointment with a doctor in San Diego that has great words about him online.
26737,"I will pay around $25 copay, much less that out of pocket with my doctor now."
26738,"I did email my current doctor about my depression, he just upped my dose from 40mgs to 60mgs of Paxil, and .50mg of Klonopin (a few months back I was in a ""only when needed basis"", I was taking .50 every 7-10 days, now I am back on it daily."
26739,I am writing this from my office.
26740,I left my house to go to the grocery store for a few things and tried 3 times.
26741,Twice I returned home because anxiety started.
26742,The third time I stopped in my office which is near.
26743,I took another dose of Klonopin and started writing this to present myself and join the community.
26744,I have been thru a lot and have been great.
26745,I am scared to touch the bottom again.
26746,When I was driving here it kinda felt like when I tried to leave my house in my agoraphobic year.
26747,"I can't wait to tuesday to see my new psychiatrist, tho I will have to drive to San Diego, cross the border, but I am sure I can."
26748,"My wife is very supportive and sometimes once I am 20% into a road, I just start feeling great and I think to myself lyrics from my favorite songwriter (Conor Oberst)... ""There's nothing that the road cannot heal."
26749,"When I make it to Moab, I'll get my cantine filled."
26750,There's nothing that the road cannot heal.
26751,Basically I wanted to vent and read about similar experiences.
26752,I can't go back to being housebound.
26753,I have a wife and a daughter to look after now.
26754,I travel now.
26755,I fly.
26756,I drive.
26757,Something with anxiety.
26758,Sometimes the anxiety just makes me take a small break but end up doing it.
26759,So... how are you guys today?
26760,"TL;DR
First panic attack at 15."
26761,Psychiatrists since 21.
26762,"Agoraphobic and housebound 18 months in 2008/2009
Much better that I've been a long time."
26763,Depression creeping in again.
26764,Anxiety presenting itself a little stronger that usual.
26765,Will see a new psychiatrist in a week.
26766,"(36 now, married with a 2 year old daughter and an 8 year old boy from my wife)."
26767,I just tapered off Celexa and Buspar about a month ago.
26768,Buspar was mid July and Celexa was beginning of August.
26769,"Before starting my medication in January, I had been suffering from a high degree of anxiety for a year and dealing with it without medication."
26770,Ironically I was working in a psychiatric office when it just got to a point where I was able to function at work and that was it.
26771,So I started seeing one of the doctors at my work at their other practice and we had to change my medications around once but once I was on the Celexa Buspar combo I was great.
26772,I felt better than ever.
26773,Unfortunately i did pack on about 10lbs which everyone says that they can't tell but I can and it sucks.
26774,So after 6 months of doing well I quit.
26775,And I was doing really well in the beginning.
26776,I was working a new job with new friends and I forgot to mention I'm getting married next month.
26777,And then I lost my job.
26778,And it sucked.
26779,At first I thought I'd recover quickly and find a new job quick.
26780,But after receiving rejection letter after rejection letter I found myself getting back into a familiar slump.
26781,Still I held my head high even when I came down with a pretty bad cold last week.
26782,(Seriously who the hell gets a cold in the summer heat?)
26783,"But the high stress of a wedding in less than 30 days and a future mother in law who is being really difficult about everything and just being emotional in general from everything else I have going on, I broke down in the middle of the watching Mockingjay Part 1 with my fiance yesterday."
26784,"For those of you who have seen the movie, it was the part where Finnick is talking about how it takes seconds to fall apart but a long time to rebuild yourself or whatever and I just lost it."
26785,Crying spells the rest of the day and shaking and panicking and just in general wanting to curl up in bed.
26786,My poor fiance just held me and tried to cheer me up the whole time.
26787,My future brother in law came over later and him being there kind of forced me to pull it together.
26788,But there were still random times when I just wanted to cry.
26789,I went to bed trying not to puke my guts out.
26790,"(Something that happens when I'm upset)


And now I'm just laying here contemplating going back on my medication and making an appointment with my doctor and all that jazz."
26791,Which sucks.
26792,I really felt strong enough to handle everything and I really wanted to get married unmedicated.
26793,I knew it wasn't going to be a walk in the park but I didn't know it would be so hard.
26794,I almost cried again this morning when my fiance got up and left for work because I didn't want him to leave.
26795,=(
26796,I ordered her some worming medicine off Amazon and ended up telling my parents about it so we could get her help.
26797,One anxious acquaintance of mine exhibits it severely enough to warrant daily medication and weekly therapy appointments.
26798,One person saw a therapist for only a brief stint until they identified a good medication schedule for her.
26799,"TL;DR  :  male, 21, have overcome anxiety problems and back to my normale life."
26800,found somethig i like as a career.
26801,I am a more happy person now.
26802,"YES it's possible, do not give up."
26803,"if I can do it, you can."
26804,"Just make some efforts, even the smallest if a huge step ;) have a good day wonderfull people of r/anxiety, take care."
26805,"Hello, first english is not my first language so be smooth on the grammar errors i'm not perfect... :3 Well i saw people who liked hearing good stories of people who got better, here is mine."
26806,"From hell (anxiety, i'm aware manny peoples had it harder than me but for me it was hell) to an enjoyable normal life again."
26807,"From a bullied kid when i was 9, from the solitary boy i was all my life (not by choice) i didin't had any friends, or girlfriend, never had a kiss and... well you figure that out.. 2 years ago i had anxiety problems that started with not knowing what to do in life, it scared the living *** out of me."
26808,tryed something but quit on an impulsive taught.... then i was really anxious... trouble sleeping.
26809,i tryed something else bu i forced myself during 1 long painfull week.
26810,"I quit that, it was not a job i liked anyway."
26811,then... what do i do ?
26812,"it went only worst, i started doing some advanced maths for maybe going in a program in colege, *maybe* it was for not staying at home doing nothing, starting working scared the living **** out of me because i never worked before."
26813,"It only went worst.... what i call *that* infernal week, the worst week of my life, the worst moments of my life... durin that week i had extreme anxiety, insomnia, the pain... oh the pain... nothing physical, it's only mentally, but oh so much horrible, so painfull, it was torture just to live 1 minute of it, imagine a whole week of it."
26814,"the doctor tell you *do you have dark toughts* it's a polite way of saying do you have suicidal toughts, i said no.... but that's not entirely true... the suffering is so intense, nothing in life have a value anymore, music is not music anymore, video games (and god i love them, music too it's my 2 bigest passion) it was lifeless."
26815,"Lost my apetite, lost weight."
26816,"I didin't wanted to die, but you are not stupid, how much how hard you fight it, your subconcious is thinking *hey... see those pills over there ?"
26817,take them all and the pain will finaly go away...* because there was literally nothing to make me feel better.
26818,"it was constant suffering, sometimes less worst, but no relief."
26819,"I was taking anxyolitics, it was not strong enough,  i started anti-depressant and an other anxyolitics."
26820,it took some days before i started feeling not better but *less worst* after a week and a half-2 week the anxiety was going down.
26821,"To pure torture to *livable* sorry grammar nazis i'm butchering my engrish....

so that was for about a year, after that is this year (well this school year that just finished) i tryed the same computer tech professional diploma that i first started and that started my big anxiety when i left it because i was so lost not knowing what to do in life."
26822,"It was fun, the people were nice (exept some little exeptions that hurted my friend..... she already have problems with being in a guy environements qui pc's and computer pieces all around...) what a bunch of heartless bastards... N_N

anyway i made a good friend (her) and i became much more social, i overcome my little social phobia well it's still not perfect."
26823,"I talk more naturally with people, whitout fearing the scary awkward *silence* since then i never had anxiety anymore (well i was still on my second anti depressant, the first ones didin't worked well) 

i saw a psycholoist but it was meh... he was cool and young but not much connection from me to him and it's something crucial for therapy."
26824,"i did most of my changes alone, from the horrifying anxiety eperience that forced me to make changes, even the smallest one is an accomplishement."
26825,"There is no secret in making your life better, you have to make some efforts."
26826,"I did, not always perfect but i did and it was rewarding."
26827,"going ou with friends, discovering some tasty drinks in bars that before i would never have went to a bar because i hate beer, and i hate bars it's not a fun place to me, music is too loud... but there is a cool little bar with a babyfoot table and a nes-n64 to play :o clubby place with techno music and douchebags and superficials girls uhhh i hate that...


anyway dont drink while on meds.... it's stupid i know i did it and it was in moderation i was never drunk and my medications were not too strong so it didin't really did anything, but for once in my life i wanted to just have fun and freacking go, whitout wories."
26828,"Me who as extremely comlexed that i never had a girlfriend, never kissed, and never... well you get the point."
26829,"i got my first girlfriend and my first kiss, i tought my first kiss would suck but no it was so good :) but the girl was a liar stupid **** so it was not long.. XD anyway at least i had one, at least i can say that at 21 years old i had a girlfriend... N_N at least now i can say i had one (i know it dosen't mater but it was bugging me alot before) 


right now i have in a... a...  withdrawal  ?"
26830,weaning ?
26831,anyway i was on 20 mg and now i'm on 10 for 1 month and i'm finnaly free of this medication.
26832,It saved my life when i needed it or otherweise i would have turned crazy for not having even a minute of relief of the extreme pain.
26833,But i'm happy i will be free of it.
26834,"still no anxiety for a year and a half now :) back to my normal life and even a little better, still a huge gab to fill to be fully happy but i'm working on it."
26835,"i'm doing good-great depending on wich day, exept maybe after november i started getting depressed late at night and started crying (me who never cryed in my entire live exept when i had extreme anxiety and when i was a kid) but it was not health related it was... more of a broken hearth... i lived it hard because it was my first time dealing with this... N_N i tought it was the love of my life, what i lived all my life for the only meaning to my life."
26836,to be happy with someone i trully love.
26837,"but nope...


anyway, to you if you didin't falled asleep durin this your good your good."
26838,"I post this to show that, yes it is possible to get better, but for that you need to make some effort, even the smallest of effort is a big acomplishement !"
26839,"Do not give up, if can make it.. me.... then you can make it it's sure."
26840,"medications is not obligatory to get better, in my case it helped me greatly, but keep in mind a single therapy will work too, and help you solving your problems."
26841,"Pills only make the pain fade away, it will not resolve your problems, talk to your doctor if you think it's right for you or not (and dont be stupid like me who was drinking while on meds... even in small dose i dont recomand it)

even alcohol in general, i discovered a passion for tasty drink but it's not a good idea if you ask me to drink while having anxiety, a beer on ocasion is ok. but do not ever drink by yourself, you will have the illusion to maybe feel better, and it can cause a circlejerk ?"
26842,"anyway adiction to that *buzz* and you'll need and other one.. and an other... then alcoholism.. i dont try to scare you, i'm saying it's not a good idea while your mind is weak, because it's likely to submit to adiction..

so that's it.... if you have some questions dont be shy, have a good day ladies and gentlemens ;o"
26843,"I realize that medication and therapy work best when done together, however my anxiety issues were talked about and dealt with by my therapist a few years ago when I was seeing her for depression."
26844,This all started in college.
26845,"After a pretty traumatic experience with a former roommate, I began to have some issues."
26846,"I would wake up in the morning, feel nauseous, and end up throwing up."
26847,"This went on for about a 10 day period where I kept getting sick, and couldn't keep anything down."
26848,"This has happened intermittently over the past five years, and I knew it was stress because of what would be going on in my life at the time it started up."
26849,"It finally got so bad that last September, I medically withdrew from school and finally got the diagnosis I've been dreading: severe anxiety and depression."
26850,"I've been on a few medicines but didn't like the way they made me feel, so I quit the second one cold turkey."
26851,"I hate taking medicine and doctors visits, so I haven't been back to see my doctor since probably this past January."
26852,"I tried really hard to focus on the great things in my life instead of worrying about everything else (my family and boyfriend tell me I'm a big worry wart), but the past 2 months have been hell from my point of view."
26853,I moved out of my parents house and on my own.
26854,"My best friend and I got an apartment together, and things haven't been going how I imagined."
26855,"Work is at peak season so we've been working 10-11 hour days with minimal breaks, and I'm exhausted."
26856,"The pay two weeks I've woken up, I've been feeling nauseous, and this morning I finally threw up."
26857,"I feel no relief, only more anxiety because I don't want to go through this again."
26858,I don't know what to do anymore...
26859,He prescribed me some medication (which I have annoyingly forgotten the name of!)
26860,I did the therapy thing and I was put on medication (Zoloft).
26861,I'm still on the meds four years later and generally doing a lot better.
26862,I have gone 5 months without a regular medication (sometimes I take a clonazepam when really anxious) however i'm starting to think maybe medication could help me a lot.
26863,Just waiting for meds to kick in here.
26864,"I do panic attack almost every week and i can't deal with this anymore, even if the one of last night i have deal with my medication with homeopathy and i don't have cried."
26865,I would highly recommend Phenibut to anybody looking to try something outside of more traditional methods like medication (and all of their side effects...
26866,"I need my meds... 

Help..."
26867,"I've tried self medication, and muscle relaxers that general doctors give me... but now it's in my jaw and neck and face... i know it's going to get worse ....."
26868,"Overall I feel a lot better only a bit of general anxiety, sort of like a back ground type of thing annoying, but very much better than before taking the medication."
26869,"I'm doing everything I can (with the help of therapy, meds) to work out my issues independently."
26870,"I would like to TRY to stay away from medication, just based on personal preference."
26871,I had two sessions with the therapist and was diagnosed with anxiety/depression and was to meet with a psychiatrist the next week to decide on a medication plan.
26872,"I bailed while in the waiting room (because the thought of taking a medicine that could change/interfere with the way my mind worked scared the hell out of me), costing a fee for not cancelling the appointment in advance."
26873,"Along with CBT, exposure therapy, my meds, I managed to make it work."
26874,"I also suffer from chronic insomnia, and the last probably 8-10 months I have been taking my meds solely at night to try to help me sleep, but the same deal is i'm taking more meds and they arent working."
26875,So I quit my anxiety meds 2+ months ago.
26876,"I went from being crippled, relying on meds, to now being able to drive 30+ miles, 30+ minutes."
26877,"Which is not something the practitioner would normally do, because she is our birthing midwife basically, and knew my wife breastfed and the meds would mean we had to quit that, which was really hard for me personally."
26878,"I myself have gone through psych dr in my twenties and have my own success I suppose from being on meds, but then getting off when i felt i didnt need them anymore..."
26879,"That was the first time I tired taking medication, I took a half a peach ( Xanax ) it helped."
26880,"But I didn't start taking them, my friends got bad into them so I always avoided taking medicine my whole life."
26881,"I feel like things have been getting better though, I've never taken meds before."
26882,"For the first 18 months, I resisted medication and instead tried all that herbal rubbish, meditation and of course counselling but nothing ever helped in anyway."
26883,"So I've continued to take OTC meds, which help."
26884,I currently cannot afford to see a therapist or take anxiety meds at this time.
26885,"I've been psychologically, verbally and sometimes physically abused by my dad since i was little, he would insult me on a daily basis and sometime hit me, yet i would be a happy outgoing child, when i was 7 i had my first panic attacks, i would just say to my mom that i was afraid to die, she took me to our doctor, i was given medication and after a while it was ""gone""."
26886,"In the mean time i've seen several psychiatrists and psychologists, but talking with/to them + the medication (had prozac, xanax, deroxat and some other i can't recall the name of) wouldn't change anything."
26887,After years of switching doctors and medication with zero improvement i decided to stop everything and try to get better by myself.
26888,Having been diagnosed with GAD and seeing doctors about it for a while I've noticed that they simply don't prescribe the best medication.
26889,The weird thing about this is that she has actually been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and takes meds for it.
26890,"What kind of medication are you guys taking in SOS situations, how's that turning out for you?"
26891,"Hey guys, stumbled on this thread tonight and would like some input from the folks going through struggles I'll never fully understand."
26892,"I'm an RN that works in behavioral health, so my knowledge base is a little above the rest."
26893,I've got a friend currently in therapy that is being recommended for an elevated level of care via medication management.
26894,She has pretty classic Generalized Anxiety Disorder with some traits of OCD sprinkled in.
26895,Has anyone ever been on some less common medications that would potentially treat both on a long term basis?
26896,I'll be going to her med management appointment as a support and I want to point her in the right direction.
26897,I'm a little leery of the doc just tossing her some generic benzos and sending us on our way.
26898,Thanks in advance!
26899,"Ive never found anyone else who has this feeling so I'm looking to reddit to hopefully find someone who might have it as well
I'm not on meds and I'm wondering if anti-anxiety meds would fix this issue because I just can't take it anymore 
(Sorry this post is all over the place!)"
26900,"Im taking all the meds and inhalers but the pollen has been so high in the uk these past few weeks that they are having little effect :/

So, i felt wheezy, started coughing, and then felt i couldn't breathe enough to talk so i started to panic."
26901,I think meds are slowly starting to work.
26902,"So what are some other meds that help with Anxiety/Depression that aren't called ""Zoloft?"""
26903,"Ok, so I now know, and am sure that I need therapy and medication for this disorder I have."
26904,"I have OCD (diagnosed) and possibly GAD, as well as some other non-anxiety issues, and I am currently on no medication."
26905,I'm now on medication.)
26906,"I can no longer participate in a night of drinking with my friends, or take medication as prescribed, because any form of non sobriety makes me panic."
26907,I chose a psychologist mainly because I didn't want medication to be the quick and go to answer.
26908,I understand how this medicine works and I'm certain I can't control it.
26909,Im sure this will sound strange but bear with me.
26910,Ive struggled with crippling anxiety my whole life.
26911,"Ive been on medications, currently practice mindful meditation, positive self talk etc."
26912,"It comes and goes depending on the day, I am all to familiar with the struggle."
26913,That being said I feel like im being put in a weird situation now.
26914,One of my best friends (who unfortunately is notorious for making things up to sound more interesting/exaggerates everything) has started complaining about anxiety.
26915,"I dont want to sound unsympathetic because i absolutely feel for anybody who is having any kind of mental or emotional trouble, but i feel like he is making this up for attention."
26916,Over the past year or so ill explain what its like to have a panic attack or episode to him.
26917,"Then, within days i will hear him explaining how he had a ""panic attack"" to others in front of me using a very similar scenario to mine if not the same one."
26918,I should mention that at first when he started bringing this up to me i gave him a lorazepam to try to help him out and he said that it didnt do anything.
26919,Just recently he was prescribed a medication that he said was life changing and motivates him to get everything done that he needs to.
26920,Turns out it is lorazepam as well and he forgot that is what i let him try.
26921,I should also mention that he lives with room mates and they all take xanax (sp?)
26922,and vicodin almost every day when they drink just to get more fucked up.
26923,"Like i said i dont want to sound insensitive but i feel like this is for attention or a drug seeking behavior, and it really frustrates me that he would use something that ive struggled with for so long as a vehicle to do this."
26924,"Sorry for the novel, any advice on how to approach this would be helpful."
26925,Happy stories about starting meds and feeling better would be greatly appreciated :)
26926,BTW I am on meds and have been for about 6 months now but still get attacks nevertheless...
26927,"So I have had panic attacks before, usually over the loads of work I would sometimes put off as an undergrad."
26928,Other then that I function pretty smoothly day to day.
26929,"However today and yesterday were some of the worst attacks I've ever had, and the thing it was during a pre-graduation event and graduation itself (I got my Bachelors in English)."
26930,"I just went to the pre-event and I guess it just hit me that I was graduating and I fucking freaked out, like out of nowhere."
26931,"I didn't expect it, but once they started reading senior awards I just needed to get the hell out of there because of the sense of dread and panic that was coming over me."
26932,Fast forward to today.
26933,Graduation day.
26934,"When I was getting my cap and gown on I already felt anxious despite the fact I knew it would be ""ok.""  I had to go, my mother, father, brother, and grandfather were all going to be there and I was expected to walk."
26935,So I'm in the staging area and I knew this was going to be bad.
26936,I'm sitting in the church pew in a row of people that was ordered in a way that the degrees that were to be handed out would get to the right people.
26937,I feel that same sense of dread coming over me that happened last night .
26938,"I think I'm going to freak out, I think I'm going to freak out, the cyclical thinking happens and I do."
26939,I leave my spot for a drink of water and I just stay down in the basement of this place calling my parents that I can't go through with this despite the fact I'm doing breathing exercises and whatnot.
26940,"My parents get pissed, then concerned, then pissed again, then concerned again that I don't want to walk at graduation."
26941,"My father ends up coming to where I'm at, gives me a hug and calms me down and I take my place in the procession at the last moment possible."
26942,"The beginning of the ceremony was bad, but controllable through breathing techniques and a general positive mindset."
26943,I see people winning awards and honors and it spurs a bit of panic because I knew I could have won some if I wasn't such a slack-off.
26944,"I ended up walking and getting my degree and having a good time afterward, I take pictures with my girlfriend, my friends, and parents."
26945,"They knew I was freaking out the entire time, but were happy I was able to do it."
26946,So I thought I was fine.
26947,Then dinner happened.
26948,"I was with my family in this restaurant, and I looked at my brother (whom I love) and randomly thought I don't want to be with my family and had another mini-internalized attack."
26949,I had to excuse myself from the table and smoke a cigarette outside.
26950,"I came back, calmed down,  told everyone about how anxious I was about this new chapter in life I am experiencing and they were understanding, but the whole vibe was thrown off."
26951,Nobody was having fun on a day that is supposed to be a celebration and I feel guilty for everything.
26952,"Now I""m just kinda drinking too relax."
26953,"Some background is necessary, I was a heavy drinker at school and have done recreational drugs."
26954,No pot though.
26955,"Sorry for the rant, I just had a real difficult day and any support, suggestions, or comments would be great


tl;dr:  I had panic attacks and it ruined by college graduation."
26956,"Edit: I'm a male, 21 years old, I don't really know what type of anxiety that spurred those attacks but I usually get attacks when I have a lot of work backed up, I'm not on any medications but I am drinking alcohol."
26957,Because I was a college freshman (living in dorms and just moved back to my parent's house on Thursday) I have been unable to receive therapy or medications.
26958,"Aside from the more severe side-effects, like sending me to the ER at 144bpm with no trigger, or the terrible scares that metaphorically cripple me, I feel like an idiot all of the time."
26959,"I've always been an A- or A student, great with grammar, and quick-witted."
26960,Lately (2-3 months) I've felt like I've been getting dumber.
26961,"I cannot remember things as quickly as I feel I should, and I often cannot think of the words I need to complete my sentence (for example, searching my brain for the word ""often"" in this sentence was difficult for me)."
26962,"I often misread things, and my thoughts feel jumbled."
26963,"I also seem to be screwing up my speech sometimes, like switching parts of words, or switching tenses and possessions within sentences for no reason although it sounded fine in my head before."
26964,"I also feel that I cannot recall information, or I cannot understand things as quickly as I should."
26965,"Is it possible that this is related to my untreated lifelong anxiety, or could this be a more serious issue?"
26966,Do any of you guys feel this way at all?
26967,What do you suggest I do?
26968,Thank you!
26969,"I am on no form of medication, but right now I really wish I was."
26970,The pain meds aren't working so well and its making me so anxious.
26971,I ran out of my meds faster than I usually do.
26972,"I have had my meds for around 90 days, and it was 60 1mg ativans."
26973,I am terrified that my doctor will think that I am abusing my meds.
26974,I've been trying a lot of different methods (excluding medication) to stop my anxiety.
26975,"I have nausea medicine, but it does nothing but make me less likely to vomit and even then I vomit the medicine up sometimes."
26976,I don't know about getting new medicine because my mom basically tells me to suck it up... which makes me even more frustrated.
26977,I'd like to get some kind of medication or something just so I can have a normal relationship with another human being.
26978,"Keep in mind i only have issues with anxiety but she will only prescribe antidepressants (yes i know they work for mild anxiety) or basically *not* anxiety meds... i dont know if thats just her or the whole practice, or maybe because I told her Im a daily smoker of the mj to combat misophonia (sound sensitivity) and anxiety."
26979,"(keep in mind Ive never done any other drugs and have zero experience with anxiety meds)

Most of my anxiety is school related, if that helps, but school is a constant thing in my life so that stressor combined with other things means I get anxiety about smaller stuff too."
26980,"I have no idea how to approach any of this, I kinda hate my psychiatrist, she treats me like an idiot, asks me what meds I want to try even though I told her I was new and would prefer guidance as opposed to ""well what do you want to try"" especially because when I make suggestions (this SSRI dose makes me not feel my damn clitoris, can we lower it?"
26981,I have a call in to my Doctor but I don't expect a response until Monday.
26982,"If anyone else has had similar experiences, let me know how things turned out."
26983,I recently (2 weeks ago) switched from Lexapro (generic) to Pristiq.
26984,I have felt relatively normal until yesterday when I got a little lightheaded.
26985,"Today, about an hour after taking the pill I got really light headed and started feeling very sad."
26986,I had to pull over and cry for a bit and when I got home I curled up and bawled my eyes out.
26987,"It's not a desperate, depressed, kind of sad."
26988,"It's just a weepy, moody kind of sad."
26989,"I know it will pass as I normally have strange, unexpected reactions when on new medications."
26990,I'm just curious to know if my experience is common and how long before it might pass.
26991,I don't take meds besides something homeopathic.
26992,I don't want to be on medication anymore.
26993,I don't know where to start with this but if I don't get my thoughts down I feel like I'm going to explode.
26994,And I'm tired of telling the people who will listen because it's the same old story and I feel like I'm boring them with my problems.
26995,I graduated from College last year and a few months after was put on Viibryd for anxiety.
26996,My anxiety was stemming from my inability to land a job and feeling like all the time I spent in college was for nothing.
26997,I was working at a shitty call center and having a hard time even getting to work in the morning.
26998,Eventually I got used to Viibryd and things evened out.
26999,I still hated my job but I was at least numb to it.
27000,I turned 26 and then was no longer insured by my folks Health Insurance.
27001,I couldn't afford Viibryd anymore and got switched to Citalopram.
27002,The transition between the two medicines was difficult but I had a new job that was a lot better so things were looking up.
27003,2 weeks ago I got laid off from that job.
27004,It was a temp position so it shouldn't be surprising I guess but since then things don't seem to be getting better.
27005,"The job search is going slow, I feel worthless as a son and a boyfriend."
27006,The medicine has destroyed my sex drive and I don't even care about things I used to like to do.
27007,"My days have become a pattern of waking up energized, becoming defeated over the course of the day and going to bed depressed and defeated."
27008,I don't know what I should be doing anymore to get better.
27009,I can't afford therapy.
27010,Even a visit to the doctor is so damn expensive.
27011,I'm sick of being angry and sour and sad and mad all the time.
27012,I need help but I really don't know what to do anymore.
27013,I didn't used to be like this and it's only getting worse.
27014,Does anyone else have a huge fear of taking medication?
27015,I feel like I lose control when I take meds.
27016,I'm at the office now but my meds are in the hotel and I am seriously freaking out.
27017,"When we are cleaning his room, I see that he has anxiety medicine, which gets me thinking."
27018,"I began taking medicine at the beginning of this school year, and it has helped me sleep a bit more."
27019,I have found that working out stops the attacks but I will look into meds due to the fact that will not always have time to work out.
27020,"My anxiety is starting to destroy any hold onto normalcy I once had, and I want help."
27021,"I have severe (like, **severe**) social anxiety, and no trust in anyone."
27022,"The moment I meet someone, I find a reason I don’t like them, or they don’t like me."
27023,I can’t make friends anymore.
27024,"I’m constantly worried people are talking about me, hating me, trying to hurt me."
27025,"I don’t feel comfortable around anyone, and alone in the quiet the thoughts just get worse."
27026,It’s a snowball effect.
27027,"Someone saying something tiny, a simple challenge to an idea that’s not important to me, can send me over the edge and give me a panic attack so bad that I feel like life isn’t worth living anymore."
27028,"Tunnel vision, chest feeling like it’s splitting in half, body going numb, and sounds echoing."
27029,"I feel like this isn’t how life is supposed to be, and I want help, now, before I become even more of a recluse."
27030,"I tried Zoloft for a while last year, and it made me feel better, but it killed my sex drive (which in turned made me die a little inside lol), made it so I couldn’t sleep at **all**, I couldn’t eat anything but corn pops, I was constantly nauseous, and it overall just sucked."
27031,"I went off of them, and the anxiety/depression came back, but everything else got better and I figured I’d just deal."
27032,"My family is completely unsupportive and pushes me into more and more social situations, when even sitting with just them, watching TV, is hard for me to bear."
27033,"(Not because of child issues, I get really panicky and dizzy)."
27034,"I am broke, so while I really want to try therapy so I can get a hold of myself again, I was wondering if anyone knew of any programs for people in my shoes?"
27035,"Likewise, any medications that can help without making life lame again."
27036,"edit: Forgot to mention, I get panic attacks and paranoia about taking meds as well, so they need to work quick or I'll throw up."
27037,"I can't take antibiotics, vitamins, or birth control pills because my body just refuses to swallow them, and i'm able to trick myself or force down really important things, but my mind starts..."
27038,I don't know how to explain it.
27039,"I put off taking it, then decide I forgot so forgetting again won't matter, and then keep ""forgetting"" and then decide it's pointless to start up again."
27040,"I've recently gotten another job, and I can't afford to screw this up, I feel like I need medication to control it but the councillors / therapists I saw in the past didn't bring up medication at all."
27041,I don't know anyone who's seen a therapist and been prescribed medication here.
27042,I have never been on any anti-depressants or anti-anxiety meds before.
27043,But anyways I'm going on medication soon and while I'm not against medication I don't want to be taking another pill just because the doctor wants to appease me or my mom.
27044,I am on medication and I'm seeing a psychologist.
27045,It's not my fucking fault I have an anxiety disorder I try so hard but I haven't been able to get meds to help me.
27046,"And also, I just got my wisdom teeth out 2 weeks ago and I learned that general anesthesia and pain meds can spike anxiety threw the fucking ROOF."
27047,"I'm studying biomedicine, which means I spend quite a bit of time in the lab."
27048,"Idk if there's a question here, or just a rant, or wanting to not be seen as pathetic or crazy for being on anti-anxiety meds, but yeah."
27049,"Thanks to a recent post on here, I remembered how much I used to love writing and how much better I felt after a good session of just writing everything that crossed my mind."
27050,"I need to vent, today."
27051,About my anxiety.
27052,I have felt my entire life that my anxiety has an ebb and flow.
27053,"Maybe this is common, but sometimes my anxiety is non-existant."
27054,"And there are periods of my life, like the last 9 months or so, it has been consuming me."
27055,"I broke my leg and was in crutches, requiring two surgeries."
27056,"That is what started it all, in February."
27057,"This was about the same time that Ebola was starting to hit the media, and I think my anxiety-brain used Ebola as an excuse to not stress about my leg."
27058,"Now, my leg is better and Ebola has consumed my life."
27059,Borderline obsession.
27060,I was reading earlier tonight about how OCD can manifest as obsessive thoughts instead of rituals (like checking a locked door multiple times).
27061,"While part of me is glad my anxiety is not an outward, obvious to other people kind of thing, it's really tough to be so internal about it all."
27062,"I want to see a therapist, I have to look into whether my insurance covers it or if I could afford it, even."
27063,"I want to avoid getting medications because part of me feels that would be weak, that I can control it through learning coping techniques but I don't want to be too proud."
27064,"My husband and I want to start a family, and I can only imagine how much worse this will all get once I am pregnant or have a child alive in the world."
27065,I have to learn how to manage this but I'm so scared.
27066,"Yeah, I have had anxiety my whole life but this is the worst it's ever been."
27067,Will it be this way forever?
27068,Or will it ebb again (my last non-anxiety period lasted for several years!)?
27069,This unknown is terrible.
27070,I'm ready to feel like a normal person again and not have to check the internet every couple hours to see if there is a new suspected patient anywhere near me.
27071,It's just so fucking ridiculous.
27072,"Logically, I know this."
27073,"But it's starting to interfere with my life, my job."
27074,"I want to be able to enjoy my life again and go to bed with peaceful, happy thoughts instead of the moment my head hitting the pillow an awful, scary thought that won't go away."
27075,The only way I know how to cope right now is distraction.
27076,I can't sleep anymore without the TV on like a child.
27077,I try to distract my brain with other things but I read that's my brains way of ritualizing to temporarily get rid of the anxious feelings and thoughts.
27078,"I really need to figure this shit out, and find a productive way I can handle my anxiety."
27079,Shit.
27080,"It could be worse, I suppose."
27081,"We are talking medication was messed up beyond belief, I couldn’t go a day without swinging my emotions like there is no tomorrow, and don’t even get me started on how I was with people."
27082,"More through luck than judgement however, I was able to be put on another new bout of medication."
27083,"I’m starting to realise that I’m suffering from a down cycle, but because of my medication its not as bad as it use to be."
27084,She prescribed me hydroxyzine and zoloft and I am nervous to start taking these meds in fear of them changing my personality.
27085,"I've switched medication three times now in about a years time, and been to a slew of doctors and dealt with insurance woes."
27086,"So now I'm adjusted to my medication, and need to start finding work again."
27087,I've been a redditor for quite a few but never stumbled on this subreddit before and I feel like I should share my story since i think it could help somebody.
27088,"So, about me: I'm 27 and I have a story of anxiety since my early teens, maybe I was 16 or 17 when I started feeling sick every day."
27089,"I felt like I had to vomit every other second and, obviously, because I'm scared to vomit ( I know many of you know exactly what I mean because ""scared"" it's not the proper term), I couldn't do anything that I used to enjoy: I couldn't date any girl, I struggled at school etc etc."
27090,"This got to the extent that I've put myself through many medical exams (gastroscopy, ct scan and many more) because, in my mind, I HAD to have something wrong with my body."
27091,"Well, once they obviously didn't find anything wrong, I went to a psychiatrist and, guess what, I finally realized it was all in my head."
27092,I never had panic attacks but the everlasting feeling of being sick it was all due to a semi-permanent anxiety state.
27093,"I've been prescribed with lexotan but, soon enough, I became a slave to the medications instead of being a slave to the anxiety and realized this wasn't what I wanted."
27094,"I decided I had to face my issues and day by day tried to pursue a semi normal life with no medications: went to university, had a few relations with girls, etc."
27095,although with some days where I felt too sick and did nothing instead.
27096,"Long story short, now I'm a flight attendant, I live abroad with my girlfriend and to get this position I had to attend a training course for 4 week where I didn't know anybody, where I had to share the accomodation with them and had to endure pretty hard tests."
27097,"In my job I'm responsible for 50 ppl's life on each flight (we do roughly 4 per day), I see more than 700 people every day and my colleagues are never the same."
27098,Do I still get some days where my anxiety overwhelmes me ?
27099,"Yes, of course."
27100,Is it stopping me to live my life ?
27101,"Not at all, because I don't want to !"
27102,"Guys and girls, I know it's possible to fight your anxiety, because I've been trough and I'm still going through that."
27103,"If I think about how I was back in the days, i wouldn't ever bet I could endure a job like this, where I'm completely exposed and I have the eyes of 200 ppl constantly on me ( not that I'm beautiful, but the uniform it's a pretty good reason why I'm constantly looked at ;P)."
27104,"So stay strong and fight your anxiety, because you want to live a normal life and you absolutely can!!!"
27105,Hope this is going to be helpful for someone and sorry if my English lacks a bit of skill !!
27106,TLDR: went from being a slave to anxiety to being a flight attendant.
27107,I am on meds and in therapy.
27108,I told her that I wasn't really interested in taking any medication at all.
27109,My concern is she didn't really tell me anything about the medication.
27110,I don't want to start taking some long term medicine if I don't need to.
27111,I finally went it to my doctor after a year of having dp caused by anxiety to try medication.
27112,Not to mention this is a completely new doctor (she’s also a resident) and I’m afraid she’s going to think I’m making it all up just to cheat her out of some medication or something.
27113,"Tl;dr: I seem to have all the symptoms of anxiety and can’t deal with it anymore, luckily discovered a name to symptoms days before a family doctor appointment, but will she believe me or think I just want quick medication?"
27114,And although it is general and is pretty much a lingering feeling I have all day (Im on medication right now which helps)..
27115,I've ALWAYS felt better (even before meds) when I was in social settings.
27116,"I have GAD and the only way I know how to deal with it is to escape - using either prescription anxiety meds, drinking alcohol, zoning out, or sleeping."
27117,"I think I read somewhere that anxiety medication ideally is only for short-term use (maybe six months - a year or so), and should be used in conjunction with some sort of effective psychotherapy."
27118,"I'm wondering if medication would actually help in my case, or if the potential reduction in anxiety would only be short-term and unsustainable given that the therapy doesn't seem to be working."
27119,There's not much one can do except cope and take the meds.
27120,should these meds ever feel like a magic switch that makes me feel happy and healthy?
27121,"One is in charge of my personal matters, evaluations and medication while the other is in charge of my group CBT."
27122,I am also going to end up taking anti-anxiety/depressant medication.
27123,"It feels like I'm doing unpaid labour.. 

One of my psychologists mentioned prescription medicine but I have trouble swallowing even the smallest Tic-Tac™."
27124,"I'm not sure I want that because it also helps with my physical pains, and it doesn't consist of the chemicals found in 'medicine'."
27125,"The chemicals are part of why I'm semi against prescription medicine, but the marijuana can only help me so far."
27126,I'd prefer not to take medicine but if that's what it takes than I'll do it.
27127,I need to get back into therapy and find the right meds.
27128,I've been cutting back on my Xanax and I ran out and have my yearly drug screen Tues. but the medicine will by out of my system by then.
27129,The Dr. said it's to make sure you aren't selling your meds and not on other illegal drugs.
27130,I'm just guessing it would only matter if the meds were in your system if you are going back to the Dr. the soonest possible time for a refill which means you were abusing them or selling them if none was in your system but I'm cutting back and it's been four months from the last months supply was filled.
27131,"I haven't looked forward to anything in a long time, and I can't afford a therapist or meds."
27132,"I would also like to note that I am on a very strong medication for anxiety, but once I'm this worked up the attack just escalates."
27133,"Then got up in this morning, felt okay, took my levothyroxine (thyroid medication for hypothyroidism) and then half an hour later, started getting waves of panic and intense brain fog."
27134,"I just have no clue whether it is a reaction to the medication I am taking, subconscious anxiety I've had about school and family and life that has just been building up, or what."
27135,I'm a college student who has been sick for a year.
27136,I'm a little better than I was so I'm trying to get a part-time job and go to school part-time for this up and coming semester.
27137,"I was already hired for the job, but I feel like I cannot function in society."
27138,"It's not the job thing, it's several little things, some extremely menial but to me are monumental."
27139,The first is functioning in society.
27140,I live in constant fear of never amounting to anything and all of the bad things that can happen to me and my family.
27141,I am very superstitious even though I'm agnostic.
27142,I have also been on/off antibiotics for a year and I'm on them now.
27143,It's destroying my body but I'm too afraid to get off them because I don't want to get as bad as I was a month ago.
27144,I have no idea what I want to do with my life and every time I think about it I feel like I'm going to faint.
27145,"Actually, there is something I might be okay doing but I talked to my mom about it (she does a little bit of what I want to do) and she said to do it I have to believe in myself and be cutthroat, and I can do neither of those things."
27146,Just working a full-time job and knowing what your passion is and promoting yourself gives me such horrible anxiety because I don't have a passion or motivation and I am deathly afraid of getting older.
27147,"The only future I imagine for myself is what happens for most people in this economy: joblessness, homelessness, no future and no money."
27148,I also have a plethora of health problems and if I choose this career path I will not be making a lot of money to support my medical needs.
27149,It is also extremely competitive and not a steady-type of job.
27150,The second is my weight.
27151,"I have never been ""overweight"" exactly, but I have been close to being it."
27152,The highest I've been was a little over 140 pounds (I'm 5'4).
27153,I've lost some weight but only by starving myself.
27154,"I can only exercise very little because of my sickness and because of my medical conditions, the sickness, the plethora of medications I'm on and the fact that I get like 4 hours of sleep a night, my body is exhausted and is always working overtime, so I don't eat as much as I should."
27155,"I have such anxiety that I'll end up overweight and disgusting when I'm older (I don't find overweight people disgusting, just myself) and that I won't be able to control myself, because I have accidentally binged many times before."
27156,I have lost a little bit of weight but it's not enough for me.
27157,"I hate my body and want to be skinny so very badly, but it's so hard, especially the exercise thing."
27158,I wish I could run and work out for hours like everyone else but my body is that of an old person's.
27159,And my legs constantly hurt and feel heavy and I also have shin splints that haven't gone away and lower back pain.
27160,I'm so depressed and irritable all the time.
27161,The whole dieting thing has made me feel like life is not worth it.
27162,Every time I eat a little more than I should or more carbs I swear I gain some weight.
27163,The third thing is sleep.
27164,I have had a fear of sleep since I was little.
27165,"I have a computer addiction that keeps me up late, and I am constantly hurting and fighting with my body."
27166,"If I have something at 8AM the next morning, I purposefully go to bed at 2AM and it takes me 2 hours to go to sleep."
27167,"This has become a horrible, horrible habit."
27168,I take so many medications every day.
27169,I'm just so sick of being sick and my body not cooperating.
27170,The fourth thing is finding sneakers.
27171,If you look at my past post history you'll see that this gives me so much trouble.
27172,"It's so ridiculous, considering that it's probably the easiest thing in the world for 99% of people."
27173,I have a new pair of sneakers but I'm too afraid to try them for fear that they will be too small.
27174,My old therapist said this was OCD because I also return sneakers every time I buy them because of money.
27175,Money problems and society is the fifth thing.
27176,I feel hopeless about money.
27177,I feel like this economy is just so horrible and I will never make enough money to support myself.
27178,"I see homeless people on the streets and I have so much sympathy for them because most of them are probably severely mentally ill, and we live in such a horrible world where they cannot find work or do not have the money to pay for medical treatment."
27179,My future feels so bleak because of the high cost of college and living and healthcare.
27180,I feel like I should just end it now to save myself from the pressure.
27181,I have thought about going into an institution several times for the past few years.
27182,"My parents have told me that going into an institution will ruin my life, and that I'll be trapped there for months."
27183,I had a therapist but he told me I should stop seeing him.
27184,I have a prescription for an antidepressant but I'm too afraid to take it for fear it would ruin my metabolism.
27185,"I want to keep my job, but I need mental help."
27186,I don't know what to do.
27187,I know this is long and a lot but maybe somebody could give me even a little bit of advice.
27188,"Sorry if there are a lot of mistakes, I'm exhausted."
27189,"&amp;nbsp;

A year ago I started my first project about nano medicine in chemo therapy and it turned out to be really stressfull."
27190,"Hi everyone,

Hope today is a good day for you."
27191,It's not going well for me unfortunately!
27192,"I recently was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer and went through numerous rounds of PPI medications (proton pump inhibitors like prescription Pepcid, Zantac, etc)...but nothing has helped."
27193,I've had terrible generalized anxiety ever since I was a kid.
27194,"Now I've had headaches, migraines, muscle pain, IBS, the whole nine yards of physical anxiety symptoms, but lately this stomach pain is killing me!"
27195,"Sometimes I go nearly a month before I have another episode, but when I have this pain it lasts 3-4 hours of EXCRUCIATING stomach pain (upper left abdomen)."
27196,"I hate throwing up so I concentrate on not but it causes nausea, and it causes all the muscles in my torso to kind of ""lock up"" and become extremely tense."
27197,It doesn't always correlate with anxiety (sometimes it does).
27198,"Anyone else, and how do you relieve it?"
27199,"The only thing that slightly works for me is chain chewing peppermint gum and taking a bunch of stomach acid reducers, but that still doesn't relieve it until it's run it's course."
27200,I just recently been diagnosed for anxiety and my doctor prescribed me lexapro.
27201,The doctor that prescribed me the medication told me to start at 5 mg a day for one week then work my way up to 10 mg a day afterwards.
27202,"Well after starting my medications these last two days, I been experiencing headaches and slight nausea."
27203,These headaches are really annoying especially since I am lifting weights while on a strict diet.
27204,My doctor did mention to me that the first week on lexapro will lead to various side-effects that differ among individuals.
27205,"I am afraid that these side effects might last for more than one week..  Just to calm myself from freaking out, has anyone else experienced similar side-effects?"
27206,"I'm not on any meds, I know that I'm triggered, I don't WANT this to be a trigger, but it is."
27207,"I haven't been on meds for years because I've been able to manage my triggers, except for this one."
27208,I also do not have any medication.
27209,So I've been thinking about talking to my psychiatrist about medication for anxiety.
27210,Hey all!
27211,Was wondering if anyone has taken or is on Neurontin/Gabapentin?
27212,I have taken it before a long time ago and it seemed to work really well.
27213,I've been having some extreme anxiety (different from previous anxiety) and began to take the medicine again.
27214,It doesn't really seem to be working as well.
27215,"I can tell it's working a little bit (my eating habits have changed, I only feel panicky maybe twice a week as opposed to almost every day), but I just don't feel like it's working as well as it could be."
27216,"Anyway, has anyone else been on this medication?"
27217,How have you felt taking it?
27218,Any advice or different medications I should look into?
27219,Any help is gratefully appreciated!
27220,I don't belive in medication.
27221,"I didn't want to take medication, because I saw it as covering the problem and not fixing it..."
27222,PS Please do not take this post as a request to stop medication or not to seek professional help.
27223,And I have to quit my medication because my insurance is running out.
27224,"I have a mix of depression and anxiety, but the medicine I take helps a lot."
27225,Should I seek anti-anxiety meds to deal with times like this?
27226,"Please note I'm not recommending beta-blockers for everyone, I understand that different people find different meds helpful."
27227,So I always carry spare meds in my bag.
27228,It has been getting so bad that I have been thinking about finally seeing a doctor about it and maybe getting some meds.
27229,"But I've heard a lot of bad stories about meds, like getting too dependent on them, finding it hard to stop using them."
27230,"Some people even use it in place of their meds, because you can't get addicted to it or dependent on it."
27231,"If it does work, that's awesome because it's way cheaper than medication, and more natural."
27232,"I found this video a while back, and I thought it would belong in this subreddit."
27233,I've had a generalized anxiety disorder ever since I was in the seventh grade (I'm in eleventh now).
27234,I've been taking medications ever since and I've been to therapy although it didn't help.
27235,"Whenever I'm in the middle of an attack, just like I am right now, I think of one line from this poem."
27236,"""These people fight through their days like fucking gladiators, who fight demons worse than you and I could dream of just because they want so badly to live, to hold on, to love because you can't be this afraid of losing everything if you can't love everything first because you have to have a soul-crushing hope that things will get better""."
27237,I hope you all enjoy this as much as I do because I really feel a connection to it!
27238,I was prescribed medicine and that hasn't been a problem since.
27239,"I tried talking to one of my university's psychiatrists, but he did the same thing as my doctor back home and just sent me home with medicine (for depression this time) that didn't work."
27240,"I have a family member who is a psychiatrist who I talk to, but they can't prescribe meds obviously."
27241,"I still can't go to public school without feeling sick to my stomach, I've gotten through a lot of things without medication but I am still not anywhere near where some people are."
27242,"For the record, I'm a 21 year old female who's fairly healthy (besides the anxiety/panic), currently not on any medication/supplements, OTC or otherwise."
27243,"The therapist has told me that I really need to continue doing this when I go back to school (in another state), and to consider taking medication because this has been going on for so long that it may be chemical."
27244,"They also can't prescribe medication, which I might actually need."
27245,Back in 2009 I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.
27246,I drank a bottle of vodka with a full prescription of xanax.
27247,"I barely made it thru, but I did."
27248,"After a long, drawn out battle with depression I overcame it."
27249,"I was diagnosed as bipolar, but strongly believe it was the wrong diagnosis."
27250,I had clinical depression.
27251,I stopped medications in 2011.
27252,Over the last 9-12 months my anxiety has gotten worse and worse.
27253,It's to the point that it's affecting my daily life.
27254,"I feel like I'm going to lose my job (I have no reason to think these things, I know this), get kicked out of my house, get into a car accident, I constantly think that if someone is whispering that they MUST be talking about me."
27255,I make constant conversation with coworkers just to make sure they aren't mad at me for some reason.
27256,It's gotten to the point that I actually told coworkers that I don't think they like me.
27257,This isn't true.
27258,I have taken every type of SSRI out there and back in 2009-2010 nothing but benzos worked for me.
27259,I'm very scared to go to a new Dr and ask for any type of benzo as I'm scared I'll end up trying to take to many if I get upset over something.
27260,Does anyone have any advice on any of this?
27261,"He said he wanted to be in touch with that psychologist, and he would decide with them if I truly need anxiety medication, which he wants to put me on."
27262,"I don't want this medication to change who I am, so I have chosen to ignore the doctor's orders, and I haven't spoken to anyone."
27263,What does the medication make people feel like?
27264,I have no medication.
27265,I've always managed to keep it under control without medication (mostly).
27266,I am wondering if how you know when the medication is working.
27267,"I am asking this because everytime I see my doctor (that I've had since I was four) she asks me if I feel any different from the medication and I always tell her I honestly can't notice a difference in me or that I honestly can't tell, but I do seem to do more in my life (first college experience, waking up early) and when I am not on it I can't do anything."
27268,"BTW even though I am back on the medication when things get really bad in my relationship I don't refrain from harming myself, does this mean the medication is wrong?"
27269,What can you tell me about this medication?
27270,"I have a history of asthma (no problems or meds for 7-8 years) and pneumonia (very serious case when I was young, almost died and once again, less serious about 9 years ago.)"
27271,I'm going to the doctor in a few days and I'm almost certain I'm going to be prescribed anxiety medication.
27272,I take a ton of anxiety and sleep meds at night but they don't help much.
27273,"Because of this I started to go see the doctors, they decided to change the travel medication I was on, however this didn’t improve anything."
27274,"I did this and ended up having a terrible night full of anxiety, all the progress I felt I made in the past few years seemed to go away and I am in full blown distress mode for the night, the next day I call him again but he isn’t at work, I call the base hospital and they connect me with the pharmacist who finds out my medication is “extended release”, the pharmacists tells me never to cut extended release in half because I would get the full dose immediately."
27275,"However, she believed that I would likely have anxiety and depression for the rest of my life because it ran in my family and made the suggestion that I go on meds again."
27276,I don't think that I need meds that bad.
27277,I'm open to meds as a possible boost until these symptoms subside but I dont think I need to be on SSRIs where I need to stay on them indefinitely.
27278,"TL;DR
Doctor told me Seroquel is ""harmless"" compared to other meds while a bit of research says otherwise."
27279,"I have never used the medication to ""get high"" or to ""feel good"" - I have only ever used it when extremely anxious or having a panic attack."
27280,"I have no money for any physicians to help, i have no money for medicine that I once upon a time took about 3 or 4 years ago for these issues...that actually worked."
27281,I'm on Lexapro 10mg and have been for about 3-4 months now.
27282,"I noticed that the majority of cold medicines are considered a severe  interaction, so I was wondering what's a safe to take for a cold?"
27283,"It certainly had its ups and downs for me, though cannabis is, in my mind, a fantastic medicine if you can moderate."
27284,"I have insurance, and a wonderfully supportive girlfriend, and if it’s something that’s suggested, I don’t have the aversion to medication I had because of prior experiences with the anti-depressents—I just worry that my drug experimentation might persuade doctors I’m a junkie or something, and turn me away."
27285,It's currently 6:40 am here and I can't get to sleep so I thought maybe writing some of what i'm currently feeling would help.
27286,I've had anxiety and Ptsd for 10 years now and I'm still trying to piece my life together.
27287,"I struggled for years trying to find out what was wrong with me, why I would go from extreme depression to being unbearably nervous for no reason."
27288,I think that the root cause is my anxiety.
27289,It is this ever present crushing weight placed on my shoulders that I have some how learned to live with.
27290,I can grin and bear it when I need to but only in small doses.
27291,Tomorrow I have some errands I need to run and then I have to go to trivia night with my friends.
27292,"I know that once I get to sleep I can get through tomorrow and maybe even enjoy myself, but I also know that once the events of tomorrow are over I will once again notice that weight."
27293,I feel like I have gotten past the events that caused my PTSD but it still causes severe panic attacks and uncomfortable situations.
27294,I am still feeling what I think of as the aftershocks of the PTSD in my anxiety and depression.
27295,This ever present feeling of anxiety and nervousness has been so crushing for so many years that at times it gets to be too much and the depression takes over.
27296,I just want it to finally be over and in that depressed state I always feel like there's only one grim solution.
27297,"People in my life will often try and help me get through a nervous episode, or a depressive state."
27298,"They'll tell me stories of times where they have felt nervous and how they coped with it, what medicines they took or how they drink it away."
27299,"I feel like none of these people truly understand anxiety, what it's like to feel like you are about to die for no reason at all."
27300,"There's no date waiting on you, no job interview lined up, no traveling to a new place, you are just sitting there anxious out of your mind."
27301,I know some of you can relate to these feelings but I have no idea how to verbalize them to others or make sense of it.
27302,"I try and take every day one step at a time, do the laundry one day, exercise the next, pay the rent the day after but it all seems like I am walking on a treadmill to nowhere with no real end goal other than a nebulous ""be happy""."
27303,"I was told by my therapist that I will feel this weight for the rest of my life, but I can learn to live a better life."
27304,"I don't know if I believe this, maybe my life really ended 10 years ago and i'm just going through the motions."
27305,"Thanks for reading, i'm going to try and get some sleep now."
27306,These past couple of months I have had weird stomach-area discomfort.
27307,My insides just don't feel right and every tiny feeling that I get in my torso worries me to no end.
27308,"Yesterday while I was experiencing this discomfort, I suddenly began to feel hyper-aware of my body."
27309,I started feeling my pulse all over my body and I got mild nausea.
27310,I also got a strange feeling that something bad was going to happen and I started breathing harder.
27311,I was sitting down and my legs started jumping up and down as if I drank too much coffee.
27312,All of this happened involuntarily while I was on the phone with my cousin.
27313,My mind went blank and I couldn't figure out what to say to him even though it was a routine conversation.
27314,I made an effort to rationalize what was happening to me and it all stopped as soon as I did that.
27315,Only a little restlessness remained.
27316,"My questions:

What was happening to me?"
27317,My mom recently revealed to me that she suffers from anxiety and is taking medications for it.
27318,Can it be hereditary?
27319,"Also, I noticed that I was able to stop the episode through sheer reasoning."
27320,Is this always the case?
27321,"Some additional info about me:

I am a veteran and I have experienced combat."
27322,Fear is a feeling I don't feel very often.
27323,I have been on the brink of death before and was able to maintain my composure.
27324,Socially I carry myself just fine.
27325,I spoke in front of large groups during the military and I only got mild stage fright which I was easily able to manage.
27326,This is why this recent episode is concerning me.
27327,Thank you for your answers!
27328,Naturally I'm someone who is  extremely anxious about taking medication in the first place.
27329,"Hello /r/anxiety,

Genetic anxiety sufferer here."
27330,My mother and father suffer from it.
27331,Both of which are prescribed klonopin and my mother also takes effexor daily to regulate her brain chemistry.
27332,"I also take klonopin and effexor XR, the effexor I give credit to stopping about 85% of my panic attacks."
27333,The klonopin is treated as more of an emergency pill if I can't handle a particular attack.
27334,I also have a pretty decent case of ADD/ADHD.
27335,For this I am prescribed Vyvanse.
27336,I have also used Adderall.
27337,"They are only used on occasion, as I don't like the speed like effects it has on me from time to time."
27338,"Anyhew, trying to schedule an appointment with an MD and I left a message for his assistant to schedule an appointment."
27339,She said she was looking at my file and noticed I was prescribed klonopin and that the doctor usually *doesn't* write prescriptions for klonopin.
27340,This is the second time I've heard this in one form or another.
27341,The nurse practitioner I had before wanted me to decide between klonopin and adderall.
27342,"Now before anyone points out the obvious, I'm well aware one is a stimulant while the other is an obvious depressant."
27343,"I'm aware the combination can be extremely unhealthy and, if absued, deadly."
27344,I only take klonopin and adderall on a per needed basis.
27345,And I can't imagine for the life of me why anyone would ever abuse klonopin.
27346,"I've had zero desire to risk stopping my heart for a little high, when I'm in the middle of a panic attack the last thing I want to do is actually take a risk on my own life."
27347,I simply take the recommended .5 milligram dose and all is well within half an hour or so.
27348,So why is the medical community so against prescribing both of these medications so fervently?
27349,Is the average person really dumb enough to abuse them daily?
27350,"Hi All,

I have an appointment to see a psychiatrist (I think, definitely the one that prescribes meds), but it's a wait of over a month!"
27351,I've seen a psych dr and a nurse that oversees meds and this was an ok plan.
27352,It seems crazy to be on 3 meds at once and I haven't filled the script for Xanax because of this (I am worried about med overload and side-effect/interactions).
27353,"Everyday since, I have been breathing abnormally (Making this MPH sound to breath, feeling short of air, and feeling the sense to force myself to swallow and it messes me up even more) I have taken some medication, and it helped at first but hours later making me feeling terrible."
27354,"I've been with my anxiety under control for about 2 or 3 years, last year without any medication."
27355,"im on meds and they certainly help, though only for a few hours tops until the next dose."
27356,Self medication is useless.
27357,"Hi everyone,
I've been suffering from panic disorder and OCD for about 6 years now, but was never able to convince myself to try any medication because I was too nervous."
27358,"Well, long story short, everything was getting worse so I brought up medicine with my therapist and got a prescription to Zoloft and lorazepam."
27359,"I barely ever take ANY medicine, not even tylenol, because I'm just generally scared of something wrong happening and I'll die."
27360,I need to get medication but am so scared the doctor will tell me to stop worrying or try to talk to me.
27361,I just want the fucking meds and to get the fuck out of there no words needed to any one!
27362,I'm worried that if the Lexapro isn't cutting it that I might not find a non-addicting medicine to solve my problem.
27363,I have anxiety/depression that I've recently started medication for (again) but I'm worried this isn't normal behaviour at all?
27364,I think maybe I need to go on stronger medication...
27365,"Ive tried the alarm clocks that slowly get louder, I've tried a quiet alarm, I've tried having someone gently wake me as well."
27366,"I have to wake up to get my daughter on the bus and no matter what I try, I go from being asleep to gasping and jumping when being woken.. My body goes tingly and numb, my heart pounds, my stomach fills with acid and I'm miserable every morning."
27367,On the weekends if my daughter wakes first and makes noise it also happens.
27368,I'm always jumpy when awake and prefer silence.
27369,Too much noise makes me very uncomfortable and causes my anxiety to rise.
27370,I fear balloons because they pop and when they pop I fly backwards against the nearest wall.
27371,I can be doing dishes and my husband can walk by me and his sudden presence causes me to literally jump across the room and freak out.
27372,Afterwards I need to catch my breath.
27373,"Ppl used to think this was hilarious but after years of it, people sympathize."
27374,"Is anyone else so jumpy and if so, any solutions?"
27375,These sudden jolts of panic make my stomach miserable.
27376,Ive tried 3 different anxiety medicines but nothing has helped so far.
27377,I've always been this away but it's getting more sensitive as I get older.
27378,I'd wear earplugs if I didn't worry my daughter would tell for me in the night or that I wouldn't wake.
27379,"Sorry if this us jumbled, I'm on mobile and haven't posted from it before."
27380,I have to taper off the meds temporarily to make up for the loss.
27381,"i gained 10 kgs since i have been eating shittily and my constant thought is that maybe it was heart related, but it's not, but still, i think I became a hypochondriac... in the last few days i was feeling much better thanks to meds but now i had 2 small attacks since this morning and i need to hear about if this is normal, how you got out of this and anythng that can help me."
27382,I don't really have anything going on in my life that should trigger anxiety or stress and I'm not currently taking any medication.
27383,"She's been trying to get me into a psychiatrist to get some sort of meds, but that hasn't happened yet."
27384,"I made progress, got onto Anxiety meds, was working on my own self, and felt I was in a healthy relationship."
27385,"I've tried everything other than prescription medication, but I don't want to just go and ask my doctor for it because I feel like he'll think I'm just drug seeking (I look pretty bad since all the stress kicked in so I may kind of look like a junky right now)."
27386,So i've been having anxiety about trying new kinds of medicines.
27387,Once I take them and realize it's fine then it goes away and I'm ok. Well I'm getting married in march so I'm getting on some birth control within the next few weeks and I'm starting to worry.
27388,"It's the normal ""what if this happens, what if that happens"" ordeal."
27389,What I'm worrying about is treating my fiance bad because of the hormones or having some sort of bad reaction.
27390,"Also having a noticeable reaction that will effect my wedding (if my face breaks out or even loss of libido during the honeymoon)

One of the predicaments with this is that my anxiety gives me physical symptoms (most related to panic attacks) so if I get any of those I know I'm going to convince myself its the meds!"
27391,"Lastly I would like to say, (and no hate please) after talking to my doctor I've decided to try the depo shot."
27392,Which is another reason why I'm worried.
27393,Not because of what it is but because I can't just stop it if something happens.
27394,PLEASE only positive words.
27395,I really don't want to see anything else negative about the shot.
27396,It's different for everyone.
27397,If I don't like it I don't have to get it again.
27398,Thanks in advance!
27399,"anyway fast forward, i graduate, am on medication, sort myself out and have an ideal job opertunity come up for me."
27400,"ever since i was a kid i've allways been told my moods radiate off me and are infectious, even when i'm on medication to deal with manic highs and lows."
27401,after 2 days i'd had to double up my medication to stop me freaking out at the events.
27402,"i wanted to run out the room and scream, but the medication was numbing me so i was only screaming inside."
27403,"I'm taking my normal anxiety meds and my normal allergy meds as well, but things were getting difficult."
27404,I hope meds will work for me or some therapy will change me.
27405,"I'm on medication for the anxiety, and between the med and therapy, I've made huge strides."
27406,"I started treatment pretty biased against medicine and psychologists, but I gave it an honest shot."
27407,My idea of how to attack this was to get medication while therapy could help me really fix the underlying causes.
27408,"I first met with my psychologist in early August- after an initial session, he said ""well I don't think we need medicine for what seems like a mild anxiety""-- which very much felt awful."
27409,I went on to say I wanted to try medication as soon as possible.
27410,I don't take medication.
27411,Hey /r/anxiety I was diagnosed with GAD when I was 13 and I have been on several meds and been going to therapy since then.
27412,I'm uninsured and am not on any meds now.
27413,"I was prescribed 10mg of Celexa for anxiety, because I've reached a point in therapy and self-work where things are not improving much anymore, so I have decided I should try medication for a while and see what happens."
27414,"Also, is it true that after a while (some years), the celexa can ""poop out"" and start giving me withdrawal symptoms until the dose is increase or the medication switched to another ssri?"
27415,"Hello, everyone."
27416,I've been a long time lurker of various subreddits and I thought you all could possibly help me out.
27417,My entire life I've suffered from severe anxiety.
27418,"When I'm with close friends or family I'm just fine; however, anytime I'm faced with strangers I'm a nervous wreck."
27419,All throughout school I was that kid that 'never talked'.
27420,I never really thought of it being much of a problem until recently.
27421,"Now, that I'm out of school, I feel like my anxiety is really affecting my life in a negative way."
27422,"I'm completely apathetic, unmotivated, and depressed."
27423,"I'm unemployed, not going to college or anything, and my life just really isn't going anywhere."
27424,"I didn't really think my anxiety and depression had anything to do with it, but recently I've been thinking it has."
27425,"I'm always wanting to get out of my house, but every time I do, my anxiety takes quite a toll on me."
27426,When I'm face to face with people I don't know every well my mind becomes completely cluttered.
27427,This makes it very hard to communicate and pay attention to them.
27428,I feel as if I never have anything to talk about and anything I do talk about seems pointless and stupid.
27429,I recently started dating a girl I've liked for quite a long time.
27430,Every time I hang out with her I hardly speak or show any emotions.
27431,"I'll text her afterwards telling her that it's because of my anxiety and she seems to understand, but it makes me feel like a terrible boyfriend."
27432,There have been times she'll ask if she's boring me which makes me feel like absolute shit.
27433,I feel like if I continue down this road of being shy and nervous around her that it's not going to last.
27434,Previous relationships I had mainly fell apart due to this reason.
27435,"I've been considering medications for my problem, but I'm not sure if that's the route I should take."
27436,Any suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated.
27437,"I went from having about 3 or so panic attacks a week, to maybe one a month while on medication."
27438,I have had one panic attack since (still a big change from before the medication).
27439,I'm thinking maybe I wasn't ready to come off the medication.
27440,Coming off medication too early?
27441,"It makes me worry when i hear people taking ""medication"" from doctors because doctors can be corrupt and prescribe medication to gain money for a friend."
27442,Please explain to me why i should be okay with medication as an answer over just spending more time with a friend thats fun.
27443,Perhaps i'm asking for what specific medication is good?
27444,Help me understand why or why i shouldnt trust medication as an answer.
27445,I saw my doctor and she pressured me very heavily to try a new medication.
27446,I worked very hard to get off my other meds and I still hope I can get by without daily medication.
27447,She told me that taking a medication could thwart the healing process a little because it might hide some things that need to be worked with.
27448,"I hear many different things regarding how certain medications should make you feel, what they do, what they're supposed to accomplish, and what the side affects are."
27449,Would anyone taking SSRIs for anxiety/depression be willing to talk about their experiences with different medications for reference?
27450,"Also, what is the ""right"" medication supposed to do?"
27451,"Is it just supposed to make you *able* to get out of bed in the morning, or is it supposed to have a noticeable change?"
27452,over time it became a lot worse to the point where i no longer had an appetite and after trying anti anxiety meds which worked initially but stopped working i can't help but feel like my anxiety is trying to tell me something that i am not realizing consciously.
27453,I've been on 3 different types of ssris over the past 2 weeks.
27454,"They've given me bad side effects such as - but not limited to:

- heart rate going up and down
- fluctuating blood pressure (140/90 last night."
27455,First time in my life my blood pressure has been high in a rested state of mind.)
27456,"- dry mouth 
- nausea 
- diarrhea 
- mania
- increased anxiety
- confusion
- dizziness 
- tremors
- sleepiness 
- excessive yawning
- heat flashes 
- brain jolts 
- insomnia 
- irritability 
- itchiness 
- decrease in appetite 
- constipation 
- headaches 
- memory issues such as forgetfulness 
- unable to focus 
- dilated pupils (one larger than the other)

I was evaluated by a doctor last night and remained in an overnight in stay."
27457,They were concerned about my symptoms and had me undergo a medical screening.
27458,"After the tests came back saying I was fine, they continued to ignore me when I said the side effects of the medications I've been on are too debilitating."
27459,They told me to give it a few weeks to kick in.
27460,"But after doing my research and speaking to several therapists, nurses, and psychiayrists, I felt that the side effects of ssris are too much."
27461,"Even if the ssris did work on me, I felt like the long term effects are absolutely ridiculous."
27462,I'm being given powerful medication that can entirely change the way our bodies and brains function.
27463,"Due to this, I absolutely refuse to continue with the medication."
27464,From tonight I'm going to focus more on natural relief.
27465,What should I do?
27466,I want to get better but I don't want to risk the potential of being in a worse position than I am now.
27467,I'm absolutely dumfounded that they hand out antidepressants like candy.
27468,It's astonishing how quick they are to diagnose someone and fill them up with drugs such as these.
27469,It's kind of scary how careless people can be.
27470,"I feel like I can handle my mental health with natural methods such as meditating, breathing excercises, coping methods, thinking positively, etc."
27471,Has anyone decided to take a natural route to recovery?
27472,"If so, how'd you do it, and how well did it work for you?"
27473,I'm going to my doctor on Saturday and telling him i want to stop with my meds (ween-off of course).
27474,One thing im afraid of though is my anxiety and depression becoming worse after im done with the meds.
27475,In 2009 I finally decided to take steps to help after a particularly bad bout of it and started meds and seeing a therapist.
27476,"Last year, I decided to try going off my meds because although things were going so well, I was having some sexual side effects that I felt were putting a strain on my current relationship."
27477,"I make less than $1000/month, $250 of it goes to student loans, $167 to my car loan, $70 to car insurance, $30 to health insurance, I buy my own food and incidentals like shampoo, clothing, medication etc, and gas since I drive a lot is running me ~$100/month."
27478,"I am a 20 year old girl at university and I used to have at least three panic attacks a week at work around 2 years ago, going anywhere was a struggle and there was a period of about a month where I couldn't quite catch my breath and had meds for it."
27479,"Through out 2013 and half of 2014 i was half assing it with my appointments, medication and therapy."
27480,"But with the help of my friends, family, medication and doctors i have been getting progressively better since then."
27481,"I felt super trap and sure i was going to die but i took my medication, did my grounding exercises and now i feel a little stable."
27482,"That's a definite deal breaker for any meds for me, at least if it's going to be an all day kind of thing, which it was, no matter what time of day it would go soft at some point more than once."
27483,"My mother wants me to take medicine to help me, but I am resistant to the idea."
27484,Are there any other non-medicine ways to help get anxiety under control?
27485,"Or am I really just paranoid like my mom says, should I try taking meds?"
27486,Could this be a side effect of my anxiety disorder and/or medication?
27487,"Before I decide to take this medication course.., I'd like to hear your success or horror stories so I can take a weighed judgement call on if it's worth it.."
27488,"Would medication/therapy that effects Social Anxiety help ""cure"", or at least treat, stuttering?"
27489,"(Escitalopram/Lexapro, 5mg) My anxiety isn't as bad as others', but I tried briefly to taper down to 2.5 mg/day a couple days ago, which led to my first panic attack since starting my meds."
27490,"Last week, I saw my doctor and he prescribed me some medication to use sparingly."
27491,"Long story short, seen more than my fair share of waterlogged corpses, been abused etc etc all leading to a pretty monstrous anxiety problem that I can usually handle on my own without medication after a long ride with a great therapist."
27492,"I have a tiny bottle of a floral anti-stress mix that i smell from time to time, a lot less since started on meds though."
27493,I'm already going to invest money for skin treatment so I'm not sure if I can afford therapy but I would really like to go to a doctor to get prescribed some anti-anxiety medication in moments where I just can't go outside due to my acne scars.
27494,"I was wondering if asking for anti-anxiety medication to temporarily deal with my horrible acne scars is reasonable, especially from the doctor's perspective."
27495,"Still, I worry that things are going to get worse instead of better, and don't know if I should see a therapist or get medication or just try to deal with it mentally somehow."
27496,"She was not willing to try medication or seek therapy, so I was ready to love her for who she was and accept that things would just be difficult for her at times."
27497,They sent me home with some blood pressure medication.
27498,"I'm scheduled to see a psych tonight but I'm honestly worried about taking psych meds and even worse, I'm afraid than any prescription would cause a paradoxical reaction, leaving me with crippling anxiety."
27499,I know I will probably eventually need medication for this but I'd rather try all other methods before going that route.
27500,No medicine.
27501,"I was put on a smorgasbord of medication for nearly 7 years, and went through endless sessions of counselling, psych visits etc."
27502,I made the decision to wean myself off the meds last year as Lexapro (the only drug that's worked well for me) was giving me liver problems.
27503,"I can't go back on meds either, no way."
27504,"I still continued drinking (says not to on bottle) while on medication and for me, it was a disaster."
27505,"It was weird, because I didn't give a shit about anything, but the Wellbutrin made me even MORE anxious than before I started taking any meds."
27506,"The first few nights off meds, it was hard to sleep."
27507,The plus side to being on meds was that I could work through my inner turmoil more comfortably.
27508,"Stopped taking meds, learning how to cope with real life."
27509,I'm 22 years old and have been dealing with a variety of anxiety for about 5 Years.
27510,Yes I've seen doctors and prescribed all the medications but I don't like to take them because the effects are intense.
27511,I just am wondering if people ever have the same problems I do.
27512,I feel like I have ocd as well because recently I moved across the country with my husband.
27513,I had a lot of down time while I was looking for a job.
27514,"And now for several months I've been repeating a name in my head, one I really hate, and don't want to think about or remember."
27515,And when I dont have the name in my head I'm obsessed with thinking about my past.
27516,This mistake I made when I was really drunk and 18 keeps eating at me.
27517,And I tell everyone about it.
27518,I just can't seem to get it out of my head.
27519,I'm obsessed with thinking and analyzing about it.
27520,It's exhausting.
27521,I keep repeating stuff and I hate how I can totally forget about something and then 4 years later remember it like it was yesterday.
27522,"I'm hoping writing it down helps, but I always tell myself move forward and don't look back."
27523,But all I keep doing is looking back.
27524,I don't understand why this is happening.
27525,I already came clean after it happened and cleared my conscience.
27526,Maybe I'm just being a girl.
27527,I just want my anxiety to go away and to be happy again and be myself again): my medication doesn't seem to be helping.
27528,"She has social anxiety (somewhat controlled by medication), a history of depression, ocd, cutting."
27529,"I am not currently on meds, although three months ago I finished a six month course of SSRI's for GAD

My question is in regards to what I can only describe as imaginary pain, I wonder if these are intrusive thoughts?"
27530,"Also, this sounds so vain- but how many of you have experienced weight gain from medication?"
27531,My mind always seems to trick me into thinking that my anxiety isn't severe enough to qualify for medication or even therapy sometimes.
27532,"I've been having panic attacks since I was in high school, but they are mainly situational."
27533,I'm always kind of on edge about daily things which usually lead to an attack.
27534,My doctor put me on Xanax when I feel an attack coming on or during an attack to calm me down and all was fine with that.
27535,"About a year ago I started having random seizures (they've stopped now, apparently it's something people can develop in late teens/early twenties)."
27536,I went to a neurologist and he put me on Lamictol which helps with seizures and is also an antidepressant.
27537,"I just feel kind of spacey and emotionally detached since I started that, but he told me to wait a bit for my body to adjust to it."
27538,"It hasn't yet, but I'm going to talk to him on my next visit."
27539,Now I am going to another doctor that is closer to where I live (he knows about all of my other medications and such).
27540,"He's been giving me my regular Xanax prescription and again everything is fine, apart from the emotional detachment from the Lamictol."
27541,"After a few sessions of seeing him he put me on Buspar, saying it will make me generally more calm and such but it won't make me feel sleepy and high with Xanax."
27542,"Ever since I've started taking Buspar, I've just been extremely tired all of the time."
27543,"I can't tell yet if it's helping my overall anxiety, maybe because of my Lamictol."
27544,I also have been having weird dreams.
27545,Like Inception type dreams.
27546,VERY realistic and vivid.
27547,"I'll fall asleep and dream that my friend is coming over to borrow a book or something, she leaves just like any normal day."
27548,"Then I wake up not too long after wondering where I am and if that actually happened, so I have to get up and see if it did or not."
27549,"I guess not knowing where I am isn't the best description, but when I was little I would end up on the other end of my bed and be very confused until I actually realized where I was."
27550,Has anyone else had any of these medications together and had dreams like these?
27551,I'm already piled in medical bills and I don't have insurance so I can't afford to go to the doctor as frequently as I'd like to.
27552,"I don't see anyone or take any meds, and I just moved to a new area so I don't know how to find doctors here."
27553,I've tried therapists and meds before but they never seemed to have an effect so I'm skeptical of even trying.
27554,I really wish I had anxiety meds to take before I went so I could be calm.
27555,"Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2gbnnz/when_should_i_consider_medication/
I didn't get many replies, but I figured the post trail would be relevant to this posting."
27556,"I spoke with my psychologist last week, and she agreed with me that I probably require some kind of medication for my issues."
27557,I can just try a different medication.
27558,"Here's the back story:

I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD and Chronic depression and have been taking medicine to help."
27559,"I got put on new medication on Monday, Concerta, Ativan and Celexa."
27560,"I'm not on any sort of meds at the moment, nor do I think that's something I'd consider at this point, so I pretty much just have to grin and bear it when I feel one coming."
27561,I'm going to the doctor today to get off these meds because they're making me so much worse.
27562,And I'm thinking maybe I need to readjust my medication again.
27563,"I didn't want to take any medication, I thought getting things off my chest would make it better."
27564,I don't want to be stuck without pain meds but I can't suffer through hours of panic either...
27565,"and my ""stats"" would be
:
age 16,male,no medication,'merica and my families insurance is busy on many other things, I don't know if we could really afford it."
27566,"If anyone is wondering, the only medication I am on is xanax, and I take it only as needed."
27567,"I've noticed I reverted to the way I was back before I was on medicine, and I was wondering if anybody has ever had this happen."
27568,"I feel like the medicine has just stopped working and maybe it's because I'm on a low dosage (10mg), maybe I need a higher dosage?"
27569,I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety and I don't have any medication.
27570,"I have no prior history of mental illnesses, I don't use any medication, nor I smoke weed."
27571,"I know why I'm susceptible to these mental illnesses and  I've half-assed tried meds, therapy, everything  

Despite having anxiety I've always managed to be strong enough to put on a face and hold down good jobs, lots of friends, been sociable and outgoing."
27572,I went to my GP yesterday and she prescribed me a new medication (citalapram?can anyone shed any light?)
27573,Maybe some help.
27574,"Gathered from what I sent to my friends yesterday: 

I was pretty split between ""none of your business,"" ""are you fucking kidding me?!"""
27575,"and ""I'm going to cry,"" when I was talking to my psychiatrist today."
27576,"Basically, details on what he did to me: 

1. told me it was fantastic I had somehow lost 20 pounds since my last session."
27577,I haven't.
27578,I've lost 20 pounds over 6 months.
27579,"He went on about this last session too, and hit all of the same points."
27580,"About how my body is carrying less stress, and so on."
27581,"We have 15 minutes dude, keep it moving."
27582,2.
27583,"He asked me how life was going for me and I told him that I was graduating, working regularly."
27584,I opened with the positive stuff.
27585,Explained I had a neuropsych referral I was waiting for a call on because of increasing frontal lobe neurology symptoms probably related to my car accident.
27586,"He

3. asked about my meds and said ""you're only on these two, right?"""
27587,gesturing at his chart.
27588,I almost wanted to freaking laugh at him.
27589,I'd given his nurses my medication list several times now.
27590,My chart should have had my medication list on it.
27591,I shook my head and started to list my prescriptions.
27592,"Which, yes, I know are a lot, but three are non-daily, they have minimal interactions (they increase my risk of seizures, but negligibly, my doctors told me, when I asked) and the side effects are really minimal as well."
27593,It's been a good mix.
27594,"But he was trying to toot a medicine limited lifestyle, and I'm just sitting there thinking ""let me just hand you my diagnosis list, and you try and figure out how to get by on less medications than I have."""
27595,"I knew he didn't have the bigger picture, but I was also thinking he was overstepping his bounds."
27596,He wasn't my GP or my therapist.
27597,And we were only supposed to be in there for 15 minutes.
27598,4.
27599,Now we're finally talking about my anxiety which has been untreated for over a year at this point.
27600,"First I had to get into the office, then they wanted to treat my depression first, then he dismissed my concerns, and so on."
27601,We get to my meds.
27602,I'm on Klonopin.
27603,"I had two weeks of basically straight nightmares on it, and it may have revealed I have (definitely mild) OCD."
27604,"Well, he dismissed it right off-hand."
27605,"Even said ""so-called"" when talking about it, which, I'm also a regular over in raised by narcissists, so I had an instant image of punching him for that."
27606,5.
27607,And now for the funnest part.
27608,I was explaining Klonopin wasn't really doing anything for me.
27609,"I pointed towards my calendar showing I'd had several panic attacks since I started Klonopin, explaining I still had a lot of ambient anxiety, and their records should show I had called several times about this."
27610,And his response was to try and take me off the Klonopin.
27611,I'm not entirely sure to describe what emotional reaction I had in the office.
27612,"My first thought was ""are you fucking kidding me?!"""
27613,"I had be paring down my Klonopin dose since the nightmare parade expecting I'd get taken off of it, something it sounded like I had approval for, but I'm getting the feeling he listens to nobody at that office."
27614,"I put my head in my hands and very quietly said: ""I have been dealing with pretty bad anxiety for years."
27615,It's been totally ignored by you.
27616,I can show you I've been having panic attacks even with the anxiety.
27617,And you're saying you want to do... nothing.
27618,"Again."""
27619,We got to a compromise of upping the medication to the max dosage out there according to my research (2mg.)
27620,(I figure if I get another nightmare parade I can complain and get switched to another benzo.
27621,"I know they're also an addictions clinic, but I have no addictions history--I like to joke I have an anti addictions history for the drugs I've been on and just walked away from--so I'd really just like to NOT HAVE PANIC ATTACKS."
27622,That's my priority.
27623,I'm really not that worried about getting addicted.
27624,Not dismissing the idea.
27625,But I'm not too worried about it.)
27626,And he's the only option my insurance will give me.
27627,"(They want me to go get mental health in this specific building, and he's the only psychiatrist in that building."
27628,"I might be able to call them and get a workaround if I'm desperate, but I'm going to talk to the people in that building first and see if they know what my options are."
27629,I can't be the only one who nearly had a meltdown in his office about his treatment.)
27630,"I know how to work around him within the building, but I still have to see him every three months to be able to work around him."
27631,"(I can talk to his nurse, who will talk to him, but she's said she doesn't like making some changes before, and would rather I talk to him."
27632,But he pulls shit like this!)
27633,Background: have been taking 40mg of Paroxitine (Paxil) for about 8 year and also had 0.5mg of alprazolam (Xanax) in the medicine cabinet if I ever needed it.
27634,Let me preface this by saying that the medication is not mine.
27635,"They've offered to let me use some of their medication to ease my nerves before interviews, though I have not tried it before."
27636,I've had anxiety since August 2010 and have been reading and using various non-medication methods.
27637,But that medicine threw me into a panic attack immediately with no anxiety build up.
27638,I did not take any more of that medicine because 1. my reaction and 2. my doctor told me to stop.
27639,"Now that the medicine has fully cleared my system, I wanted to go to Office Depot this morning, my first time driving in a week."
27640,I don't want to rely on medication.
27641,Particularly if you are having trouble finding real medical help and medication.
27642,Different type of medicine?
27643,2.Anyone have any good results from just having therapy sessions and not going the medicine route?
27644,"(I hate taking meds)

If anyone has any question that they want to ask me feel free."
27645,but anyways it started with withdrawing from my meds (xanax) when that happened i had to deal with everything on my own panic attacks and such.
27646,After i had withdrawn from my medicine it felt like i had just dont something i thought id never do in my life and that really opened me to alot more things to do that i thought id never do.
27647,Antidepressants don't work on me and anti-anxiety meds make me more relaxed but don't help with the motivation part.
27648,"I also see my psychiatrist about every 8 weeks or so for checkups on meds, which I'm taking Lexapro right now."
27649,"Now, I've had SAD, and Hypochondriasis, but I've been fortunate enough to have a supportive family and a skilled therapist, and a case of anxiety where simply changing my thought process helped immensely."
27650,"I've never been on medications, nor have I ever considered them, due to my successes in dealing with these problems."
27651,"I don't know how to fight this, though."
27652,"My title is really referencing Schizophrenia; not only is the idea of being completely out of touch and afraid due to a corruption in data absolutely mortifying, seeing as to how I love interacting with the outer-world and not being afraid, but the fact I'm a teenage male only makes me far more afraid."
27653,"It'll be little things that get my attention, which retrospectively are just like a hypochondriac's signs."
27654,"Little twinges, and feelings, and *thoughts*, in this case, which just don't make *sense*."
27655,I'm sure you guys understand.
27656,"I'll just be listening to music, and I'll swear I hear a voice, so I have to rewind, only to realize that is was a part of the track."
27657,"I was running the other day, and I thought I heard some voice in the distance yelling at me, despite being nobody to account for it."
27658,"I walk back to my dad, who then complains how some people were yelling in the distance, and rambles about how they're being disruptive."
27659,"I felt both relieved, and somewhat stupid."
27660,"It's especially bad at night, to the point where it sometimes interferes with my sleep."
27661,I feel dread at the prospect of just taking on my environment.
27662,"I feel like I'm losing the ability to just be aware, and I'm getting too self-absorbed, simply so I don't have to face the quietness where the intrusive thoughts will come in, and set up shop."
27663,"Even now, I wondered if something's wrong with me having to write this."
27664,"I know there probably isn't, and I'm just being hyper-vigilant and extremely silly, but it's still there."
27665,"I'm getting better, most of the time I can just bat it away, realize its anxiety, and move on with my day, but it's the times I get caught off-guard, and are completely unable to offer any sort of relief to myself."
27666,"**So, if you're uninterested in me describing my sitch, and just want to help, start here."
27667,"** I was wondering if anyone had any advice on what to do with fears of insanity, particularly schizophrenia."
27668,"I've heard it can be related to OCD, which honestly wouldn't surprise me, as I do seem to have an obsession with my thoughts, not so much why I have them, but if they're *normal*, so to speak."
27669,Any advice would be really helpful.
27670,"I've been seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist for seven years, but with no specific type of therapy and not a whole lot of improvement, other than medication."
27671,"Greetings all,

I've been dealing with depression, general anxiety and social anxiety for most of my teens and the beginning of my adult life."
27672,"Lately, when going out with friends I feel immense pressure."
27673,"They all have no issues talking to other people, and seeming comfortable in these situations."
27674,Especially when it comes to women.
27675,"I have this haunting feeling that I could be a much better version of myself, but it's as if there is something holding me back and I can't figure out what."
27676,"The only times I feel comfortable around other people is when I'm drunk or under the influence of an upper, such as ADD medications."
27677,"I don't know if this is anxiety or depression, as it's unlike anything I've personally experience before."
27678,Anyone have any ideas?
27679,I am scared of medication and scared of this process.
27680,I've just been waiting for an appointment to clear with a new psychiatrist so I could get some emergency medication.
27681,I was lurking this sub for a while and now I feel the need to let my thoughts out.
27682,Big thanks for everyone who actually reads it all.
27683,"Main infos: 25 y/o, male, born and living in a capital city of Central Europe."
27684,"As far back as I can remember I was always introvert and a loner, even in preschool I knew that I was more sensitive than the others."
27685,"I remember those feelings, when I realized that I've done something in a wrong way, (even if it was only a coloring book that I messed up) I felt really strong shame and I was already in tears."
27686,Then came school and high school and though I remained introvert and shy I made some friends and everything was easier.
27687,"But those deep feelings were always with me in every work, in every new task."
27688,I learned to control and repress them.
27689,"After high-school I went to 5 different universities/colleges, because after 5-6 months in a school I always felt bored and uncapable of going to the same course for 3-4 years."
27690,But I have to admit that the main reason was the people.
27691,I have a serious problem with communication.
27692,"Everytime when I'm talking with someone, who isn't in my inner circle, I always feel as I'm just faking the conversation."
27693,"I don't want to sound rude, but my experience is that the avarage human being is stupid and selfish, but he/she makes every effort to hide these facts and this hypocritical thinking is what I can't stand, I almost immediately see through their lies and this makes me stressed and more closed."
27694,"After years of trying to find my path I was partying for almost half a year, drinking almost every night until I met with a girl."
27695,She meant so much for me..
27696,"I felt that for her I can live an ordinary life I can bare living the weekdays, so I accepted one of my family members offer and I started my ordinary desk-job living my personal horror with the non-ending chit-chat and with the vulgar jokes (which is what I hated the most) of my stupid coworkers."
27697,"We broke up with the girl after 6 months, of course, because she didn't fall in love with the ""office worker me"", but the careless boy who was always in the best parties."
27698,I was caught in my own trap..
27699,"I couldn't leave the job because I didn't mean to dissappoint my family and I was living with my mother, who barely could pay the bills, so we needed the extra."
27700,"So I lived the horror for another year and everytime they asked me how do I feel, I always answered that everything is fine, but I didn't know how to end the situation."
27701,"Every day was a hell, I started to hurt myself and focusing on the pain just to keep myself on a functioning level."
27702,"All I needed to do is talk to my manager, that I don't want to work there anymore, but my manager was my uncle and I knew that if I fail in the job that would be an embarrassment even to him."
27703,On the summer I went to holiday for a week with my father (who lives separately since I was a baby) and with my two little halfbrothers and when I had to go back to work I just didn't.
27704,Something went off in my mind and I went to a nearby hill and just sit there for hours.
27705,I spend the next day shouting and crying in my bed.
27706,I guess I had a little nervous breakdown.
27707,"The third day my family took me to the psychiatry, that was a frightening experience, but fortunately they let me home with the diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and with some medications."
27708,After 7 months now I am more closed than ever.
27709,"I tried to learn code, play guitar, nothing interests me in longer term."
27710,Every time I want to start something new those repressed feelings come to me and everything just feels wrong.
27711,Just the thought of applying to a new job fills me with anxiety.
27712,"I only ""live"" online with the exception of meeting with my two close friends once a week, but that's usually just a few hours drinking and talking in a pub."
27713,"Tomorrow I have an appointment with a dentist for root canal treatment and it sounds ridiculous, but I don't care about the pain, I'm only scared about the conversations and awkward situations."
27714,"That's the most frustrating about my condition, that I can ""see through"" the avarage people, sometimes even I can predict their movements, their thoughts, but I'm still terrified of them."
27715,I just don't know how to function properly and use these skills in real life without being a villain.
27716,"Today I decided that I will get fit for this summer and made some ""before-photos"" of myself."
27717,"Maybe that's the way out from this situation, I really hope that these photos will be enough motivation for me."
27718,"Usually I just exercise for one or two days really hard then I gave up, like I do with everything else.. but not now!"
27719,"Thank you for reading, I just had to let it all out anonymously."
27720,**tl;dr:** diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and seeking for something to do in my life without forcing myself to living the ordinary weekdays
27721,My docs think its anxiety and told me to see pyschirariy but I am seeing a therapist and I will never get on meds again.
27722,"By ""quick fix"" I mean some sort of medication."
27723,"Alcohol is the closest thing to medication that I have, but it's a slippery slope and I think it's becoming a problem."
27724,"What's the strongest, most potent medication there is?"
27725,Over a month ago I was coming off because I didn't like being on medication.
27726,I keep telling myself that if I go to the emergency room I can be given a sedative or something to calm me down which is ironic considering I don't want to take my medication.
27727,"I was on medication for it (Tegretol and Prozac), but I got pregnant, so I stopped taking them."
27728,I was on fluoxetine and amitriptyline for four years but went off meds almost two years ago.
27729,My doctor just re-prescribed those meds again and Xanax when needed.
27730,"I have a psych appointment in January, that I'm hoping will allow for some medication or something, but this is a pretty immediate problem."
27731,"I know everyone is different but in your opinion, what anxiety medicine has worked for you that hasn't made you tired or sleepy?"
27732,I was at a restaurant and had my two meds in my pocket.
27733,"Long story short, I've been on one type of psychotropic med or another for 2 years."
27734,I was struggling with anxiety for a couple years prior to starting medication and reached a point where I felt desperate to try anything that might relieve me of the daily discomfort.
27735,"I started on SSRIs, tried a couple different ones, and hated them because of how numb they made me feel (particularly in killing my libido)."
27736,I was probably on them for a total of 1 year.
27737,"My psychiatrist then put me on Buspar, which I've been on for about 7 months."
27738,"The bulk of these 7 months was during a particularly rough patch in my life, and they definitely worked to reduce my generalized anxiety."
27739,"Then 3.5 months ago, my psychiatrist decided that I sounded particularly depressed, so I was prescribed Wellbutrin."
27740,"At first it made me feel awful, but I eventually got used to it."
27741,"It was during a particularly bleak time, and in the middle of winter so literally and figuratively bleak."
27742,"Anyway, I feel as though I'm emerging from this rough patch."
27743,"In retrospect, my depression was very conditional, a result of a combination of negative events going on in my life."
27744,"My anxiety is very controlled, I feel as though I've gained a perspective on it that has helped me deal with the moments of panic that I still have on occasion."
27745,"Now that I feel better and feel as though I have this perspective, I very much want to stop taking medication altogether (of course, tapering with the help of my doctor)."
27746,"I don't like the idea of being on psychotropic medication for longer than necessary for a number of reasons including the following:

1. the lack of studies done on the long-term effects of antidepressants/anxiolitics."
27747,"Yes, they're safe enough on the short-term, but most of these medications haven't been around long enough for there to be substantial testing done on long-term health effects."
27748,And that is very scary to me.
27749,2.
27750,I want to know who I am without depending on any medication.
27751,I'm in a very different place in my life than I was 2 years ago.
27752,"I feel much more in touch with my emotions, as a result of 2 additional years of weekly appointments with my therapist."
27753,I feel as though I can recognize and deal with my anxiety and deal with it better than I could even earlier this year.
27754,"The depression, as I said, felt circumstantial, I don't think it's a result of some sort of permanent chemical imbalance, since I had never had the tendency toward depression in the past."
27755,"However, I am aware that anxiety and depression are commonly co-morbid."
27756,3.I want to learn alternative coping mechanisms for my anxiety.
27757,"I've been starting to practice meditation regularly, as well as cardio exercise."
27758,"I want to start eating healthier, being more mindful, just living healthier in general."
27759,"These all feel like doable goals, whereas 2 years ago it felt as though there was nothing I could do to feel better."
27760,My question is- am I jumping the gun wanting to get off of meds ASAP?
27761,"I know redditors aren't doctors, but it would be nice to hear about personal experience getting off meds, getting of these meds in particular, and/or from people who feel similarly."
27762,Thank you for taking the time to read this long post.
27763,"Ive done CBT , therapy, medication but the negative thought processes are so hard to overcome."
27764,I have a call in to my psychiatrist right now to see if he has any ideas for coping or maybe some meds to get me through this episode until this Effexor kicks in.
27765,Here's a question I've wondered.
27766,"Many years ago I worked for a large phama firm, making Asthma medications, after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars working on on how their patient tracking system worked."
27767,"I sat with one of the project planners, and we mapped it out."
27768,"And it dawned on me that in the years of development, from onset to mild symptoms, to full blown regular critical care cases, with near permanent severe disability."
27769,"There was - one option missing - nobody ""could"" get better."
27770,They had no program track or route by which patients did anything other than escalate in symptoms or maintain.
27771,This seems to be the monkey trap of modern pharmacology.
27772,"So my question for those in /r/Anxiety is - does anyone have any success stories, where they were let's say taking Paxil or Concerta or some other med or meds, and manage to get **off** the meds, and do well, without them."
27773,How hard was it to do?
27774,What coping mechanisms do you use?
27775,How did you get back to being 'well'?
27776,"it wasn't so bad at first, a few mini attacks here and there, nothing worth medication, or anything sleep couldn't fix."
27777,I was taking lamictal for a month or so but stopped taking it because I didn't feel comfortable with taking medication.
27778,"Obviously the meds I'm not are not helping with my physical tremors to the point that I can be weaned off of them, which was the hope."
27779,"Does anybody else fear that behind the self medication, there might be depression or anxiety that doesn't have a real reason?"
27780,I went to my doctor for a change in my depression medicine because it stopped working and explained to her what was going on with my sleep patterns.
27781,The only difference I feel with this medicine is that my anxiety is finally gone and I feel free.
27782,I'm just wondering what people generally experience on anti anxiety meds.
27783,"After so many years of going to therapist, medications, reading so much about anxiety - I haven't come across any solution to Anxiety !"
27784,I feel so frustrated.
27785,I'm not on any medication so I still have my moments which is normal.
27786,"I've been given the opportunity to take meds by MDs, but always refused them, because I've always though I could solve the problem myself..."
27787,"* 4 -Go to the gym when it is busy and complete all exercises in my routine
* 5 - Pee in a urinal when there are people already at it (sober)
* 6- Sign up for any kind of social hobby and stick with it for at least 1 month
* 7- Get involved while sober in a conversation with 2 or more people who i'm not that familiar with
* 8- Go into a bar or any social situation involving alcohol while completely sober and stay there for at least 2 hours without drinking
* 9 - Compliment a stranger
* 10- Speak in front of 5 or more people in any kind of social situation or work meeting

I firmly believe that exposure therapy is the only way to beat social anxiety without taking medication."
27788,"My first post would probably go along the lines of:

Had a panic attack because I couldn't find my anxiety medication #anxietyprobs

or this (this one isn't mine but I thought it could apply):

I have anxiety issues so I am trying to seek out a therapist."
27789,"It's been roughly 5 years now - and while I was VERY anxious about any sort of medication after hearing many horror stories, I was assured by all doctors that lorazepam was non-addictive and essentially harmless."
27790,"Naturally, that worries me - and now I'm having a good bit of anxiety over my anxiety medicine."
27791,"My sister has a BIG problem with it, and has seen a doctor and prescribed meds."
27792,"If my test came back fine I was going to get in touch with a psychiatrist to see what, if any, medication might work for me."
27793,My therapy sessions don't seem to be a huge help at the moment and I'm debating starting medication if it turns out I don't have a testosterone deficiency (which likely would be addressed through testosterone patches).
27794,I am seeing a psychologist since Fall 2014 and I’ve been on medication since Spring 2015.
27795,"I don't think medication would be suited to me, as I only suffer from it sporadically."
27796,"I went to the doctors and got some anti anxiety/anti depression medication which I have now been on for a couple of months and it appears to be working to an extent, but I am still struggling- actually quite badly at times."
27797,"From your experiences with medication, did you find it helpful?"
27798,I've spent years in agony and I have now had a 2 week taste of normal.
27799,I loved every second of it.
27800,"Right now, I want to go back to the agony I thought was normal so I wouldn't know the difference."
27801,I went to the doctor with a simple enough idea of my problem - general anxiety.
27802,"I get stressed, panicked, can't sleep...the usual."
27803,"My first day there, explaining my situation, he mentioned bipolar and manic episodes."
27804,I brushed it off and kind of kept it to the back of my mind.
27805,"""Have you taken time off work at all?"""
27806,"""No."
27807,"I thought this was normal."""
27808,I try a couple medications...
27809,"Upon doing what any anxious person would do, I asked several people close to me if I ever seemed manic."
27810,"The overall response was, ""Uh yeah, duh."""
27811,"OK, this is fine."
27812,I go back and see the doctor.
27813,"Start and stop some more medications and, upon telling him about my dreams and sleep habits (ie: I have not had a good night sleep in the last 10 years), he mentions ADHD."
27814,"Ok, also push that to the back of the mind."
27815,No way.
27816,So I start school again and my whole life seems to collapse...back to the doctor.
27817,"I cannot do this, I am stressed about this and that, everything is a mess, obsessive thoughts and on top of all these things I haven't even touched my schoolwork wtf?"
27818,School is the reason I'm here in the first place - I CANNOT  handle school without some help.
27819,"He, after ages of him avoiding it (I did not ask, I just don't think he wanted to put me on it all willy nilly), puts me on a medication to keep me focussed."
27820,This goes well...and I continue with some therapy sessions.
27821,"Upon starting cognitive behavioral therapy, though excited to fix myself, I soon realize that this isn't going to work for me."
27822,"My thoughts are so contradictory of themselves...""Can you use that to counteract this and that thought?"""
27823,"No, because they are so sporadic."
27824,They come and go for no real reasons.
27825,"I am so sporadic...If someone asks me a question about something I think is stupid, they are an idiot and I do not hide the fact that I think they're an idiot."
27826,"If I see them 10 minutes later, no ""dumb"" question in toe, I am happy smiley sweet and kind."
27827,I feel bad for these people.
27828,"How does anyone know how to act around me when my mood, voice, mannerisms and opinions change depending on the tiniest things people say or do?"
27829,Or just who they are in general.
27830,"I love you, I hate you."
27831,There is no in between and these things can change day to day depending on...entirely little things that no one else notices.
27832,This goes for how I see myself as well.
27833,All else seems pretty good following the push to help me focus.
27834,"I am sleeping well, my anxiety is thoroughly reduced and and I'm doing well in school."
27835,Everything feels perfect.
27836,This lasted for 2 weeks...
27837,I had an excellent weekend.
27838,"Everything was fun, no badd thoughts or things happened and then BAM, I wake up on Monday PISSED OFF."
27839,I was doing well quitting smoking and BAM 4 cigarettes before I leave the house.
27840,Everyone is an idiot.
27841,I'm an asshole to everyone around me.
27842,I can't sleep.
27843,I can't get out of bed or get anything done.
27844,"I'm the stupidest person I know until...BAM, I'm manic."
27845,"I clean the house top to bottom - laundry, dishes, scrub the floor and bathroom then make 5 different foods - all in one hour."
27846,"Now I'm more beautiful, smart and driven than anyone else in the world."
27847,"OK, I better see the doctor again."
27848,So I go back.
27849,Increase the anti anxiety medication and mood stabilizer.
27850,"""I can't focus"" No change in that medication but come back in a month."
27851,I ditched therapy - she's stumped...referred me somewhere private - too expensive...doctor put me in for a rush referral to somewhere else and they called me for an opening interview.
27852,Experience does not come cheap while finding a psychiatrist.
27853,It's been a month since I last went to my doctor.
27854,I'm going in tomorrow and I'm so frustrated...I feel like we're finally on the right track - proper medications but maybe need some dosage adjustments here and there.
27855,Why is this taking so long?
27856,"My mood has been OK, not too many highs and lows but still a few, even day to day."
27857,"I'm very very anxious in the last few days and still haven't slept at all since my ""episode""."
27858,I cannot even focus on an hour long class.
27859,I went in with anxiety and came out with this.
27860,I have spent months and months trying to figure out what the problem is and it just feels so complex.
27861,"After years, I am finally aware that there are problems but I often wish I was still so oblivious."
27862,It's easier to not know what normalcy is at all.
27863,PS: I am so lucky and grateful to have such an amazing and supportive family doctor.
27864,"He sees things before I do...every, single, time."
27865,"He is trying to help me and I can't thank him enough for all his knowledge, compassion and hard work."
27866,"Im not on any medication, have no health issues, etc."
27867,"I've never taken meds before and while I don't like the idea of having to take a pill, I would like to give medication a try."
27868,"I’m worried, in the present about the homework I will finish."
27869,"I am worried, in the present about the job I don’t have."
27870,"I am worried, in the present about the fact that I cannot meditate because I worry too much."
27871,"I worry, in the present about not having enough money to do everything I want."
27872,"I am worried, in the present about creating fake facades to carry out all the time."
27873,"I am worried, in the present that college right away, wasn’t for me."
27874,I am worried that I didn’t do college right.
27875,"I am worried, in the present about pissing people off."
27876,"I am worried, in the present about not being able conquer my fears and worries."
27877,"I am worried, in the present about not pleasing my mom and dad to the fullest."
27878,"I am worried, in the present that I don’t understand other people’s emotions."
27879,"I am worried, in the present that I worry too much."
27880,"I am worried, in the present that I’ve let people down."
27881,"I am worried, in the present for myself because of all this worrying."
27882,"I am worried, in the present about not becoming the great person I want to be."
27883,"I am worried, in the present, that if I don’t worry anymore, what will happen to me?"
27884,"I am worried, in the present about the medications effect on me because I stopped it so quickly."
27885,"I am worried, in the present about hating my first job and being miserable my entire life because I will never be a good working on a team."
27886,"I am worried, in the present about my health."
27887,"I am worried, in the present about never being able to view women like I used to."
27888,"I am worried, in the present that I objectify sex and use it to make me feel better, when it really doesn’t."
27889,"I am worried, in the present about what others think of me."
27890,"I am worried, in the present about my grades, even though I really don’t care."
27891,"I am worried, in the present that I won’t ever be able to live comfortably."

27923,It is by far the most effective daily anti-anxiety medication I've ever been on and there's been no lead up time for it to start working.
27924,I'm just someone who found a medication that's been helpful as compared to all the other crap I've tried out there.
27925,She is on medication (not sure of names) for the ADD and depression and I'm looking for ideas on how to help her with her anxiety.
27926,But do I really need medication?
27927,"I HAVE DECIDED, that the heroin is no longer an option for medication so I'm getting hit even harder, paying my emotional debts to the days I just got to checkout of reality."
27928,Isn't medication a fucking scam?
27929,When i was in 6th grade i attempted suicide which led to about a year of therapy and medication.
27930,"I went to my doctor and got prescribed to a couple different meds (Paxil, Lexapro, Buspar, etc)."
27931,I'm a small girl and I don't take any kinds of medicine very often because it affects me so strongly.
27932,"She pointed out that I am a small girl who doesn't handle medicine well, why would caffeine would be any different?"
27933,Did you get put straight on meds or referred to counselling?
27934,"By the way he gave me some medication about it, some Lyrica 150MG, I think it might help a bit, but not at the anxiety I have around people, more on the anxiety about me fucking my university up and ending on the street living by whatever could get me going, or well at that point properly just suicide, who knows."
27935,I weened myself off of paxil and was looking forward to being medication free for a long time..
27936,"I'm depressed and I hate it, but the last thing I wanted was to go back onto medicine."
27937,Now I'm terrified that it won't and I'm afraid if it does what will happen when I have to change meds again.
27938,"Sorry for the long rant, but I needed to vent about my new medication."
27939,"I managed to start controlling it through therapy and some slight meds, but about a month ago I smoked again and almost had another panic attack, but was only just able to suppress it."
27940,"Hey, so I'm almost positive I have social anxiety disorder and I'm planning on seeing someone about it soon but I just have a question about anxiety medication."
27941,"I mean as of right now, the only thing I have going for me in life is that I'm pretty smart and I guess I'm just worried that taking medication might in some way mess with that or something."
27942,"So if someone who has taken medication for anxiety can sort of tell me what it's like or something, that would be great."
27943,So 7 months ago I booked a trip to Bangkok and Phuket with 8 other friends.
27944,The trip was for two weeks although I am now at the 1 week point and have brought my flight forward so that I leave today.
27945,I told them it was a family emergency.
27946,For many years social anxiety has often chosen to show its ugly head at the worst of times however I have never quite known just how bad it could be until this holiday.
27947,The last two days have been hell for me.
27948,"The main symptom for me is being unable to eat, which tends to be a pretty big problem after a day or so."
27949,Once it started I was hopeful that it would go away and I would be fine.
27950,Unfortunately this was not the case.
27951,Being so far from home made it much worse.
27952,Knowing I was ten thousand kilometres from the comfort of home while freaking out about the thought of having to sit down with my good friends so we can simply have a meal.
27953,They have no idea of the mental anguish I am enduring.
27954,"Having my mind racing a million miles an hour, paranoid about where to look, what to say and do."
27955,So I am about to jump in a taxi and head for phuket international airport for a 22 hour journey back to New Zealand.
27956,I will be exploring all possible methods to help control this problem.
27957,I have tried various anxiety medications and they always seem to either make me feel like a zombie or make me put on a large amount of weight.
27958,I am so damn tired of it having this grasp on me.
27959,"I'm on Strattera, which is a Norepenephrine Reuptake Inhibitor, so it's related to various Anti Depressant and Anti Anxiety medication."
27960,"So I got on meds, went to a therapist and started school and everything was good."
27961,"You go to school in the fall and the winter, and for me that signifies the time of the year that I got on meds and felt for the first time in a long time that everything was actually going to be *okay."
27962,"They never last long either, normally a few minutes of screamingly and hyperventilating before it calms enough that I can take medication."
27963,I am generally anxious and definitely suffer from severe social anxiety but I am not diagnosed or on any medication and doubt I can afford treatment or even the transportation to get there at the moment.
27964,I finally found one doctor who listened and agreed with me that low dose medication could help along with CBT.
27965,After a few months the doctor resigned and my medication ran out while I was still searching for a doctor that would hear me out.
27966,"Started on meds (citalopram), worked off them after 9 months."
27967,Hello everybody.
27968,I am 19 and have suffered from social anxiety and minor depression for years now.
27969,My anxiety manifests itself more-so physically than mentally.
27970,"To a large extent I can suppress what I'm feeling mentally and can go about my day, attend classes, etc."
27971,(I'm a uni student).
27972,"What I can't do, however, is stop the physical symptoms that come with the anxiety."
27973,"When I am out and interacting with people, I am almost always sweating through my armpits, and sometimes even through my palms, back, and chest."
27974,"I also get heart palpitations, a quivery voice, trembling arms and legs, when I am under high-stress situations (i.e., giving a speech, meeting with a professor, that sort of thing)."
27975,"The extent to which I suffer from these symptoms varies from day to day, depending on how much I go out/interact with people (especially people with whom I am not entirely comfortable, like acquaintances from class)."
27976,"I have consulted psychologists, psychiatrists, and general doctors in trying to fix the problems I am experiencing."
27977,All have suggested that I take SSRIs.
27978,"I took their advice and started Celexa/Citalopram 10mg, and remained on it for a number of weeks (around 5 or 6 I believe)."
27979,"The medication helped with combating mental anxiety/depression, but considerably worsened my physical anxiety."
27980,"Even though the medication lowered my social inhibitions and made me more comfortable around other people, my sweating worsened."
27981,I had originally sought out medication in an attempt to curb the sweating.
27982,It also doesn't seem worthwhile to be taking an anti-depressant when I am trying to combat my anxiety.
27983,"Also, after doing research, it seems that all SSRIs have the side effect of increased sweating."
27984,"So after weighing all of this in my mind, I have decided that SSRIs are not worth it."
27985,(This decision was compounded by the terrible withdrawals that I experienced while coming off of Celexa).
27986,"TL;DR: what medications, other than SSRIs, alleviate the physical symptoms of anxiety, namely sweating?"
27987,"Can anyone who has tried Buspar, beta blockers, benzos, or other SSRIs, please share their experiences?"
27988,How did these medications affect you?
27989,Were they effective in reducing physical symptoms of anxiety?
27990,I've been on the meds for a week and I have a follow-up appt with my doc in three weeks.. What has been your experience with lexapro?
27991,"I've been offered meds twice (ages 12 and 18), but never actually got a prescription because I wasn't interested."
27992,I'm worried medication would take this away from me.
27993,"I would be able to have one in September when I move back to school, but if I'm going to be trying out meds, I'd like to do it with my family doctor who is back here at home."
27994,"I don't have any relatives that *aren't* on anti-anxiety medication (aunts, uncles, dad, surviving grandparent, my mom used to be)."
27995,It's almost like it's a given that you take meds in my family.
27996,"I guess I just want to know 1) What was ""transitioning"" to medication like for you?"
27997,"I get diarrohea and IBS symptoms caused by my anxiety and even though i'm on SSRI and IBS medication, I still struggle."
27998,"I get attacks, and have to carry medication to exams, and worry worry worry."
27999,Yesterday I went to my doctor to refill my ADHD medication.
28000,what other unbearable side effects have you endured from your meds?
28001,"I feel this has turned into a rant ...

tl;dr- Doc is reluctant to give me meds that have worked for me in the past."
28002,"I was diagnosed in the Navy with General Anxiety Disorder and depression, but I feel like there is more than that."
28003,"I  have been hospitalized in Navy Psych wards 5 times for sucidal Ideation and panic attacks, I was prescribed Klonopin and Effexor, Klonopin was the only one that worked, but it is a pretty hardcore method."
28004,Since i was discharged from the Navy my medications have ran out and i have been trying to take care of my self cold turkey.
28005,"I don't have insurance nor an adequate support group, lately i have been harboring all of my anxiety and depression, because my wife and family don't want to hear about it so it has been manifesting through rage and anger, I don't want to be this way nor can i live this way succesfully... any suggestions.. words of encouragement or thoughts would be greatly appreciated"
28006,"I've had panic disorder for about 3 years, and I want to say I conquered it because I didn't have it for over a year and a half."
28007,"I did have panic attacks on and off between that period, but they weren't severe."
28008,I just recently started havin panic attacks again.
28009,They're getting worse on each one.
28010,I went to the ER about two weeks at 6 in the morning because I thought I was having a heart attack.
28011,That was the 2nd visit for the same reason.
28012,"Lately, I've been getting mild to extreme anxiety and only at night."
28013,Sometimes it occurs when I'm driving.
28014,"Pretty much anytime I'm alone, I get some sort of anxiety attack."
28015,It's been eating me up for the past few weeks.
28016,I'm afraid to take medications because I've tried them in the past and it makes it worse.
28017,I don't know how or where to seek a therapist.
28018,That alone gives me anxiety because I can't afford one.
28019,I just want to know how to get rid of this.
28020,I didn't know anywhere else to turn.
28021,"Maybe my meds need changing, I'm on Wellbutrin and am not sure if it works for me."
28022,My therapist has recommended medication but I am hesitant.
28023,"I'm very anti-medication, it took me a long time to even be OK with the medication I have to take for my Crohns."
28024,"You get anxiety, you see a therapist, you get medication, you take medication, you get better, you stop taking medication, repeat."
28025,I was wondering if the only way to treat anxiety was to use medication.
28026,"She takes medicine and sees a psychologist, but it's not helping her right now."
28027,But that was over nearly 8 weeks ago and she's still getting worse prompting her doctor to prescribe her Xanax and some kind of nausea medicine because she's throws up each morning from her anxiety.
28028,There are so many thoughts that plague me and I feel like I just can't cope; I plan on going to the doctor soon and seeing what I can do medication wise.
28029,"There are a bunch of posts about therapists, medication, and different methods of treatment."
28030,Hi everyone!
28031,This is my first post in this sub.
28032,"I've been taking Citalopram (Celexa) for 5 or 6 years, I think."
28033,"A few weeks ago, I found an old bottle in my drawer."
28034,"I knew medications lose their effectiveness, but I didn't properly research it."
28035,The bottle was two years old.
28036,"The bottle was from when I had it upped to 40 mg but decided to go back down to 20, so I never used the rest of the bottle once I got my 20 mg pills."
28037,"For the past few weeks, I've been splitting the 40 mg pills in half and taking 20mg every morning as usual."
28038,"I realized what was happening today after increasing mood swings, anxiety, elevated heart rate ALL THE TIME, a little bit of panic, and just feeling like I did years ago before starting to take Celexa."
28039,I messaged my doctor and I let her know what was going on.
28040,I am picking up my new refill of new 20mg pills as soon as I get out of work today.
28041,I asked my doctor if there was anything I could do to jump start getting the chemical back into my system so I don't have to wait weeks for it.
28042,I can't feel like this for weeks!
28043,It was my own fault but I'm trying to fix it the best I can.
28044,"I doubt there's anything I can do, but I wanted to ask anyway."
28045,"I had to go without my meds for a month a few years ago when there was a lapse in my health insurance, and I had brain zaps during that time."
28046,"I'm not having them this time, but the anxiety is so much worse!"
28047,"Besides just waiting for the new pills to kick in, what should I do?"
28048,I've never taken anxiety medication before when in all honesty I really should have.
28049,My doctor and psychotherapist practically begged me to go on medication because I know I need help but I've been too nervous about it to take medication.
28050,"I mean if I could do my last set of finals without medication (even though I was freaking out the whole time, I didn't die), then surely I'll be okay."
28051,"Do I have to take medicine forever, can I learn to live with my anxieties?"
28052,"I've been a little better for the past few weeks, even though I still can't leave the house very often I have been doing more meaningful things in the day time, such as yoga and working out, eating better and cleaning the house daily."
28053,"However, for these last couple of days I have been getting this really unnerving feeling, mostly in my hands and feet."
28054,"I felt faint a couple of days ago, and had to lie down for a bit."
28055,"I suspected it might have been low blood pressure, so eat a bit more salt thinking that would help."
28056,"It's making me more anxious on a day to day basis and as such i'm not able to push myself as much as I would like, or as much as I usually do."
28057,"I'm still tired on a daily basis too - and as i'm not able to make it out, I haven't seen the Dr for a while now."
28058,"But i' m not on any new medications, just diazapam if it all gets too much."
28059,Which it hasn't for a while now.
28060,"Just looking for some help and advice, is this normal?"
28061,will it pass?
28062,what will help ease it?
28063,Thanks in advance :)
28064,"I'm not really sure where to start, I just want to talk about my struggle with anxiety since its hard to talk to people about it in person."
28065,"I remember I never used to be this way, when I was a kid I could go out anywhere, socialize with new people, and be fine."
28066,But starting around grade 12 I started developing horrible social anxiety.
28067,"It's hard to explain but if anyone will understand, it's you guys."
28068,"Everywhere I go, anything I do, is always accompanied with that knot of anxiety in your stomach, the lump in your throat, the facial sweating, the feeling like you just need to run away and disappear forever."
28069,"This gets much worse when I'm in a never social setting, like college."
28070,"I tried going for a semester at my local collage and could barely even walk through the doors without having a panic attack and facial sweating, which would lead to even worse anxiety, and worse sweating."
28071,"To make a long story short, I dropped out and now have worked in the trades for the past 2 years."
28072,"Ive been on and off many different medications, some that work, and some that don't."
28073,I'm currently taking wellbutrin and xanex which seems to be working alright but I STILL start panicking and sweating when talking to new people or even just going to the grocery store!
28074,"The weird thing is, I know I have absolutely nothing to ever have anxiety about, I have a wonderful girlfriend and were recently blessed with the best baby boy in the world, he's 7 months old now and I love him to death."
28075,"But still, every day, the feeling of anxiety accompanies me no matter what I do and I have no clue if I'll ever be able to beat this."
28076,"I've recently been looking into medical marijuana for severe anxiety, but that wont happen anytime soon."
28077,I think I should also go on a medication to control sweating?
28078,I think it would help with the anxiety.
28079,Ide be interested in all of your opinions and what medications or whatever you do that helps you deal with overwhelming anxiety.
28080,"Thanks for reading, I really hope I can beat this one day."
28081,"My counselor recommended that I talk to my doctor about taking something for my anxiety and both of my parents flat out refused, saying things like meds are the easy way out, that I need to try harder to get better, that they just mask the problem etc etc."
28082,"I myself had looked into it and knew quite a bit about the different types of medication there are etc, and they just parroted off a load of pre conceived notions they had about medication."
28083,I'm dependent on my parents for this because I can't afford to get meds on my own.
28084,"With a long history of going to therapy, taking medication, and even being hospitalized."
28085,"Hello /r/anxiety, it's been a rough weekend."
28086,"I went to an LGBT conference in a major city, and upon going to an evening social event, I found myself experiencing hyperventilation, tremors, and just severe emotional discomfort before I even got into the room."
28087,"There were some people there that I really wanted to talk to, just to make friends with, but I was too nervous to even approach them."
28088,"For some reason, this incident hit me much harder than anything previous."
28089,This situation has happened countless times in my life.
28090,"But by looking back, I can see how damaging this anxiety has been."
28091,It's taken a huge toll on my self-esteem and pretty much wrecked my outlook on life.
28092,I'm putting my foot down and vowing to do whatever it takes to get better.
28093,"Unfortunately, the career path that I'm in does not allow for the taking of any prescription drugs for any psychological disorder."
28094,"So, my first place to turn is to natural medicine."
28095,"I've taken St. John's wort before for depression, but stopped taking it because it didn't help with my anxiety."
28096,My next option (and what I will probably do anyway) is go to talk therapy.
28097,The last resort would be to give up my dream career and start prescription medication.
28098,"I really do not want to do that, but if it comes to that, I'll give it serious consideration."
28099,"That being said, I want to know what natural medicines have worked for you."
28100,"I've already tried passionflower, which did not work."
28101,Something like a natural equivalent of Xanax would be wonderful.
28102,Does anybody have any other suggestions?
28103,Thank you.
28104,"TL;DR Bad social anxiety, want to try natural medicine and/or talk therapy before going to a psychiatrist and sacrificing my dream job to start prescription meds, looking for effective natural medicines to try."
28105,"EDIT: Not sure if this post violates the subreddit rules on medication, but if it does, can anybody recommend a different website to seek advice on?"
28106,I dealt with it with medicine.
28107,"That helped me get through the anxiety on a day to day basis, and after a few months I didn't need the medicine anymore."
28108,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I don't know where else this would file into."
28109,"Ever since I was young, I've had what I believe are panic attacks."
28110,"I feel dizzy and lightheaded, I get cold and sweaty, I hear ringing in my ears and my hands shake."
28111,Sometimes I'm able to lie down to avoid fainting but other times I can't.
28112,These are triggered by a specific and odd thing.
28113,Whenever someone explains what a drug or activity does inside your body.
28114,"I'm fine learning about body systems and what not, I can see open heart surgery feeling fine, but when someone starts to explain to me how anesthetic works I can't handle it."
28115,"Up until yesterday, I hadn't fainted for at least a year, however, I was at the eye doctor and had drops put in my eyes."
28116,"I've had this done dozens of times with no problem, but then the nurse started explaining to me how these drops will make my eyes numb and I fainted."
28117,This is something that I worry could seriously affect my life.
28118,If I ever get hooked into an IV or need to take serious medications I don't know how I'll do it.
28119,And I suppose a career involving medicine is out of the question.
28120,Does anyone know anything I can do to get rid of this?
28121,I have diagnosed ADHD but I don't take my medicine as often as I should because I'd rather be high and happy than focused because I have nothing to focus on but my self-generated misery.
28122,"I have an appointment on the 11th to get put back on meds, but am I normal?"
28123,I'm 35.
28124,I've been dealing with chronic anxiety and panic my whole life.
28125,"Literally, from toddlerhood (ask me about my mortifying fear of Gene Shalit -- but really that man was terifying) !"
28126,This is a disease that runs in my family.
28127,"I have made the focus of my life escaping this problem, doing everything I can to be ""different"" from my family."
28128,"In the last 20 years I've seen 12 therapists of all different methodologies, 5 psychiatrists, tried at least 20 medications (not all at the same time, ha!)."
28129,I've been hospitalized twice.
28130,"I've had hypnotherapy, acupuncture; tried meditation (several Buddhist retreats, which were cool but didn't cure me), yoga, exercise, diet changes, read every book on the topic."
28131,"(It's funny when I read through this /r/ because every time I see a book recommended....yup, read it!)"
28132,I should basically have a phd in anxiety.
28133,I can't say it's done nothing.
28134,I'm still here.
28135,I'm alive.
28136,"I've developed a highly intricate ""fake"" personality - a sarcastic, smart girl with a lot of friends, musical talent and a decent career."
28137,But underneath it all I'm a wreck.
28138,I wake up anxious every day.
28139,I feel anxious all the time.
28140,"I dream of running away from my life, my body."
28141,"All of this leads to depression, although I don't consider myself 'depressed' per se since it's a side effect of anxiety."
28142,"I had a major breakdown this weekend, my biggest panic attack in years."
28143,I embarrassed myself on a bus full of people for six hours straight.
28144,"I did it in front of a person I love, who I thought maybe would be the answer to not dying alone, and I'm not sure yet how he's going to react but based on every other relationship I've ever had I'm guessing it doesn't bode well and I'm bracing myself for the worst."
28145,I have no drive to get better anymore.
28146,"I feel like I've literally tried everything, and nothing's worked."
28147,What am I trying for anyway?
28148,"I've always said I don't want to be happy, just 'normal'."
28149,What if a 'normal' life is out of reach for me and always will be?
28150,"I've turned a corner, and I refuse to live like this anymore."
28151,"Of course, isn't the only solution not to live at all, if I've tried everything else?"
28152,"I'm ok with this us except I have a wonderful, hilarious lovable dog that I love with all my heart, who also has anxiety problems ironically, who I would never abandon."
28153,So I know that's not an option.
28154,I don't really have a question here.
28155,"Just wanted to share my story, maybe hear something optimistic."
28156,"Feeling kind of done with all of this, though."
28157,"On a side note, I hate that I have this problem that isn't even a 'real' problem."
28158,"Oh sure, all of us here know it absolutely is -- but I mean, I'm embarassed to even talk about it in the real world because people are like ""What, at least you don't have cancer""."
28159,I almost want to say -- and not demeaning people with cancer which is horrible and painful and deadly and did I mention horrible -- I wish I did.
28160,At least then people would take me seriously.
28161,I might get some leave time off of work.
28162,"I would get drugs to treat my problems instead of doctors constantly threatening to take away my beloved xanax prescription (even though I take one maybe like, once a week MAX) because I've had it for 10 years and it's too dangerous."
28163,"And saddest of all, maybe if I had cancer I'd die, and it would be a noble death."
28164,People would say I was brave.
28165,"Not that I'm a coward, or that I dishonored my family or my god."
28166,"Sorry about the morbid tangent, just having a tough time here."
28167,Hang in there everyone.
28168,I understand you if no one else does.
28169,I started taking new meds because I was abusing ritalin (depakote) and then I had an anger attack at work the other day.
28170,I'm currently not on any medication.
28171,She suggested I try to go for an evaluation at a clinic for low income families and expressed that they will hopefully put me on medication.
28172,"I wouldn't have to worry about today""

So, I definitely think medication would help and I'm open to it if it's determined appropriate."
28173,what is being on meds like when it goes right?
28174,what is being on meds like when it goes wrong?
28175,what happens if medication doesn't help?
28176,I looked through the FAQ and the resources on the sidebar but they're not very useful since I'm not on meds or diagnosed.
28177,"so im 17 years old and have had a social anxiety disorder and depression since i was 13 i take medication for my anxiety, my problem is i seem to have alot of trouble talking to girls i communicate with them just fine over facebook and text but in person i dont necessarily get anxious but i do start acting like a typical teenage nerd talking to a girl, my real problem is when i do get a girlfriend thats when all my anxiety sets in, in most situations i dnt even know whats causing my anxiety i think its just i have become so use to being alone that these changes and differences make me uncomfortable and thus cause anxiety."
28178,I've been one meds for the past few years and I am in a much better place because of them.
28179,"He doesn't know that I am on anxiety medication, and I am pretty sure he's not on any."
28180,"I've made passing mention that I am able to control migraines with medication, but he's not interested in that for himself."
28181,"I am going abroad to study for a couple months in the summer, and would rather not have to worry about medication."
28182,"Hi guys, I finally decided I need to get on medication to get me through the next 5 months of nursing school."
28183,I'm looking for a non prescription alternative to anxiety medication.
28184,"I really don't want therapy, or sleeping pills, or medication."
28185,"The basics of my anxiety began to form such as : 

- Nail biting

- Playing with my hair constantly 

- Fear of the dark, sleeping, irrational thoughts/ideas

- When I try to sleep my body has spasms, muscle spasms, sudden jerks, and my mind is flooded with worries and fears

- I make huge lists of things to do/ remember even about simple things such as ""Shower, straighten hair, clean drawer"" and then i re-write the lists when they begin to get ""messy"" (I have like 5 lists at a time daily)

- I've had two huge anxiety attacks that were extremely painful and lasted about 2 hours each 

- I have tried to kill myself over 100 times ever since I was 11 

- I purposely bruise/bite myself to take out my frustrations

- I rarely sleep 

- I have no motivation anymore and I always assume the worst of things

- I am absolutely terrified of pain/cannot tolerate any pain at all

- I rely heavily on medicine when I AM in pain 

- I starve myself on and off 

- I have low self esteem 

- I have trust issues

- I assume people dislike me almost immediately which alternates between that and me assuming I am better then everybody 

- I am very pale/sickly looking with bruises beneath my eyes but I hide it easily with make up

- I am very shaky/weak boned from bad diet which stops me from exercising 

- I re-organize constantly and need things in perfect order 

- I have extremely violent/constant thoughts that come from nowhere

and that is all just off the top of my head."
28186,I dont want to take any kind of pill because I dont want to feel like my brain and thought process will change from using an everyday medicine.
28187,"I have already been to see a doctor who prescribed me medication which I refused (for now); I have seen a therapist, told almost everyone in my family and my good friends and hired an herbalist to help me find a good mixture of something to get me feeling like my old self."
28188,I haven't had medication in two years but due to a new job and other life events I am having terrible anxiety again.
28189,"I would like to seek out a new doctor or therapist to get me on medication again, but now I live in a different city currently without health insurance and the thought of seeking out a doctor and therapist is only causing more anxiety."
28190,I need to take my meds.
28191,I'm going to switch meds over the summer.
28192,I didn't take my ADD meds to relax further.
28193,"I thought we were just joking about something, but whenever I don't take my meds, I sometimes don't pick up on social cues very well."
28194,"Sometimes I couldn't sleep, but some very average medicine has always done the trick."
28195,"After nearly a decade of therapy, and trying more medications than I can count, I've realized that I'm never going to get better."
28196,I'm going to have anxiety for life.
28197,"So I need to stop trying to fix it, and stop trying to find the root of my anxiety, and instead focus 100% of my efforts on coping with it."
28198,"It was really hard to accept this reality, but that's what it is."
28199,"Every moment of my life, I feel like there's a weight on my chest, and a clamp on my temples."
28200,"My heart pounds, my hands sweat, and my thoughts race."
28201,"This is my life, and I need to learn how to deal with it, and ideally with as little help from benzos as possible."
28202,Has anyone else come to this conclusion?
28203,I know anxiety is different for everyone.
28204,"My other option is to go on Paxil, but if NLP is as effective as my therapist says it is then I don't want to start another medication."
28205,I've dealt with a lot in my life and persevered so the thought of taking medication is new to me.
28206,"I've had depression and anxiety for almost 8 years now, and I've been off medication for 4 years."
28207,But I'm worried and I don't want to get back into the meds.
28208,But one thing that has kept me from going off the deep end is being on medication.
28209,But I'm on such small doses that I'm wondering if the medication is doing me any good.
28210,"I guess that the medication is working, but I'm still pretty anxious all the time."
28211,The reason I ask is in the 'what medication do you take' thread everyone talks about their GP's.
28212,I am a social worker that works with people that have mental health issues and from my experience GP's don't make referrals to psychiatrist as much as they should and totally fuck up the medication on a regular basis.
28213,From my observations CBT is often more effective than medication in the long run.
28214,"I am on meds, they're not helping it (although helping my depression)."
28215,"I'll be seeing someone about my meds (gotta get new scripts, moved to a new state) on dec 31st."
28216,I was prescribed a minor dose of a generic anxiety medicine and out the door I went.
28217,I'm wondering if it would be a healthier option to see a doctor and try some medication like an SSRI first.
28218,Should I seek professional help and get some medication or should I just man up and try alcohol to use as a crutch in certain social situations?
28219,"I've got a feeling that people here will be more biased to the medication side since this is the anxiety subreddit, but I hope I can get some unbiased opinions."
28220,"These help, but the therapist wanted to know if I wanted to try medication to see if it would help."
28221,My largest fears in this is that a therapist will put me on medication which will make me addicted (which might be physically and financially unhealthy) and change me for the worse.
28222,TL;DR- boyfriend of a year broke up with me just as I was starting new meds and therapy.
28223,I won't do meds.
28224,"I have a very high stress, high demand job as a litigator and I've seen another person start anti-anxiety meds."
28225,I don't take medication for it as I haven't had insurance for the past few years.
28226,Btw she's on some meds to help her with it but she can't deal with people for 3 weeks until she gets a checkup.
28227,"I've been on and off meds for three years now for depression/anxiety, and none have helped at all."
28228,"Any advice would also be greatly appreciated, as I'm really sick and tired of the medication deal."
28229,I haven't been on medication for it for some time but when my anxiety was at it's worst it was when I was ending a year long relationship.
28230,"Have tried various meds, and was most recently on bupropion (Wellbutrin) and escitalopram (Lexapro) for a couple of years."
28231,"I agreed with this, as I had had some side effects (including sexual function) although the overall effect of the meds was positive."
28232,"Have now been off all medication for 5 ish months now, and have recently had a full-blown reappearance of my anxiety (last 2 months)."
28233,Have I screwed myself by being on meds for so long in the past that I can now no longer function without them?
28234,I talked for a little bit and was wondering if I should ask the psychologist about medication.
28235,Is it possible to fight this without medication?
28236,I finally saw help and they prescribed me two types of medication.
28237,"The first, Mirtazapine, I am supposed to take a half tablet before bed."
28238,The second is Propranolol which I am supposed to take as needed for anxiety.
28239,"The problem is, as a result of stress and anxiety I have created a pretty bad health anxiety issue."
28240,This issue extends to medication.
28241,I can't get myself to take these medications.
28242,Just the thought of taking them gives me a panic attack.
28243,"I am afraid I will have a bad reaction, or something horrible will happen (yes I have watched way too many episodes of House)."
28244,I am also worried I might become reliant on them and have a tough time stopping.
28245,I just can't get over the fact that they might make things worse.
28246,I know I should be okay with taking them.
28247,But my brain just keeps saying no.
28248,"Those with health anxiety, how do you cope with this?"
28249,What gets you to take medication?
28250,"I tell myself over and over nothing will happen, but I can't."
28251,"However, they completely trust conventional medicine, which is pretty contradictory on its own."
28252,"Hi all,

I’m new to this sub and after browsing around I thought that this might be a good place to voice concern and hopefully get some feedback on what I can do about this particular issue."
28253,To start off: I am a 23-year-old female.
28254,"I have health insurance but am not seeing a professional at the moment because I used to see one through my university, but can’t see her anymore since I am a graduate and I haven’t found a new therapist in my price range yet."
28255,"I have had significant issues with anxiety for most of my life, although I did not really realize it fully until a few years ago."
28256,"I should also mention that I was in an abusive relationship a few years ago and although it definitely didn’t help any of my issues, I don’t think the particular issue I am here to write about is affected by it."
28257,"I am not on any medications for my anxiety, although I used to be on 10 mg of Citalopram(Celexa), and I sometimes take herbs for my anxiety (lavender, valerian root, magnesium, etc)."
28258,"It’s kind of hard for me to describe what makes me anxious, but a definite trigger is corresponding with people, either electronically or in writing."
28259,"I have been known to take up to a week to respond to a text; Facebook messages can take up to a year, sometimes."
28260,"Phone calls aren’t that bad, but if I miss a call and then it goes to voicemail, it might take up to a month or longer for me to check it."
28261,It is much easier for me to not open mail than it is to open mail.
28262,"It doesn’t help that people tend to make jokes about my reputation as a “slow responder.”  It doesn’t really seem to matter who they are – loved ones, friends, strangers all get the same treatment."
28263,"I would say that the exception to this rule is my boyfriend(not the one that abused me), I never really have trouble responding to him; I’m thinking this is because I feel like I can come to him for help if I need it and he won’t judge me, is always there for me, etc."
28264,"When I don't respond to people, they understandably get upset, which augments my anxiety greatly."
28265,It makes me feel like they hate me and that there's nothing I can do to make it better; I'm a failure.
28266,I've had some very toxic friendships in the recent (last 5 years) past and I think this may play a role.
28267,I have absolutely zero problem talking to people face-to-face.
28268,"It’s hard to say how long this problem has persisted, but I would definitely say that it developed over time and it got really bad during my first year of college."
28269,"I should also mention that I have a very busy life: I’m a college grad seeking a job that I am qualified for that will also pay me well (not the job I have right now), I am an unpaid intern at a non-profit 2x a week, and I sometimes work on the weekends (meaning that I sometimes work 6 days a week and the last day of my week is spent sleeping/recuperating and doing chores)."
28270,"I also have pets and try to maintain an active social life, which inevitably stress me out a lot sometimes."
28271,"I have a good relationship with my family and boyfriend, and I seem to be well-liked by my friends, when I don’t take two weeks to respond to a text."
28272,"Conversely, if I am not busy enough, I quickly get bored and depressed, and it can be hard for me to come out of that."
28273,"I know that I should speak to a professional about this, and intend to do so."
28274,But for right now I just wanted to get some basic input.
28275,What do you guys think?
28276,Any ideas on how I can try to get better at doing something so simple as sending a text within a reasonable amount of time without wanting to cry?
28277,Thank you so much for reading!
28278,:)
28279,I was prescribed some anxiety medication and something for my depression.
28280,We had to drive around 14 hours to get there and I had just started my medication.
28281,I stopped taking all my medication.
28282,"I still do not take medication, but I am at a point where I can do that."
28283,It doesn't help that medication is a trigger for me.
28284,I've been dealing with general anxiety my entire life.
28285,To be honest its made me too nervous to talk to anyone about it my entire.
28286,The only person that really knows I deal with it is my girlfriend of three years.
28287,I'm 24 now and i'm considering going on my own health insurance.
28288,The reason being is because I am considering going on anxiety medication.
28289,I didn't want to do it before because I thought that my parents would disapprove or judge me if they found out I got a prescription to anti-anxiety medication.
28290,Oh by the way bringing up the fact I'm nervous most situations to the doctor makes me really really nervous.
28291,"Anyways, the health insurance will be about 10 dollars more bi-weekly but I think it will be worth it because I feel like my parents think anxiety is a made up thing."
28292,What are your thoughts on anti-anxiety medications?
28293,I'm sort of running out of options and want this burden to go away.
28294,I feel like I am taking too MUCH medication.
28295,I never have been on a lot of medication before.
28296,I don't want to depend on these meds.
28297,"(Besides medication, of course) I was hoping that we could compile a list of healthy coping skills for when things get to be too much."
28298,"He refuses to take medication for it, as the last pills he was on made him gain weight."
28299,I've been dealing with anxiety issues for years now and its just getting worse.
28300,"I recently started a new job (first one out of college), and its creating more stress for me."
28301,I want to quit but if i do i'm worried about all the things that might go wrong.
28302,"me not being able to find something else, what my bosses will think, what my co-workers will think, how i should, etc... my mind just won't stop, and its eating away at me."
28303,"I'm starting to develop more than just the chest pain, but also heartburn, gerd, and possibly ulcers."
28304,This job doesn't even provide me health insurance unless i pay $400 a month.
28305,I make $1500 and it costs me $200 to get to work by commute.
28306,So i opted out of the insurance because i couldn't afford it.
28307,It's too late now too.
28308,"I want to quit, but i'm worried."
28309,"The last saving grace of this job was that i had my own cubicle away from my boss (who is probably the reason for most of my stress), but now he wants to move me into his office."
28310,Any advice?
28311,I would really like to get help  Dealing with my possible GAD without insurance?
28312,I rather not go on medications but i would like to get some help if possible.
28313,Are there any options?
28314,Should I consider going to a psychologist and getting medication?
28315,"I know someday I'm going to have to try without the medicine, but the Xanax is a life saver for now"
28316,Finally went to the doc to change my meds as I was really having a hard time.
28317,My doctor didn't want me on anything new since I'm having a hard time and she knows I'm not a fan of trying new meds with fear of side-effects so we went back to it since it worked for me and its been 5+ years since I've been on it.
28318,This previous weekend (Friday - Sunday) I went down to Southern California for a wedding with my parents.
28319,"On Sunday morning, I found myself miserable: variable hunger, unquenchable thirst, minor hot flashes, cold sweats, and light-headedness, which I attributed to my recent stoppage of cannabis use (previous to last thursday I was stoned for pretty much the whole summer)."
28320,"However, by the end of the day I ended up with my first panic attack."
28321,"To put this in context, my family has had a fair amount of family health issues; my father (52) has HBP, and my mother (57) recently developed intense anxiety issues that she is pretty much unable to cope with aside from medications that turn her into a pharma-zombie."
28322,She was diagnosed with this condition in December of 2010 after a completely random anxiety breakdown regarding a problem that didn't actually exist.
28323,"Over time it has become more outwardly controllable, but her symptoms are not subsiding by any means."
28324,"At this time I was a senior in high school, and once she was afflicted, I turned to heavy marijuana use as a crutch."
28325,"I also began to stay at friends houses for long periods of time, avoiding familial interaction like a sport."
28326,I became completely numb to my mother's condition due to the pot use; thinking back on it I'm not sure it ever really crossed my mind how (excuse my language) *fucked up* she actually was until this weekend.
28327,"However, spending 72 hours with her (and my father) in the hotel made me realize a lot that I didn't want to come to terms with."
28328,"[Additionally I have a 16 year old sister who is currently participating in a study abroad program, in part to escape the same situation, among other things."
28329,"I realized she acted as a primary buffer, along with my father, to evoke ""normal"" responses from my mother; primarily disciplinary, which I subconsciously used as a rationalization to not worry about her well-being.]"
28330,"At the end of the trip, they dropped me off at my house, where I live with 6 other very close friends (we're sophomores in college, I'm 19)."
28331,"I went to help out with some renovating in the back yard, and upon finishing (almost no work at all, just laid some seeds down in a garden), I sat down."
28332,"My heart began to race, as if I had just run the mile."
28333,"Hands were clammy, breath was irregular, but I knew I wasn't going through heart failure."
28334,"I'd never experienced this before, and a quick google search informed me that I was going through a panic attack."
28335,"I ended up calling the paramedics, as I recently discovered most first-time panic-attacked individuals do."
28336,My pulse was something close to 170/60 at the peak of it.
28337,"I've never been notably anxious before, and at 19 I never figured I'd experience something so intense with no obviously noticeable trigger."
28338,As I wrote this I was able to condense what I wanted to ask into two distinct questions.
28339,"First off, the worst part of this has been the ""hangover"" from the attack."
28340,I still feel buzzy and slightly worried (anticipatory) about another panic attack.
28341,"Is there an efficient way to ""come down"" from this?"
28342,"From what I've read, this part can actually be the most debilitating, as it can last anywhere from several hours to a few days."
28343,"Secondly, is it possible to have panic attacks as a one-time thing?"
28344,Or now that I've had one will I unavoidably have more?
28345,"I'm rarely on-edge, I act well in social situations, people like me and I like people."
28346,The only explainable trigger I can think of is stressing about my family's health.
28347,I'd love to hear any advice you guys might have about how to confront situations akin to that of my parents/mother specifically.
28348,"It's impossible to be around her without seeing the blankness in her eyes, which is almost a mini-trigger itself."
28349,"She believes that she doesn't have a real problem, and that instead everyone else does."
28350,"Because of this, my father can't check her into care or even brain scans/tests, so her issue is not yet formally diagnosed, meaning any number of things could happen and I have no idea if I'll ever get my real mother back."
28351,"I just have no idea what to do, I'm 19 fucking years old, this shit isn't supposed to happen yet."
28352,"Any help or consolation you guys could offer would be great, even if it means recommending a visit to therapy and/or the doctor, everything helps."
28353,"I'm extremely inexperienced with this sort of situation, and the paramedics told me it probably wouldn't be worth an ER visit, so I'm completely unsure where to go from here."
28354,Typing this all out for internet strangers to read has been strangely comforting.
28355,Thanks for your time and consideration
28356,I'm not on meds anymore because they weren't working as well so my doctor tried to wean me off of them in 5 days (they were ativan and i had been on them over a year) but i stretched that out to 10 days just to cope.
28357,"He noticed my rather up-beat demeanor (I'm very good at pretending and putting on a happy face), and when I told him I think I could probably get by without meds, he agreed, but said sometimes these meds are more like a shortcut and they might still be a benefit to me."
28358,I wasn't even this unsure about taking my HRT meds.
28359,"""Just take medication for it""
""Figure it out"" 

Okay...I think you get the point."
28360,"The drawbacks of Zoloft, for me, are FAR outweighed by the relief that I have gotten from the meds."
28361,"I am also on my medication (not anti-anxiety, but beta blockers)."
28362,"Without the medication, I would have easily had a full blown panic attack at this point with a heart rate over 120."
28363,Edit: I am male and have no medication.
28364,I was on adhd medication for a year but came off of it about 7 months ago.
28365,"The medication was called stratera, and I stopped taking it because of camp, and also because I felt like I didn't need it/it wasn't helping."
28366,"I have tried to change my diet, working out, exposing myself to my fears, talking to people and therapists about it, and I even take medication but its still there."
28367,"I genuinely don't know how to cope with this and I don't think she does either, aside from taking her medication (her prescription for which runs out soon)."
28368,"I am on meds as of a few months ago, but I always found it really unsettling that most people couldn't empathize with the feelings that I couldn't even put into words."
28369,"I'm now taking my medication properly, I've lost around 12 kilos through diet and exercise."
28370,"If anyone has similar issues and is taking (or has taken) a medication that had positive results with, I would love to hear about it!"
28371,"I got diagnosed and I'm on medicine, and my GPA is rising aside from two classes I screwed up in."
28372,"(Found out when my anxiety medication mixed with my sleep fuckery--as I eloquently call it--to have me sleep through alarms--and they call, for some reason, if you're a half hour late into your shift."
28373,Now this isn't something that's completely out of the blue as she's been living with it for a while and does take appropriate medication.
28374,"Fast Forward to Current Issue: 

She has taken the week off and has gone up to a co-workers cottage for the majority of the week (left Monday 07/20 and is returning Friday 07/24), she ended up forgetting to pack her meds and shes stated multiple times already that she doesn't think that she can make it until Friday."
28375,"She is getting very homesick and even mentioned it on the first day being away, she really misses her pets, is up there at this cottage with no meds and no one around her age."
28376,I tried going off the meds for a full day and on the second day I experienced the same sad results.
28377,So I went to visit my doctor today about my increased panic attacks lately.
28378,He went through my medications and told my that what I was currently taking was more geared toward fighting my depression and not my anxiety.
28379,I was actually even taking a medication that has a side effect of increasing anxiety.
28380,"Anyways, we decided to go off of the on increasing anxiety (which should help)."
28381,Then he introduced the idea of fighting the anxiety aggressively for one month and then pulling back to maintenance.
28382,"So he prescribed Ativan, 1 mg daily, for one month."
28383,Then we would revisit it and pull back to using it as needed.
28384,"This is all fine, but I'm worried about dependency and getting addicted because I know Ativan is addicting."
28385,"I was just wondering if anyone else has any experience with it and if they could let me know...idk, that they turned out okay."
28386,Just anything to calm my nerves would be good.
28387,Thanks.
28388,"Oh, and I am in active therapy.I have Tricare Prime for my insurance company, so everything is covered and basically nothing is off limits medication wise, testing wise, or hospital wise."
28389,"Tricare Prime insurance (no co-pays on visits or medicine), previous bipolar 2 dx."
28390,I have a prescription for medication (Cipralex) which I haven't taken yet because I've been overseas for the summer.
28391,I hope this is something that will go away assuming the medication works well for me.
28392,"I'm on medication (100 mg Pristiq right now) and it's such a help, but I think we all know there's more we could be doing or trying to help ourselves in addition to the meds."
28393,I'm just looking for some advice on decreasing anxiety medication.
28394,"Sorry this turned out so long, I guess I'm just looking for anyone who's tried/been successful with getting off anxiety medication?"
28395,My dr dosen't take seriosly that the meds aren't working right because this is a stressful time in my life (4 weeks to graduate college) but my meds seemed to have stopped working and he wont change anything.
28396,Is this a reaction of combination of meds or what?
28397,**TL;DR:Anyone have experience with meds suddenly not working?
28398,"I eventually decided I couldn't live like this anymore and even though I felt a lot of anxiety towards taking the medication (I don't even take tylenol or anything), I decided it was worth a try."
28399,:) I may be trying behavioral cognitive therapy soon to try and complement the medication.
28400,"And so the only ways for me to fall asleep are getting drunk, taking a ton of anxiety medication and hipnotics, or sometimes when I haven't slept in days I'll be able to fall asleep for 5 hours, but as soon as I wake up the pain starts again and I need to grab my phone and look at twitter or check my email, or take a book and start reading or something and I can't choose to put it down again."
28401,"Do not take this as gospel if you wish to go on this medication, because everyone reacts differently, but Jesus Christ, did it fuck me up."
28402,"I do understand it's something that will more than likely pass (unless this medication doesn't 'fit' me), but I suppose I needed somewhere to vent and just talk about this with like minded people (and I hope that's okay, mods)."
28403,"As I said with regards to my previous medication, do not hesitate to try out medication based on other people's experiences."
28404,I've been told that adding wellbutrin is a common thing that can help with all of these side effects... but I'm a little weary of using a medication to essentially fix the first medication.
28405,I don't take medication because I was trying to get over it without the use of medication.
28406,She suggested I try to go for an evaluation at a clinic for low income families and expressed that they will hopefully put me on medication.
28407,"So, I definitely think medication would help and I'm open to it if it's determined appropriate."
28408,what is being on meds like when it goes right?
28409,what is being on meds like when it goes wrong?
28410,I looked through the FAQ and the resources on the sidebar but they're not very useful since I'm not on meds or diagnosed.
28411,"He started complaining about it a bit, prescribed my medication and left while the nurse came in and took my blood."
28412,"I currently am not seeing anyone or taking meds, but I have in the past and will be at a university where I can get care in a little under two months."
28413,I have a lot of friends who get turned off by condescending or inconsiderate psychiatrists/therapists or they're scared of medication.
28414,I haven't been medicated since September and not getting back on medication after acquiring new health coverage was clearly a horrible mistake.
28415,I know that no one can just make it go away and that I have to get back on my medication but I just hurt so badly that I felt compelled to at least post a thread where others might understand my odd compulsions.
28416,I tried other medicine but most of it actually makes me feel depressed which i feel is worst.
28417,I am wondering what other suggestions that can help me get through this other then medication.
28418,"I feel so relieved and accomplished, not only because I finally came to terms with my anxiety and battled it (without medication!!!!"
28419,I found a new physician who wants me off the meds and recommends tapering down to .25 and then to as needed.
28420,They want to put my on a cholesterol medication.
28421,"I've been talking to my psychiatrist and we've been modifying my medication dosage, but so far it's not helping much."
28422,"I know high BP is bad for your system, but I feel like if I were to take BP medication, it might be bad for my body during periods where I feel normal and relaxed and my BP is low (because it may drop it too low, or something like that)."
28423,"I sought therapy, medicine, spirituality, and friends and community to cure myself."
28424,"And maybe, either way, these aren't just going to go away with some medication that makes me stand up for myself a little better."
28425,And I have the fortune/misfortune of being on a medication that is basically allowing me to live uncompromised.
28426,A medication that I need really good health insurance to get.
28427,This medication has allowed me to live.
28428,get the medicine.
28429,I'm prescribed two meds: Wellbutrin and Lexapro.
28430,"I was diagnosed bipolar and I take a mood stabilizer,  I've been on meds since March,  and while it took a while to come to terms with it,  I was ok.  As the pills fell into my hand I just had this overwhelming feeling of hating the fact that I have to take medicine,  and of course a while bunch of other invasive thoughts started taking over."
28431,Will I need to go on medication or is this something I can overcome with practice and finding the root cause mentally?
28432,I went to the doctor once and she told me that it seems the two most stressful programs are mine and medicine.
28433,I never used to be anxious.
28434,I had some anxiety that came with the depression that always existed.
28435,But not like this.
28436,"Within the past year, I weened myself off anti depressants, because I honestly couldn't stay sober from alcohol and because of that they weren't working."
28437,Since then it was honestly alarmingly sudden the onset of my anxiety.
28438,Which almost completely surrounds the process of death and the after life.
28439,I have so much anxiety about how I might die and what happens when I die that I'm not living my life.
28440,I have gained 100 pounds from being pent up  in my room drinking when I used to be an avid hiker.
28441,"I carry a knife when I have to go to my car at night, and am afraid I may accidentally hurt someone meaning well because they scared me."
28442,I literally am just waiting for an intruder to come into my home and take me to torture me.
28443,"Never mind geological hazards, nuclear war, asteroids etc."
28444,It's exhausting.
28445,Then the afterlife.
28446,I almost can't even talk about it.
28447,It's too scary.
28448,I really need to know success stories.
28449,Has anyone defeated this?
28450,Found peace?
28451,Are their medications/ therapy that have helped?
28452,Am I alone?
28453,P.S.
28454,I'm a almost 25 year old gay female living in the midwest.
28455,"In the time since I stopped school, I've been getting increasingly worse, I have started to see a psychologists, but I can only afford to see her every 2 weeks and I am on meds."
28456,I got meds which I stopped taking after a few months because they gave me awful feelings.
28457,Edit: I have no idea why this was flared as medication.
28458,"I've never had an anaphylactic reaction and I'm not allergic to any meds, but that doesn't stop me from being afraid."
28459,Do I need anti-anxiety medication for episodes like tonight?
28460,"Antihistamines like sleep aides cold medicine and allergy pills give me sleep apnea already, they restrict the blood vessels and I have scar tissue in my artery where the wire from the defibrillator goes into my heart so I can't take those."
28461,"Therapy, medication, the whole 9 yards."
28462,Any comments on either of these meds?
28463,"I have suffered with depression for a while, was put on medication, got it under control, I'm not on the medication anymore because I can't afford it (no insurance) and I can't see my psychologist anymore for the same reason."
28464,"* taken medication in the past, didn't help, doing group therapy now

For a more detailed descption see here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2evgdc/dragging_ones_self_through_life_5_steps_forward_4/

Most people with social anxiety self describe themselves as introverted."
28465,Then my counselling sessions ended and I stopped my medication as I didn't think I needed it anymore and moved home to live with my parents at the end of my last year of Uni (although I haven't actually completed my degree thanks to the anxiety).
28466,Hello.
28467,I'm writing this after 2 and a half hours of trying to go back to sleep (Woke up at 4).
28468,"Yesterday, I woke up at 6."
28469,"The day before, I woke up at 5."
28470,I fucking hate this.
28471,I don't feel tired and I can't remember my dreams.
28472,Does that mean I woke up between a sleep cycle?
28473,"Yeah, I don't feel tired or anything, it just doesn't feel ""normal"" or, better yet, ""usual."
28474,I would always get a good 8 or 9 hours a night before this.
28475,I try to just lay there and calm myself down.
28476,"I try to do breathing exercises and give myself affirmations but it usually ends up like:

""Okay breath in, 2, 3, 4,....hold,2,3,4.....out,2,3,4.....in,2,3,4....UGH WHAT THE FUCK WHY ISN'T THIS WORKING, JUST STOP ITTTTT.....okay no,, everything's fine....brain, let's just calm everyone down...we're going to be okay.....in,2,3,4....hold,2,3,4....out,2,3,WHAT THE FUCK THIS ISN'T WORKING."""
28477,I've been obsessing over my heart-rate.
28478,"I measured my heart-rate , upon waking up, at 75 bpm."
28479,"Now, it's at 68."
28480,"I just recently started changing my diet in the past week, out of suggestion from a friend (who also suffered/suffers from anxiety and can relate to what I'm going through now), because I felt like my anxiety was affecting my GI tract."
28481,"I was having 1 bowel movement a day (I know, that's still ""normal"" but it didn't feel normal *for me*, probably just another anxiety-caused worry)."
28482,"I'm cutting out dairy and red meat, and I'm eating more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables."
28483,I'm also going for walks every day.
28484,"My friend showed me a documentary on Netflix that was explaining America's rise in both red meat and dairy consumption and how it was linked to America's rise in heart failures, diabetes, cancer, prescription meds, etc."
28485,"I just thought ""well, shit."
28486,"I don't want any of that!""."
28487,"I've also been taking probiotics, metamucil, and multivitamins every day."
28488,(I've also been having somewhat soft and green stools.
28489,I read somewhere that it could be an effect of the probiotics and that it's a good thing?)
28490,"I guess I've always had moments of anxiety, with years in between, but this anxiety spell really started about a month ago, when I lost my job."
28491,I would spend entire days just worrying and getting anxious about finding a job again.
28492,I have a possible job prospect and a job interview later day.
28493,I've been getting anxious about just getting the job.
28494,"I just need it, damnit."
28495,I went to get a physical exam and got some lab work done.
28496,My blood pressure was really good and a lot of test results came back really good.
28497,The only one I was concerned about was my LDL was a little high.
28498,I'm trying to stay positive about my new diet lowering that.
28499,"I've been seeing a therapist for  the past weeks (really, for years but just a few weeks with this new one) and my therapist is suggesting I see a psychiatrist to get on some medications."
28500,My therapist says I would really benefit from it.
28501,"The thing is, I'm terrified (probably adding to the anxiety) of taking meds."
28502,"I don't want anything addictive (because addiction runs in my family) and I definitely don't want something that will give me weird side effects, while I'm already experiencing changes in my body."
28503,I don't want to not feel myself anymore.
28504,I have this extreme image of me being on meds and just being practically comatose or just a completely different person.
28505,I don't want it to change who I am.
28506,"Also, I don't want it to change who I am out of fear that my SO won't love me anymore."
28507,"I'm also terrified of having to ""take"" something for the rest of my life."
28508,"I never thought I'd end up being someone who had to ""take' things all the time."
28509,"I was so used to just eating whatever the hell I wanted, never getting sick, and feeling great."
28510,"Now, I feel like a weaker version of myself."
28511,I feel like I've failed myself.
28512,Help.
28513,"I avoided going for many years, as I was apprehensive about being given a label or being put on medication."
28514,I am more than curious to see how I get on next week and wether the medication can help prove to my nervous system that there is no need for excessive amounts of adrenaline in such situations.
28515,"All your meds and the doses, hours of sleep the previous night, levels of anxiety/depression and such, and also a notes section."
28516,I am a 51 year old man.
28517,"In the past six years, I had a ten month hospital stay where I received last rites three times, got divorced and remarried, lost two really good paying jobs, moved three times and ran out of medications to treat a chronic disease I have had since I was 20 years old."
28518,"I was an abused child, both physically and sexually."
28519,"I am a recovering alcoholic, and am sober thirty years."
28520,"For the past three years I have had panic attacks that wake me from sound sleep, cause me to throw up and can freeze me in my tracks."
28521,It is getting harder to cope.
28522,"My wife is wonderful, but I am wearing her out."
28523,I can't focus.
28524,I am on Xanax ER and antidepressants.
28525,I dread going to sleep.
28526,"Every time I hear about someone losing their job, I have weeks of panic attacks."
28527,I have been in talk therapy for years and years.
28528,I feel like I am losing it.
28529,I dread going to bed.
28530,I dread talking about my anxiety and panic.
28531,And I feel like a total fraud and loser claiming thirty years of sobriety when I have so little peace in my life.
28532,I am doing things I never did before.
28533,"I am waking up, pulling the covers up over my head and texting my boss I am not coming in."
28534,Then I sleep until four or five in the afternoon.
28535,"I am afraid my wife will leave me if I don't get this under control, though I have no reason to believe this."
28536,I am afraid I will lose my job.
28537,And I fear most that these will become self fulfilling prophecies.
28538,But the attacks are so potent that my blood pressure goes up to dangerous levels.
28539,And I feel ashamed.
28540,"Like most people I have gone through a lot with anxiety, depression, medication, suicidal thoughts etc."
28541,"Now that I've found a good medicine, I have made a lot of improvement, I've stopped having panic attacks."
28542,I'm not on any medication but I have talked to therapist for awhile about it and my chronic worrying.
28543,"After 20 minutes of going back and forth he got frustrated, prescribed me adderall for ADD, and told me I would just have to live with the anxiety then because he wouldn't consider any other medication."
28544,"Tried escitalopram (generic for Lexipro), but that medication actually increased the frequency and severity of attacks."
28545,So obviously I came here for help.
28546,"I have severe anxiety, and I really want to overcome it."
28547,I'm pretty sure it stemmed from bullying in middle school.
28548,"I was bullied to the point where I had almost no friends, and I was constantly left out of everything."
28549,"I was so judged during that time that I actually judge myself, I judge myself so badly that I'm afraid to do anything in fear of being judged (ironically)."
28550,"Because of my fears I still have a very small amount of friends, and it's been a while since I've made any new ones."
28551,"I really want to be myself around people, the few friends I have say I'm a great guy, and I really want to show the rest of the world that and not be afraid."
28552,Are there any methods I could use to finally grow out of this?
28553,Are there any medications (over the counter) that could help?
28554,What do I need to do to over come this?
28555,Hi there.
28556,"Ill try not to make this post long, it has been a hard year for me and I think maybe writing it all out will help me."
28557,"If you are willing to read, then thank you :)

I've always been a little anxious, but nothing too extreme, no panic attacks, and nothing crippling enough that it was ruining any aspect of my life."
28558,"Around 2 years ago I started feeling a little different, that being I would just have random bouts of vertigo, and dizziness."
28559,These increased in frequency to the point where I started to get anxious and distancing myself from friends and activities.
28560,"I went to the eye doctor, and regular doctor but they informed me it was nothing serious."
28561,Months went by and things continually got worse to the point where one day I woke up with such bad vertigo I was unable to even get out of bed.
28562,"This continued on for awhile, and again my doctor did not seemed concerned, he actually thought it was mostly anxiety related and prescribed me cipralex, which did nothing."
28563,Months went by without getting better and finally I was sent to a specialist.
28564,There I was diagnosed with a severe form of something called vestibular neuritis.
28565,"Basically it is severe nerve damage in the inner ear that causes the vertigo, dizziness and nausea."
28566,"Normally it only lasts a few months, but in my case, I may experience symptoms for years."
28567,However I also had excruciating pain around my jaw and ear and was sent to another specialist.
28568,While there I was diagnosed as also having a fractured and dislocated jaw.
28569,No idea how it happened.
28570,And treatment began on that as well.
28571,Which brings me to the present day.
28572,Everyday I still wake up with horrible symptoms and pain.
28573,"Of course anxiety too caused by dealing with these symptoms for almost 2 years total, one year of it being bad."
28574,"One of the problems is that I have an allergy to almost all pain medications, and other medications that the doctors have tried have had horrible side effects where I have to stop taking the meds, these mostly being anti depressants."
28575,"I always wake up overwhelmed, and I am not able to have any quality of life."
28576,"I only see few of my friends, I am one class away from getting a degree and I cannot even finish."
28577,I just feel that I will never get better.
28578,"Ontop of this my symptoms and anxiety have given me depersonalization/derealization, and as well insomnia."
28579,"Everything was going good for me, I had a good job, getting almost 4.0 in school and almost ready to graduate."
28580,Now it feels as though just getting through the day is an accomplishment.
28581,Does anyone have any tips for me?
28582,Things I can occupy myself doing to not think about this very much?
28583,"I just feel very alone as I have not seen a majority of my friends since this all started, I feel like I have very few people I can talk to at a time when I could really use someone."
28584,Is anyone willing to just talk and be a friend?
28585,"I prefer maybe a female, but I wont be picky."
28586,"Add me on kik, same username as this."
28587,As a thanks for reading heres a smile from me: [Hi!
28588,](http://i.imgur.com/Xll8LgV.jpg)
28589,"I am 22 and was diagnosed with GAD around 16, and have been on and off medication, mostly off for the last few years."
28590,Have any of you ever had this immediate of a reaction to meds?
28591,"I am on a trip and before I came, I asked my doctor if there was any medication I could take to take the edge off, as it is a business trip."
28592,"He saw that I had a lot of gas, so he gave me some medicine for the intestines, as well as some medicine for my liver, since he found some fat, although he says that it's expected for my change of lifestyle."
28593,I've been on a variety of SSRIs and talked to therapists but I am currently off of any medication or therapy.
28594,Is it worth sticking it out or did you find switching meds helped?
28595,Currently on some anxiety medication that is not helping in one aspect of my life that seems to still be drowning me and that's my irritability.
28596,General background info:  I'm a 21-year-old female with general anxiety and major depressive disorder.
28597,"Currently in the process of finding therapy for an (doctor's words:) ""unspecified mood disorder"" and coping mechanisms."
28598,"The medications I'm currently taking are Paroxetine, Gabapentin (for sleep), and Vitamin D. I currently have Medi-Cal and am residing in California, US."
28599,I recently started to become more prone to extremely bad anxiety attacks.
28600,"They can be caused by seemingly little things: a tone of voice leading to a heavy sigh due to my actions, hearing a joke made in bad taste (about rape, abuse, etc), receiving a bad phone call from one of my parents... Or general periods in time in which I think extensively about my rapist/past abusers (a habit I've since made myself stop)."
28601,"(Quick note: I recently found out I was raped and there are people picking ""sides"" as to who is ""innocent"" in all of this."
28602,The fact that they're doing this at all is completely disgusting to me but I've found solace in the people who have supported me thus far.)
28603,I've also jumped at the slightest sound (multiple times in a day) or even someone innocently touching my shoulder.
28604,The most recent panic attacks have had me completely uncontrollable of my hands.
28605,It started out where I would quickly and harshly wring my fingers and wrists to the point where I was afraid I would break bones.
28606,The fact that I had no control over my hands or body would lead me into further panic mode.
28607,"I would spend an hour or two trying desperately to stop my hands from doing what they were doing, yet wasn't able until I did one of two things: had my boyfriend draw up a bath for me and sit with me while I lay in the hot water, or pet cats."
28608,Because cats.
28609,"The last attack, however, being 2 days ago, had me self-harming."
28610,I've never intentionally self-harmed.
28611,"I felt that I was in such emotional agony that my hands would rip large sections of my hair out, and the physical pain it caused somehow gave me temporary relief from the emotional pain I felt."
28612,"I wretched and screamed in agony while my hands flopped around finding things to mess with: my hands would hit my face, legs, stomach, chest, and scratch and claw at any skin left visible."
28613,I have noticeable scratches and bruises I'm embarrassed to walk out in public with.
28614,I've never in my life had such harsh symptoms as these until 2-3 months ago.
28615,"I've dissociated on and off for the past year, but this feels different."
28616,"I still feel in-body, yet my hands, and sometimes legs, don't?"
28617,It's like they belong to someone else.
28618,"The doctor prescribed me Gabapentin for ""restless leg syndrome"" (the ""restlessness""/not being able to control my body carries over into my sleep unless I take the medication)."
28619,I've had sleepless nights for 3-4 days straight before I started regularly taking Gabapentin.
28620,"Now, my questions: does anyone know what causes this, aside from extreme anxiety?"
28621,"Since I'm on my way to (hopefully) regular and consistent therapy, is there anything I can do to tide myself over until then?"
28622,"Has anyone else experienced this, and to what severity?"
28623,I'll be on the thread if anyone has any further questions for me to answer.
28624,"so basically I need the opinion of others who are going through similar things as me, because at this point I don't know where else to turn to."
28625,I've been dealing with severe general anxiety disorder since high school (I'm now almost 25) and been on medications for almost 10 years.
28626,I'm currently trying to find a medication that doesn't make me feel like a complete sleepy zombie.
28627,"I just weened off of cipralex as it was making it impossible for me to lose any weight (sounds crazy) but I am doing boot camp kettle bell classes now, and a lot of high intensity training and cardio / this is the most active I've been in years and yet my weight won't budge / I am still the heaviest I've been in years."
28628,Weight gain + lack of ability to lose weight = feeling crummy about myself = depression turns on full force.
28629,"Anyways, my psychiatrist just recently put me on the med ""pristiq"" which is claimed to have little to no side effects and is an SNRI which mainly focuses on anxiety treatment (as opposed to SSRIS) &amp; coming through coming onto the med my body has been acting a tad crazy / I feel even more mental."
28630,This may sound completely bonkers but I have had this severe burning / itching sensation on the top of my scalp for the past 2 weeks (that's how long I've been taking the new med) pharmacist says it could be an allergic reaction but said it would subside once my body was used to it.
28631,I also feel as though my hair is thinning.
28632,I could just be super worried about it as losing my hair is also a massive fear of mine.
28633,Anyways that is my current mental health / med update.
28634,"But I want to know, what meds have you guys tried to treat anxiety/ what do you find works best."
28635,I've come to the realization that no meds is not an option for me as my anxiety is just too bad for me to deal with on my own without this as a crutch/ help.
28636,sos Sos someone tell me I'm not completely crazy.
28637,I've had stomach issues since I was a kid.
28638,"I'm 33 now, and I've seen my family doctor off and on, but the last 18 months or so I've been seeing a psychiatrist."
28639,"He says that my problems are caused by my stress and anxiety, and we've tried a lot of different medications (several SSRIs, Buspar, Lamictal, Ativan, Ritalin, Strattera, etc."
28640,"), but nothing seems to help."
28641,"I don't doubt that I have some anxiety issues, and there's a complicated connection between physical symptoms and the mind, but I've tried a lot of things to get better and I haven't had much success, so I still feel like there must be some underlying physical ailment."
28642,"My family doctor says I likely produce excess adrenaline and that causes my problems like fatigue, congestion, dizziness, nausea, constipation, and headaches, but he's never suggested that it's a condition that would require treatment beyond exercise."
28643,Over the last few years I've lost over 100 pounds (down to 140) and exercise hasn't seemed to really fix the issues either.
28644,"I have to imagine this is a pretty common occurrence for people with anxiety, but how do you eventually get past it?"
28645,Do you just keep asking for tests to be run to eliminate all physical ailments until all you're left with is anxiety?
28646,"I should mention that I never have negative thoughts or emotions, other than just general disappointment at not feeling well, and the few anxiety attacks I've had have all been following stomach issues, not preceding them."
28647,"My symptoms also seem to come in waves, I'll be fine for a week or two, then have a week or two of problems, and cycle on and off like that."
28648,Any suggestions or advice?
28649,I got perscriptions for medication but the side effects were too risky for me.
28650,"I'm a big worrier, I'm not on meds and I think I'm slowly improving."
28651,I recently upped my medication dosage and I feel like things are just getting worse overall (been close to a month on the new dosage).
28652,So I finally bit the bullet and decided to try medication for my anxiety after getting sent home for having a panic attack for absolutely no reason.
28653,"I'm at the point now, where I'm considering medication."
28654,"Has anyone of you been in the same situation, tried medication and found that it made things easier?"
28655,What medication?
28656,"I'm now 22, and it hasn't gone away, despite sporadic counselling and medication."
28657,"I'm already taking more anxiety medicine than I have in months, and I still keep finding myself on the edge of breaking down."
28658,Compared to only 25% less on meds.
28659,"(The tests were taken over the course of one summer, June with no medication (control), July with prescribed anxiety meds, August with THC) 

And though I've only had alcohol once, I felt more open, I talked to people I barely knew, I started conversations."
28660,"Granted, I was better prepared since I was on medication, I still took it fairly hard."
28661,"I need to change my meds, and just really think about things."
28662,[Here's the original post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/137ylo/started_antianxiety_medication_yesterday_to_help/).
28663,Hey everybody.
28664,"About 3 years ago now (almost to the date, I believe!"
28665,"), I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder."
28666,"My depressive cycles have always been excruciatingly long, and now that I think about it, they're all based off of my anxiety about one thing or the other."
28667,"My ""manic"" episodes are periods of not having this anxiety, thus being more risky than usual and blahblahblah."
28668,I've been reading on this subreddit that it's normal to go through phases of being overly anxious and being fine.
28669,"Right now, I've been having absolutely horrible social anxiety and paranoia (related to social activities as well as others), so this has been the main concern with my treatment for my bipolar disorder."
28670,"However, since my diagnoses, my doctor's and I haven't been able to find a medication/combo that has had any effect on me."
28671,"My next appt with my doctor is on Thursday, should I bring this subject up with her?"
28672,Could I suggest medications that are more directly aimed towards anxiety?
28673,"I know that doctors are sometimes a bit hesitant to prescribe these meds, out of fear of the patients abusing/selling."
28674,I'd honestly appreciate any input you have.
28675,Thank you in advance!
28676,I didn't take my anxiety meds (klonopin) today.
28677,I just turned eighteen a month ago so now I stay at my house and watch all my acquaintances having the time of their life for senior year while I wait for medication to kick in so I can get my GED and then get a job and live in the real world because now that I'm eighteen my mom's made it pretty clear I have to get a job or move out.
28678,I took my meds.
28679,"Without meds, I don’t see myself going to a doctor."
28680,Then in March/April things got better after I started taking meds (sertraline).
28681,"I stopped taking meds during the summer and things seemed to be fine, but now that I got back to school, I'm not doing so well anymore."
28682,"Anyway, should I start taking meds again?"
28683,"I was put on different types of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, anxiety medication, and add medication since that time until a little before I graduated college over 3 years ago."
28684,"She seems to feel much better with medicine and talking with therapist, and we're talking more after many months of a lot of stress, but it's only been about a week and a half since she's been on Paxil."
28685,While taking the z-pack I have been unable to take either of my meds because it interacts with the antibiotic but I have severe nausea and have felt dizzy/lightheaded.
28686,"I want to stop taking this antibiotic, I know my doctor and probably everyone else would say to finish the treatment but if I can't take my nausea meds along with it, I'm not going to be able to handle how I feel."
28687,Should I just wait and see if I still feel sick after the meds are out of my system?
28688,"I'm not opposed to meds at all, but I definitely want to get into some counselling."
28689,"I got a facebook message from a super close friend of mine, it was a group message explaining how she had had an awful time recently, been taken off all her meds and told her various disorders were up to her to fix as she's 'an adult now'

I called her non stop, convinced my heart was going to explode from the stress of not knowing what was going on."
28690,"She ended up eventually answering me and I calmed her down enough to get her to tell me where she was and what she'd done, turned out she'd managed to take all her medication (which is quite a bit and includes some rather nasty anti-psychs) without anyone in her house noticing."
28691,What meds can I take that will curb this social anxiety?
28692,"So my question is, should I bother with trying to go to the doctors to get medication?"
28693,"It hasn't lasted for too long, and I sound like a total bitch for whining about it, but I can't control it, and I can't let it control my life... To me this is a really strange thing to want, because I usually try not to take more medicine than I have to, just because I like to see myself as stronger than what I am (obviously)."
28694,"Having both at the same time is extremely difficult and tiring to deal with, and even though I'm on medication and seeing a counsellor I'm still having some pretty rough days."
28695,"but I feel like with these kinds of meds, placebo effect can be huge."
28696,"When I started the meds I felt like I was really prepared to ""fight this thing"" and just go fullspeed into recovery, like the meds were my weapon and I was just gonna beat this fucker."
28697,So I feel like I was riding on a lot of optimism and formed a bunch of good habits while I got adjusted to the meds.
28698,"Also, the meds have done nothing to combat my OCD (skin picking) and I even feel like that might be worse than before."
28699,"All of this is very hard to examine rationally because I feel like I can't really even compare to how things were prior to starting the meds, as I have been changing and evolving in different ways and it's hard to remember what my state of mind used to be like even if I can remember events."
28700,So I know my doctor is the only one who can give me an opinion on whether I need to switch my meds or whatever.
28701,"But I was wondering if anyone here had a similar experience with meds, if they tried a different one and got better, or whatever perspective you might have."
28702,First things first - I'm mid 30's male on no medication.
28703,I'm also really concerned about how suddenly the medication has stopped being effective.
28704,"Has anyone else had a similar experience, or felt like their medication had just one day stopped working?"
28705,I'm a first year PhD student in a very prestigious lab.
28706,"I've struggled with anxiety my whole life, especially related to school."
28707,"I've seen multiple therapists, tried various medications."
28708,"I think I finally have some of my anxiety under control, but I have my days...

My biggest issue right now is research (surprisingly not homework, like it was last semester)."
28709,I just can't concentrate enough to do anything.
28710,"Because it IS research, it's never been done before and I don't even know where to start."
28711,I have so much anxiety about my research that I don't even do it - I spend all day browsing the internet.
28712,"I try to come up with excuses to not go into the lab, and count down the hours until I leave."
28713,Everyone else in the lab seems to do great work and I feel like I'm not doing anything.
28714,"I can't really tell my adviser, ""I have anxiety."""
28715,What grad student doesn't?
28716,"It's not that I can't do the work intellectually, I just can't do it mentally/emotionally."
28717,"When I work, I think I do decent work, I just have trouble doing it."
28718,I really love what I do - I just wish I could do it.
28719,Any advice?
28720,My parents weren't happy with me taking medication so we never went back.
28721,My final issue is I don't want to go to the doctors only to be prescribed with medication.
28722,"(I can do math the next morning, couldn't after taking a Xanax to sleep)

I know you can go to some shady fly by night doctor and get a script in DC, but I'd rather find a psychiatrist who I will actually see on an ongoing basis, who is supportive of me wanting to take whatever medicine helps me best, and who can liase with a therapists in the same practice."
28723,I don't want to go back on the medication and retaper off either.
28724,Should I try getting medication?
28725,"When you know that a brain needs at least 5 hours a day of sleep, you can easily imagine that this finished at the hospital, imploring the urgency doctors ""I just want to sleep...""
5 days of hard medication in the hospital later (with huge doses of anxiolytics, antidepressent and sleep inhibitor), I felt a little better and take all my time to sleep."
28726,So my POV is this; I'd rather live a decent life on meds (either benzo's or AD's) than being completely lost from this world right?
28727,"I can't live the rest of my life feeling like this...

TL;DR: Got diagnosed GAD, therapy+medicine didnt help, cant deal with endless dissociation, derealization, negative feelings of detachment and paranoia, becoming depressed, dont know what to take/do"
28728,I just don't really want to start out trying to fix this with meds.
28729,Docs on it but thinks its anxiety + meds (getting off klonopin but ive been on half a pill for a long time i dont think its that) but I dont know.
28730,"I've tried medication in the past, and with a very sensitive stomach, I'm looking to try to stay on the natural side of things to resolve my issues."
28731,"I'm out of anxiety meds and won't be able to pick any up for a while, ~~constantly feel like puking~~,  haven't slept in the past 47 hours, ~~diarrhea has kicked in~~... Just feel like eternal shit and I *hate* myself for it."
28732,"For those of you who do *not* take medication, or those who do, has keeping a journal been beneficial to you?"
28733,"I wish I had medication or SOMETHING to help me cope but I have nothing except for SI, which is how I used to cope, but my therapist doesn't want me doing that anymore."
28734,"I'm very afraid that this is a temporary issue caused by PMS or PMDD, so I don't understand why she put me on a long term medication for something that will end up being temporary."
28735,"Other times that I can't talk myself down, I'll take one of my xanax pills, but they don't work immediately, and I'm prepared for pure hell until my medication starts to kick in."
28736,I'm convinced it is the acid medication and there's something different going on with my stomach.
28737,I'd use [antihistamines](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/common-anticholinergic-drugs-like-benadryl-linked-increased-dementia-risk-201501287667) to sleep and [benzodiazepines](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/benzodiazepine-use-may-raise-risk-alzheimers-disease-201409107397) for situational anxiety.
28738,Both are connected to Alzheimer's and dementia.
28739,Suddenly taking medications to alleviate anxiety are CAUSING me anxiety.
28740,There is no way to win.
28741,I need some advice from people who have taken this medication.
28742,"So I'm off of my medication cold turkey and I was wondering, to others who have been on Effexor/Venlafaxine, how long did you personally have to deal with the withdrawal symptoms?"
28743,I have two questions: the medication can be habit forming.
28744,I think I need medication.
28745,I feel like my meds aren't working.
28746,I've been on meds since uh... November?
28747,Today I decided not to take my meds.
28748,Why do I feel like everything has lifted off my shoulders with a glass of wine and not with my meds that are supposed to do it?
28749,"I was diagnosed with GAD last spring and have been on medication since, which helped immensely over the summer except for a few occasions."
28750,I’ve been on this medicine for about two weeks.
28751,"He prescribed ""Lyrica"" (pregabalin) and I am taking this medicine every night before sleep, 150 mg, and this relief the symptoms."
28752,"I used to meditate, exercise and all that jazz back when I wasn't on the medicine."
28753,That's one of the reasons I'm considering dropping the medicine because I'm starting to depend on it's effects and became sedentary again.
28754,"She tried everything to get me to not worry about it, but instead I just stopped taking the medication."
28755,My mind hasn't been quite sharp for awhile... why?
28756,"I guess depression and anxiety, but I was fine in high school."
28757,"At the time I was depressed and had a lot on my plate, but I could think fine."
28758,I was on Prozac and Wellbutrin.
28759,Then I stopped taking the medications and was OK for a bit.
28760,Over time my cognitive abilities got worse.
28761,"In college I had a difficult  time, and now it is even worse."
28762,I have a full time job and my mind just feels like it is one of those clouds of dust/dirt when characters in old cartoons get into scuffles.
28763,"I can think internally a bit better, but then it is like my thoughts trail off into nothingness."
28764,I also have a more difficult time conjuring up dialogue for what I want to speak of at times.
28765,"Like, I can hold a conversation, but I KNOW I am so much smarter than my mind is allowing me to be."
28766,Two years ago I had my first panick attack.
28767,Awesome.
28768,"I had a bunch of physical manifestations thereafter, but no one knew anxiety was the cause."
28769,"At the time, two years ago, I was a volunteer firefighter, worked out, and had no fear."
28770,"Well, no fear of anxiety."
28771,"After some time, earlier this year, it flared up."
28772,"I developed agoraphobia to a degree and couldn't go anywhere but work, really."
28773,Super market?
28774,Panick.
28775,Get together?
28776,Panick.
28777,Even having a friend over?
28778,Panick.
28779,"Not over the top panick for everything, but I'd get that dizzy feeking, palpitations and so on."
28780,Since then I've gotten a lot better.
28781,I am on medications  (although I hate to be) and see a therapist weekly.
28782,"I have gone from not being able to see a friend in my own home to going to parties, get together and even the movies again."
28783,"It has been grea, but I feel like there is a lot more improvement to come."
28784,But one thing that has taken a dive is my confidence.
28785,"I was never totally overly confident, but now I feel like I am in shambles."
28786,I was bullied when I was younger and I think that resonates in my mind.
28787,"I try many things, but with my concentration lacking it is hard to truly take in good information and recall it."
28788,"I'm in pretty decent physical shape,  but I feel weak when I talk to others."
28789,"I try and maintain eye contact, but when I cannot really project my thoughts I feel like an idiot and just sit in defeat."
28790,And I've tried concentration medications before.
28791,"I was on Amphetamine Salte, which promoted more anxiety to the point my chest had an incredible amount of pressure."
28792,I tried Strattera and that had the worst sexual side effects ever.
28793,"I've tried natural stuff, and I do take Fish Oil and Vitamin D daily."
28794,Suggestions?
28795,I have recently moved to NYC and started a new job with normal hours (9 to 5 or 6).
28796,"I'm really struggling with anxiety and depression, as I have been for years."
28797,"I've had lots of help in the past with meds and therapy while in HS and college, but nothing has really helped long term except for Welbutrin (which only keeps me from sleeping all day)."
28798,I'm still on my mom's insurance which is kinda shitty but would cover some costs I think.
28799,"I'm low on funds but am reluctant to prioritize my mental health because I have already tried so many medicines, partial hospitalization,  etc."
28800,with little success.
28801,I tried to get involved with a NYC free program from Columbia but they only operate from 9-4.
28802,"I should mention I'm a full time freelancer, not salaried, and this is only my 2nd week there."
28803,My question is: How do you guys get help when you work full time?
28804,Any suggestions for free/cheap help or support in NYC?
28805,Im tired of waiting every day for the moment I can crawl back into bed.
28806,Gunna skip the sob story but hows this medicine supposed to work?
28807,After all these meds I don't feel any different.
28808,"So 5 years ago I had a break down and held my mother with knife ,a year+ ago I stoped taking meds but kept going to theraphy so she wouldnt find out ."
28809,"I've tried a bunch of different medications over the past four years and while I think they help a little on a daily basis, when I'm faced with a trigger I still usually get anxiety attacks."
28810,"I guess I'm wondering if your medication has actually removed 10% of your anxiety, or 90% or whatever."
28811,"I'm not sure if I should be trying a different one, or if this is as good as it gets."
28812,"I want it to stop, I've been on meds before."
28813,"Any drug excluding alcohol (most of the time, lord forbid I get DRUNK) (I am a 2 year recovering addict at least)

Taking medicine."
28814,Not taking medicine.
28815,"I am not prescribed any meds nor taken any (Xanax two times during huge attacks, given by my father who also has anxiety) and don't plan on it."
28816,"I'm not at a point where I need medication, and it's not hampering my ability to function in life but it is bringing my quality of living down periodically."
28817,"I haven't been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but all of those who I confide in say that I should probably talk to a therapist (that costs $$, which I don't have and is the main thing I stress about)."
28818,"Anyways, lately (as in the past couple of months) I have been rubbing my eyes a lot in my sleep."
28819,"I mean I wake up and my eyes are bloodshot, swollen, and throbbing."
28820,"On one occasion I gave myself blisters on the white of my eye which was terrifying, I honestly thought I was going to lose my eyeballs."
28821,The past two days I have woken up rubbing my eyes and all day today my vision has been really cloudy and fuzzy.
28822,"The fuzziness is normal, and it usually goes away within a few minutes after I wake up, but today it hasn't gone away and I have been awake for nearly 12 hours!"
28823,I'm getting scared that I will ruin my vision from this!!
28824,My mom works with kids with learning disabilities (anxiety disorders being some among many she deals with) and she thinks my eye rubbing thing is anxiety-related.
28825,She also told me that I may have to go on medications to get myself to stop.
28826,Any advice/experience with this??
28827,This seems so weird and scary to me and I don't want to ruin my vision while I'm asleep!
28828,P.S.
28829,"I'm 20 F (college student= high stress life), undiagnosed, no meds."
28830,"I'm doing well, and I just started taking medication today."
28831,"If you could leave any stories or perhaps some advice about dealing with my anxiety medication, I'm taking citalopram hydrobromide."
28832,"In trying to help my SO understand what I'm going through, I've been sending my SO tips on dealing with someone with anxiety, as well as the list of side effects of my medication."
28833,I'm seriously thinking about taking some type of medication so I was wondering if anyone else here could tell me about their own experience in order to help better my future decisions.
28834,I miss when i was in the USA :( at least i had a therapist and meds there while here my dad wanna take me to what equivalent of exorcism.
28835,"Hello ,
I don't know where to start, I'm quite An anxious person I always get scared of getting a disease or something For example 

I thought I had a heart attack once and I called the emergency and they came and did all the tests on me and ie was fine ..and same thing the next day .. And later I thought I had cancer Alzheimer's even hammroids and I had a Protected sex and I thought I caught hiv for 2 months I did like 9 tests ..so all this anxiety stopped for a while and then one day I was going to get something from my friends house and all my friends were there and they asked me to chill with them and one of them told me that my ex best friend was there and I didn't go in and drove away and started crying and screaming and at that moment I was like "" omg I think this is a trauma and I'm going psychosis"" and then when I see someone on the street who's psychosis I get anxious and I tell my self ""what if I'm like him"" and I forgot about the whole thing and I was on trip with the fam .. And when I was chilling in front of the TV there were a show where they talked about schiz .."
28836,I had no knowledge of it I thought it's like multiple personality and that night I had thought that I'm scared if I'm going to be another person and kill my family or smth ......
28837,"I told my cousins about my anxiety of it and he started saying a joke  where he talk to me and when I answer he says he didn't say anything  and I ignored and laughed at it at first and later he started doing it again and I got so mad cuz I had enough anxiety already and yelled at him and threw him out (he even told my brother to do that joke but my brother told me ) 

And I searched the symptoms later (which was so stupid thing to do) and since then I'm thinking like something moved in the corner of my eye but there is nothing actually and if I see something like someone walking in the street  I ask the person with me if thy saw it too (and ofc they say yes )) and I'm just scared that I'm going to hear voices or something

And I did read that people with schiz have problem with expressing them self and I have problem when I wanna tell someone about something happend to me I take some times to make good way to tell it in my head and I did read that they feel something is moving on their body and since I did read that I got that feelings 

Since that damm TV show I lost almost 14 pounds and I feeling like I'm gonna throw up a lot  and I spend all my day searching symptoms and remember everything I did before if I did something crazy ..even asked my parents if I have it and they laughed at me but I got so depressed I started crying almost everyday and get that feelings I'm not alive and the whole time I have what if  in my head 


I have a question ..does anxiety lead to schiz ??"
28838,"And if I'm anxious about schiz.. Will that get me the illness 


Too bad there is only 1 therapist in my small city and he has rlly bad reputation 


Plz help me 

I lost my appetite and i feel lightheaded a lot and tension in my neck 

Im 18 and I just graduated high school with rlly good grades and I missed singing up for college because of this anxiety .. God mercy on me 

There is no one that has schiz in my family but only my moms cousin 

And inever used any hallucination drugs or marijuana  I only used medications because I had an injury in my knee like 3 years ago 

My child hood was nice and my parents barley fought but my high school was quite bad because I injuried my knee and withdrawed from sports and I started playing videos games and sit at home most of my team and I was quite sad because I injuried my self and I couldn't workout on my body anymore"
28839,"I do have Hypothyroidism, and I take actively medicine for it every single day, I also have PCOS and take medicine for it, and I get regular blood works done."
28840,I'm too anxious thinking about the surgery so my brain shuts down .
28841,.
28842,.
28843,"I guess I should ask how long the surgery should take, when I can go home, aftercare adivce."
28844,I feel like I'm missing something?
28845,"I know I'll have the Pre operation tests (to make sure I'm healthy for surgery) with the nurses and then on the surgery day the nurses will take my details again, weigh me and discuss the medications they will be giving me."
28846,"I am crazy anxious today, I'm on medication (20mg citalphram) but it doesn't seem to be strong enough usually."
28847,"Before I was on the medicine I used to get this feeling like I was on autopilot but then suddenly I ""took control."""
28848,"I have been on quite a few meds, and some i am still on."
28849,"I'm a 23 year-old male, currently at university."
28850,"In my life, I have experienced normal amounts of anxiety--that is, when I was supposed to."
28851,"However, this has recently changed, and I am scared and confused at how to handle this new change in my mentality."
28852,"I'm not sure when the ""change"" started to occur, it was probably a gradual developmental thing that has progressed over the past few months."
28853,"Looking back to last November, I was completely anxiety-free (with the exception of the ""normal"" anxiousness anyone would get from anxiety-inducing situations)."
28854,"Last march, during spring break, I got sleep deprived and had been getting about three or maybe less hours of sleep per night."
28855,"By the end of the week, I was an anxious mess--I felt all the typical symptoms: hopelessness, dread, urge to have a bowel movement, and sometimes a tightness in the chest."
28856,"When I returned home from said vacation, I basically spent a few weeks recuperating and getting my sleep schedule back on track."
28857,"I am now seeing a psychiatrist who has prescribed Clonazepam, 0.5mg three times a day (once every six hours)."
28858,"I've been on the medication now for about a month and I love it, it effectively eliminates this new ""ambient"" anxiety that I recently started feeling."
28859,"However, I am new to medications in general and am now aware that my body has probably become physiologically addicted to the drug, and I've heard that the withdrawals are going to be intense."
28860,"I do plan on eventually tapering off, and hopefully soon."
28861,Does anyone have any insight on the taper off?
28862,"I've also heard mixed opinions about benzodiazepines--some say they're horrible, some say they're great, and my psychiatrist tells me there's nothing to worry about."
28863,"Still, I am inquisitive about the nature of the drug."
28864,"My psychiatrist diagnosed me with ""episodic mood disorder,"" and had me get a blood test to check my thyroid for any hormonal imbalances."
28865,"When the test came back, I was told that my TSH levels are high (3.9 on some unit scale that I'm not familiar with), which would imply hypothyroidism, which is the opposite of what would be expected since anxiety is usually linked to hyperthyroidism!"
28866,He scheduled me to see an endocrinologist.
28867,"The endocrinologist essentially told me that it's a guess-and-check with thyroid patients and he wants another blood test, which I'm going to get to him as soon as possible (been very busy this week)."
28868,Does anyone else have any insight about the endocrine system and how it could affect the sympathetic nervous system?
28869,"I've read a lot about what anxiety actually is, the ""fight-or-flight"" response, and it's supposed to be mitigated by the parasympathetic nervous system."
28870,"I'm no brain scientist, so that's the extent of my knowledge about it."
28871,"I've started practicing breathing exercises, which helps, but it's not that useful for me because my anxiety is almost perpetually there, in the background (when it's there)."
28872,"Some things I would like to add about my condition that I think are relevant and might help someone here diagnose my problem or perhaps give me some insight:

I sleep at the same time every night for 8-9 hours and have little trouble getting to sleep thanks to Clonazepam (I'm pretty sure)."
28873,"I don't have anxiety for most of the day, it comes primarily at night, like around 6-7pm."
28874,I started lifting weights again a few days ago and I've been weak and having the typical muscle pains associated with working out for the first time in a while.
28875,"I've noticed that in my weakened state, the anxiety is substantially worse, it even comes through the Clonazepam dose."
28876,I'm also scared about the current and eventual side-effects of Clonazepam.
28877,I've almost completely lost my libido and I feel weakened.
28878,"Apparently Clonazepam is metabolized in the liver and has similar effects as alcohol, which would explain both side-effects."
28879,"I'm really scared about the memory-loss that supposed to occur, but that doesn't happen for a while."
28880,Also it should be noted that I've only had one panic attack; it came from smoking a joint (first time in my life) last December.
28881,"Worst feeling ever, felt like I was going to die."
28882,"I haven't had an attack since, but the anxiety is still a lingering thing."
28883,"It comes out of the blue, seemingly completely unrelated to my thoughts at the time."
28884,"Like tonight for instance, I was playing Minecraft and suddenly the anxiety just onset and I lost all interest in what I was doing, started getting that bowel-movement feeling, and am feeling just generally shitty."
28885,"For anyone who read this, I appreciate your time and am thankful for any replies or insight about the matter."
28886,"EDIT:

Thank you all for your support, it has really calmed me down lately and I feel less frustrated and scared about this new condition."
28887,You're all wonderful people!
28888,Which is better?
28889,"I have been seeing my GP and a therapist (LISW), but my therapist's office also has a psychiatrist (MD) on staff."
28890,I had an appointment with my GP today and I don't feel like it went very well.
28891,"He wants me to make some changes in my medications, which I understand, and I do see where he was coming from, BUT I also felt like he wasn't really listening to me very well."
28892,I am not one of those patients who tries to dictate their care but I just am not sure he really understands my issues.
28893,He didn't ask me hardly any questions and I felt like he was a little dismissive.
28894,"I normally really like him and I think he is good and thorough, so maybe he was just having an off day or maybe it was just my perception or...I don't know."
28895,"I am not trying to doctor shop (and I have zero interest in finding a new GP), but I've never been to an actual psychiatrist so I am wondering if they are better or worse as far as really listening to your concerns, previous experiences, and preferences about medications?"
28896,"She felt uncomfortable (she has never liked our debates) so she sulkily said ""You guys are really testing my anxiety medication right now."""
28897,"Td;lr (I think that's right): Time is moving fast, I miss the past and I can't even try and enjoy myself in those ways again due to anxiety and meds."
28898,What other options are there for anxiety meds besides benzos?
28899,"I'm a little skeptical of the efficacy of herbal remedies and supplements, but my doctor recommended that I take passionflower along with my medication."
28900,"A colds going around the office and I tried to get by without meds but I just couldn't do it, but when I do take cold meds and my anxiety pills I get the shakes..."
28901,She is going through depression and taking medicine for it.
28902,"She is not sure whether it is from the depression, or from her medication but she gets extreme anxiety when we are alone in our apartment."
28903,"Description of it matches what I've been experiencing, I've been instructed to carry on with the medication for now."
28904,I'm hoping it will help take the edge off a bit during this transitional period and in a couple of months I can go off from it again and move forwards sans any form of medication.
28905,The reason I went to meds was due to anxiety and the physiological manifestations associated with the anxiety that were hindering my life.
28906,Now you know why I'm on the meds.
28907,How long does it take until my meds kick in?
28908,"I've been trying for years to do non-medicine techniques, but my family and I have made the decision to try zoloft."
28909,"Or worse, what if they're is and they have to pay for outrageously expensive medication?"
28910,Anyone have any suggestions for medication or therapy to help overcome them?
28911,"I do think it's bad that I diagnose myself, but seeing as how somatic disorders are in some grey area between psychological therapy and regular medicine, it's been very hard for me to get any help."
28912,"Should I find another medication, or up my dosage?"
28913,I got this one from a yoga teacher.
28914,"Essentially, just concentrate on trying to make your eyebrows go ""down""."
28915,"Don't stress over it or try to overdo it, just lower your eyebrows a bit."
28916,"Apparently this does a couple things:

1) Something about sympathetic versus parasympathetic nervous system."
28917,I don't know if I buy this one.
28918,"She told me that I could also use my hands to push my forehead down (towards my feet, not in) to make this effect more dramatic."
28919,"2) Makes you slow down your breathing by concentrating on something specific and small, the same way counting or meditation would."
28920,"I don't know if it's just a placebo, but it does seem to do a little bit of something for me (not enough to solve anything, but more than any of the non-addictive medications I've been on have)."
28921,Any thoughts?
28922,"In the last 4 months I feel like I have accomplished a lot, from quitting my anxiety meds to getting a job, and I recently started vocal lessons."
28923,"I've had panic attacks since I was 17, and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder."
28924,"In high school, during stressful times, I would start having trouble breathing, my chest would get tight and I would feel like everything is falling apart."
28925,Well I've dealt with the shortness of breath and now I just completely fall apart mentally.
28926,"I still feel like everything is falling apart, but I also feel like I'm trapt."
28927,"If I'm out anywhere, I immediately want to be home and I just want to cry."
28928,I get extremely irritable or even emotionless.
28929,"I'm a teacher, so this does not work well for me."
28930,Advice?
28931,Are there any medications that I can take when this happens?
28932,Or something I can do to calm myself?
28933,"My boyfriend is really good at calming me down and bringing me out of it, but I can't have him by my side at all times."
28934,Help!
28935,"At one point she mentions that she was on meds during school, as many of us are, and told me she had to get off them, because they made her feel worse and tiresome- I understood and respected this, I'm no expert but if something makes you feel worse than it should, then there's no point suffering, it's obviously not good."
28936,"I felt like I should be honest with her and I came clean to tell her that I take meds myself, well just one- Cymbalta, once a day in the morning, because of debilitating anxieties I had."
28937,"without meds, but anxieties were still a huge fear for me."
28938,"TLDR; told girl who took meds I take meds, she decides it's not okay"
28939,"Just to give a little background information, I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for most of my life, and in the past year (August) I was just prescribed medication to help deal with this situation."
28940,"Basically I take medication in the morning (for anxiety) and medication at night (for depression, it usually knocks me right out)."
28941,"Being that I'm a bit skeptical of psychiatric medication, I chose to ""train"" myself to be able to talk myself down from panic attacks and they eventually went away for a while."
28942,"I expressed my desire to take a ""rescue"" medication on an as needed basis."
28943,I don't want daily medicine.
28944,"Any and all thoughts, opinions, advice on this medicine would be appreciated!"
28945,"My mom has a heart condition and she tells me that before she was diagnosed, she was briefly put on anti-anxiety medication."
28946,"My current prescription will run out, I'll be forced to come off my meds - being treated for depression as well -, I'll be kicked off the list with my psychiatrist for missing 2 appointments in a row (I missed my last one earlier this month because she wouldn't drive me) and... that's it."
28947,First time poster in this subreddit.
28948,I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder and depression when I was 13.
28949,I used to have panic attacks every single night until I finally figured out how to get them under control.
28950,"I always denied medication though because I was afraid that it would change who I am, or make me feel not like myself."
28951,Over the last 5 years I've sort-of learned how to cope with my anxiety/panic disorder and keep myself calm for the most part.
28952,"Anyway, now I live in my own apt with 2 roommates, and my anxiety came back full-force in the past couple months.."
28953,"I was seeing a guy and after he fucked me over I sort of just fell apart, but it's not just from that, I've been stressed out over money and bills and everything going on around me."
28954,"I started having nightly panic attacks again, and when I'm not panicking I'm always depressed."
28955,Anxiety has interfered with my life so bad to the point that I can't even drive my car at night anymore without freaking out (my anxiety gets worse at night.)
28956,"My panic attacks are caused sometimes by being afraid of having panic attacks, if that makes sense."
28957,"I can never sleep, and when I do it's always during the day, I'm always up until 7-9am and I spend all night every night alone shut in my room."
28958,I want to leave my house but when I do I feel anxious and come back home.
28959,"On top of all of this, I have a weird disassociated/disconnected feeling which is really hard to describe.."
28960,"I haven't talked much about it before but it's a really strange feeling, I feel like I'm sort of out of my body, sometimes I'll hear my voice but it seems like someone else said it."
28961,Sort of feels like everything that is happening isn't real.
28962,"I always feel alone, even if I'm around a bunch of people."
28963,I'm always alone.
28964,"I'm going back to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist in a couple weeks, I'm going to try meds because nothing is working and I seriously can't live like this."
28965,It's awful.
28966,I'd like to hear about some medications that worked for other people too.
28967,"ps- I'm sorry this is so long, and I'm sorry if it's really patchy!"
28968,I have a hard time talking about and describing this shit.. but I figure this would be a good place to come talk about it.
28969,edit: accidentally put thread instead of subreddit.. whoops.
28970,"However, it suddenly dawned to me that it was from the meds."
28971,"My psychologist wants to put me on meds, but I've seen anti-anxiety meds do some pretty bad stuff to people."
28972,"I also stopped taking my meds, prozac a couple months ago."
28973,"A week ago I had a panic attack because I thought I was going to have a heart attack because my left arm was tongly and got back on my meds, prozac and klonopin."
28974,I'm on medication and getting therapy and I can honestly say I feel like a different person and those mistakes are all in the past
28975,"So it has been a blessing to find you guys and to realize that I'm not the only person going through this :)Also, before anyone mentions it, I am seeing a psychologist and have an appointment with a psychiatrist to talk about the possibility of meds for my disorder."
28976,been on lots of diff types of meds.
28977,"after a couple months meds stop working so i was thinking about brining it up with my dr. i tried hypnosis before and i don't go under very easy, it takes a long time and I'm only under for like a few mins."
28978,and like i said meds come and go.
28979,"I got a job that I would NEVER have taken (bartending/barbacking) without the medication, and I have a social life now!!"
28980,A little background: I had not been drinking much if at all when i started my medication.
28981,"I didn't take my medication today for the first time ever, because my practice forgot to call in my perscription, so i'm saving my last dose for work on Monday, just in case i can't get the refill tomorrow."
28982,Note that I get these (albeit less frequently) even when I don't drink and do take my medication.
28983,"I really don't want to rely on medication just so I can sleep at night, I'm only 20."
28984,"I was wondering if you have any general, non-specific tips (I.e not ""Take this medicine, and meditate for X hours a day"") that could get her on the right path?"
28985,"Not spam, I don't work for Costco, I just see a lot of people struggling to pay for meds."
28986,They offer these kinds of discounts for most generic meds.
28987,"Target and Walmart do something similar, but Costco is the only place I've found that discounts this many psych meds."
28988,Also should I give ADHD meds a try?
28989,I started taking my meds again on Saturday.
28990,Did you go to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) before you got medication?
28991,How soon into therapy did you get put on medication?
28992,I'm currently about a month into CBT and at today's session my therapist recommended I go on meds.
28993,Obviously it's different for everybody (people who want medication right away vs. people who only use it as a last resort).
28994,"After my anxiety was to the point where I couldn't operate on a day-to-day basis I started on the roller coaster ride of prescription meds, such as : Celexa, Lexapro, amitriptyline, etc."
28995,And I was also still kind of broken from all of the meds I ran through.
28996,and also possibly talk about getting some type of medication for my anxiety as well.
28997,"Up until last year I avoided going on meds and dealt with it by hiding it from everyone and pushing through the episodes (and it was very much episodic for me, triggered by real life events- starting a new job, really bad breakup where I had to basically start my life over, moved to a new city, etc."
28998,"He has had depression and social anxiety pretty severely his whole life, years didn't see anyone or take any meds."
28999,"They put him on 5 or 6 different meds, and I can't remember what they all are, but I know they included wellbutrin and klonopin."
29000,"He spends every day either abusing alcohol, sleeping, or meeting girls from the internet for casual sex (he still has not ejaculated during sex since he started abusing anxiety meds, don't know if this is relevant)."
29001,I don't know if I should start taking the meds again since I'll just be out soon (before I can get insurance back) or if I should space my doses out so I at least have *some* in my system.
29002,"**TL;DR: out of money, out of meds, got some extras from friends, gap in time btw."
29003,"I feel weak that I have this axiety, even though I have good friends who help me, and even my roommate is currently on meds to anxiety as well, he seems to handle it better than me, so i feel weak."
29004,"I just found out I have anxiety (probably through my mom, she even takes meds) because I told her how every morning I feel like throwing up and I almost always have butterflies in my stomach, I'm always tensed up."
29005,I was initially quite positive about the idea of taking medication to hopefully change my life but now that I've finally got the medication in hand I'm scared to take it.
29006,I know I am sick as wouldn't have all these appointments and therapy sessions and I certainly wouldn't be starting meds if I wasn't.
29007,I spoke to the doctor and my therapist about these feelings breifly and they reassured me to try the medication and see how my progress goes while continuing therapy.
29008,I'd also like to hear how people felt just before starting meds for the first time.
29009,I told her I thought it was the medication but she said it was a symptom of my anxiety.
29010,I think i would as I have been on medication before and am seeing a therapist.
29011,"its like before i started the meds, im having terrible anxiety right now, is this normal."
29012,However the one thing that keeps me in this loop is my fear of medication.
29013,"I want to get better so bad, but I am scared of the side effects of meds."
29014,"I see a psychiatrist who wants me to take meds again, but I didn't do too well the last time I tried them."
29015,"I desperately want to get better, but my anxiety is stopping me from taking the meds."
29016,"The medicine makes it more manageable, but its really all coming down to how I handle my thoughts."
29017,"I spent the next 2 years hopping through different meds, eventually ending up on citalopram, where I am now."
29018,I took 20mg for about 4 months and am now weaning off it because I'm sick of my meds giving me side effects.
29019,"In these 6 years, I've never been without medication."
29020,I'm a little curious as to what it's going to be like transitioning from this to medication-free.
29021,"I'm not taking anxiety medication, because I haven't had my first counselling session yet (19 days!"
29022,Just an FYI to always check your meds for possible side effects-my anxiety levels this summer have been skyrocketing and I had no idea why.
29023,"I had successfully weaned myself off anxiety meds (SSRI's, with the help of a doctor) last year and was seriously considering going back on them when I saw something I think on this sub -but possibly another one- about Topomax, which I had been put on in May for migraines."
29024,"Just a heads up that sometimes a benign medication (honestly, I had asked to be prescribed it because it also aids in weight loss) can be exacerbating your anxiety."
29025,Finally found some good medication and I was feeling the greatest I have felt in years.
29026,I thought medication was supposed to stop this.
29027,"I ended up leaving my friends house to go home and take an anti-anxiety medication, and on the way out I began dry heaving and vomiting."
29028,"I ended up on Effexor which worked great, but i hated the medication."
29029,"So when I went back on meds, the prozac, I wanted to make sure that was working and so I stopped taking Xanax."
29030,I ended up having an attack right after and freaked out because I thought it was a reaction to the meds.
29031,"I've been medication free for over half a decade now, recently (several months now) due to a whole bunch of stuff I just don't want to get into."
29032,"I've got a general feeling of anxiety usually for several hours a day, sometimes mounting to minor-to-moderate panic attacks."
29033,"Just to cover my bases, I'm already watching my diet, I've cut way back on caffeine, I've almost entirely cut out alcohol (socially having a beer every now and then)."
29034,"I also have begun supplementing magnesium, calcium and taking D and B complex, and I do try to exercise and  meditate daily, but it's hard when you're feeling like garbage and/or panicky most of the time."
29035,"Given past experience I feel I could kick the cycle if I can reduce or eliminate panic attacks for a week or two; I don't have the option to just not go to work/deal with life, so I think I might need chemical assistance for this."
29036,Can anybody tell me about their experiences with short-term/as-needed medications?
29037,"I don't want to just drug the problem away, however other options just have not worked."
29038,"My family has all sorts of mental problems - my brother is diagnosed bipolar, yet refuses to go to therapy or take medication for it."
29039,I feel sometimes judged and looked down on in my family for doing therapy and now medication at all - but at the same time I'm the *only fucking one* in the family that seems to actually be seeking help to overcome this.
29040,"After years of anxiety and a recent state of dizziness, nervousness, loss of train of thought, my doctor and I decided to try medicine."
29041,"I slowly tapered off of that and I've been medication-free for coming close to 6 months, and while I'm ""functional"", I'm definitely slowly moving back towards my old anxiety riddled self so I caved and made an appointment with my doctor."
29042,"A few things have kept me from seeking treatment--feeling like I might not be taken seriously, fear of medication side effects, inertia...Has anyone else had similar experiences?"
29043,"Anyone else have these issues, related to anxiety, anxiety/depression medication, sleep medication, or caffeine use?"
29044,"I have been trying to get off my medicine (fluoxetine, 20mg daily) for a few months now but keep returning to it."
29045,I feel like i'm not who I am supposed to be when i'm on my medication.
29046,"I take a medication every night, and as a PRN."
29047,"I was prescribed 25mg but I had a panic attack before taking the medicine because I thought it might be too powerful, so I cut the pill in half."
29048,"Edit: I should also mention, I forgot to take my meds yesterday and sunday, but have gone much longer without them before (not on purpose)."
29049,This may get long.
29050,My mom has both anxiety and depression.
29051,"She is medicated for both, but always takes less than her doctor prescribes because she is worried she will become addicted to her medications."
29052,She also sees a psychologist.
29053,My mom is very kind and I love her very much.
29054,"She is extremely afraid of driving, even if the destination is 15 minutes away."
29055,"She will try and manipulate me into driving her instead of driving herself, even telling me I'm a horrible person, should be ashamed, etc."
29056,(lashing out).
29057,She started therapy with a nice lady that we found through her insurance.
29058,I met her once and said I believe there's much more going on than a fear of driving and that's only how it's manifesting.
29059,I have not seen this woman with my mother since that first visit.
29060,"She tells my mom to do nice stuff for herself, visit with her friends, get her nails done, just do stuff for her that she likes."
29061,My mom won't do it.
29062,I think she lies to her and says she does.
29063,"She makes excuses as to why she can't and instead has to take care of other family members (they also have disorders, but not generalized anxiety disorder)."
29064,I don't know what to do to help her.
29065,She has no desire to do much of anything really besides talk about how awful she feels everything is and sleep.
29066,"I feel like I can't really do anything for her, and that she has to deal with it or magically something will change."
29067,"I basically feel like as much as I love her, I can't help her."
29068,I feel...lost.
29069,TL;DR I love my mom and I don't now how to help her anymore.
29070,I went to the doctor &gt; referred to psych &gt; feel much better now thanks to modern medicine.
29071,"It was for OCD like touching something twice because it felt ""right"" or something and the meds were supposed to help with the anxiety part I guess if I didn't do my OCD."
29072,"im not embarrassed, or scared so i dont know what the fuck is going on and its pissing me off i am no way going back on any meds."
29073,"I just don't know what to do, I think i should talk to a therapist or get some medication."
29074,"I'm in therapy but not currently on medication, as most of them seemed to make it worse and according to two different psychiatrists I've tried just about all the medication options."
29075,"Thank you for taking the time to read this and if you have any suggestions, ideas, things to try - things that don't involve medicine - it would be great."
29076,Do I need medication?
29077,"I had issues with panic attacks when I was in college, was on a one a day medication I believe Paxil or Paroxotine for a about a year."
29078,Once I started feeling fine I weened of the medication.
29079,Just talked to my doctor the other day about being put on medication for anxiety and she recommended Celexa.
29080,Perhaps I should have my medication increased....
29081,"I've been on meds for the anxiety, but I can see the sleepless night coming already."
29082,"And on top of that, the meds I've been using for the last 8 years?"
29083,I ironically have anxiety about taking anxiety medication so I don't want to know anything that could make me scared to take it.
29084,"I would get medication, but my mom doesn't want me on pills for it, and she deals with my insurance so I can't get pills behind her back."
29085,The daydreams are making me so upset that I might take medicine and just sleep the rest of the day but I have obligations to take care of before I leave.
29086,My worst fear is that I come off these meds and the LES pain comes back like it was.
29087,"When I started my job as a pharmacy tech a few months ago, I was told we would rotate stations every few hours."
29088,"I thought I could power through a couple of hours at the register, and then relax a little when in the back at production or when inputting data where prescriptions are dropped off."
29089,That would have been nice.
29090,"Instead, I'm stuck at the registers for 8 to 10 hours at a time."
29091,Trying to calm people when the price of their medicine has changed or when we don't have something ready for them the moment they step up to the counter.
29092,People blowing up because their medicare copay is fifty cents instead of free.
29093,"Adults that don't understand that if their insurance expired on the 31st of last month, that filling something on the 2nd of this month won't be covered."
29094,People who snatch things out of my hands so they can read the labels and then question every little detail.
29095,It doesn't help that I'm not actually a medical or pharmacy student; So I really don't know much about the medicines themselves or about insurance matters.
29096,"While growing up, I would develop a stutter during stressful situations."
29097,It was enough to cause a distraction or to allow people to talk over me.
29098,Did wonders for my inferiority complex and general anxiety.
29099,I worked on it for **years**.
29100,Eventually I got to where I only have a slight stutter while very tired.
29101,"Whelp, not anymore."
29102,"Thanks to my coworkers Never switching stations and my boss always putting me down for register duty, the Stutter is coming back."
29103,"I've asked to switch or be assigned somewhere else at the start of my shift, but no sympathy from them."
29104,And it's not just at work.
29105,I've noticed my stutter the last couple of weeks most everywhere I interact with people.
29106,So something I've worked on controlling since I was twelve years old has been undone by work in just a couple of months.
29107,I really feel like I have to do something with all the thoughts swimming around in my head and I haven't the motivation to write it down in my journal and I do not see any benefit in typing it out in a word document and then never looking at it again.
29108,"Briefly worth mentioning I moved to Canada from London, UK when I was 16."
29109,**You might like to just read the bold stuff down bottom.
29110,"**

I was doing well."
29111,"Age 19 was my finest year because I came from an anxious, blubbering, overweight wreck and I ended the year as a confident man-thing."
29112,I got to where I was mainly through inspired moments of exposure which showed me that my anxiety cannot kill me as well as some help from a somewhat pathetic 75mg dosage of Zoloft that I took daily.
29113,"I did CBT but I remember nothing of it, largely because the process started when I was 17 and so I was not afforded much time to develop any skills since they kicked me out of child psychiatry at age 18."
29114,I was offloaded to another man but I could not learn from him or be truthful with him because it was my weight above anything that made me miserable and he was morbidly obese.
29115,Also the amount he was paid per hour was the exact same amount that I live off per week which just seemed immoral.
29116,"Then I did some teenage things, had a girlfriend, collapsed miserably when it was over, gained more weight (still 18 at this point) and made myself into the ultimate recluse."
29117,"Basically lived off Dr Pepper, grilled cheese, pasta and bacon for a year."
29118,Then I was 19 and still had a year of high school to get through which I attempted and failed at on day one which meant I had a whole year to do shitty online courses and figure out how to become a less pathetic blob of anxiety.
29119,Over the course of a year I ignored all of my courses (until the last couple of months which were so stressful I nearly died) and just focused on weight loss.
29120,I went from an estimated 230 pounds to 140 over the course of 9 months and I wound up being quite attractive.
29121,I made a friend from Reddit who lives in Germany who helped me to tease me out of my recluse status.
29122,She's actually coming to Canada to attend the same University as I do next year which will be so bizarre considering she's one of my best friends and I've never actually met her.
29123,Anyway.
29124,At this point I am 20 and am finishing up my first year at the University of Toronto.
29125,It has been a year filled with alcohol mostly and some assignments slotted in when necessary.
29126,I've spent most of the time hiding how horribly anxious I've been about the whole experience from everyone so that I may gain a fresh start without being known as a little anxious shrew of a boy.
29127,The beginning of University was remarkably good and I did so many things that had everyone thoroughly impressed and intrigued.
29128,One trouble that had struck me throughout this time however was my total sexual indifference and so I decided to get off the Zoloft because I was becoming increasingly resentful of SSRI's and their side-effects and quit rapidly beginning in January and finally quitting it entirely on the 1st of March.
29129,I have since felt such heightened anxiety that I have found it painful to function as I previously had.
29130,On Monday of this week I deferred 3 of my exams and gathered and submitted all of the relevant documentation before I had even given myself a chance to understand why I was doing it.
29131,The anxiety was so intense that I really felt like I had no control over what I was doing in the moment.
29132,I let the Doctor prescribe me two different medications: 150mg of Bupropion daily (to be increased to 300mg on Monday) and 50mg of Trazodone each night to help me sleep in the meantime but I hate how it makes me feel so I have stopped taking the latter of the two.
29133,Neither of them are SSRIs and are supposed to have the opposite effect on one's libido.
29134,**Does anyone have any experiences with bupropion (wellbutrin) and if so how has it impacted your anxiety?
29135,I know there are lots of threads about it across Reddit but I feel like the people of this sub will give me the exact sorts of answers I'm looking for.
29136,"**

**Thanks for reading**."
29137,I stopped taking meds about 4 years ago (before I moved to the USA) and my depression still rears it head occasionally but it is not really an issue.
29138,Does anyone know if there any meds out there that I can even take if I were to become pregnant/had experience with this?
29139,I do have anxiety and take medication as needed (Xanax 1 mg).
29140,"Hi everyone, I don't post here often but I do lurk, and consult reddit for a lot of first hand experience on things."
29141,"I suffer from gerenalized anxiety, only ever consulted my General Practitioner about it."
29142,"SSRI's have never helped me, so I took it on myself to look for other ways to manage it I've been doing a pretty good job up until recently (stop excerising as much, stop taking supplements, having tummy troubles) because I've gotten really overwhelmed with school."
29143,So I started up taking St. John's Wort again.
29144,"I'm not on ANY other medications, I have a mirena IUD as birth control."
29145,I've researched it a lot and I'm curious to know other experiences with it.
29146,I have taken it in the past and generally it does make a difference.
29147,"It takes just the right amount of edge off for me to deal with things that would have normally set me off into an attack or tears, but I have no idea if it's a placebo effect or not."
29148,My concern I come to you all with is if you have ever experienced any negative side effects.
29149,"For me it seems to upset my stomach, and sometime bad diarrhea or gas."
29150,I like that it helps me but these side effects make it almost not worth taking.
29151,Perhaps I'm not getting it from the right source?
29152,Right now I just have the generic Kroger brand.
29153,Maybe someone could recommend a good brand.
29154,I take 1 pill once a day and the pills are 300mg or 0.3% hypercin standardized extract.
29155,TL;DR: Tell me your positive/negative experiences with St. John's wort and any side effects you experienced.
29156,How long did you take it and what brand was it?
29157,"Hi I was just wondering about medicines and such for treating anxiety , what exactly does it do to someone and are there any long term/short term side affects to taking the medicine?"
29158,I'm considering going to my doctor to discuss it I was just wondering if anyone had any opinions on the matter?
29159,Any success stories with this medication?
29160,"I just wanted to know if anyone here overcame anxiety with meds, how they changed after it."
29161,I seem completely normal the majority of the time.
29162,"I'm intelligent, charismatic, and hard working when I'm doing well."
29163,But I can't seem to keep it up.
29164,"In my adult life, I haven't managed to go more than a few months at a time before having an episode that affects my work performance."
29165,"I'm diagnosed with Boderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar II, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD."
29166,"I seem to be right on the line between functional, and disabled."
29167,I'm currently employed at a summer seasonal job for the 2nd year in a row.
29168,"It's a stressful job to start with, but I also work longer hours, and have more responsibility this year."
29169,"About a month ago, I lost an immediate family member, and all of my problems at at their peak."
29170,"I can tell I'm on the verge of a breakdown, and I need to change something."
29171,I've been trying various medications and therapies since I was 13 years old.
29172,"I'm 26, and still sick."
29173,What kind of work is well suited for an emotionally unstable person?
29174,"Also, should I be seeing a Psych in addition to the medication or wait until it takes effect (hopefully)?"
29175,I get these infrequently and I'm not on meds.
29176,Hi all- so here's the thing.
29177,One of my biggest anxieties is over taking new medications.
29178,"It doesn't matter if it's something I have to have (antibiotics for an infection for example), it doesn't matter if I've taken it before without problem, I still have a really hard time and basically have to FORCE myself to take any medications."
29179,I seriously don't even take ibuprofen when I need it.
29180,I have had a pretty rough past with medications for anxiety and depression.
29181,Effexor left me completely incapable of moving (I just laid there numb and couldn't move for like 2 weeks it took all my energy to get up and pee) Zoloft made me worse.
29182,Celexa stopped working after a few years and then was incredibly hard to get off.
29183,Prozac made my anxiety worse than it's ever been.
29184,So now my doctor wants me to start Paxil.
29185,I am terrified.
29186,All the what-ifs are going through my mind.
29187,I am frozen with terror at taking a new one- but I know that doing nothing isn't helping me at all.
29188,Any commiseration?
29189,Any suggestions for getting past this kind of anxiety?
29190,I have had the perscription for over a week and I haven't bene able to bring myself to take it.
29191,Does anyone have experience with getting off of medication?
29192,"The one doctor that prescribed me this medication was a doctor that would prescribe ANYTHING, which I felt was dangerous and scary."
29193,"I do see her point in staying on the medication for longer-- she wants her child (I'm well in my 20s, lol) to not suffer more than they have."
29194,"She also says she wants me to see the doctor that prescribed me the medication in the first place, but man, let me tell you, that doctor is nuts."
29195,"I guess overall, all I really need is reassurance that it is OKAY to start to go back to a life without medication."
29196,I personally don't know anyone (or anyone that has talked to me about this) that has gotten off of medication and that has conquered anxiety/depression.
29197,I really do feel like I'm at that point where I will be successful without medication.
29198,"I partly just wanted to rant and ask for other people's experience who are in a similar situation, and maybe advice on medication or ways to relax."
29199,I didn't abuse the meds and haven't gone back since for follow up.
29200,"I'm normally against medication because I saw it turn my dad into a zombie, who himself had suffer from severe manic depression and bipolar...something I'm trying to avoid."
29201,"So I've been battling with anxiety/depression in a serious way for about a year now, and between the symptoms and the meds I haven't been able to do much of anything."
29202,"I see myself as a generally confident person in day to day life, but I always seem to have this subtle anxiety that makes me generally nervous and panicky, whether Im just out in public or at work."
29203,"For example, Im not blowing my own trumpet or anything, but I see myself as a fairly intelligent person and get told that by others."
29204,"The problem is, when Im doing daily tasks at work, I come across as a bit 'dopey' although I'm not."
29205,I'll slightly do things wrong or keep forgetting small details immediately that I need to remember and it is starting to give me that image.
29206,"I'm not dopey, but I always feel this nervousness/anxiety that seems to live under my skin and just stays there affecting me."
29207,"I dont know why, but its really getting to me now."
29208,I even find myself not being able to speak correctly and tripping over my words a lot because of it.
29209,"I once had bad anxiety whilst learning to drive around three years ago, so bad that I couldnt pass my test."
29210,I was fine once I was prescribed a temporary dose of anxiety medication (10mg Propranolol I think it was) and flew straight through the test and passed.
29211,"The funny thing is, Im not a nervous driver, in-fact, its one of the most things I am confident at but it was the fact someone else who I didn't know all that well was also present and it gave me extreme anxiety."
29212,I still face this problem now with different serious situations.
29213,The anxiety seems to come out in full force when Im put on the spot for something.
29214,I'm considering going back to my doctor and explaining all this to see if I can get a permanent prescription for the anxiety but I'm not sure what he will say as I am only 21.
29215,I was just wondering a couple of things; 1.
29216,"If anybody out there is the same and how its affected you, 2."
29217,If you have taken any steps to relieve the anxiety 3.
29218,Have you used/using any permanent prescribed and/or over the counter medications to relieve the anxiety?
29219,I'd be interested to talk to people who are in a same or similar situation to me to see if it helps me get through it any better or not.
29220,"If you read this far, then thanks I appreciate it."
29221,tl;dr - anxiety.
29222,I'm looking for success stories of people who have gotten off of an anxiety medication.
29223,"I saw a therapist a handful of times and then that was that... Never really encouraged to do anything else, so I just sort of accepted that medication was what I needed and I took it faithfully until the end of last year - so for about a total of 15 years."
29224,At the end of last year various circumstances made me open my eyes to the fact that medicine was the wrong answer.
29225,Am I doomed to a life of anxiety caused mainly by medication withdrawal or being on a medicine I don't want to be?
29226,I feel like there's a dual inside of me raging all the time: the part of me on medicine and the part of me that is human and waking up again for the first time in almost 15 years.
29227,"The human part is getting stronger, but in it's awareness I'm just now realizing how much I hated myself while I was on the medicine."
29228,Another thing that alleviates my symptoms are taking over the counter medication such as ibuprofen and advil.
29229,"I also hate being on medication for whatever reason and that my parents kept a ""scorecard"" of my actions when i was younger and so now i do it to."
29230,I want to go on my medication for it(paxil) but hate being on medicine because it makes me feel like a drone.
29231,"But even going on the medication wont help me with the ""scorecard"" mentality and i want that gone as well."
29232,"After having anxiety my whole life, I was officially given a diagnosis and began medication in 2009."
29233,"Before the medication, I felt very removed from my body, even hiding under a desk at one point."
29234,"Right now I'm living in a constant state of anxiety (my normal is to do pretty well with an occasional full-blown attack, I take no meds)."
29235,"My meds (heavy cocktail of SARI+SSRI+NDRI+Benzodiazepine) have proven to be in some way effective on depression (mainly future centered, still there but less now, i can at least work again more or less), sleep and energy but these do nothing for my social anxiety at large."
29236,"This is pretty much unsolveable for me, and so is my social anxiety or even thinking of any relationship, now i can ""function"" again on meds for some time but not really solve anything in the end."
29237,But as soon as I had a setback in the anxiety I started doubting the medication and it's effectiveness.
29238,"""After a long time with therapy and finding the correct medication, maybe I can be like that"" I say to myself."
29239,"What followed was a few good days, another catastrophe-level panic attack, then five days where I could barely force myself to eat anything, lost 10 pounds, slept 4 scattered hours a night (partly because the meds caused insomnia and partly because of the hunger pain), and was too scared (and too weak) to leave the house."
29240,"Since then, I've done a pretty good job of convincing myself and others around me that I don't want to try meds again, but I've also continued to have panic attacks and anxious feelings at a rate and level that I never had them before the incident with citalopram."
29241,It's just been me and my therapist trying to deal with the trauma of what happened with the meds.
29242,I'm so scared of meds now.
29243,"But at the same time, I know medication could probably help me."
29244,They were so bad I called my mom to talk about maybe seeing someone or getting medication.
29245,I'm also considering medication but I don't know if that's appropriate for my situation.
29246,"I used to be on medication a couple years ago given to me by a family doctor but was never actually diagnosed with anything other than ""yeah you're having anxiety attacks""."
29247,They are the only medication that seemed to help my anxiety &amp; panic attacks.
29248,"The doctor would usually throw in some kind of anti-depressant or ""sleep"" medicine like Trazadone."
29249,"He just throws me on a bunch of meds to make a me a zombie, that his answer to my problems."
29250,I wish I could find a medicine that is quick acting like a benzodiazepine but without the terrible side effects (deadly withdrawals).
29251,I am beginning to realize that taking medication will be my only shot at a happy life.
29252,So I've made an appointment to see a psychiatrist on Aug 16th to see about switching to a new medication.
29253,"I don't take anxiety medication anymore, and I need some help coping without it."
29254,"I'm having trouble differentiating between anxiety symptoms- chest pain, dizziness, nausea, rapid heartbeat- and the symptoms of an allergy to the medication, which are similar."
29255,"I've tried breathing techniques, reading other threads, everything... and I can't get it out of my head that I'm going to die from this medication."
29256,I never liked taking prescription meds because feeling numb and zombie-like isn't my ideal state.
29257,"For a herbal medicine that is supposedly mild, it felt like I took a Tylenol PM, minus the groggy side effects."
29258,Hello Internet.
29259,I've finally come to the point where i realize that I need to ask for help.
29260,This is a huge step for me.
29261,I have struggled with severe social anxiety for as long as I can remember.
29262,"When I say severe, I'm talking 29 years old, been on 1-2 dates in my life."
29263,Yeah that bad.
29264,"Over the last few weeks, I've entertained the suicide as a serious solution to my problem for the first time in years, and it's terrifying me."
29265,"Even with my severe anxiety, I have been able to maintain what would appear as a normal life."
29266,"I have a good job, I have a few pretty good friends."
29267,I think that I am generally well liked.
29268,I've never had a romantic relationship.
29269,I'm so ashamed of this that I don't even talk to anyone about it.
29270,"None of my friends know, it is deeply embarrassing."
29271,"For my entire life thus far, I've been ""procrastinating"" on dating and meeting people."
29272,"It's not that I don't want to meet people, it's that I don't even know where to start."
29273,"Whenever I have the urge to start meeting people and someday finding a romantic partner, I just end up jacking off and putting it off till the next day."
29274,I've realized that I can't keep putting it off forever.
29275,I need advice on where to even start.
29276,"One of my problems is that I get so worked up, that I become ""paralyzed""."
29277,"Whenever I start to have a crush on someone, my mind races, I imagine my entire life with this person, and I can't even muster up so much as a hello."
29278,I'm a bit put off by the idea of dating sites.
29279,"I'm not some douchebag looking for casual hookups, I don't want to flirt with a bunch of people."
29280,I want to find a serious lifelong partner.
29281,I'm also hesitant to the idea of therapy.
29282,"Whenever I've been to therapy as a teen, it always seemed like I was just being evaluated to see which medication I needed to be put onto."
29283,"I've been on zoloft, prozac, seroquel, welbutren, and a few more I probably can't remember."
29284,"None of these medications have actually made me feel ""better""."
29285,"At best they've made me feel ""emotionally numb""."
29286,Does anyone that's been in my shoes and found their way out of it have any advice on where to start?
29287,"And while some of the symptoms get better with medication and lifestyle changes, I still have perpetual headaches."
29288,"Hey, bit of a background:

Agoraphobia (although not true agoraphobia, I can still leave my house) since I was 14 years old, I'm now 22 and 23 in a couple of months."
29289,"My anxiety/agoraphobia seems to be subconcious e.g I want to be in those situations where I get anxiety from and I'm not worrying about them but as soon as I'm in the situations, the anxiety symptoms start flooding in."
29290,"Because it appears to be subconcious, my numerous bouts of therapy and CBT have done nothing so I've resorted to trying medication."
29291,"The only thing I've found to help me so far is Lorazepam 1mg which unfortunately you're unable to take for a long period of time, so my doctor has been trying me on SSRI's which might have well been sugar pills."
29292,"I've tried Mirtazapine 15mg for 4 weeks, Lexapro 5mg for 4 weeks and 10mg for 4 weeks and Sertraline 50mg for 5 weeks."
29293,"I didn't feel a single noticeable positive effect on any of those medications although I was only using them for 4 weeks (apart from the Lexapro) and at minimum dose, so maybe I need to raise my dosage?"
29294,"Anyway - back to the main question, what medications have been successful for YOU to help deal with symptoms of anxiety/agoraphobia?"
29295,Thanks.
29296,"The Zoloft had been working well on my anxiety and depressing, but I was having the postponed-orgasm problem...  And this new medicine allegedly works like Zoloft but without that side effect."
29297,"So, as is ever the question with meds: How do I know if 1) I'm perceiving run-of-the-mill life crap as worse than it is because the medicine isn't working, or 2) the last couple of weeks have in fact Sucked and I should blame this pill?"
29298,"I'm just curious to hear stories from others who've tried this new (and expensive, as there's no generic yet) medication."
29299,Should I seek medication?
29300,I'm an English and Journalism student at the University of Iowa and am currently planning to base two separate class projects off anxiety disorders and my experiences with them.
29301,The first is a photo essay for my advanced photo storytelling class.
29302,I'm taking self portraits related to my anxiety and how it affects my life.
29303,"I've started taking some self portraits already, some with my (many) medications and some representing my trouble sleeping."
29304,The second project is for my post-colonial Vietnamese literature class.
29305,"It's a pretty high level course, so I have a huge literary research paper/casebook."
29306,"I'm planning to research the ways that PTSD and other war-related anxiety disorders (panic disorder, mostly) are represented differently in post-war American and Vietnamese literature."
29307,"I'm looking at The Things They Carried, Matterhorn, No Man's Land, and Catfish and Mandala as primary narrative texts and researching their reception and reponse across the different cultures."
29308,Do you guys think that these projects could be therapeutic for my own personal struggled with anxiety?
29309,"(20 y/o female, developed GAD and really severe panic disorder once I came to college."
29310,It's fairly new in my life but it happened so quickly.
29311,It's like I woke up one day and was suddenly having panic attacks every few hours and couldn't leave my house).
29312,Or do you think that focusing so much on anxiety disorders over the next month and a half could make me fixate more on my own suffering?
29313,**TL;DR Studying anxiety disorders for lit and photo classes: therapeutic or damaging?
29314,**
29315,I was recently diagnosed with GAD and have had issues with depression in the past.
29316,My doctor has really been encouraging me to try medication but it's never been something I've wanted to try.
29317,I have had a few friends who've reacted terribly to medications &amp; it's really put me off of the concept...
29318,But my anxiety has become rather crippling recently &amp; I'm starting to open up to the possibility.
29319,So I'm basically crowdsourcing experiences with medications as treatment for anxiety and/or depression.
29320,Tell me your stories!
29321,I felt tightness in my chest and was sure that it was caused by the meds because I made the mistake of reading about them on the Internet.
29322,"This summer, I decided that after 9 months and I was feeling great, I should ween off completely as I was under the impression that I didn't want to be dependent on meds for the rest of my life."
29323,Hello r/Anxiety.
29324,I am a 25 year old female and I have an appointment in two weeks with a new doctor.
29325,I plan to speak to this doctor about my (own strong assumption that I have an) anxiety disorder.
29326,As a child I had a couple meetings with a psychologist about my intense fear of school/leaving my house in any way.
29327,"This did not resolve in much besides ""oh she probably has separation anxiety""."
29328,"My parents did quite a lot to help me, through talking with me and trying to help me rationalize my fears, and by the time I turned 11 or so (yes, from 5-11!)"
29329,I was very outgoing and generally extroverted.
29330,"I have always needed alone time to recharge, but I don't see that as a huge problem."
29331,"Maybe it is...

As an aside, I have been reading through a lot of threads tonight and it seems like another medical issue I've struggled with is made a little clearer - I've always had a lot of issues with my stomach, which I am now thinking is related to my anxiety."
29332,I have had literally every test on my stomach in the world and they never show anything.
29333,"Anyway, I digress...

Over the last 5 years my anxiety has gotten worse and worse and I am to the point that I find it hard to leave my house, get out of bed, my relationships are strained and suffering, and I have serious food/internet/(+other things to distract myself) issues."
29334,I really feel like I am on the verge of a much more serious dive into the black hole of anxiety/depression.
29335,"I try to be rational and logical but I generally spend most of my time hating myself, being unable to complete simple tasks without feeling overwhelmed, terrified and exhausted, and about 15 seconds away from tears."
29336,"My family are not really pro-medication and I guess growing up around the stigma of drug=bad, I am very nervous about the possibility of being prescribed medication."
29337,"Personally, I think medication is a wonderful tool in the process of self-healing, but you know... logic is not always equal to anxiety."
29338,Did/does anyone else feel this way?
29339,Is there anything I should know about taking medications?
29340,"Any stories, advice, or thoughts at all would really help me."
29341,"tl/dr; I feel hopeful about finally opening up to a doctor about my anxiety, but I am (irrationally) terrified that I will be given pills and they will affect me in a negative way."
29342,"I've finally gotten onto medication, after being diagnosed with GAD, and boy was the first week shitty."
29343,"Due to habit, I took one medication for two days and then the other, so propanolol first."
29344,"Years later (last year) I went to the hospital to control my insulin resistance again, and when I mentioned my doctor I was taking fluoxetine (I actually asked her for prescription because I couldn’t get it anymore in the drug stores), she looked at me confused, asked my age, and told me I had to follow a mental health treatment, that I was “too young for that kind of medicine.” I felt pretty bad about it."
29345,"Every 3 months I must see the doctor in charge of the mental health department of the hospital so he or she gives me the prescription for my medicine, and he or she decides if I have to take more of less of the pills."
29346,"I now have a few beers every now and then, smoke pot every week or two, and I take my meds as prescribed, every once in a while I take an extra ritalin, or don't take any that day."
29347,It's been two nights without a moment of sleep and I'm not sure of its coincidental and I'm just super anxious or if the medicine really is keeping me awake.
29348,"The problem here is, with I am on the meds I feel like I'm dull."
29349,So I have been off meds for a while now.
29350,"I can't believe that my university, a leader in medicine, that has built an entire department to provide mental health services to students, has failed to recognize my issues despite providing everything they ask for."
29351,Would I get put on medication?
29352,I'm not sure if I want to be put on medication but I'm not sure if I can deal with whatever is going on with me for the past 5 years any longer.
29353,As I'm already stressed out and I'm not sure how medication would effect my studies/revision/memory.
29354,"the first week i was on this medication, everything was fine."
29355,"So, I read that turmeric helps improve your memory, so I was wondering if there's anyone here who's taking similar medication and turmeric at the same time and if the turmeric has helped improving your memory?"
29356,I am on an antibiotic and asthma meds.
29357,I'm terrified the meds aren't working and I'm going to be hospitalized with a deadly virus!
29358,the meds worked well on physical symptoms of SA but nothing for my racing mind and panic attacks.
29359,My doctor prescribed me some blood pressure medicine and now that it's run out I can't get ahold of her to either make an appointment or refill them.
29360,So last night was the first night in...god I don't remember how long I went out somewhere without taking medicine.
29361,"This sounds stupid I guess but I almost freaked out because not being on medicine and having people get near me, when I know they might have forgotten to wash their hands, or might have been sick, or etc that's a **HUGE** thing for me."
29362,"It wasn't intentional, I didn't go out without medicine on purpose I just didn't have time to take what I needed to, and by the time I got out I realized I hadn't."
29363,"Includes giving meds throughout the night and morning, general house cleaning, and general care-taking of the guys)."
29364,"I took no medicine, no nothing."
29365,"Thankfully I am seeing my counselor next week and she had said something about me meeting with an actual psychiatrist instead of a primary care doctor, since they obviously know more about mental health issues and can prescribe medication."
29366,"I have an appointment with a psychiatrist scheduled for this afternoon - I've been on meds for years, but I've had to find a new doctor after finishing grad school and I'm quite nervous."
29367,What if he wants to change my meds?
29368,I've always been an anxious person- but sometimes it gets to the point where I can't function.
29369,"I'm also pretty sure I've been dealing with depression for a while but shoving it in the back of my mind, sort of."
29370,"I have no passions, everything Is just kinda 'meh' I feel like I have no emotions and I'm always tired."
29371,I go out of my way to avoid situations that make me anxious (like working out at 11:30 pm in my buildings workout room because I know it'll be empty) etc.
29372,When I get too stressed I can't keep that thoughts out of my head- and when I'm too sad or feeling overwhelmed I don't eat- I don't feel inclined to do anything but just sit where I'm at or go sleep.
29373,"Unless I'm at work...where I have to force myself to function, which results in a ton of anxiety buildup and I barely do anything more than I have to until it's time to go home."
29374,I thought I could 'live' with my issues but it's becoming...everything in my life.
29375,Life revolves around avoiding situations that make me anxious or trying to ignore how lonely and down I always am.
29376,I tried talking to someone my senior year of college and it was nice- but I felt the sessions only worked for that day and then all the clutter in my mind would come back.
29377,Do medications really help?
29378,"I want to see what it's like living a 'normal' life....

Has medication really helped any of you?"
29379,"It like my brain was repeating what I had done that day (which was go to nannas) what scares me is that I have NO RECOLLECTION of this I don't remember the shower or passing out, i only had about 4-5 beers and a couple of these pills..I know I shouldn't have mixed the alcohol with medication (that wasn't mine) but why does that happen?"
29380,"[21F] 
There are days when the smallest things seem like mountains."
29381,Whether that is driving into town to go to class or speaking to the clerk at the grocery store.
29382,I freeze up and stumble across my words.
29383,Lately it has been getting worse.
29384,"My doctor has offered to put me on medications, but I have a friend who thinks I should continue to try and deal with it on my own."
29385,I have anxiety where I drive all the way across town just to make it go away.
29386,Unfortunately when I do have increased anxiety I become irritable to the point where I lash out and hurt peoples feelings.
29387,There will be weeks that it does not affect me though.
29388,Usually when I am not in college.
29389,Recently I have been having issues with my SO's sister who is in an abusive relationship.
29390,I worry so much about it and how many bad things can happen to her.
29391,He recently stopped talked to her breaking off all contact.
29392,"An he told me ""Do what you want, I don't care."""
29393,in regards to communicating with her.
29394,We went over to his mothers house where she was and he was ignoring her the whole time.
29395,My anxiety kicked in as I did not know whether to look at her or ignore her.
29396,"I would occasionally make eye contact, but then would freeze up."
29397,Tonight I was trying to relax after studying all day.
29398,When I saw a post on FB.
29399,"There are so many days I wish I could get rid of the life sucking website, but I need it to communicate with classmates in regards to projects."
29400,It was picture of his sister and her boyfriend.
29401,I snapped and started ranting about how she should respect her mom and listen to other people...and a bunch of other not so nice things.
29402,Everything just built up.
29403,I felt so bad afterwards.
29404,So much regret wondering why it happened.
29405,Why I did it.
29406,Now I am so worried I cannot sleep.
29407,"She blocked me on facebook which had been one of my end goals, because I did not know what to do."
29408,I feel horrible and wish I could take it back.
29409,I hate how there are weeks like this where I can barely function in a proper manner and have a outbursts.
29410,Social interactions of any kind are always a mess for me.
29411,I have problems letting things go after they are triggered.
29412,I also have mild depression.
29413,I have been on Paxil for a month and a half and my anxiety is definitely better controlled on this medication.
29414,I want to take meds but I don't want to lose creativity or energy.
29415,At the same time I worry about not being able to function any more without medication.
29416,"I feel like I might as well just not be on medication at all, it's a waste of my money and I'm not so certain it isn't making me feel a little bit worse."
29417,I'm curious to see what other people's views/experiences are with meds.
29418,When might it be a good idea to talk to a doctor about medicine?
29419,"I have been to a psychiatrist who strongly suggested medication, but I refuse because of my phobias:

1."
29420,I could not handle this medication making me sick.
29421,I fear medication will give a similar feeling.
29422,Is the benefit of taking meds better than the risks?
29423,"Sorry if somebody already ask, but are there any meds i can take that works for you that's over the counter?"
29424,I need to change meds and am looking for suggestions that do not cause weight gain - thanks to Celexa and Luxapro I gained almost 20 lbs in a month...I need an anti anxiety and an antidepressant.
29425,"I'm not taking any meds currently and I don't have a doctor (although, there is a handy walk-in clinic nearby if I need one)."
29426,I have semi-inguinal hernia diagnosed last year (no surgery necessary).
29427,This year I got diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder.
29428,"I feel as if pins and needles are stubbing me in my groinal area (groin, below testicles), and sometimes a warm sensation in the same area."
29429,"Went to the neurologist - he said everything is from stress (found no pathological reason for the anxiety), went to the Urologist - did an Ultrasound - found NOTHING also."
29430,"Sometimes the pins and needles pain is very sharp, luckily it's short (few seconds)."
29431,Can this be caused by Anxiety?
29432,Taking no medications.
29433,Also feeling some sort of dispersonalization - as if I am high on weed.
29434,This keeps me for the past week..
29435,Thanks all!
29436,"I have relatively mild anxiety, the sort that only flares up badly when in certain situations that set me off, for example anythings pertaining to finding a job (networking, interviewing) or an a date with a girl, or even approaching one to ask out."
29437,Sometimes I put off starting hard things because I'm anxious that I will fail.
29438,"I've started to drink heavily in social situations that cause me anxiety because it help me let go and just have fun (obviously not appropriate for an interview, however)."
29439,"The things is, the anxiety has led me to be fearful towards these things and so I have, in the past, rarely stepped out of my comfort zone and face my fears."
29440,"My fears have largely limited the way I live my life, and I want that trend to stop."
29441,"I know people say not to consider medication unless your anxiety is preventing you from living a normal life, but to me, my fear about stepping out of my comfort zone is indeed preventing me from living the kind of life I want to live."
29442,Is a case like mine an appropriate one to begin a course of medication?
29443,And what sort of medications would it be appropriate to consider?
29444,All opinions are welcome and will be read :) Thank you.
29445,"I've never been on medication, although I have had a therapist off and on."
29446,I don't drink nor do drugs nor am I on meds.
29447,Anxiety meds are helpful but I have OCS about becoming addicted and don't take them as prescribed even if I am given a small reasonable dose and I don't abuse them.
29448,"Anxiety meds help with my pain, sometimes but other things aren't in my head and just hurt."
29449,I don't like being on medication because it changes my personality and I have lots of side effects.
29450,"I'm sick of meds that don't work, therapy that doesn't help, coping strategies that don't help me cope."
29451,Why isn't my medicine solving both problems ?
29452,I've been seeing a counselor/therapist for a few months.
29453,"I recently had to switch because the woman I started with is part of the university counseling service where I attend veterinary school, and I'm not a student who has the benefit of free counseling over the summer."
29454,"The first appointment the new counselor, which was two weeks ago,  handed me a paper, and at the top it said something about evaluating anxiety and depression."
29455,I noticed that out of a scale of 4 I rarely circled anything below a 3.
29456,"It did make me realize that what I'm doing with the counseling thus far is reducing some, but most definitely not all, of the things that distress me the most."
29457,"I'm not suicidal now, but the thought patterns that led me there once in the past are returning, and quite frankly, that frightens me."
29458,And that alone is enough to stress someone out.
29459,I definitely recognize some perfectionism out of fear of judgement upon perceived failure.
29460,"Example: My newly introduced cats were fighting, and it prompted a meltdown."
29461,I struggled for awhile to put to words why it did so to my boyfriend (who is amazingly patient.
29462,"Even though he was mad at me for slamming shit around the apartment as I tried to channel the energy into something productive by cleaning, he refrained from yelling at me."
29463,He waited till we were both calm to tell me he was angry for my actions).
29464,"In retrospect, it was the fact that, as a veterinary student, I feel like part of being successful as a veterinarian is being able to offer advice to clients in the situation I was in, and since I was not able to keep my cats from, as I saw it at the time, trying to murder each other, I would never EVER be a good vet, and all the time and effort and money I have put towards that goal would have been wasted."
29465,"And when I finally fail out of vet school, said wonderful boyfriend would think I was a loser and leave me, or he'd leave me that day if I couldn't get myself under control."
29466,I think I am getting better at stopping that spiral but I'm not so sure some days.
29467,"And the last couple nights, this idea has been really really bothering me."
29468,"I almost feel like it's not okay to post this here since I don't have an official diagnosis (so I wouldn't understand what people who really have this problem go through, I'm just a drama queen, blah blah blah)."
29469,"So, is thinking about getting a diagnosis making me think I have it like a mental hypochondriac, or has this always been there, and the stress I'm under in my program is exasperating the problem?"
29470,I feel like I owe certain people an explanation.
29471,Like the professor I'm working with for my summer research fellowship.
29472,"I could barely function today because I got worked up before going in and could not shake it, even with the breathing exercise I've been working on with the new therapist."
29473,I basically have a hard time focusing on my breathing like she has been teaching me on my own.
29474,"I know it would work if I could do it, but doing it in her office with her to gently remind me to go back to breathing once in awhile and making myself do it on my own and consciously being able to return to that focus is eluding me."
29475,But I also feel like it will become an excuse.
29476,Something to blame rather than me taking ownership of my problem and my behavior.
29477,"I don't want to start doing this ""My anxiety is acting up, I'm going to go home now"" sort of thing."
29478,"Or let it make it ""okay"" for me to be a bitch to the people I care about."
29479,If that makes any sense at all.
29480,I've seen too many people close to me do this.
29481,And I don't want to follow.
29482,"This all said, I do not want medications either."
29483,"Everyone I've known who has been on an SSRI has experienced more of the unwanted side effects of the drugs with very little, if any, of the benefit they were supposed to confer."
29484,"Most slept a lot, something I cannot afford to be doing in my third year of veterinary school."
29485,"One in addition developed some pretty severe GI disturbances, and the other started having seizures (meds were the ONLY thing that had changed."
29486,Don't want to risk THAT one and have it happen while I have a scalpel in my hand in surgery lab).
29487,"And the one time I was on a benzodiazepene (diazepam/valium), which was prescribed by my dentist to ""calm me down"" the next time I came in."
29488,He'd been the one to make me upset in the first place by pretty much yelling at me the whole time I was there previous.
29489,"So stepmom filled the prescription, I took it like I was supposed to before the appointment, and still proceeded to become upset as he and his assistant yelled at me constantly to open my mouth wider so he can work on my back molars or we're going to be there for hours, and maybe have to reschedule to finish the work, when it was his fault for prescribing something that is also a muscle relaxant."
29490,I spent the rest of the day wrapped in a blanket sitting in the doorway of the kitchen in a daze because I had gotten up wanting a snack but never quite made it to my destination.
29491,"I've always been on the heavier side, so my stepmom couldn't move me."
29492,"I think I remember her asking me if I wanted to move and I said no, so she let me sit there."
29493,This ended up being quite a lot longer than I expected.
29494,TL;DR: Any real benefit in actually getting officially tested for anxiety/possibly also depression if I'm already seeing a counselor and absolutely refuse medication?
29495,Or should I stop worrying about it and continue on like I've been?
29496,The meds have not helped in the weight department.
29497,I've slowed the meds down and starting taking melatonin to help me sleep.
29498,"I really want to go back to a normal dosage of my meds, but it can't gain weight."
29499,"Any kind words or polite advice on how to get these awful comments out of my head so I don't have to resort to my ""fat, but happy"" meds?"
29500,"This is a short story about my anxiety, the medication I took and how eventually my life took a turn for the better."
29501,I went to see the doctor again and said I wanted to stop taking medication.
29502,My brain felt woken up and like the glass that the medication had put there was lifted.
29503,Any ideas on medicine I can ask my doctor about next week?
29504,Is it time for me to call my doctor and increase/change my medication?
29505,"Even though you don't have any sort of background on me, I thought you'd appreciate hearing that I've been off my meds since Monday."
29506,It took me awhile to post on here because I'm not one to talk about my problems but I am really stressed out about taking these meds.. Any help is appreciated.
29507,On medication.
29508,My doctor put gave me medication that helps my anxiety as well as helps me sleep.
29509,"-No medication; though weed has been helpful, I use it socially sometimes."
29510,I think that removes the medication aspect of it when it becomes a social thing.
29511,"EDIT: I am also not on any medication, don't do drugs(I've smoked weed a few times but that just makes me even more nervous) I occasionally smoke cigarettes but that also sometimes get me all jittery and makes my heart race."
29512,I am taking medication (anti-depressant and anti-anxiety) and talking with a counselor.
29513,I am not currently on meds because I have been on them (anti depressents) in the past and saw no results.
29514,"I'm going to see a doctor as soon as I get healthcare, which is anywhere from next month, to the next 5 months."
29515,"But I'm going to tell him my symptoms, shaking, racing heart, worrying, shaking before work/when writing, depression from my anxiety, restlessness, trouble sleeping, pouring sweat at work."
29516,What should I be expecting?
29517,"What kind of medications should I outright avoid, in your experience?"
29518,What kind of medications work/worked for you?
29519,I just want as much feedback and personal experiences as I can before going in.
29520,I am not medicated and would prefer not to be dependent on medication but have always been open to therapy.
29521,I also don't want to be dependent on meds as I said before.
29522,"I've encountered few people whom lives where effected in a positive way from taking prescription psych medication(share yours and be honest please)

TL;DR I've never taken drugs and this thought comforts me if I do take drugs now and they don't work out I think I might give up on everything and rote away."
29523,Does medication help with social anxiety?
29524,"I'm 18, female, and not currently on any medications."
29525,"Things have been getting a bit too stressful lately, and I've never handled stress well."
29526,I used to see a psychiatrist during middle school and also took anti-depressants for a short time.
29527,"I suffered another breakdown during my finals years of high school, but the symptoms were pretty mild, and I quickly recovered."
29528,"Recently, I haven't been sleeping well."
29529,"I have recurring nightmares, and they're a bit too disturbing to describe."
29530,I'm also slowly losing my appetite.
29531,"Worst of all, I've been having random ""panic attacks""?"
29532,"over the past couple of months, but nothing too serious."
29533,"Now, within the past week I've had two major panic attacks that were so bad I found it difficult to breathe, and these episodes lasted well over an hour."
29534,I just want to know that nothing's wrong.
29535,"It's just stress, right?"
29536,"There's no reason to tell anyone or seek help, right?"
29537,That's the last thing I want to do.
29538,"I still live at home, and I'm in a somewhat stable relationship, and I just don't want to place that kind of stress on them right now."
29539,What should I do?
29540,"Edit: I suppose I should mention that I don't have insurance, so it makes it difficult to seek any professional help or even just get medications."
29541,"I had managed this with my depression in the past, and when I started going to the therapy sessions and taking the medication I thought this would be the exact same thing."
29542,Tons of meds and a few doctors later I kinda have a sense of where I am at.
29543,"You see, I am a emetophobe(fear of vomiting) and since I had severe vomiting during my food poisoning, I have been worried ever since...probably to the point of a stomach ulcer  

As I am typing this at 4:00am CST, I am shaking wildly, already having exhausted my daily intake of anxiety meds(Klonopin 6mg) and anti-nausea meds."
29544,"The counselors don't know how to help me honestly, and meds don't work much for me."
29545,TL;DR Be nice to yourself and anwer your anxiety questions so they don't just sit there and rot.
29546,"Some back story,  I was on a great medication (Latuda) for almost 4 months and it gave me akathisia and panic attacks so bad I had to get off of it."
29547,"With Latuda, I was able to leave the house pretty easily and was very appreciative of how well it worked  Now I'm starting to feel that ol' crappy anxiety that makes things hard to enjoy."
29548,"With Latuda I still went into panic-filled terror more than I'd like and had trouble managing stressful situations, but my everyday living was easier."
29549,"Now I'm between medications and it's a really scary uncertain time, so I wrote this:
      I've chosen to personify my anxiety recently."
29550,"By doing that, I can try to separate my actual self from those irrational, catastrophic thoughts that I have."
29551,"When I have this anxiety, it's like there's another person in the room staring at me impatiently, while I do everything."
29552,"I've named him Mr. Anxiety, because why not?"
29553,"When I try to be productive, he will announce something like ""Don't forget that you should be working like everyone else."""
29554,"""Did you do enough today to match what your SO has done while he's at work?""."
29555,"""Are you pulling your weight around the house?""."
29556,"I, then spend a lot of time trying to argue with the anxiety that he's wrong, if I'm having a good day."
29557,"If I'm having a bad day, then I spend the time wondering if everyone else is thinking the same things that Mr. Anxiety is asking about."
29558,"I would prefer to spend more time living my life and that's why I'm trying to show/remind my myself that some things are things everyone worries about, and some are just these nagging thoughts that don't deserve my effort."
29559,In the past this anxiety has kept me from doing a lot of things.
29560,"That's why it was so nice to have a medication that worked, and allowed me to do normal life tasks more effortlessly."
29561,Now I have the worry of worry.
29562,"I have been through a lot in the past, and I can get through this."
29563,"I need patience from my loved ones, and I am afraid that their patience ran out long ago."
29564,I need to remember that a bad day doesn't mean that everything in the world is ruined.
29565,A bad hour or two of anxiety doesn't need to mean that my day is ruined.
29566,A fantastic coping skill I've learned is to answer Mr. Anxiety's questions.
29567,"Let me give you an example of a worry I currently have:

Mr. Anxiety poses the question What if this whole week you're unable to be as productive as you have been since April?"
29568,Isn't that going to give you even more depression?
29569,"He then goes on to offer a few unhelpful answers: Everyone will be disappointed and give up hope that you would be a ""normal"" person again?"
29570,"Also, btw, you know you're probably going to be alone forever."
29571,So I need to answer this productively.
29572,"I've found that addressing those fears is scarier at at first, but satisfying:  Dear, Mr. Anxiety, I've had a bad week before, and I've had a bad month before."
29573,I am going to do what I can.
29574,"Hell, if I can make it to a dr's appointment on my own, do the dishes and work on some artwork for a few hours on a bad day those are accomplishments!"
29575,"The people who know and love me, understand (or should by now) that sometimes there are limitations for me, and everyone has flaws and limitations."
29576,"Those who don't understand mental illness may never will, and that doesn't change my worth as a human."
29577,I can't control them.
29578,I am not cursed or blessed by being so special that my life is so terrible and no one could ever possibly understand.
29579,"Tons of people have anxiety, Bipolar, depression so what?"
29580,"Feeling bad for myself isn't going to ""fix me"" or make people love and accept me more."
29581,"There is no such thing as ""being fixed"", because life is fluid and you never know what's going to come."
29582,"I naturally want to be a productive person, and I don't need you to remind me of it."
29583,"It IS sad that I am not currently on a medication that is successfully managing my anxiety on it's own, and I am allowed to be sad about that, without beating myself up."
29584,This week I will cut myself some slack on getting all the things done that I want.
29585,"I wouldn't expect someone else having a bad week to just suck it up and get over it, so I need to be just as nice to myself."
29586,"Also, you're a jerk."
29587,"I do take prozac for depression and anxiety (low dosage as I don't want to become dependant on it) and other than medication, what helps some of you when you feel like this, if ever."
29588,"I'm 26, male, two adorable toddlers, and I feel like I'm completely unable to function."
29589,I've had crippling Generalized Anxiety for as long as I can remember (I remember incidents from being as young as six) and I really don't see it ending.
29590,"I appear to be doing well because of a series of fortunate opportunities and bizarre behavioral conditions, but I've finally ran out of luck and I'm slowly sinking."
29591,"In March, my wife of almost 5 years left me."
29592,Telling me that she felt more like my mother than my wife (on account of my inability to do basic things like call a company to pay a bill).
29593,At this point I've got the house payment to make by myself and I'm starting to fall behind.
29594,I won't be able to stay and because of when I bought the house and the housing bubble I'm so upside-down there is no way for me to get out of it other than short sale or foreclosure.
29595,I don't know what's going to happen when I finally have to leave.
29596,My anxiety is so bad that I can't make arrangements for my next living situation.
29597,Every time I think about it I just get paralyzed and end up curling up until I fall asleep.
29598,At the same time I've also got work completely crushing me.
29599,"I wouldn't be able to go if it wasn't for my anxiety making ""not going"" out to be even worse."
29600,"At one point I looking into disability for my anxiety, but one of the requirements is that is has to have ""prevented you from working for at least two years"" and I don't think they'll accept the plea that my anxiety is forcing me to go to work."
29601,"And even if they did I don't know how I would feel about getting disability, since I technically *am* able to work, though I am in excruciating mental and physical pain as a result."
29602,"I've tried Zoloft, Paxil, Pristeek, Abilify, Xanax, Clonopin, Ativan, Celexa, Mirtazapine, and some others that I can't even remember over the last few years and nothing helps."
29603,"The ""use as needed"" meds like Xanax all put me to sleep."
29604,If they actually did anything to reduce my anxiety I have no way of knowing.
29605,"The maintenance meds I would take and we'd slowly up the dosage until the side effects were unbearable, and then move on to something else."
29606,Nothing is helping.
29607,I had stopped going to the doctor for a while (couldn't afford it and the copays on my medications) but I'm looking for a new one.
29608,I guess I'll start trying random medications in the hope that one will actually work.
29609,I feel like I am being tortured.
29610,My anxiety causes me so much anguish but the thought of denying my boys their father leaves me unable to kill myself.
29611,Right now my worst fear is that I'll live to be a hundred years old.
29612,"Basically over the past few years I have become increasingly more anxious with my actions (lifestyle etc) and I find it hard to engage people... As far as prescribed medication goes, I am on lexapro 10mg..

ANYWAYS!"
29613,So I've been on medication since June and I want to know how it should affect me.
29614,Are there no meds which make you more calm and less anxious ?
29615,I used to take daily medication for anxiety but I can't handle the side-effects.
29616,"Suffered with anxiety for 4-5 years now, taken antidepressants/antianxiety meds on and off."
29617,I'm not taking any at the moment.
29618,"However my main issue over the years has been my stomach (worse in the mornings) I lose my appetite in the mornings, am extremely gassey and pass wind/burp alot If I sit with my Knees crunch up to my stomach."
29619,I've learnt to deal with the other more physiological negative thought patterns etc and really its just my always tired/constant yawning/bloated/gassey/odorous wind/sickness feeling in my stomach.
29620,Should I see my GP about acid medications that may reduce the amount of acid in my stomach?
29621,Or is that not even the problem??
29622,Thanks for reading.
29623,It's not nearly as bad as before I started with my medication but it sucks big time.
29624,"It seemed as though everything was getting better for a while, and I stopped taking the meds that the drs prescribed and things started to look ok again."
29625,"The hospital also prescribed me with a weeks supply of Diazepam 5mg, but I want to do more research before committing to medication."
29626,"I don't take any medication, I'm definitely not an active person, I'm very good at cooping myself up inside my house and not doing much."
29627,"A few weeks ago I finally managed to find a medication that works for me, of course it did not eliminate the problem but it made it easier."
29628,"As for going to my GP, who I know quite well, I fear he would instantly see how far I have dropped and prescribe me medication ,therapy etc."
29629,"I for the first time in 3 months went out where Im not feeling ""safe""on no medication and ate burgers."
29630,Currently in therapy and taking meds for depression.
29631,I haven't had much experience in changing anxiety meds so any advice is appreciated.
29632,Hello.
29633,"I have gone to therapy on and off for the last 5 years with various different therapists and types of therapy, and tried 4 different medications, but none have worked."
29634,Is there any other avenue to getting better?
29635,"I wanted to type a whole thing about my situation but it doesn't really matter, I'm just so tired and want this to be over."
29636,It's hard to keep up hope after so long.
29637,Am I the problem?
29638,What could I do to have more success with this in the future?
29639,Thank you.
29640,I already tried medication and I don't want to anymore.
29641,Meds after meds and I finally feel a bit better.
29642,"Hello everyone,

I'm a male in my mid 20's."
29643,Back around January I started receiving counseling for a combination of anxiety and what I thought was attention deficit.
29644,"After going through full testing for ADHD, the testing center's determination was that I actually had a panic disorder."
29645,The recommendation of the guy who worked with me was to find a therapist to work through and it to consider medication as a stop gap.
29646,So today I had an appointment with a psychiatrist.
29647,They ended up prescribing me both Zoloft and Xanax.
29648,"The zoloft for daily use to deal with my general anxiety and the xanax to use as needed when I have bad panic attacks (typically these only happen maybe once a month, maybe less)."
29649,"I've never been on any kind of medication before, so I just wanted to maybe talk through it with some folks who have been or previously used this stuff."
29650,"Generally speaking my intention is that if I do start taking Zoloft daily, I don't want to need it for life."
29651,My goal is that I will learn how to control anxiety better on my own in time and not need it.
29652,I'm a little uncomfortable with the notion of needing to take a pill daily.
29653,Any general feedback about either of these medicines would be greatly appreciated.
29654,"My mind is honestly a bit all over the place right now, and I'm not exactly sure what to ask but I'm sure more questions will come to mind."
29655,"Edit: Question 1) For anyone who takes Zoloft, do you take it in the morning or at night?"
29656,With or without food?
29657,Edit 2: Question 2) I drink socially.
29658,My doctor said that if I take a Xanax I definitely cannot drink that day.
29659,She also said generally they suggest against drinking with Zoloft but that it's probably ok to do but that I should be mindful because it's common that when taking Zoloft one drink is more like two drinks.
29660,Anyone with experiences or recommendations on that?
29661,"Edit 3: Thanks for all of the support, feedback, and recommendations here guys."
29662,"I really appreciate it, I wouldn't have guessed so many people would be willing to chime in with their own experiences and suggestions."
29663,It's not near as bad as it was prior to my meds but I don't want to let it get to that point.
29664,I've had this in the past and overcame it with meds and CBT.
29665,"I want to try to get over this without relying on meds again, but another day or two and I'll go see my doc, but in the mean time I'm looking for your help."
29666,"Here's an example: as I was writing this, I was worried for a second that people would read this and say ""You're obviously just feeling the meds"" or ""why can't I feel like that?""."
29667,The idea of medication (which might reduce libido!!)
29668,"I can't be in cars too much(especially at night), I have medication which is usually needed whenever entering new social situations, and I'm basically not a sane person during finals at school because I'm guaranteed panic attacks from the lack of sleep and high caffeine intake."
29669,I took a huge first step and talked to my doctor about my anxiety today.
29670,"He was actually really helpful and suggested trying some medications if I'm interested (pristiq, anyone tried it?"
29671,Along with clonazepam for really bad days).
29672,"He also suggested I go to a counsellor, which I'm doing tomorrow."
29673,This is my first time addressing my anxiety after having had it my entire life.
29674,I feel really really hopeful!
29675,Edit: wrote the wrong drug name... Oops :P
29676,"I am taking meds due to the constant anxiety, and going to therapy (so are the kids)."
29677,"I've had anxiety issues for as long as I can remember, but in the past few months I've been seeing a lot of improvement (without medication, just coping techniques)."
29678,"I've been developing this/trying to combat this for the last 5 years, to the point that I have to carry anti anxiety meds on me at all times, and often they aren't enough for the acute attacks, only leaving the situation can solve it for me."
29679,"It all begins with a tingle, a random pin prick in a hand or a foot."
29680,"Then it sparks, traveling through your veins, every blood vessel feels like an explosion."
29681,Muscles lock and forget their purpose.
29682,The air in your lungs isn’t enough as your chest tightens.
29683,Your heart is beating almost as fast as the breaths you’re trying to take.
29684,Your stomach threatens to betray you as the dizziness says hello.
29685,It’s as if you’re taking part in the Earth’s rotation even though you’re on solid ground.
29686,Reason and logic have flown away.
29687,"You don’t want to be here, you don’t want to be anywhere."
29688,"Your eyes dart, a blurry attempt to find a way out."
29689,After a false eternity your adrenal surge subsides and you’re left shaking with barely caught breath.
29690,Is your heart racing?
29691,Welcome to my world.
29692,We’ve all experienced some degree of anxiety; maybe you’ve noticed a wasp flying a bit too aggressively towards you or forgetting where you parked your car in a crowded lot.
29693,But what happens when you’re hit with those feelings for absolutely no reason?
29694,You might have an anxiety disorder.
29695,That’s certainly the case with me; I have the paperwork to prove it.
29696,"I’m a master worrier, my fight or flight response is primed and ready to go at a moment’s notice."
29697,"It’s often without my input, but you can’t argue with your brain."
29698,"My experience in anxiety started with daily nausea in middle school, it progressed and evolved into different quirky symptoms for the next few years; sweating in winter, a foot that never stops tapping and more nausea."
29699,"Then the panic attacks started, first in response to relatively normal things, a speech in front of class or a job interview."
29700,But when they hit you in a store you’ve been into a hundred times before or while you’re driving home you realize something is off.
29701,So the various trips to the doctor’s office began.
29702,"I’ve been put on alprazolam, escitalopram, diazepam, buspirone, citalopram and hydroxyzine at one time or another with varying degrees of success."
29703,"Some do nothing at all, others made me sleep for eighteen hours straight and some don’t play well with others."
29704,"My head was a chemistry experiment for years, but I finally found the right medicines that weren’t a volatile mixture."
29705,"What they don’t tell you is that we humans as a species are a particularly adaptive bunch, so when they stopped working and the panic attacks returned I shouldn’t have been surprised."
29706,So my miracle cure wasn’t found in the bottom of a pill bottle.
29707,"Trying to take deep breaths and just relax while it’s happening is futile and exhausting, believe me, I’ve tried."
29708,It took longer than I’d like to admit to actually sit down and analyze it.
29709,You don’t get rid of diabetes or any other disease; you manage it and learn to continue living life.
29710,"I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, which means it’s not just triggered by social interactions or a specific phobia."
29711,"So I’m just left with a general sense of worry, but sometimes you have to play the hand you’re dealt."
29712,It doesn’t have to be all bad though.
29713,"Being worried means I’m more alert to my surroundings, I’d make an excellent meerkat."
29714,"I have no choice but to pay deep attention to detail, if there’s a typo in this I’m going to be embarrassed."
29715,I have a constant residual drip of adrenaline which helps in concentration; I can read a book in no time and can type seventy words a minute without trying.
29716,And if you’re having a panic attack you just want to go home so my shopping gets done really quickly.
29717,"I’m currently only on one medication and it’s only for DEFCON 1 level emergencies, but being positive and finding the strengths in my weakness has been the best medicine I’ve tried."
29718,"It hasn’t been an easy thing and sometimes it’s a day by day thing, but my anxiety is part of me."
29719,"Sure, it can be Hell, but it’s my Hell, might as well put up new curtains."
29720,Thanks for reading and for any feedback :)
29721,"Hey guys,

Like most of you, i've struggled with anxiety for a quite a few years, and having parents that firmly believe medicine can do no good for me certainly hasn't helped."
29722,"Here are a few articles about what i'm talking about so you can get a better understanding -

I'm very hopeful for this and think it could be great for a lot of people not wanting to go the pharmaceutical route."
29723,Well recently my grandparents  came for a visit and I realized that in my grandma's cocktail of medication she had clonazepam.
29724,Point is maybe I do need anti anxiety meds just havent gone to the doc.
29725,"I don't know what came over me, but after taking my medication (specifically cough syrup, because i'm sick), I started to panic."
29726,"I think I need to see a psychiatrist to at least talk about the possibility of medication, and hopefully get something that just makes my anxiety more even and a bit more toned down to a point that I can deal with it better."
29727,How long should I take the medicine before deciding whether it's working for me?
29728,"I know that there are probably some drawbacks of taking anything, I'm just really afraid of what those drawbacks are and that the medicine will turn me into ""not-me"" and no one will notice."
29729,Don't have enough time to visit a doctor and get birth control or anxiety meds.
29730,"So after dealing with years of crippling anxiety, I decided to take the plunge and get some medication for it a few days ago."
29731,"I've been taking klonopin for a little over a week now; it seems to do the trick to help me sleep, but I feel so guilty about having to take medication."
29732,"Pretty sure it's psychological now, anxiety based after the bad anxiety attack (haven't had one that bad since I got on medication)."
29733,"It's basically the square wheel of ""medication""."
29734,"Hi,

I just wanted to ask what is your view on medication for social anxiety."
29735,"In particular I'd like to know if SSRIs and MAO inhibitors treat the actual root cause of anxiety disorder, or if they merely numb the symptoms until the results of cognitive therapy show effect."
29736,This is something that is not entirely clear to me.
29737,Especially since it is recommended to take these medications no longer than a year or so.
29738,"For example, if I'm taking beta blockers before presentations, everything goes smooth and there are not symptoms of distress."
29739,"However, the underlying trigger as in fear of public speaking remains."
29740,"Beta blockers blunt the body's adrenaline response, but don't really help with the brain's reaction to stressful situations."
29741,Is this something I should seek medication for?
29742,I've always been against treating stuff like this with meds but it was the only thing I've ever done to help.
29743,Long story short: I've had a series of health issues in my life and for some inexplicable reason (I've gotten multiple doctor diagnoses on this ruling out all possible reasons) I have high blood pressure.
29744,"I'm fit, I'm young (late 20s), I don't smoke, I'm not obese, I don't drink excessively, I eat relatively okay, but I have to take two blood pressure medications to get to a relatively high blood pressure reading 130-140/80-90."
29745,When on just the one medication my blood pressure went as high as 170/100 and when I was in the hospital for a kidney surgery it was as high as 200/100.
29746,"It's really bizarre, but the doctors have diagnosed me with essential hypertension."
29747,My point being: I'm absolutely terrified I'm going to have a heart attack or stroke.
29748,"I'll be fine and then suddenly I'll get a feeling of pain in my chest or numbness in my arms, or shooting pain in my face."
29749,"I know these are symptoms of anxiety, and I have been diagnosed in the past for panic disorder and depression, but I have a hard time not thinking that it's something worse -- like a heart attack or stroke."
29750,Here's the thing -- it's irrational because my doctor told me that my chances of having a stroke at my age for this is 4 out of 1000.
29751,That's really unlikely to happen.
29752,But there are still those anomalies and I'm a pretty big anomaly myself for having this blood pressure am I not?
29753,I'm just hoping someone might be able to give me some sort of advice on this.
29754,Someone who's maybe down this path of semi-rational panic.
29755,"Meanwhile, I'm driving myself crazy and probably making my blood pressure worse."
29756,"I have a prescription for klonopin and it really helps to take it, but I don't want to have to take that all the time."
29757,Please give me any guidance.
29758,Thanks.
29759,Hi all.
29760,Sorry for the wall of text.
29761,"I've been having anxiety for the past two years, it seems to get worse everyday."
29762,"I finally saw my primary care doctor in November who put me on the lowest form of Xanax they make, he told me that if it doesn't help to seek out a Psychiatrist."
29763,The Xanax does help but I found myself taking it more often that I would like.
29764,"I decided to see a Psychiatrist yesterday to see if there was something that could help me on a daily level, that way I could keep the Xanax in case of a panic attack or for a really bad day."
29765,"She was a very nice doctor, listened to everything I told her and was very compassionate."
29766,"She told me I definitely have an anxiety disorder and put me on Sertraline 50mg at half a pill for the first week, then a full pill there after and Clonazepam 0.5mg which is to be taken mostly at night since I sometimes have trouble sleeping, this will also take the place of the Xanax."
29767,"She also mentioned that she would like me to see a Neuropsychologist to rule out ADHD, I'm kinda on the fence about being tested for this."
29768,She wants me to do the test right away but I kind of want to take what she gave me first before we even go that route.
29769,When I got home I told my husband everything and he wasn't too thrilled.
29770,"When he got out of the Army back in '03 they prescribed him Zoloft and it did not help him at all, it made things worse so he stopped taking it."
29771,"I tried to explain that everyone is different and this might actually help me, he's not convinced and told me I can't change his mind about it."
29772,"He's not pissed at me and said I should do whatever I think may help but I can tell he's a bit upset, which I'm hopping he'll get over."
29773,I also told him about the possible ADHA and as you could guess he's not too keen on that either.
29774,"I'm feeling a little lost, alone and unsure of what I should do."
29775,I don't have any friends to turn to and I definitely don't want to bring it up to the spouse right now.
29776,I'm definitely going to continue to take what she prescribed for me.
29777,I would love to hear what you guys have to say on the matter.
29778,Anyone have any experience with these medications?
29779,Any advise would be greatly appreciated.
29780,Hope everyone is having a great and hopefully stress-less day.
29781,Thanks again.
29782,I feel like I might as well not be on medication right now because this is like it used to be.
29783,Title says it all.
29784,I had a GP since birth who I recently left because he started charging a monthly fee.
29785,"Long story, but when I was with him I expressed an interest in seeing a psychiatrist."
29786,"He told me not to, because of certain tactics psychiatrists use vs. counselors."
29787,He didn't want someone trying to get me on a cocktail of medications when I really only needed one and some good CBT.
29788,So now I'm running out of Zoloft and I need to get my dose readjusted.
29789,Do I go see another GP and tell him/her my situation and ask for a reassessment of my medications?
29790,I'm on 25mg of Zoloft.
29791,"Without my meds I'm irritable, on edge, and anxious."
29792,"If I break my 50mg pill unevenly and take more than half I'm anxious, lightheaded, and can't stop zoning out."
29793,"I know y'all aren't doctors and I need to see one, but I just need some form of feedback so I'll know what to expect."
29794,"I've been on it for nearly two months now, and although my moods are under control, I have been having some of the most vivid, bizarre dreams since I started taking meds again!"
29795,"I'm so scared it was me causing the panic attacks and not the meds, even though I wasn't scared of taking them in the beginning."
29796,I'd give anything to go back to how I was before I tried the meds.
29797,"I haven't taken meds since I was 15 years old (for the OCD) and have preferred to take the holistic, natural route."
29798,"i felt so confident about the medication untill i read some text written up by a crazy activists,  saying the drug will kill you and rot your braim,  and is just out there to make money for the big coorperations."
29799,"I don't know if I should go on medicine, or if I should ask my mom to get me another referral from my doctor, or what."
29800,"I sort of want to see a therapist, but I am not sure they will do me much good, and I do not want to be put on medication or have my family think I am crazy (thirdly, it will be expensive)."
29801,"I have a lot of knowledge about behavioral medicine, and how brain and body interact, and suffering from GAD has been the most frustrating thing I've ever had to deal with, mostly due to the fact that no matter how much I understand it, it seems outside of my control at times."
29802,So I put another one on and the anxiety medication that I'm on gives me slight erectile disfunciton so I went limp for a while.
29803,"Perhaps only a coincidence, I had started taking medication that day before hearing the news, something pushed me to go to the doctor and something was starting to change."
29804,"Doctor prescribed meds for acid reflux, and no caffeine or alcohol."
29805,I want to avoid meds altogether if possible but I want to find the right path to being myself again.
29806,If that involves meds so be it ( I have family members taking Celexa for anxiety already) Or could the acid reflux really cause long-term anxiety (or vice versa?)
29807,Just started on meds.
29808,"I've been afraid of taking meds for years (didn't wanna dull my personality), but finally started having awful night terrors, and developing a serious problem with alcohol."
29809,TL:DR - finally went on meds after 30 years.
29810,"Keep the faith, you might end up far more capable than you think, just keep trying to find that right mix of medicine or alternative that works for you."
29811,I'm stacked with therapy and meds.
29812,"I'm on my third day of this medication, and this is my first time in my life taking medication for mental health problems."
29813,I just wondered if anyone else could share their experience of this medication.
29814,"I've had three anxiety attacks in a week, which hasn't happened since I started my anxiety medication 9 months ago."
29815,I also have just been diagnosed with A.D.D and am taking medicine for it.
29816,"I sent myself to a hospital and was on anti depressants and anti psychotics for several months, since I told them I thought I was psychotic, since I had read about the symptoms online...

Now I'm not taking any medication or anything but I still have some concerns."
29817,I've seen a professional who wouldn't perscribe meds; and partly because I don't want them.
29818,Have meds truly helped anyone?
29819,"I've tradionally been drawn to addictive things such as cigarettes and alcohol, and worry about addiction to the meds."
29820,I'm seeing a therapist and I'm on medication.
29821,"I have been trying to get a prescription for some anti-anxiety medication for a while, but due to a history of abuse with lorazepam/xanax my psychiatrist is refusing."
29822,I have Social Anxiety and I'm coming up to being on medication for 1 year now.
29823,She has never been on medication for it (lack of health insurance) she is constantly worried about her job and wether she will get fired over the smallest things (she is an amazingly hard worker and every employer has had nothing but outstanding things to say in her reviews) and its preventing us from getting both physically and emotionally closer.
29824,"Is there anything like an over the counter medication I could get, or something else I can try?"
29825,"I'm totally committed to trying therapy and, if need be, medication."
29826,"I would have ""peaks and valleys"" but if I timed my medication with when I knew I had stressful driving I would feel ok once it kicked in and had to drive."
29827,Aside from the drowsiness from the medication I hardly feel any anxiety at all.
29828,"I have had dizziness as my primary physical symptom; this isn't dizziness like a spinning but like the floor is moving beneath you, like you are in an elevator when you are just standing still."
29829,This is of course met with nausea and the feeling of wanting to leave whatever environment you are getting this feeling in.
29830,"I have bad HA because of some of the events that have happened in my life; one of which was the passing of my mother (whom has a birthday tomorrow) Who was misdiagnosed and sadly passed away due to malpractice, so I always want atleast a second opinion just to keep my mind at ease."
29831,These are some of the physical symptoms I have had lately which doctors keep blaming on anxiety.
29832,"-The dizziness feeling has returned
-I get really anxious in buildings that have florescent lights and have to leave almost immediately."
29833,"- I get really co-dependant, I have a fear of passing out/dying and I wont go places alone."
29834,"-I have constant post nasal drip, tonsil stones and a feeling of something stuck in my throat about 70% of the time."
29835,"-I have been getting chest pains but not sure if its the chest or the breast, the side changes but right now Its on the left side which people associate with heart issues so... yay."
29836,"- Stomach aches and nausea
-Acid reflux (on a medication for this, seems to be working most of the time except when I have bad anxiety, medication is a ppi."
29837,"- Persistant white coating on my tongue which I have to scrape off every morning, as well as a sore tongue and what looks like bite marks on the side of my tongue."
29838,"-I have been getting really achy/seem stiff, and muscle cramps in my calfs and hands."
29839,"-Burning skin sensation, feels like I have a sunburn but I don't, this comes and goes and moves arround
- Seems like my legs/arms fall asleep easily."
29840,"What I have done - I have started taking a multi-vitamin daily (well this one is 3x a day actually) I'm on a ppi for my stomach acid issue, I'm taking klonopin 2x a day at 0.5mg doses, sometimes 3x a day, and I'm trying to ""ignore"" these symptoms and just assume they are anxiety but I have a gnawing feeling something else is up, can anyone else relate to put my mind at ease?"
29841,PS.
29842,"I'm also suposed to start taking a new medication on top of the klonopin called cymbalta, I'm waiting for my doctor to come back from vacation (On the 7th) in case I have any bad side effects or I have to talk to him."
29843,"I'm very nervous about starting new pills and I have been on simmilar medications before including paxil which made me gain awit, effexor whichmade me loose weight but sleep all the time and celexa and lexapro which made me feel very ill."
29844,Anyone have success stories with cymbalta?
29845,"I developed a migraine yesterday though (ironically while talking to my new psychiatrist) and it has not yet gone away, and won't go away with OTC meds."
29846,"I can here the insults now but all i care about is not suffering,so yess the last part is GHB,i prefer gbl because it takes muc much less just a pin drop or two and i take only enough to work with my meds NOT GET HIGH.Is it a nutrient YESS.did the gov totaly screw everyone in the way they banned it YESS does it work,TOTALY does it needed to be used with extreme caution and knowledge,YESS

What it does is with the klonopin it totaly destroys anxiety ,not only that but i have plain ole social avoidance,i dont want to interact,on this combo im out there talking away.Hope this helps god bless"
29847,I'm 25 and already on blood pressure medicine and have been so for 4 years.
29848,I'm on anxiety meds now but it isn't really helping.
29849,"This lead me to talk to my psychiatrist about beginning to get off my meds since I am stable, and he thought that was a fine idea whenever I was ready."
29850,"However I'm worried that getting off my meds will take me back to how I was before, maybe worse."
29851,"Are there a lot of cases where being treated by meds and therapy for a few years, stabilizing, and then getting off meds keeps people stable?"
29852,"I know I want to get off my meds because I want to be more focused and feel like myself, but I'm worried that ""myself"" might be worse than I am now."
29853,"I can say with certainty that if it wasn't for ACA helping me get my medicine and proper therapy, I would not be here writing this."
29854,I switched off antidepressants (Prozac) to anti-anxiety medication (buspirone) to manage my GAD about six months ago.
29855,"After a few sessions, she recommended a low dosage anti-anxiety medication (Citalopram)."
29856,3) I have tried numerous anti-depressants and anxiety medication.
29857,I can't afford therapy and I'm scared of medication.
29858,"22, female, United States, I have insurance but it's under my Dad (I'm in college) and he doesn't understand this, no medication - used to be on Fluoxetine in 2011 but I didn't like being a zombie..."
29859,I'm EXTREMELY medication-sensitive (25mg/day of Seroquel had me sleeping 16 hours a day and hungry all the time) and I told my doctor this.
29860,"I also recently started on medication, after years of not needing it."
29861,"I've found Valium works through self medication (I have a friend who has the same problem, and suggested I try it)."
29862,I do not like this medicine at ALL.
29863,Has anyone been able to take control of their anxiety without medication?
29864,"I've recently come off my medicine and notice my energy level is higher, My head feels a lot clearer (though not perfect) and I feel more like myself and I haven't had any anxiety issues, which is raising my confidence."
29865,I'm trying to truck through and not use medication or therapy but I'm running out of ideas!
29866,I need to start dealing with this and I do not do very well with medication.
29867,"I read some suggestions on this subreddit about non-medication relief of anxiety (eliminating caffeine, exercise, journaling, finding hobbies) but I would be interested in any input of supplements you take and any other non-conventional things that you did or any tweaks to your diet that you made that helped your anxiety."
29868,"On Friday, I'll be going to my family doc, and I wanted to ask for a medication for my anxiety, panic attacks, and depression."
29869,My plan is to hopefully get a job before I can't afford the meds anymore.
29870,The cost of those meds are well worth the help it's giving me; of course I'd rather pay less for them if I could.
29871,I have really bad anxiety at night and the medication still hasnt sunk in.
29872,"Maybe I was caught up in worry about getting more meds (I don't like taking them), or I don't remember him saying how/why to use it, but he told me not to start taking it until my finals are over, because of possible side effects."
29873,"I've been diagnosed with panic, anxiety and social anxiety and the panic has been a lot worse lately (probably due to my finals and all these new changes to meds and whatnot)..."
29874,Took OAB medicine for a couple months (Vesicare) which helped a bit with the intensity of the feeling but didn't make it go away.
29875,I was re-diagnosed with GAD with panic attacks and started on a medication.
29876,I had stopped taking medication because I was doing great without it but as the trip got closer I realized I could not do it and stayed behind while my brother and dad went.
29877,I went into a treatment center for like 4 days in July or August and got back on medication (40mg of Paxil and 10mg of Wellbutrin).
29878,"I have taken my asthma meds and a xanax to help me, but still am breathing to fast can anybody help me right now just advice on breathing or maybe just drop into this thread for a general chat about anxiety, anything im on my own right now and need someone"
29879,"I am on meds, and for the month of December I felt pretty damn good."
29880,"I started medication that seem to be helping a bit, I was getting better at controlling my thoughts and being able to function."
29881,"I'm not currently on medication, but if this is a thing that's going to continue then I'll have to give in and get on some, because this is completely fucking exhausting and debilitating and I'm trying to find a job/live my life right now."
29882,Why would she rather take the risk with the risperdal interaction and try all these random meds when she could just put me on something that is actually meant to treat insomnia?
29883,This is a throwaway account I am not sure why its just something that im not too comfortable sharing and just in case someone knows my regular name and some info that does not pertain to the anxiety injury has been changed.
29884,I also apologize for the grammar and going all over the place in advance.
29885,Something just triggered my anxiety and I am trying to get over it right now.
29886,"So a little background, the initial injury happened 3 years ago and I ended up in the hospital for a week."
29887,"I was messing around with some friends, yes I was sober, but it was my fault."
29888,It was a warm winter day causing some snow and ice to melt then the temperature fell at night.
29889,"We were walking back to our cars after a night out and we were pushing and shoving each other, I started running to get away, just jokingly, then a friend kicked a can at me."
29890,I was running and went to kick the can as I did I slid into the side of a stone building.
29891,"I do not remember much but next thing I know I'm on the ground looking up, no pain so I try to stand up and I cant move my left leg."
29892,I reach down to touch it and thats when I feel the bones are broken.
29893,"My pattella and tip of my femur ( cracked) were broken and my tibia, fibula, and femur were almost protruding out of my leg."
29894,Took 30 minutes for an ambulance to get there even though the station was less than a mile away.
29895,Spent the next week in hospital on morphine drip and pain killers for next 4 months and physical therapy for 10 months.
29896,The whole time in the hospital I begged the doctors to just cut my leg off.
29897,They obviously wouldn't since there was no need to and i was on so many medications.
29898,I was okay after that surgery and PT getting back to normal life.
29899,"Starting to feel like I could run, the ice and snow never really got to me."
29900,"Until last year, I was walking to work, took a step outside a building after grabbing a bite to eat and next thing I know I hit the ground."
29901,Same thing try to stand up and can't move my left leg.
29902,"A minute passes by before anyone stopped to help ( 3-4 people just looked at me and kept walking, it's not that I look homeless I was in a nice button up shirt, a dressy wool jacket and dress slacks) Finally someone stopped and called 911."
29903,"Basically I rebroke my pattella, luckily I did not crack the femur again."
29904,"But basically same thing, heavy drugs, crutches for 5 months, surgeries."
29905,So in the past 2 years I have had 4 major surgeries on my leg.
29906,Warm weather came and I was fine.
29907,That was until mid summer and it started raining really hard.
29908,"I walked outside and my heart started racing, I got light headed and thought every step I was gonna take I was surely gonna fall and break something again."
29909,The feeling didn't go away while driving either.
29910,I felt like my car wouldnt stop and I would crash and get hurt.
29911,"I only felt safe inside, I had to make sure my shoes were completely dry before walking on tile or wood floors if I came in from rain or snow."
29912,Whenever I see it pouring rain or snowing or any time the ground looks wet my anxiety kicks in I start getting pain in my leg again.
29913,"I keep thinking I am slipping, I grind my teeth or bite my tongue."
29914,"Its not like I can't do it because I always end up walking in it, it just is extremely hard and I feel sick while doing it."
29915,"Now what lead me to post today, I am in university and I am on my way to take a big test, its pouring rain/snow mix."
29916,Ground is wet.
29917,While walking to class I almost wanted to cry and I could feel the pain in my left leg again.
29918,It was all around horrible.
29919,"Now I suffer from depression, anxiety, and adhd since I was 12 ( thats when I was diagnosed) I was off meds for the past year but since August I am back on them."
29920,Doctors believe I have more anxiety and OCD than depression but they believe its there.
29921,"I am on ADHD meds to help me concentrate, and sleeping pills to help me sleep due to insomnia, I am on an anti- anxiety/depression drug that helps with OCD as well."
29922,I can just stop taking this or my body thinks I am having a stoke or a seizure.
29923,I am well regulated now and don't have issues but I do not know what to do about situational anxiety that arises such as this.
29924,Anytime the ground is wet or I think is wet it happens.
29925,In the worse case scenarios the best way to explain it is that I feel like I am in space jam or a cartoon.
29926,Super lightheaded and dizzy and really antsy.
29927,"I hate the way this makes me feel and my family says they understand and my girlfriend has studied psychology at university, but they don't really understand."
29928,"They tell me just to work through it, but thats so much easier said than done."
29929,They tell me to go outside more when its rainy/snowy and walk around but they don't understand what it does to me.
29930,I try to convince myself I am making this whole anxiety up but it doesnt seem like I am.
29931,"I did buy something that helps me, these things I put on bottom of shoes, better than yak trax, but I did not bring them because I did not think it would rain/snow today."
29932,"I dont really know what I am asking, but am I experiencing just general anxiety?"
29933,is there anything I could do for this?
29934,"Again sorry about the novel, and the jumbleness I am writing this in class before my test and am just wanting to figure it out."
29935,"**Tl;Dr** I suffered two traumatic leg injuries to my left leg, now I freak out when I see the ground is wet or there is ice."
29936,I even start to feel some of the pain again.
29937,I've decided not to take my medication tonight because I wasn't able to speak to anyone due to it being Sunday.
29938,"I'm opting for the ""medication"" abortion, and I just feel like a piece of shit."
29939,But I know I need to be on medication for now.
29940,I've consulted a doctor regarding the scalp condition but I refuse to take medication for the anxiety itself.
29941,"Seeing a doctor for it, trying medication and CBT."
29942,"While I don't know if this medication is exactly the right one yet, its just a relief to know *it will get better."
29943,I'm hoping its something that can be fixed with a little tweaking of medication.
29944,I wonder if anyone has any experience regarding coming off their axiety meds?
29945,Has anyone tried st johns warts alongside meds?
29946,"I lost my health insurance, so I've been off meds for about two months now."
29947,"Will I be taking the mind numbing medication forever or, one day, will I be that awesome kick ass spunky kid I was only a few years ago without any klonopin, or celexa, or atarax, or trazadone?"
29948,It actually went alright.
29949,I really liked the guy.
29950,"I wish I could have seen a psychiatrist, but there is ONE psychiatrist within an hour's drive and he is not accepting new patients."
29951,I saw an LPC instead.
29952,"I trembled the whole way through the visit--nerves, I guess?"
29953,"Anyway, since he can't prescribe medicines, he wants me to go get an appointment with a regular doctor (I'm in the middle of switching doctors so I have to find a good one first) and then he said he'd call my doctor on the day of my appointment and talk to them about prescribing me an SSRI."
29954,"The thought of an SSRI kind of scares me, just because I know there's a lot of drug interactions and well, I've never been on any kind of daily medicine besides birth control."
29955,"I have a lot of health anxiety, and my therapist seems to think I have some OCD--the obsession being my health, the compulsion being that I take my temperature daily, even hourly."
29956,"He said the anxiety goes hand in hand with OCD, usually."
29957,"So, can anyone tell me about SSRIs?"
29958,"My mom is convinced they'd put me on Zoloft, but that's just a guess."
29959,"I did look it up and it said it's good for OCD+anxiety, but there are so many kinds out there, it's hard to tell."
29960,Are they going to make me feel like a zombie?
29961,"With all that being said, I'm really glad I took a step in the right direction to fight my anxiety by seeing a therapist."
29962,"He wants me to set small goals for myself daily, just so I feel like I have more control over my life when I complete the goals."
29963,Anyone else do this?
29964,Does it help?
29965,"I also have another appointment on the 20th of this month, which I'm actually..looking forward to."
29966,It was actually a nice change of pace to talk to someone who listened.
29967,Edit** I forgot to ask--what about marijuana and SSRIs?
29968,"I do smoke fairly regularly, and I'm getting mixed information online."
29969,"Safe to do so, or should I quit?"
29970,:\
29971,"I like this girl and pretty sure she likes me, but I have anxiety disorder and mild mood disorder but am on a good meds regime and feeling quite good."
29972,"So as my title says, does this bad point tonight mean that I'll now start turning around and finally feel the benefits of the meds?"
29973,"See a therapist weekly, take a handful of meds daily."
29974,I have suffered from severe anxiety and depression for my whole life almost and now at age 20 i am slowly getting off my medicine.
29975,"I've never taken any meds except theanine (a kind of nootropic), which I imagine help some."
29976,I've been suffering with anxiety for about 6 months now and til this I haven't touched the medication my doctor had prescribed me.
29977,"Edit: I looked at the bottle and it appear that my medication isn't xanax, but the generic brand for it."
29978,"If I was capable of ""just relaxing"" then I woudn't be on medication that did it for me."
29979,Has medication helped?
29980,Has there been negative affects/withdrawal from medication(thats what I'm most worried about).
29981,Afraid of medication but at this point I'm willing to try anything.
29982,"I shan't relay the details of my time in therapy as it will most likely not be relevant to a great many of you (didn't go straight for meds, opted for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy instead)."
29983,Hello there.
29984,"Kind of a random and vague question, but I have been experiencing increased trembling during my panic attacks."
29985,"Before it was just a general shake, but now it will be very difficult to do things such as hold objects and things like that."
29986,Its getting a bit harder to handle myself in public during these things because my hand is shaking so much.
29987,"So, does anybody know what could cause an increased tremble?"
29988,I'm even coping with my attacks better than I was before.
29989,I just tremble more too.
29990,"Also, does anybody know ways to keep the trembling down?"
29991,I do not plan on taking any medications so I'm really limited to my own mind here and/or herbal stuff.
29992,Thanks all.
29993,I have reached the point where I have to go on meds.
29994,"I know a lot of people in this thread are on meds and I don't mean to offend anyone when I say this, but I really don't want to be that girl on meds."
29995,What do people do when they can't afford medication?
29996,OK.
29997,"I'm terrible at articulating what's going on inside of me so if this seems emotionless and bland, bare with me please."
29998,"10 years ago I was raped, more than once in a span of a couple of months, I was fifteen."
29999,"Before these things happened, I was very active with my life, ambitious, very good student, etc."
30000,Wasn't afraid of anything and considered myself a tough individual.
30001,"After, I put my tall dresser in front of my bedroom window and I never left the house."
30002,"I was scared one of the guys were going to kill me in the middle of the night, because he said he would if I told, and I did tell."
30003,"The first time it happened, I was drugged at a party my ""best friend"" begged me to go to."
30004,"She set me up for it, as she had wanted to sleep with the rapists brother, but they wouldn't invite her unless she brought me, and she didn't even try to get help for me."
30005,The second time was by my half brother.
30006,The third by a drug dealer that snatched me off of the street on one of my walks home.
30007,"The 1st and 3rd time, I told, but no one believed me and I got shamed for it, even to this day I don't think anyone believes me."
30008,"I was in a relationship for seven years and constantly called a whore because ""I had been with four guys"" even though three of them were not consensual in any way."
30009,"And just to be clear, I said no, I fought as much as a fifteen year old child could, I didn't ""put myself in the situation."""
30010,I was not asking for anything in any way.
30011,"It's a small, low income neighborhood, a ""ghetto"" that I come from and these dudes were very well liked."
30012,Now I'm almost twenty six and I still don't leave my house.
30013,"I do not acknowledge men, I avoid looking them in the eye, I don't respond if one tries to talk to me."
30014,I have panic attacks ALL OF THE TIME.
30015,I used to walk every day.
30016,"I've gained weight over the years, about forty lbs, and I want to go for runs but I am deathly afraid of being snatched up again."
30017,I'm scared of red lights.
30018,I'm scared of stop signs.
30019,I don't leave my house any more much at all.
30020,"I feel stuck but if I'm out there, I feel in danger."
30021,I feel like everyone hates me probably and I feel like they laugh at me or judge me.
30022,I feel like men who look at me are going to hurt me in some way(im sorry good guys out there).
30023,I'm writing this because I can't get the right help and Idk what to do.
30024,I've been put on an extensive list of antidepressants and they don't stop me from having nightmares and panic attacks or relieve me of the fear I deal with regularly.
30025,I tried counseling a few times but I've had bad luck and my therapists were less than understanding.
30026,"""You must know that not all people are out to hurt you."""
30027,I'm fully aware of that but it's not stopping the lunacy that is anxiety and panic.
30028,The shits not logical.
30029,I think I have ptsd.
30030,Two of the last psychiatrists I've had disagree and say GAD.
30031,I don't...agree at all.
30032,I don't.
30033,ADs aren't helping me.
30034,I'm about to throw in the towel.
30035,"I've lost my job because of the rollercoaster of AD side effects already and I can't afford to see anyone, much less forking over hundreds of dollars in different ADs that don't help me."
30036,I agreed to try one more.
30037,Paxil.
30038,It's not gonna work and I know because I've tried it before but my doctor insists and gave me trazadone to help me sleep.
30039,Shit isn't working.
30040,I'm so tired.
30041,I want to live my life.
30042,"I was successful once before, in 2011, taking propranolol and .25 xanax as needed for two months to get me comfortable in new environments long enough to recognize that I was gonna be ok."
30043,"It came back, the anxiety, like two years after, and I've been once again trying to get help for it since then."
30044,"My doctor just keeps throwing ADs at me, and antihistamines, like vistaril or OTC benadryl, and im starting to get really pissed off at him for it because it's insulting to me to assume ill be an addict if you give me .25mg xanax and propranolol."
30045,"I don't drink or smoke, I have never had a history of doing those things, I never abused my medications and would never, and i wasn't always dead set on going back to those 2 meds again, I actually was the one that wanted to try ADs at first."
30046,After six different SSRIs...Im not interested in that direction anymore.
30047,"I gave 3-6 months to each new SSRI and I'm still here, frustrated and hiding under my blanket with my tablet, writing this with no idea where to go from here."
30048,I want to go to therapy.
30049,But I can't go to therapy if I'm too scared to even open up my front door and walk to my car and drive there.
30050,"This whole ""try this drug for three to six months and then well put you on another that does piss all to help for another three to six months"" is making my life way worse."
30051,My panic attacks are worse and now I'm developing a fear of new meds.
30052,I can't sleep ever because I get stuck in these awful flashback dreams and this didn't start happening until I had a few of them during my trial with Viibryd.
30053,I am broke beyond belief because I've lost my job and my savings has gone to my doctors and Walgreens.
30054,"Sometimes I consider suicide, but I'm scared of death and actually have a desire to live."
30055,I'm extremely angry at my healthcare team because they don't listen to me and now I'm stuck with them because I've thrown all my money at them blindly out of desperation for help.
30056,Don't feel I've received any.
30057,Feel worse.
30058,I am worse.
30059,"What am I supposed to do now, with no money and no means to get any?"
30060,My cars tags have had to be turned in.
30061,"I prioritized my recovery over my material belongings because I thought I'd have gotten help, and wouldn't have to worry for very long."
30062,"I started off feeling shamed for what happened to me and now I feel even more shamed, because something is wrong with my head, and my life is in shambles for it."
30063,I just wanted help.
30064,I still do.
30065,Where do I go from here?
30066,Edit: Saw my doctor (different one than prescribed the medicine) and we're dropping the dose for a bit then working up to 50 over the next couple weeks.
30067,I'm just wondering if anyone else experiences these symptoms and what you've done or used to combat them?
30068,"During most of high school, university (sometimes) and the very little time I've worked, I would wake up and immediately notice a disgusting feeling of dread that often presented itself physically in my stomach - feint or strong."
30069,Think of it as butterflies before giving a public speech but in the comfort of your own bed.
30070,"Things would deteriorate, my eyes would start to tear up and I'd sometimes cry (usually on approach to school/work)."
30071,"That's no way to live, yeah?"
30072,"This can still occur and, naturally, it has since I've begun trying to get my life back on track with an employment service who are very understanding."
30073,It's like having the emotional fortitude of a 4-year-old girl (I'm a young adult male).
30074,"I've never experienced panic attacks, shortness of breathe etc."
30075,"I suppose rather than creating a little scene, I just quietly crumble and wish to leave."
30076,So does anyone else have this?
30077,"Have any particular medications helped to ease that disgusting feeling, *particularly* upon waking?"
30078,Is there perhaps something specific for it?
30079,"I have a history of medications (spread over a long time) that did virtually nothing to erase the feeling... Paroxetine (shocking weight gain in mid-teens), Lexapro, Cymbalta, Seroquel and even Effexor 300mg."
30080,"Very little side effects, fortunately."
30081,One doctor suggested a brain scan some time ago.. is that worth a try some day?
30082,What could realistically come of it?
30083,I'm still in contact with professionals but I'd be keen to hear some opinions.
30084,Sorry for waffling on.
30085,Cheers guys.
30086,"Some backstory, me and my girlfriend have been together for almost two years and her anxiety didn't seem to be an issue until just under a year ago, so I've been digging up as much info as I can about treatments and a large portion of them keep coming back to the diet and exercise routine."
30087,"This makes sense because my girlfriend has been less active and as such has put on weight, which is making her less confident and more reliant on the medications that her doctors prescribed and marijuana to get through the day."
30088,"A few weeks ago I came home from work to find that she had binged on a half tub of ice cream, 6 prices of French toast, some eggs, bacon, and assorted snack foods."
30089,I know a portion of that is from the now copious amounts of marijuana she smokes but she has been completely unwilling to slow down in that area (it's about $20 a day).
30090,"I have tried showing her that diet and exercise will help with the anxiety but after having that talk she always assumes that I'm calling her ""a fat piece of Shit"" even when I show her articles on the subject."
30091,"She's drinking up to two large energy drinks daily, and usually buys a large candy bar or ice cream for a late night ""snack."""
30092,"I know sugar has negative effects on anxiety but I can't seem to get her to understand that, and I've tried every possible way."
30093,I need some help on this before the relationship falls apart.
30094,"As a reference I've used my past experiences of being hospitalized for what the doctors called ""sugar and caffeine induced panic attacks"" but nothing gets through."
30095,"Last week she told me it was like getting a lecture from her parents, she didn't want to listen to it because I was too much like an authority figure."
30096,But she listens to her friends advice and that is to go out for drinks every time she has a tough time.
30097,Help?
30098,"The only ""meds"" I have been taking which aren't really meds are melatonin (which I used for a week or 2 then stopped last week), and rescue remedy."
30099,Is there any medication that will help my anxiety and not leave me feeling like a zombie or ruin my memory?
30100,"I now have a better support system I feel but after realizing my anxiety was getting worse again and that it was affecting not only myself but also those around me, I decided it was time to go back on the meds."
30101,Does the emotional roller coaster of good days and bad days get better.
30102,I'm having issues where I'll have really good days for weeks at a time then BAM I just hit rock bottom.
30103,"Any suggestions on how to cope I'm currently on medications right now, I'm just having a hard time dealing with the down days."
30104,***Update: I am rescheduling my appointment for my doctors.
30105,Feeling a lot better today.
30106,Thank you everyone for the advice you gals/guys are wonderful.
30107,I went in to see another doctor and they said they couldn't really give me another medication because it was too addictive and that I would need to talk to my main doctor (I was on them before and took them under the tongue as needed.
30108,PS: Please don't mention medication.
30109,"I think she has inherited my problem, and my heart is breaking, because I can see all the behavior I used to exhibit pre meds coming out in her."
30110,I've recently gone to a psychotherapist and was prescribed anxiety meds.
30111,"I'm also going back to school in a few weeks, and I want to start some treatment (medication, therapy, or something) before I go back."
30112,"(Oh the irony) 

I have never tried medication and still is kind of afraid taking them just because of their side effects."
30113,2) Should I keep a blind eye to medication if my anxiety level is improving but other symptoms such as sad feelings and minor compulsive thoughts come on the surface?
30114,I was told that the week or so of adjustment to the meds I could have some uncomfortableness.
30115,A few of my friends have suggested therapy and medication but I'm not sure what's the first step.
30116,"I've also tried medication, which worked in the short term but made things worse over time."
30117,"Basically, I want to know if going on anxiety medication is the absolute best thing to do."
30118,"I don't know whether the doctor I'm going to see Wednesday is a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist so I don't know if he is going to be able to prescribe medication for my anxiety and I am in desperate need of SOMETHING fast because I feel like I'm losing it every day a little more."
30119,I used to take anxiety medication but I haven't had insurance for 7 years so I had to stop.
30120,"My husband said I should just call and ask if he can prescribe medication or not but I feel like I will sound like I'm a drug addict and I'm getting really bad anxiety thinking if he can't what the hell am I going to do for the next few days, months or whatever, I have things to do!"
30121,I'm looking forward to feeling the pains of anxiety and doing something about it instead of the side effects of medication.
30122,I know I'm going to get flack for forgetting my medication.
30123,Holy crap this place is packed I didnt bring my meds this is just....breathing must remember to breath.
30124,I have medication (sertraline) but I haven't started taking them yet because of my extreme paranoia concerning the rare side effects.
30125,"I'm on meds, maybe that prevents extreme panic, maybe it's not doing anything."
30126,The insomniac medicine they give me at least helps me fall asleep.
30127,He thinks that if the doctor gives me medicine that I will calm down and not mind him dating other people.
30128,"Since childhood I've felt constantly ""off,"" and I came from a very anti-meds family that subscribed to the ""just toughen up already"" school of thinking."
30129,"The whole point of bringing it up finally was because it's affected my life and recently I feel like my anxiety and depression is negatively impacting my job...but the meds I'm on aren't working and I don't know if it's just not been long enough, if I'm on the wrong medication or the wrong dosage."
30130,Do the effectiveness of meds wear off?
30131,I always thought herbal medicine was a bunch of pseudoscience bullshit and I was and still am an extreme skeptic of everything that's not clinically tested and proven to work.
30132,This is just one of many times we have tried to contact hospitals and institutions to get me some long lasting therapy or adjustment of medication.
30133,Family life is ok. Not on any meds.
30134,"I have been on quite a few meds, though none of the good stuff (lol)."
30135,"Recently I stopped taking my medication (Welbutrin, Cymbalta and Vistaril) and have been doing fine."
30136,"Yes, this can be a result of the lingering general anesthesia or the pain killer they gave me right after the operation (I'm very sensitive to medication, but have not been taking anything but Tylenol because my anxiety is not severe)

Here's the thing--I've made two calls to hotline nurses in the past two days to find some reassurance that what I'm experiencing--the insane fatigue--is simply caused by the anesthesia, and that it will go away soon."
30137,Is the medicine they gave me after my surgery going to effect my well being?
30138,"I am seeing a therapist and I'm on medication, and while those have helped few things give the instant relief that talking to my parents or close friends give."
30139,"For clarification: I'm 21, Female, on no medication, and from the US."
30140,"Please, I've been thinking about coming off this medicine for a while, what are my alternatives for medication?"
30141,"I was put on medicine and it seemed to be helping and I was perfectly fine throughout the whole summer, even got myself a boyfriend."
30142,I'm taking this medication now every time I feel like I'm going to have an attack.
30143,"Then I came back in the room with the two of them when they called me in, and the psychiatrist plainly told me that she could prescribe me medication that very day."
30144,"But she also stated that she needed samples or tests of blood and a physical from me, and I agreed to take a physical from my own doctor, then give her the results, and after she's seen the results, by that point I will have decided to take medication or not and notify her of my decision."
30145,"And she'll decide on which meds to give me, based on other things, like if I had bad cholesterol or blood pressure issues, etc."
30146,"It can be a bit confusing because I'm already confusing myself, but uh, I never intended to start therapy straight with medication."
30147,"But basically the russian lady seemed like she was more than happy to prescribe me medication, which worried me a bit or made me feel paranoid."
30148,"I mean, I just thought it was unsafe, to prescribe meds immediately to a patient who you just met."
30149,So she's only recommending meds based on the conversation that I had with her.
30150,"But uh after my dad and I agreed to get the physical done, and then decide whether to start on meds or not, the psychiatrist asked if it was okay for me to take a urine drug test."
30151,I have 6 weeks to decide whether or not I should take medication for my anxiety/ depression.
30152,"I don't even know what the meds will be for, to be honest."
30153,"I just remember the russian lady telling me that she recommends I take medication, because she thinks it will be good for me."
30154,"Bear with me because I'm going to try and get everything I can in here, i'll include a TL;DR of course, here goes...

My youngest sister is 16 and has been having anxiety attacks for the past 3 months or so."
30155,"She seems to struggle with attending school, namely large assembly's."
30156,"It extends elsewhere as she can't handle sitting through difficult topics (war torture, surgery discussion)."
30157,I myself have had panic attacks int he past starting around age 19 so I have experience with the issue.
30158,When being treated I always resisted going on daily meds because doctors insisted that I needed anti-depressants when I kept telling them I was a generally happy person who was just going through some heavy things (2 suicides to people close to me within 6 months)  I worked through my anxiety through use of xanax when attacks were really really bad and just learning behavioral patterns to help pass these attacks by.
30159,This took months and years of learning but I now have a very good handle on my attacks and haven't had one occur in at least a year now.
30160,However my question comes back to her.
30161,Doctors have told her she needs prozac and all of these anti-depressants on top of xanax for episodic relief.
30162,My sister has been open with me and does not seem to be depressed at all beyond some despair about what is happening with these attacks and not knowing how to get through it and back to her normal self.
30163,I have staunchly rejected the notion that she needs anti-depressants based on my experiences and talks with her.
30164,Am I doing a disservice by continuing to recommend she take xanax episodically coupled with therapy sessions to talk her issues out over listening to a psychiatrist who has had her on three medications in three visits?
30165,My parents are a bit older and out of their element when it comes to issues like this so they sort of believe whatever doctors tell them but as someone who's been dealing w psychiatrists on and off for 9 years I feel I'm better equipped (I'm 28 fyi).
30166,"So overall question is, what is the best way I can help my sister out?"
30167,"TL;DR:  16 y/o sister has begun having anxiety attacks, am I wrong to recommend what worked for me specifically due to a mistrust of anti-depressants which may have been a contributing factor for two suicides of people close to me?"
30168,"I stopped taking my anti depressants/anti anxiety meds, I was doing so well."
30169,Now I've been to weddings and parties without taking any benzos and managing my anxiety mentally (I am on long term meds - Prozac and Wellbutrin).
30170,I am starting medication on Monday and will also be starting classes focused on dealing with Anxiety too.
30171,Did any specific medication or therapy help?
30172,Any medication ideas?
30173,I can't stop the panic without medication.
30174,The only thing that gives me any relief is anti-anxiety medication.
30175,"I've spoken with both my therapist and my doctor about this and have a generic Klonopin for days when it is overwhelming (I do not take daily medication for my disorders, and I'm trying to avoid such), and a lot of the thought process was that it was surrounding my inability to be active after an injury, but now that I'm active again, the anxiety is continuing."
30176,"under medication, the anxiety is loads better."
30177,I'm out of my anti-anxiety meds and will see the doctor only next week.
30178,"I haven't had medication for a long time for various reasons, but day-to-day life is pretty much fine and I have coping techniques that help with work, etc."
30179,"I've had chronic constipation since I was an infant, but this acne medicine made things way worse and I've never felt the same."
30180,"Even though I now had the medicine to help me, my parents still wondered why I would get anxiety in the first place."
30181,"My problem is, I feel too dependent on this medicine."
30182,I want to get off of this medication and be able to relax at nights without it.
30183,I don't know if I need medication or a therapist.
30184,"About a year ago when I was in college I also did have panic attacks in class but at that time I never sought counseling/medication because I thought everything was in ""my head"" and just needed to get over it."
30185,"It seems obvious to me that my doctor, who is familiar with the fact that I have a panic disorder, would make sure that any medication for other issues wouldn't cause anxiety."
30186,"Luckily my husband put two and two together and looked up the side effects of the new medication: anxiety, problems with sense of identity, and hallucinations."
30187,"ANYWAY, I explained to him (against his advice) that I cannot stay in Jordan for the duration of the 'healing process' from the meds (Cypralex and Deanxit were the commercial names)."
30188,"I went home, told my mom that I stopped the meds and that my doctor committed suicide."
30189,I don't know what to do anymore.
30190,"I feel lost, hopeless."
30191,"I'm going to be 26 tommorrow, and my entire life, i've tried to make everyone around me happy, comfortable, even at the cost of my own happiness or comfort."
30192,"I worry, Constantly, that everyone is upset, that I *wronged* everyone around me..."
30193,"I worry what people think of me, if i've ""upset"" someone, or wronged them one way or another."
30194,"I worry that people talk shit about me behind my back, I worry that I'm not good ""enough""... that i always come up short..."
30195,"I worry no matter how hard I try, nobody will ever see how much I really am trying to be happy, and worry-free..."
30196,"I worry, because I feel scared, anxious, wanting to be happy myself, but also trying to make everyone else around me happy as well."
30197,I have a friend who has been there for me for the past 8 years.
30198,"He's bent over backward for me several times... trying to help me, help me ""improve myself"".. help me become **human**.... because I don't feel like I am."
30199,"I feel like i'm worthless to people when they're upset, and I can't do anything to cheer them up, or when they're noticeably upset, and I ask ""what's wrong?"""
30200,"and I get the famous: ""Nothing."""
30201,"Lately, he and I have talked about this topic, as we have many times, and it always comes down to one simple thing: I need to ""relax""...."
30202,I need to calm down...
30203,"I need to take a big deep breath, and just let go my ""fears"" and my ""worry""."
30204,Do I do that?
30205,No.
30206,"Growing up, I've been bullied, Hazed, Harrassed, and Judged by everyone: Peers, Teachers, Parents... Everyone around me."
30207,"I had parents tell teachers they didn't want their child in the same class as me because I had a ""teachers aide"" at one point, because the school pushed my parents to put me on a plethora of meds that I didn't need for something called ""ADHD""."
30208,why did they diagnose me with that?
30209,Because I refused to follow along with the rest of the class.
30210,"I'd jump ahead, do my homework in class..."
30211,I was SMART.
30212,"I was bright... i was friendly... but they stifled the flame when they could and prevented me from being ""free"" until much later in my life."
30213,"My childhood growing up, I was constantly in *FEAR* of other people."
30214,"I've never told anyone this, not even therapists, because i've always been worried that i'd be ""Judged"" accordingly."
30215,I have a problem with Judgement.
30216,A big problem...
30217,"I have one friend, and he's stuck by me for the past 8 years now, going on 9 this summer...  and what do i do?"
30218,"I worry about if I've upset him, or when he's being quiet, maybe it's something I did...."
30219,"I worry that my bills won't get paid, and I pester him about it, and as he put it once: ""I slap him in the face with a metaphorical dick"" every time I worry."
30220,"For the past 2 years, i've known a girl whom I fell in love with, we've been dating, despite my worry, and my fear of trusting others, worrying that they'll judge me or that they'll set me up to hurt me somehow... because I mean come on, my entire life, It's been one after the next, just people going out of their way to hurt / upset me... to make me into a spectacle."
30221,"She just texted me to tell me she wants to stop dating, and be friends, because I worry too much."
30222,"I worry too much that she might like someone else, or that she's upset about something I did or didn't do...  and I poke, I prod, I try to find out why she's upset, why she's sad, but it's only because I love her and want to see her happy... instead, I pushed her away to the point where she loves me, but she doesn't want to be with me until I can stop my worry."
30223,I'm a wreck right now over this.
30224,At work...
30225,I constantly worry that I don't do a good enough job...
30226,I'm a perfectionist in ways....
30227,I have OCD.
30228,Was diagnosed at an early age and I spend alot of time obsessing on perfectionism though it's not universal.
30229,"When i do a job, It needs to be nothing less than perfect.. because only perfect can do."
30230,"I'll spend hours cleaning a bathroom, where the average person will take minutes... Why you may ask?"
30231,"Because it's a reflection of ME...  my work, my sweat and blood, is ME... and people will judge ME based on how clean that bathroom is."
30232,"At work, it's the same thing..."
30233,If I get told to get something done and do XYZ...
30234,"I go above and beyond, even when not asked..."
30235,I make sure it's done PERFECTLY... why?
30236,"because I know i'll be judged on the quality of my work.... And nothing less than Perfect, is okay with me."
30237,"At this point, the girl I love is pulling away, telling me she wants to be friends until I can learn not to worry that she's seeing someone else, or worried that she's mad at me, when she may just be mad that she lost $5 in the couch...  My best (and only friend other than the aformentioned girl I am / was dating) friend, feels helpess when trying to give me advice, or guide me... because as he put it: ""I think even if you give a fuck deep down, you still come across like an asshole""

I am always anxious, nervous, worried... And I want it to STOP..."
30238,Medication is not an answer for me.
30239,"I realize that my worries are my own doing, and I don't want to ""Mask"" or cover them up, I want to get rid of them..."
30240,"Sometimes All I need to make me relax is a hug and being told ""It's going to be okay"".. but nobody ever does that...."
30241,I am posting this because I feel that maybe the reddit community can give me some insight.
30242,"I thought of posting under a throwaway, but Fuck it... Judge me, I need to not fear judgement... and me hiding behind a throwaway will only perpetuate my fear of judgement... so what if someone reads this, maybe they'll see I'm actually trying to be a better person... and what's wrong with that?"
30243,Nothing.
30244,"so go ahead, Judge, poke, prod, I'll answer any question.."
30245,I just want to stop worrying.
30246,"EDIT:

A brief summary of my life:

In Pre-K, I was ""Different""."
30247,"I wanted to always build things, when everyone else was drawing."
30248,"Instead of being encouraged, i got disciplined."
30249,"In K-2: My ""differences"" caused the school system to push my parents into putting me on Ritalin, which caused health problems, so a series of other meds, just to counteract the effects... eventually i developed Tortures Syndrome, No, I don't yell words, or curse randomly..."
30250,"I just shrug my shoulders, pop my shoulder out of it's joint, make a chicken motion with my arms, and blink alot like i'm having a siezure."
30251,"At one point in 1st grade, I tied a jumprope around my neck and threatened to kill myself..."
30252,"Mind you I had been basically ""High"" on a handful of psych drugs at the age of 6."
30253,"In 3-4: I was the target of constant bulling and hazing by the various ""cliques"" in my school."
30254,I was the target of 99% of the school's bulling...
30255,I hated myself.
30256,"I was ""fat"" after I was taken off the meds, causing me to balloon from 45lbs to 90 lbs in about 2 months."
30257,"Yes, I was 40-45lbs in 4th grade..."
30258,"Eventually it became so bad, the school reccomended a ""special ed"" program in a different school district... because i couldn't make friends, or have any ""healthy"" social interactions since I just basically took abuse from everyone around me."
30259,"mind you it was a special ed class, in a regular school district, a town over."
30260,"In 5-6: I was moved to a special ed class where I was placed with 3 other students, two who had aggression issues, one who bit me / would throw things at me and threaten me in class, the other, who would show up with his ""gang"" during lunch, and beat the shit out of me, and tell me that if I ever told anyone, he'd **kill** me (just before kicking me in the nuts while i'm laying on the ground)."
30261,"I stayed quiet, taking the abuse for 2 full years... eventually I discovered girls, and I became attracted to these two girls, G and T I will call them here."
30262,"G was my best friend and only friend, she'd give me a hug, tell me it was okay, and she was made fun of too because she played video games, and she was ""different""."
30263,"She was a bit of a nerd, and I liked it, I liked that we could get along, and not care what everyone else thought of us...  She ended up dating this other guy who i'll call E.  Then there was T..."
30264,"I liked her, because she'd flirt with me."
30265,"She was older than me by 2 years, and I thought she was cute... she only led me on, to make fun of me behind my back, and would set me up to make a fool out of myself in front of everyone on several occasions..."
30266,I began to regret ever liking her.
30267,"In 7-8: I was moved back to my home district after the other school, said i was ""too much to handle"" since I was constantly complaining I was being bullied, that I felt I wasn't being challenged by the work... and that I felt depressed all the time."
30268,My parents refused to put me on any medications so the school told me i basically had to go.
30269,"In 7th grade, i was placed into a special ed class instead of mainstream..."
30270,"I spent most of my day in that class, with students with severe learning disabilities."
30271,"I was learning 2nd grade math, in 8th grade..."
30272,I was bored.
30273,"I fought tooth and nail and made it my mission, to get into ""main stream"" classes by the end of 8th grade."
30274,"When I reached chemistry in 8th grade, i had a teacher whom I will always be thankful for."
30275,"She knew I was smarter than what people said, she knew I had the abilities, so instead of giving me the ""reduced"" test reserved for kids in the special ed curriculum, she gave me HS work, just to see if I could do it... She was giving me assignments and tests designed for a 9-10th grd level... and I was scoring 80's and 90's.... she was impressed and later in the year, i basically became a lab assistant where she took time to help me learn algebra, Trig, and how to write essays."
30276,"She *is* an amazing teacher and i wish there were more like her out there... Sure, none of the other students liked her, because she didnt' take crap from anyone, but she pushed to their fullest potentials... she really prepared us for what we were goign to see in HS... and allowed us to think ""Outside the box"" by giving us projects that made us actually *think*... not just learn to take tests."
30277,"9-12:  I was bullied, harassed, I was tracked back into the ""Essentials"" track, which was primarily for students who got C's in pre-HS or students who wanted to go to a technical school, not college.I fought for 4 years, to break out of that track... and for everyone out there who've been tracked... you know how hard that really is to do..."
30278,"I had the school against me, because I was constantly bullied... this was before zero-tolerance laws... rather than punishing the bullies, they punished the bullied, by removing me from the class, or the situation and sending me to the principal to ""sit it out""."
30279,"This was detrimental to my social growth, and my academic success."
30280,"I worked my hardest, and by my senior year, i was taking AP courses, and even a college-level environmental science and forensic class complete with a syllabus and 20 page + papers."
30281,"I was getting straight A+'s in both classes.... whereas the essentials classes, i was getting B's, C's, and D's, because I was bored..."
30282,"I had no challenge, and I was constantly bullied in those classes... which distracted me."
30283,I graduated HS with a 2.89.... an SAT score of 1250 on the OLD scale.
30284,an AP score of a 4 on the Computer Science AP exam and got accepted into my first pick school early decision.
30285,"I started College, and figured, i'd put my past behind me.... none of those ""kids"" would be there with me... so I opened myself up, and tried to be nice to everyone..."
30286,"I tried to befriend everyone I could... and thus I got taken advantage of... time and time again... Hazed, made fun of... ""Oh you don't drink?"
30287,"you must be a NARC""..."
30288,"I had Listerine dumped in my eyes, condoms placed around my head while I was sleeping and on my door handles (used in those cases)...."
30289,"I had my shampoo swapped with grape jelly... every prank you could imagine... finally the school had to remove me and place me into a single after one student threatened to kill me because he got arrested for drugs, and accused me of ratting him out since I didnt' drink or do drugs / would go to bed early, and was always tryign to help out the RAs with stuff around the building..."
30290,I like to make people happy...
30291,"Shortly there after, i met my friend I mentioned above."
30292,"If it wasnt' for meeting him, and having some hope that I'd get through college alive, I was going to drop out and give up at that point..."
30293,"I don't think he really realizes how much he's helped me over the years, because I continue to struggle with trusting people, and being afraid of being judged by others...."
30294,"I worry way too much, and now, at 26 years old (my birthday is tommorrow), I've got my girlfriend not wanting to be with me, my best friend telling me that I need to stop worrying about everything, and I have never felt this helpless / anxious in my life (outside of nearly being kicked out of college for playing a joke, but that's another story... the summary:  Not all jokes are funny... and some may actually hurt other people's feelings)."
30295,"Outside of all the school BS, I've dealt with the fact i've had overprotective parents, who care about me, but have always clung to me constantly on a short leash..."
30296,"I've never been able to spread my wings and fly...  the pink floyd song ""Mother"" sums that up pretty well...

tl;dr: This is me... all of me..."
30297,I have nothing to hide...
30298,"I've laid out the story of my life, quite literally, so maybe I can get an outsider's perpsective..."
30299,"I realize there may be trolls, and I realize there may be genuinely good people on here who want to help...  and i AM afraid of being judged, but i'd rather rip off the bandaid quickly, than pull it hair by hair year after year..."
30300,This is me...
30301,This is my Story...
30302,I do take medication but it does not help much.
30303,"They looked for a psychologist (briefly) but could not find one that would take adolescents (I had just turned 17), so they decided to just get me medication instead."
30304,So I cut my medication in half (5 mg to 2.5 mg) for two days before going off completely (my psychiatrist recommended this).
30305,"So, long and short of it is that I was finally diagnosed with ADHD two years ago."
30306,I am a 29 year old woman -  my dad wasn't the type of person to believe in any type of 'mental health' issues?
30307,I guess you'd call them that?
30308,"Depression, anxiety, ADHD, any of it."
30309,"He found those type of issues to be embarrassing, a reflection on him as a parent."
30310,"Would always make me feel guilty about my issues, saying 'what kind of parent will people think I am?'"
30311,.
30312,You get the point.
30313,"Anyway....two years ago I finally saw a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with ADHD officially, along with generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD."
30314,He prescribed me both Ativan and Adderall.
30315,"I took 15mg of adderall twice daily, and 0.5mg of Ativan as needed for the anxiety."
30316,"In the beginning, I felt odd."
30317,"Indescribable, really."
30318,"But roughly a week into taking the medications, I realized a lot of my anxiety went away with my ability to concentrate more effectively."
30319,That sounds odd when I say it like that it's the best way I know to explain it.
30320,I was awarded a promotion at work immediately after beginning the medication and began working out of town for weeks at a time.
30321,I became overwhelmed with the new job and stopped seeing my doctor.
30322,About 3 months later I was brought back home full time for another promotion that I dove into and struggled with for over a year.
30323,My entire life I have been a perfectionist and someone who strives to achieve more than what is asked of me.....and I just could not GET this new job.
30324,"No matter how hard I tried, I constantly felt behind."
30325,It killed me.
30326,I have spent the past year miserable and on the verge of insanity.
30327,"In April I was switched to another position that is a much better fit and that I am excelling much easier in, but I still find myself falling behind on little tasks and whatnot."
30328,"One night at work it occurred to me that when I was on the medications, for the first time in my life, working didn't feel like a struggle."
30329,It was something that I was actually able to concentrate on without killing myself to do so.
30330,In May I attempted to schedule an appointment with my old psychiatrist but for some reason he would never return my calls or many many messages.
30331,I decide to find a different Dr.
30332,"I see him, explain everything I've just explained in this post, and ask him if there is a chance of restarting my old regime as that was the first time in my life I wasn't a complete ball of anxiety and junk."
30333,"He basically tells me no, no chance of it."
30334,The only thing he will prescribe me is depression medication.
30335,"I tell him no thank you, I have been on 4 different types of depression medication spanning roughly 8 years, I do not like the way it makes me feel and I do not feel depressed currently."
30336,I just feel anxious among unable to focus on things in general.
30337,"He tells me that I should really try the depression medication, I once again decline and that is the end of the conversation."
30338,I schedule an appointment with a different Dr a couple of weeks later.
30339,"Same conversation, essentially."
30340,"She tells me no, persuades me to try the depression medication."
30341,"I tell her no, once again, and leave."
30342,I am now finding myself terrified to go to another Dr to try again.
30343,I feel like I'm coming off like a drug seeker?
30344,I don't know.
30345,And I don't mean for that to be derogatory towards those with addiction issues either.
30346,"I just know for the first time in my life, I felt clear headed."
30347,I didn't feel anxious every second of every day.
30348,My foot didn't shake constantly.
30349,I didn't pick at my fingers or fidget with my hair or scratch at my legs.
30350,"I just felt....normal, I guess?"
30351,I didn't feel like I would implode at any moment.
30352,Has anyone else been shut down by their Dr's?
30353,Is telling them what worked for me before not something I should be doing?
30354,I'm at a loss and I just don't feel very confident in continuing to try to be out back on medication.
30355,Sorry for the wall of text.
30356,I started typing and couldn't stop.
30357,"What also bothers alot is that I won't take any action i.e therapy, self help, meds because if all those things don't work, I am truly lost."
30358,"I just said I felt fine, school is going well, the medicine is working great, whatever."
30359,He strongly feels I just need more medication but I strongly feel dead inside when I'm on them.
30360,I'm not a regular drinker and I don't do any drugs or abuse my meds but they almost Marchman Acted me last night so I know I must've been pretty bad.
30361,I don't know if it was the meds mixed with the alcohol or if I just had a drunken panic attack.
30362,"I've been offered anti anxiety medicine, but I'm scared of it."
30363,"Although not a proponent of meds, at this stage I am willing to try anything to suppress my panic disorder."
30364,I (19F) finally went to my doctor after dealing with horrible anxiety and panic attacks everyday for almost 3 months and I was put on medication.
30365,It makes me feel completely wrung out and I can still feel the anxiety underneath although the medication dulls it.
30366,"Unfortunately,  the medication that is necessar for brain feedback therapy causes synesthesia, or an ability to feel sounds through neurological impulses."
30367,"I know how important it is to be on a stable medicine plan and I would never make an irresponsible snap judgement, but Im starting to think i may need a change."
30368,No amount of medication or counseling helps.
30369,"It's originally a blood pressure medicine, but it's also prescribed to help reduce nightmares caused from PTSD."
30370,Does anyone else have experience with this medicine?
30371,Two have prescribed medication.
30372,"Some days I can deal, other days I've had to ""put myself to sleep"" using medication because the anxiety was just too much to deal with."
30373,My meds don't fucking work and I'm in the process of changing from an SSRI to an SNRI to see if that actually fucking does something for once.
30374,"I just moved 30 minutes away from him, and have contemplated getting a new therapist, but I'm paranoid of telling someone I don't know my problems and them maybe not putting me on the same medication."
30375,I told my therapist today I wanna put the kibosh on this once and for all and I even told her I'm willing to try nutritional solutions (Since my two rounds of meds didn't end wend for me) to finally get myself on track.
30376,I am on the borderline of a panic attack.
30377,"My anxiety is very high right now, it almost feels like something as slight as a pin dropping could set me off into a full blown attack."
30378,I have not felt this way in a while.
30379,"For starts, I'm 25 y/o, female, and have bipolar (I'm on medications..lithium, lamictal, and clonazepam for the anxiety mostly)."
30380,I think my issue is that work is stressing me out.
30381,"I travel sometimes for work, but this month I have traveled every week, only being at home on the weekends."
30382,And tonight I'm in a crappy motel.
30383,"It's loud, there's not much security, the room is SUPER tiny, so the environment mixed with ""I miss my home, and my dog, and my friends"" is just a lethal combination."
30384,"But I don't know what else I can do, fellow redditors."
30385,I've already taken my medicine.
30386,I don't want to take more than the regular dose.
30387,I just can't control my own thoughts right now and it's making me feel nauseous and my head hurts and I just want an escape but there is none.
30388,I HAVE to stay for work.
30389,And all other hotels in the area are booked.
30390,I can't take a walk (normally helps) because the area is unsafe.
30391,I'm trapped.
30392,And so I am panicking.
30393,I figured writing it out would help because I don't have anyone to call.
30394,"I mean, I DO, but I don't want to burden them, you know?"
30395,My dad is really sick so I don't want to wake my parents.
30396,I guess I just needed to vent.
30397,And maybe hear ideas on other coping mechanisms.
30398,Arghh this is hard...internet hugs to anyone feeling the same way right now.
30399,"EDIT: Thanks guys, so much."
30400,I'd thank you all individually but I'm actually sleepy and relaxed tonight!
30401,Yay!
30402,Funny how it (anxiety and panic) always seems like it's never going to go away...but it always does.
30403,Logically I should be able to remember that and get my thoughts under control.
30404,Oh well.
30405,"I do greatly appreciate your support, I'm glad I found this subreddit...lol I just typed in the URL reddit.com/r/anxiety and assumed it was out there!"
30406,Thanks again!
30407,"He accepts that he has anxiety issues, but he refuses to get help and accuses me of ""badgering"" him whenever I bring up medication and/or therapy."
30408,and that he doesn't want to take medication.
30409,I'm also leery about being put on a permanent medication.
30410,"The doctor, i have been seeing would not prescribe me a take as needed anixety medicine bc of my age and how addicting they can become."
30411,I have been feeling hopeless and afraid that I may only find relief by taking medication.
30412,I really don't want to take medication as I know they can be very addictive and hard to stop using and I really want to be able to do this on my own.
30413,Is it possible to find relief away from medication?
30414,"Before this, I started taking Dramamine (a motion sickness medication sold over the counter, usually at 7-11's or drugstores) to calm my stomach down."
30415,"Hey guys, so l am prescribed seroquel and last night I took one and about 2 hours after I walk upstairs and that feeling of the medicine kicking in hit me full on and I passed out and had a short seizure-type thing and was out for a few seconds, medics came and said everything looks okay but the rest of the  time I was trying to eat, I kept feeling like it was happening again so I would lay on the floor."
30416,Should I keep taking my meds?
30417,"He is taking medication for it, but he still gets attacks when triggered."
30418,"I think I need medication, but I can't afford it."
30419,"I'm supposed to give the meds about two weeks before talking to my doctor, but should I mention this sooner or will it potentially go away after a couple more days?"
30420,"Ive been to my gp who reckons i also do and gave me a careplan and referrals to see specialists, especially about medication but i dont really want to go see them nor can i bring myself to do so."
30421,I have been depressed for a while and after upping a dose of one of my meds last week my anxiety has gotten harder to deal with.
30422,"I got allergy medicine in case of allergies, didn't do anything."
30423,Have any of you ever had to stop using Ativan or other benzodiazepines because of the amount of time you had been using the medication?
30424,"I've applied for college and am waiting upon acceptance, and really I should have been working the past two years but I started having panic attacks, got depressed and started meds (cipralex, and now effexor)."
30425,"Just felt like sharing a new development in my struggle with anxiety:

After months of therapy, starting a couple of new medications, and working very hard on keeping life in the proper perspective, I feel *normal* for the first time in years."
30426,"Life still has its stressors, and I still don't get nearly enough sleep, but finally, I don't feel like I'm in a daily struggle to maintain composure."
30427,"I am now taking hurdles in stride, I recover from anger so much more quickly, and I find that I am suddenly much more empathetic and have a better sense of *connection* to others."
30428,"Hell, I've even started being somewhat open about my struggle, and it turns out, a lot of the people I've spoken with are relieved because they realize they're not the only ones."
30429,"TL;DR - the journey's not over by a long shot, but for those of you just starting, there *is* a light at the end of the tunnel; you just have to keep walking."
30430,"I've got general and social anxiety and am currently on Buspar (buspirone), my third medication attempt."
30431,"So far, I have liked Buspar the most."
30432,It's been about a month and my general anxiety is about 80% gone and social anxiety is decreasing a little slower.
30433,"My only problem is that it is not addressing my inability to concentrate, which no medication has been able to do (some making it even worse)."
30434,I don't want to try out yet another medication.
30435,"The weaning and building up periods are stressful and emotional for me, regardless of how slow I do it."
30436,I also have been seeing a counselor weekly.
30437,"I'm going to see my doctor in three days, but wanted to ask here about some potential options."
30438,"I understand that nothing changes over night, but I need some improvement sooner rather than later so I don't flunk out of school and lose my scholarships."
30439,"Without changing my current medication, what are some things I can do to increase my concentration?"
30440,Is it common to prescribe medications for concentration along with anxiety medications?
30441,"Is there any ""natural"" remedy or cognitive exercises I can do to keep from having to take any more medication?"
30442,Any help or feedback would be greatly appreciated!
30443,It's only been three weeks and I feel like I'm at my wits end.
30444,"This anxiety attack isn't the worst I've ever been through, but in this short span of time I've taken three trips to the hospital, had a full physical, had to start up on SSRIs again, had to weasel out of job duties for fear of having an anxiety meltdown on site, had to give up alcohol entirely because it exacerbated things dramatically, and had to take Ativan AND Valium multiple times just to get by though I swore benzos off years ago because of how quickly my body becomes addicted to them."
30445,"I've become utterly unable to go anywhere without having someone I know with me (usually my mom), and even then it's dicey."
30446,I'm just barely able to be on my own for any length of time as it is.
30447,"My life is absolute shit, and the worst part about it is I actually felt like I was starting to get it together a few short months ago."
30448,Now that feels like a million years ago.
30449,"What few friends I have simply don't understand what I'm going through, and I have no SO to speak of (and probably won't again ... not much of a dating market for cowards)."
30450,"My mother is the only one I can depend on as she suffers from panic attacks as well, but I feel absolutely pathetic relying on her as a 29-year-old man."
30451,"I feel as if I have tried everything to amend my anxiety, and nothing has helped."
30452,"In the past two years, I've given up caffeine entirely, been on and off SSRIs and Benzos, taken supplements, tried holistic medicines, attempted to break up my day with physical activity, changed my diet, and cycled through numerous therapists and psychiatrists."
30453,"I've had an endless number of tests done on my heart, brain and stomach since this all started, and not a single clear test result ever seems to convince me that I'm actually fine."
30454,Because I don't bloody **feel** fine.
30455,I can't do this anymore.
30456,"I have people telling me I should do this or that - find a new doctor, get some other tests, try massage therapy, try a myriad of other medications, start up a workout routine - and maybe they're right, maybe one of those are the solution."
30457,But I just can't.
30458,I don't have the strength.
30459,I just want it all to be over.
30460,"Life, I mean."
30461,"Kinda funny, I know: someone who's afraid to die having a death wish, but I'm just so tired of being scared."
30462,"I'm tired of trying to have faith that things will somehow get better, because how could they?"
30463,I don't care anymore; I really don't have anything to live for anyway.
30464,Can medication help?
30465,I can get medication but my brain is sometimes stronger than the chemicals.
30466,"I'm 23, and I've never kept a job over 3 days."
30467,"I have social anxiety, GAD, and ""moderate"" depression and several physical health problems."
30468,"I've applied for SSI and such, but they kept turning me down."
30469,They say I can work.
30470,I need to work.
30471,"I'm independent and right now I rely on my family, and I get shit for being a bum everyday."
30472,So I started working as a cashier.
30473,Today was the first time I was on the register alone.
30474,"When I had questions, nobody wanted to help me."
30475,"I tried to get the attention of my supervisor, and she wasn't paying attention."
30476,"Meanwhile, people in my line got mad."
30477,I'm not learning fast enough.
30478,"I still have to ask 3 or 4 times how to do some of these things, and people look at my like I'm a complete idiot."
30479,I got yelled at for having to leave my register.
30480,My heart was pounding and I felt like I was going to throw up.
30481,I went to the bathroom and had to go.
30482,I never have to go randomly.
30483,"At the end of the day, I was so relieved."
30484,It wasn't AS bad as I thought it would be.
30485,The person who helped me close my lane down was talking about what a bad day she had.
30486,I was putting my money into a plastic bag and I accidentally started to tear a strip off not thinking.
30487,She stopped me and I'll never forget the look in her face.
30488,"She said 

""Why did you do that?"""
30489,Her eyes widened and she looked at me like she hated me at that moment.
30490,I had never had anyone look into my eyes like that.
30491,"I just stammered and said ""I'm sorry, I didn't know not to""."
30492,"Tears started streaming down my eyes, but I didn't sob."
30493,I was embarrassed but couldn't stop them.
30494,"She saw and I kept muttering stuff about how I'm sorry, it's my first day doing this."
30495,"For some reason, she got nicer and told me not to worry."
30496,"She told me I was shaking and to relax, but I don't even think I was shaking."
30497,I just wanted to leave and go home.
30498,"As soon as I walked away and was able to get into a private room, I fell apart."
30499,I just cried and cried and sobbed and sobbed all alone.
30500,I got off work at 5 but didn't leave til 5:30.
30501,It took that long to stop crying.
30502,"I'm off tomorrow, but how the fuck am I going to do this everyday?"
30503,I get physically sick.
30504,I'm so sensitive in a job where you can't be.
30505,"I live in a really small town and I'm in college, and this is the only job I can get."
30506,I couldn't find anything but cashier in stores.
30507,I still don't know how to do some of the fucking things and I'm embarrassed to have to ask.
30508,"I can't quit, because I need the money."
30509,My family has threatened to stop paying for my medication (not on Medicaid atm) if I don't keep this job.
30510,"These medicines are Metroprolol, Cardizem, and Klonopin."
30511,The first two prevent heart arrhythmias I get from stress.
30512,"They call me lazy, to get over it, to stop being shy."
30513,"""Can't you stick to a simple minimum wage job?"
30514,"How are you ever going to make it in the world?"""
30515,I thought sincerely about crashing my car into the median on my way home.
30516,I wouldn't have to go back ever again.
30517,Maybe I could break something bad enough I could qualify for SSI so I don't ever have to leave my fucking place.
30518,"And at least the hospital would give me food and medicine, and I wouldn't have to beg my family for it."
30519,"It's so bad, will it get better?"
30520,Am I maybe just still adapting to the medicine and should wait another few weeks for the side effects to subside?
30521,I am extremely anxious about possible side effects of medication/it not working very well.
30522,I've had anxiety my entire life and have never felt the need/want to take medication until now.
30523,Any advice on the medication front?
30524,"I've always pondered the idea of whether or not medication would help him, and the counselor and specialist always give me that kind of random non-committal BS ""if you think it would help..."" kind of thing, never a ""yes, he needs it"", or ""no, he doesn't""."
30525,"Even with all this, and writing it out does make it seem like the decision is obvious, but I worry so much about finding the right medication, and what effect it has on kids, where a lot of it is random guesswork."
30526,"I don't know if that changes body chemistry, and I've also heard about the suicide connections to meds in teenagers."
30527,I have been considering medication...since anxiety does run in my family (basically my whole Dad's side of the family takes medication).
30528,"I don't take meds anymore, it's kind unreal for me to write this, and realize I don't have to pop a pill every day, 3 times a day."
30529,"im 25, now going to school again, seeing a councillor, on meds."
30530,I've never taken any medication apart from Atarax (which is an antihistamine) which doesn't really help.
30531,I'm very worried about taking medication and I don't know if I want to try it.
30532,"The main reasons I worry about medication are:

1."
30533,What are your experiences with Lyrica/Pregabalin and psychiatric medication in general?
30534,"I started with SSRI medication; I tried Paxil, Prozac, and Pristiq."
30535,"I really feel like I need to be on medication, but I don't know what."
30536,tl;dr: Tried medication/therapy/supplements/exercise/meditation to help with my constant fear.
30537,My goal is to get some therapy aided with necessary medication.
30538,I know the story is insane but here goes: I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a couple years ago and had reluctantly begun taking medication (60mg antidepressant and 30mg anti-anxiety) I've also been seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist.
30539,"Here's the thing: I've been forced, against my will, to abruptly stop taking all my meds and abruptly stop attending any and all psych and doctor appointments."
30540,"as I'm sure you know, **discontinuing medication (and therapy) utterly and abruptly without lowering doses over time, and without any doctor supervision is extremely dangerous** but I've been left with no choice 

Why do I have to stop taking meds and going to the doctor?"
30541,"Everytime I reach someone the answer is the same: ""we're working on fixing this, just check back in a few weeks"" they say this every time with no real specifics on who or how or when this will be fixed

up until now I've been rationing the dwindling medication I have left, often taking tiny fractions of my prescribed doses but as of tomorrow I will be 100% out of all my meds and it's kind of scary."
30542,Already I've begun using alcohol too often to supplement the anti-anxiety meds which is obviously stupid and dangerous but I'm at my wits end here.
30543,"I'm not currently on any prescribed medication, I take over the counter vitamin supplements that are marketed towards mood improvement that work to a degree to take the edge off."
30544,"The reason I'm not currently on medication is my last psychiatrist made me stop the one medication that thus far has made a difference on me being able to function at a high level during times of high anxiety one month in because ""she wasn't going to create a Xanax addict""."
30545,So I'm off all prescription medication and have not seen a psychiatrist since because now I have an irrational fear that no one will help me even if I find a medication that works.
30546,"I do go to therapy every other week, we are working on me getting back to get medication."
30547,"I've been seeing a psychotherapist for 3 years now, and while the therapy was extremely helpful in cutting through my perspective in the beginning, I'm really only going back to continue my medication cycle."
30548,"This has become very frustrating, because I'm basically paying just to get a prescription at the end of the visit, and my general practitioner refuses to prescribe me the medication on his own."
30549,"I'm taking the medicine that YOU insisted I needed, and now that I have a handle on what I actually need you're accusing me of being a fucking JUNKIE!"
30550,So I tried to set them up with another doctor but they believe that they will lose some sliding scale benefit for medication by going to another provider.
30551,"I am currently feeling very nervous about starting the medication as I am worried I will gain weight and become numb, etc."
30552,Is it possible for the meds to stop working...
30553,I never tried any medication.
30554,"I have made breakfast and taken my medication, and will not sink into the couch to extend my low to new depths."
30555,"I thought this medication was supposed to treat panic attacks, not exacerbate them?"
30556,"But I just spent a half an hour googling how I could kill myself with medication I have on hand, in my house (turns out it would be tough without alcohol, which I do not have)."
30557,"My medication (Citalopram 10 mg)  has been working great and I don't feel suicidal, and I know he'd take me off of it if I mentioned this."
30558,"All alternatives were exhausted (reading, movies, writing, talking, medicine, all of it) so I sat him down and guided him through a meditation session."
30559,I can't afford counseling and I'm hoping that once I get a steady income I can go to the doctor and get some medicine or something.
30560,The only medication I am on right now is allegra which seems to help a bit.
30561,"I want thaws visions to get out of my head and I want to enjoy life again  

I have anxiety at the thought of taking medication."
30562,"I've never taken tablets unless I've had to ... And my question is will it help me, or is the medication a bandaid as such and will only help while on it?"
30563,I don't know anything about anxiety medication or how to even word this properly.
30564,"It's either medication or keep plodding along, trying to help myself with natural things like mediation etc."
30565,I've taken about every over medication you can think of and nothing has worked.
30566,"I have a high sex drive while my meds dampen it, it doesn't really help it."
30567,"I haven't really been able to eat the past couple of days, I have a continuous headache that won't respond to pain medication, I'm shaking as I type this, and I have no freaking clue how to calm down."
30568,"I need more time to get my meds straightened out, but I need to make a living to support myself."
30569,"I actually got pretty bad anxiety, although not as bad as I'm having now around 6 months ago and ended up going on medication for it."
30570,Unfortunately I had really bad side effects from the medication and ended up having to go to hospital.
30571,I'll never go on meds again after that.
30572,My mom was always very helpful and had me see professionals and take medication along with sending me to art therapy and such.
30573,"I take Adderall for ADHD, which helps a lot with my anxiety because I can make myself focus on something else rather than hyper-focusing on whatever I'm anxious about."
30574,This is an abbreviated version of things because if I go into too much detail I'll end up getting upset all over again.
30575,I ran out on Thursday.
30576,"Because it's a class-II substance, I have to go to my doctor's office, pick up the prescription, and drop it off and then I'll be good to go."
30577,"I live an hour and a half away from my doctor's office, since it's in my hometown and I am in college."
30578,"Well, I didn't call it in til Friday morning (at 7am, when I was leaving for work)."
30579,"When I realized I wouldn't be able to get it that same day, I decided to go to student health on campus and see if they could give me a prescription, and then I would just cancel the prescription request at my regular doctor's office."
30580,"I've done this before, easy-peasy."
30581,"At student health, they said I had to go talk to the Counseling Services if I wanted adderall."
30582,No.
30583,It's not that I am seeking to get prescribed Adderall.
30584,It's that I am prescribed Adderall and I need a new prescription.
30585,I have done this before.
30586,Why can I not do it again.
30587,So then I go to Counseling Services.
30588,"They say, ""okay, we'll get you set up to talk to someone today, and then they'll set you up with a psychiatrist by tuesday or wednesday next week""."
30589,My brain shut down.
30590,"I started crying at the front desk, uncontrollably."
30591,I can usually control my emotions but today was just *special* I guess.
30592,"I then started having a panic attack because I felt like a junkee, and I felt like they would think I was just trying to score drugs when in reality I *do* use my prescription responsibly, and it helps a lot with my life, and I just want to feel like a productive human being instead of a fuckup and a do-nothing when I'm off them."
30593,"Also I didn't feel like being an anxious mess all weekend, but I digress."
30594,"So I leave student health, still crying."
30595,"I turned down the offer to see a psychiatrist, because it would be the same amount of time either way."
30596,I was going to have to wait out the weekend.
30597,"Monday rolls around, my mom picked up my prescription first-thing, and then I only had to drive 45 minutes to pick it up from home rather than the Dr.'s office."
30598,"I drove all the way back, dropped it off at the pharmacy."
30599,"Perfect, great, only a few more hours and all this mess will be over."
30600,"I began to feel relaxed again, knowing that the end was near."
30601,"I got a text notification, ""Your prescription is not yet ready."
30602,"Call the pharmacy for further information."""
30603,"In the new year, my insurance reset, and I have to get my doctor to re-approve of all my medications with the insurance company."
30604,So they sent her a fax for approval.
30605,"Okay...well, knowing this office, they are really slow to do anything."
30606,"So I called and left a message, ""Hi, this is somethin_else, I need this to be resolved by today or tomorrow morning please, thanks""."
30607,TODAY.
30608,"It is almost 5pm, Tuesday."
30609,"I have manically called 3 separate times today, and left messages all three times."
30610,"I know this doesn't help to make the process move along, but it does make me feel better."
30611,"The office closes in 5 minutes, still no word from them."
30612,I am going to have to probably wait until Thursday to get any meds.
30613,"Because they'll get to it tomorrow, and by then it will be too late to take them for Wednesday."
30614,So Thursday.
30615,"I realize that most of this could have been avoided if I was on top of things, but:

1."
30616,I didn't realize I would have to get my medications re-approved; also I forgot having gone through almost this exact same process a year ago.
30617,2.
30618,"She gave me 3 prescriptions at once, and I thought I had another one before I would need to go get more, hence the waiting-til-the-last-minute thing  

I'm so frustrated by everything and every step of this process has given me a rollercoaster of emotions."
30619,"My boyfriend caught me in one of my swings today and I ended up snapping at him that, ""no, I do not want to get lunch right now why are you asking me that stop talking""."
30620,I felt bad and apologized because it's not his fault.
30621,It just makes me feel so helpless that my wellbeing and productivity and my emotions are in the hands of someone who doesn't seem to give a crap.
30622,"And feeling helpless is giving me anxiety and making me feel weak, and that is making me curl up into a ball and crying for seemingly no reason."
30623,"I at least solved one part of the problem; I am dropping my current MD, because this isn't the first time something like this has happened."
30624,"I am switching to someone that is 5 minutes away from me, so that it isn't so far out of the way."
30625,"That's something that my SO keeps reminding me of...this will all be over eventually, and ""your current MD will be losing your business""."
30626,"Edit: Also, tying in to the whole hyper-focusing thing, I have not been able to get a single amount of work done because I can't stop thinking about how frustrated I am."
30627,"I have tried deep breathing, and have exercised to get my blood flowing, and all the usual tricks that seem to work."
30628,"But with no definite foreseeable end to this whole issue, I just keep replaying everything in my head."
30629,Which is also why I wanted to rant here because maybe I'll get it down in writing and it won't weigh on me *as* much.
30630,"**tl;dr Ran out of meds, was not on top of things, my doctor seems too nonchalant about getting things done and it is making me feel helpless and anxious."
30631,The last 5 days have been a giant emotional roller coaster**
30632,"ETA: 20f, not on any drugs/meds of interest."
30633,"Should I or should I not go on any medication, and what about side effects?"
30634,I bought this book off of amazon called The Chemistry of Joy by Henry Emmons.
30635,I have been on anti anxiety and anti depressant medications for close to a year now and I feel like medications aren't bettering me but are just masking the symptoms.
30636,"In this book it discusses natural remedies to overcome anxiety and depression like eating the right foods, exercise, and taking the right supplements and vitamins."
30637,"I've done some research online and it seems that 5-HTP, L-Theanine, and John's Wort are all natural supplements that do actually help."
30638,Anyone try these or know a lot about them?
30639,I'm highly considering getting off my medications and trying these natural supplements.
30640,So I just took my first dose (20mg) of Celexa ever.
30641,I have never been on any medications before (other than birth control and allergy stuff) so I'm a bit nervous.
30642,I came on here and did a search for Celexa and I was reading some of the threads and noticed that people said you cannot drink while taking it.
30643,I looked on the bottle and didn't see anything about it.
30644,I don't drink very heavily or very often.
30645,I'd say on average I have about 3 beers a week.
30646,"The only time I drink kinda heavily (and by heavily I mean like, 5-7 beers in one night; i'm 109lbs) is on big occasions like a birthday or New Years or something like that."
30647,"For people who HAVE drank alcohol and are on Celexa, can you give me some info here?"
30648,What have your experiences been?
30649,My therapist had to bump my appointment until later this week so I am hoping something or someone here can help me calm this down.
30650,"I've had anxiety for a few years, and PTSD from an incident involving my partner's addiction (this happened a year ago)."
30651,"My partner recently relapsed, I found out, and since, have been in this constant state of panic."
30652,"We were able to see our counselor yesterday, however, she can't see me individually until later."
30653,"I used to take anxiety medications, and smoke to soothe the stress, however I'm 6 months pregnant so I am obviously off those options."
30654,"When I described my feeling to my therapist in an email, she said I was flooding and to try to breathe until I could see her (gee thanks!)."
30655,A quick google of 'anxiety+flooding' wasn't entirely useful.
30656,How do I stop this flooding feeling/behavior?
30657,TLDR; Therapist says I'm flooding.
30658,How do I stop?
30659,It's not my meds.
30660,I want to go to the doctors and get medication or something but I don't have a drug plan and I can't afford it.
30661,And to top it all off my cat has non-communicable hepatitis that was diagnosed over christmas with a 50/50 survival rate so I sent her to live with my parents because I can't afford her medicine and I really miss her company.
30662,"Hello all,

Soo I have suffered from (what i think is) a mild form of anxiety all my life."
30663,"I get panic attacks about 4-5times a year, some years i could have only one, than others i could have ten.. but I have learnt to deal with them because as a kid i thought it was just a 'normal' occurrence for everyone."
30664,"Anyways, lately my anxiety has been through the roof."
30665,"I haven't had any panic attacks, but i am just anxious all the time."
30666,"For the past week i have had the absolute toughest time eating, and its getting quite annoying."
30667,I do not know if any of you have done a drug like extacy but it honestly feels like trying to eat on that (ie eating sand paper).
30668,"Also i find my sleep is being affected, mainly in morning."
30669,"I can fall asleep somewhat fine as long days become tiring, but the minute i wake up again, the anxiety immediately makes me wide awake and i am unable to fall back asleep..  And than the headaches, i think they are stress headaches...but its becoming disabling."
30670,"I am just wondering if this is attributed to my anxiety, and some insight into maybe why this is happening??"
30671,"I have some reasoning as to why the anxiety has surfaced in this point in my life (been through absolute hell the last while, got dumper, lost job, struggling through College), and was just wondering any better techniques to cope with this crap as well."
30672,"The best technique i've found so far is to just keep busy, keep my mind focused on only one thing/task out of the realm of where i think the anxiety starts from."
30673,"This has helped, but its impossible to keep your mind always busy in this sense."
30674,Ive been to a doctor before about anxiety earlier on in life but all they want to do is fill me up with medications and I am most definitely not doing that.
30675,"Also, does anyone else have similar stories and what not?"
30676,Thanks
30677,I take medication for depression and anxiety but it doesn't keep me from being a fucking moron.
30678,I often come here hoping to hear encouraging stories that will help me believe that I CAN overcome my anxiety and panic disorder.
30679,"Unfortunately, every single time I encounter some story that someone has written about their own situation that then becomes added to my ever-growing list of fears."
30680,"Examples:
-People with no mental health training / qualifications commenting on whether or not a particular symptom will ever go away (""Depersonalization cannot ever be cured"" - a TERRIBLE thing for an anxious person to read)
-People who have gone through extensive trauma or have terrifying thoughts that can then be absorbed by anxious readers (""I am scared that I will think about harming my loved ones..."
30681,"I am afraid I will never be able to eat and have to be hospitalized"")
-Horror stories about medications (""It made me go crazy and I have never felt the same), etc."
30682,"Honestly I am not really complaining or asking for any changes, but I think this could be a helpful resource if posters were more aware that anxious people are VERY sensitive to the power of suggestion and triggers."
30683,One anecdote that you share could become someone else's panic trigger that lasts for months.
30684,"For instance, I recently asked for posts about success stories to cheer myself up and bring me peace of mind, and someone commented ""Some day my anxiety and depression will get me."""
30685,"I realize this could be loosely interpreted as a message of perseverance, but it put all kinds of terrifying ideas in my mind about my anxiety eventually ""getting the best of me"" that caused me panic and depression numerous times since then."
30686,Are there any tagging systems or even just general ettiquette adjustments that can be made to make this sub a place for safe support without fear of triggers and picking up new phobias/fears?
30687,I want to believe that my anxiety and depression can go away (I've only had them for one month!)
30688,and it's hard when I feel bombarded by stories of failure and struggle instead of success.
30689,"I'm on treatment for my disorders and take medication every day, but as they say, there is no ""magic pill."""
30690,Has anyone had any lucky getting off their meds and actually living without it and not having to go back on it??
30691,I've been diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder and I am on medication to handle the chemical imbalance.
30692,"Hi

I am 29 Years old and i suffer from Anxiety disorders for 10 years now."
30693,"I dropped out of University because of it, i wasted several years at home doing nothing and im affraid i will cancel medical school because of it now as well."
30694,"The main problem i have is dealing with people,  giving presentations in font of the class."
30695,"Im a very good student, i get mostly A's and B's, but i also have to give presentations and i get panic attacks just thinking about it."
30696,"I thought i could deal with it, but last week i had to give a presentation and it was the absolute horror."
30697,"I couldnt talk or breath, my whole body was shaking."
30698,"There were only 6 People in the audience, and all of them were 10 years younger than me."
30699,I dont know it this makes it worse or better.
30700,"however, i also play in a band with which i can perform in front of 500 people without any problems at all."
30701,"Now after this experience, im affraid to go to school again."
30702,"Im scared i have to talk, to explain something, maybe give a spontaneous presentation."
30703,"another thing that bothers me is that all the other pupils are 10 years younger than me, it is very hard to fit, i also think i appear as a total loser amongst them."
30704,"i dont know what to do anymore, i dont wanna fail again, i cannot afford another failure in my life."
30705,"i am already attending a therapy, which helps, but it doesnt help enough."
30706,"i could ask my doctor to give me medications, but i am not sure if i wanna live a life that is only bearable under the influence of drugs."
30707,"i actually dont know what i do live for anyway, which makes it hard to motivate myself to face my fears."
30708,what am i supposed to do ?
30709,i dont know how to deal with this.
30710,"My parents are divorced and I guess most people have a parent their more comfortable with, and another parent they want to impress) that I am depressed because of my social anxiety, and it's getting worse and that I might need medication, but I don't know how."
30711,I thought medication would make me weird.
30712,"After looking through /r/anxiety and /r/depression, I realized I shouldn't feel bad about being on meds or have them affect me THAT much, plus at this point, I REALLY need them."
30713,"I thought I really had it under control without the need for meds, but now I know it can creep back easily."
30714,I've been taking various medications for my anxiety for several years now.
30715,It's become a normal part of my life and I have always been thankful that it has been helpful to me.
30716,"I'm currently taking Effexor, which I have stuck with for a while."
30717,"Before that, the medication that lasted for more than a month or 2 was Prozac and I took that for years, but felt I needed to try something different because it felt like it was no longer helping me."
30718,"I've been to therapy before, not currently in any kind of therapy."
30719,"I know it's good for people with anxiety and can help, I just haven't made room in my life for it."
30720,"Anyway, I don't want to take medication anymore."
30721,Lately I've been questioning whether or not the medication is keeping me from being all the way ME.
30722,I don't feel inspired by anything.
30723,Often I feel I'm more or less indifferent to most things.
30724,"Sure I'm happy, I laugh and stuff...but it just doesn't feel REAL."
30725,"And if I'm not indifferent, I'm angry or irritated."
30726,I'm just not sure where to go from here.
30727,"I know the medication helps my anxiety, I remember what it was like being without it."
30728,"I just don't know what to do....
Are natural options any better than medication?"
30729,"Like Valerian Root, HTP-5?"
30730,Is this even something I can consider?
30731,I'm on medicine to help(specifically Effexor XR).
30732,"I've been on medication since February - Lexapro for two months, until I decided that it was doing more harm than good and switched to Prozac with the recommendation of a doctor."
30733,Should I give up all hope of this medication working?
30734,Needless to say she booked me an appointment with our doctor and I'll ask for some medication to help my anxiety attacks.
30735,"I know that every person is different in their situations, but I was just wondering how you guys went through the personal process of determining that medication was something that might help you, as it is something I might one day consider myself."
30736,Wasn't sure if I could tag this as [meds] but anyway...
30737,I am [20f] and my anxiety is causing me to be an OAG.
30738,My boyfriend [21m] has tried to break up with me 3 times now due to how my anxiety makes me act.
30739,We have been dating for a year now and I feel us drifting apart.
30740,"This is my ""last chance"" to prove to him that I can stop relying on him so much."
30741,I have recently gone off my birth control because we both thought the hormones were making my anxiety and depression worse.
30742,I already feel a little better.
30743,"My therapist has me taking all kinds of vitamins (B-complex, D, and fish oil) and I think they are helping."
30744,I really want to avoid medications as much as possible because I hated how all of them made me feel.
30745,"School has been going great for me, just recently changing my major to something I have always wanted to do."
30746,"I have been feeling better anxiety-wise, but I have tried to tell him, it is never going to completely go away."
30747,"He has asked me to stop relying on him so much and to let him have his own life, and I have been trying really hard to do so."
30748,But trying to deal with my anxiety all on my own makes it build up to the point that I need him.
30749,I get so anxious when he goes out with his friends to bars (I can't go because I am not legal yet) and doesn't text me for periods of hours.
30750,He says I need to let him be and have his own life.
30751,"I love him so much, I don't want my anxiety to destroy our relationship."
30752,Am I being unreasonable/OAG with him or is he not being understanding?
30753,What needs to be done to make our fighting stop?
30754,"I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, was on meds, but I don't believe that to be the problem anymore."
30755,"Parents didn't want me to take meds and I burdened anyone by just talking to them about it (I know because I was told), and that only made it worse."
30756,"My meds are out, my emergency meds are out, and I can't go for my cool down walk because its late right now."
30757,"Its been about two weeks now and since being put on medication 4 days ago, my breathing is better (no more shortness of breath) and limited panic attacks."
30758,I'm afraid of medication.
30759,we have a date this weekend so I have no idea) was on medicine for anxiety/depression and stopped taking it.
30760,"I started medication and therapy, found a new job, lost a significant amount of weight, and started exercising regularly and have pretty much rid myself of the crippling anxiety attacks and days spent in bed dreading having to deal with the world."
30761,"She has been refusing to seek therapy or medication since it didn't do much for her in the past, but I don't really know how she can if she's so dead-set on not seeking help."
30762,"My question is what, if anything, can I do to help her rediscover her sex drive and realize that she's not a loser for seeking help or taking medication?"
30763,I was given medication (zoloft) and a recommendation to a psychiatrist.
30764,I stopped seeing a psychiatrist and soon stopped taking my medication in a effort to forget about what I went through and dismissed it as a hiccup of sorts.
30765,Regardless of my self medication this is when my GAD started to effect my social life.
30766,After a string of massive panic attacks I decided I should go to the doctors and see about getting back on the medication that I had abandoned 5 years ago.
30767,I know the medication will not solve my problems but I know they will help me to have the strength to make the changes I need to make to get to a better place.
30768,"However, I do not take any medication for said anxiety or potential depression.)"
30769,"I've tried therapy, I'm not confident that any doctor would consider me for medication, but it physically hurts."
30770,I've.. tried just about everything.
30771,"Therapy, medications, alternative therapies.."
30772,"The only thing that helps is pinching until stuff comes out, and that can turn into something ugly in itself.. plus it's only temporary."
30773,My arms and legs are full of scars.
30774,I know I need help.
30775,"I've tried rationalizing, self help books, online searches, breathing techniques, exercising, cold water, you name it, I've probably tried it."
30776,And I'm still scared out of my mind.
30777,"Any time someone gets a message, including me, I prepare for the worst."
30778,"My internal shield goes up, and I feel myself creating a wall of emotions to try to protect my fragile self."
30779,"I've had chronic illness a long time, and my family's divorce.. well the two things happening at the same time have made it so that I am always afraid."
30780,I can't go to doctors because I'm scared of them telling me I have something else wrong with me.
30781,I can't answer the phone because of how much bad news I've gotten over it.
30782,"I obsess and obsess and obsess if I sense something is slightly wrong, in case I need to prepare."
30783,"Example: if someone is messaging my man, I get scared that I'm missing something that he needs.."
30784,I absolutely know it's insane to think like that.
30785,I can't tell him everything I feel because sometimes it's just plain insulting to him.
30786,"To anyone, really."
30787,People aren't always out to hurt me.. so why am I so afraid all the time?
30788,"My chronic nightmares that I've had ever since I was a baby have played out every horror I've ever thought of, and some that I didn't even imagine and now they're stuck in my head."
30789,and now I'm starting to doubt what people say.
30790,"If they mean it.. if it's real.. if anything is really ""real."""
30791,"I understand that this can be a defense mechanism, but I am tired of being afraid, obsessive, and doubting."
30792,Yet I can't stop the fear.
30793,My.. mom has severe anxiety as well.
30794,Along with my grandma.
30795,But they both deny that they have a problem.
30796,I know people aren't supposed to always be scared.. but.
30797,I don't know what to do anymore.
30798,And she just keeps getting worse despite help from medication and therapy twice a week.
30799,"Her panic attacks and night terrors are so severe that she barely eats and sleeps, but still gains weight from the medication which makes her more anxious."
30800,I don't know if it's her meds or just the stress of our situation.
30801,I've tried medication and it always makes me zombie-like and numb.
30802,I'm wondering if there's anything other than medication that has worked for you guys to keep your anxiety at bay.
30803,This is my second round with this medication.
30804,"I felt great, until suddenly I had panic again, and restarted the medicine."
30805,"Notes: 

-I have been on Paxil

-I'm 20 Years old, female

-I'm very sensitive to medication and very small framed


**tl;dr: Prozac works great until it makes me feel like I have the flu."
30806,I've been coping without meds for a few months now (I used to take Xanax but I stopped because it's side effects were so bad) but it's getting harder to go about my life without some sort of medicine to help out.
30807,meds don't work unless it is a benzo and they make me a zombie/unaware/toaware.
30808,I was prescribed a couple of medications that I haven't taken before and I'm terrified of the side effects.
30809,I can't stop compulsively researching online for side effects I'm scared of - if I see a bunch of people report that they are fine I will ignore it and keep looking for the one bad report to cling on to... :(  What the hell can I do to make myself stop??
30810,"I need to take this, but I'll be done with it all in 6 days :("
30811,"I feel wary about the medication because of this--it just feels like he made *such* a hasty diagnosis about something I am pretty sure I don't have, so I guess a part of me feels like he could be wrong about prescribing me Pristiq too?"
30812,"Part of me wants to try the medication, but I guess I'm just really scared and I don't know if this psychiatrist is way off base or something."
30813,"(I'm posting in this subreddit specifically because, while the medication was for depression, I feel like my anxiety has been getting the better of me since the appointment."
30814,I'm just worried (imagine that..) because my PCP has been trying to treat my anxiety disorder for almost two years.
30815,"She's exhausted all her resources and says she can no longer help me, like it's beyond her means."
30816,I've never been to therapy or any kind of counseling before.
30817,And I really have no idea what a psychiatrist can do for me because I have no clue what to expect.
30818,Im willing to try whatever it takes to help this go away.
30819,And i imagine talking with a professional could benefit me.
30820,But I'm not too sure only talking will help.
30821,"I know what causes my anxiety and when it started, why it began in the first place."
30822,But it won't ever stop.
30823,Another worry I have is that I've tried so many medications through my primary care Dr over the years.
30824,All SSRIs.
30825,All failed.
30826,"Only one did ease the anxiety, not 100%, but it helped significantly lower panic attacks and racing thoughts and I actually felt better."
30827,"The medication was called klonopin, and I started this one about 2 months ago."
30828,"Once I moved out (home life was terrible, causing all kinds of anxiety) and was on the meds for about two months, I felt I was cured."
30829,"Then right before Christmas when visiting family back home, my father lost it and put his hands on me for the first time and strangled me."
30830,"It was horrifying, and I had a full blown, paralyzing, absolutely crippling panic attack."
30831,My meds didn't stop it right away and I panicked even more.
30832,"It did finally stop, but scared the hell out of me."
30833,I couldn't believe my own dad would do such a thing.
30834,I quickly left the situation and went back to my new place and began to get over it.
30835,"I had an appointment/check up with my primary care doc, and explained what happened."
30836,She already knew the 2 months prior I was doing great.
30837,"I had refills on my meds and everything, though once I told her about the episode I had with my father, she switched my meds to 3 months of Zoloft and reduced the klonopin from 2mg per day for 5 months to .5mg for 2wks."
30838,I left the drs confused but hopeful that this new regimen would work as well.
30839,I was so terribly wrong.
30840,"After 3 days on Zoloft, i was no longer myself."
30841,"After about a week, my anxiety and panic attacks went from nonexistent to the worst I've ever been in my life."
30842,"I stopped the Zoloft, returned to the Dr immediately and that's when she said she could no longer help me."
30843,"I had only asked to go back to what i was taking before, and she immediately raised her voice and said ""You can't only take klonopin!!"
30844,I can't help you.
30845,"See a psychiatrist."""
30846,"Now I understand that kind of medication isn't for long term use, can cause dependence, etc.. but it hadn't even been a full 2 months yet AND she had written me 5 refills because I was doing so great."
30847,"So now I'm wondering...
What will this psychiatrist do?"
30848,"How will they help me when I was already doing good and then just left high and dry by a Dr who experimented on me for 2yrs, only to get it right and turn me away?"
30849,I just need some reassurance that I won't have to live through 2 more years of experimenting with drugs and ups and downs all over again..
30850,"I should also add that I have been diagnosed with GAD, I am on medication, and I am seeing a counsellor and working on CBT."
30851,"When I am home alone I sit on the couch in the living room with the gun in my lap and my phone in one hand, watching TV with the volume almost on silent so that I can hear any noises in my house)

I was on anti-anxiety medication for about 8 months once, but I've been of of it for about 2 years now."
30852,The dreams were scaring me more than my real life fears so I told my doctor I didn't think I needed the meds anymore.
30853,Lately I'm wondering if I should maybe try to go back on a different type of medication.
30854,I've taken medicine.
30855,"After a little while I made myself go see a team psychologist and she starstarted offering medicine to which I replied no thanks, thinking that if I got into this mess without drugs I can get out."
30856,There's just something very energetically uncomfortable about Lexapro that I cant wrap my head around- or is it all anti-anxiety meds?
30857,"The ER doctors, and head of medicine and pharmacology friend I have said its nearly impossible for that to happen."
30858,"I've also tried medicine - I was prescribed paroxetine by my GP in March of 2011 (when the panic attacks first started getting so bad that I finally went ahead and sought professional help, even though doctors also fuel my anxiety), and it helped, but I'm weary of anti-depressants because I don't know how they will end up affecting me in the future, as I know I am still young and that my brain is still developing."
30859,"Before I go on, I should note that I live in Japan, and the medicine and psychological help is different from the US."
30860,"The past three weeks, I have been taking it more frequently, and for the first time in the eight months since I have started medication, on more than three consecutive days."
30861,"I am quite afraid of developing a dependence or tolerance to it, and I was hoping for you guys to share your experiences with the drug, and explain to me that either: 
A) I'm being ridiculous, and have nothing to worry about in the short term,
B) An alternative medicine to switch to

Absolutely any help is much appreciated, and I wish you all well on your defeating irrational anxiety."
30862,does medication help?
30863,I was free from [thanatophobia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_anxiety_%28psychology%29) for several years right up to the point at which a medication incompatibility set me on a panic attack which lasted several days.
30864,I'm going to talk to my psychiatrist about it when I see him next because I don't like how this medicine at this dose is making me feel but that's a few days off.
30865,TLDR; don't know if my anxiety is enough to need therapy/medicine.
30866,"One of my sisters, my mother, my godmother have all suffered from depressions and are on anti-depressant medication."
30867,The best he could suggest was perhaps a change in medication and carrying on with CBT.
30868,This was obviously a stupid decision because even if I wanted to try to go of my meds I should have phased them out as recommended by my Doctor but I felt particularity gung-ho.
30869,My anxiety got the best of me and I went through the torture of trial and error with medication and therapy.
30870,I've tried so many different kinds of meds and have seen probably 6 different therapists.
30871,"I don't want to look medication seeking, and I don't want to not be taken seriously."
30872,Is anxiety medication actually helpful?
30873,i would love to get a medication that can help with this but i've never been to a doctor for it.
30874,Hey there fellas.
30875,"I'm pretty new hear, joined from /r/depression and first of all I want to thank you."
30876,"It's nice nowing, that people outside genuinely care."
30877,"I've been dealing with anxiety attacks for a while now, been on several medications, into therapy for 3 years."
30878,I've developed a lot of strategies on how to deal with it and I searched the web for new ones.
30879,"The problem is, that these tips and guides often say that you have to exercise, go meditate, eat healthier, do yoga or whatever."
30880,I found myself not doing these things because I didn't know where to start.
30881,"How can I learn to meditate when everythings scares the crap out of me, when I don't know were to begin at all."
30882,Here's my solution.
30883,You need someone to tell you where to.
30884,So here is my try.
30885,"The next time you feel anxious, listen to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIJQsE8C5Is) guided meditation."
30886,It's 21 minutes long and worked for me so it can work for you too.
30887,"I would suggest to do it now, allthough you are not feeling anxious."
30888,It is unbelievable relaxing.
30889,Give me your thoughts on this.
30890,Did anyone try already?
30891,"For those, that have no idea what I'm talking about, picture volleyball with a medicine ball."
30892,About 5 minutes into the game a 20 lb medicine ball came flying over the net and bounced off my upper thigh when I tried to catch it.
30893,Had therapy for awhile and meds until I chose to go off of them in high school.
30894,"Last summer, when the general anxiety started creeping back into my life, my family doctor offered to start me on regular meds again, which I (stupidly) declined."
30895,"I've learned to deal with this on my own and that isnt my issue (for those of you wondering why I'm not on medication, hilarious story, taking pills is a trigger for my anxiety as well, FML.)"
30896,I feel the medication is slipping again and losing its effectiveness.
30897,We have talked aboult  to a different medication and adding on to the prozac before hand since we had the feeling the prozac would poop out.. (since the same thing happened to my mother).
30898,C) add another medication to the prozac.
30899,I have anxiety and depression that I take medication for.
30900,I get severe anxiety when it comes to mathematics.
30901,In college I got so filled with anxiety I had to take a swim class after my math course to calm down and relax.
30902,Now I'm a network engineer in computers.
30903,And I've hit my limit of what I can do.
30904,I want to program applications and put my creative ideas out there to share with everyone else and advance my future without relying on others to advance my ideas.
30905,But when it comes to doing math and programming I remember how much I struggled in college and think that the reason why I don't have my degree is because I couldn't do the math.
30906,"I did study the basic parts of programming but once it started using complex algebra for example I hit my limit, I really could not understand what was going on."
30907,"Yet in my profession my entire job is to diagnose situations and conclude logical solutions, but when it comes to math I have a hard time."
30908,"When I took algebra for the third time I studied 20 hours a week, had 2 tutors."
30909,"At the end of it all the best I could do was a high D.

I do not take medications and every now and then I feel a bit of the anxiety in everyday life just like everyone else."
30910,but now I'm at the point in my life where I have to fix the problem.
30911,I researched online best way to overcome this obstacle and most recent study is to write down your anxiety.
30912,I've tried this and it does make me feel better but is not a cure for my mathematical anxiety.
30913,I've been tested for hypertension results came back negative I'm not sure what else to do.
30914,Any advice?
30915,"I've been taking medicine every night to help deal with my anxiety, but my mother always seems to increase my stress."
30916,"TL;DR - 26 year old lady wants to learn to drive, get her meds upped and quit smoking."
30917,I really don't want to be put on medication for it because I have heard nothing but bad long term effects.
30918,tl;dr: What can I do to try and open up to my psychologist tomorrow about my bad anxiety and find a cure without going on medication that I know will have bad long term effects?
30919,I've been in a rut for about 4.5 years.
30920,Disassociated myself from having any personal life about 6 years ago.
30921,Been to at least a half dozen specialists.
30922,Tried going to school a half dozen times (perfect grades when I try).
30923,Home life is a wreck.
30924,Stay home up in my room ironically.
30925,"Terrible at relationships ... personal, professional, intimate, etc."
30926,"Only really leave it for food or to occasionally go outside with my mother, who's acting like my full time caretaker now."
30927,What do you do when I've literally picked off my options one by one.
30928,Can't concentrate.
30929,Skiddish.
30930,Always on my computer.
30931,OCD ... a lot of quirks.
30932,Can't sleep.
30933,Only on light dose anxiety medication (Xanax) and a bit of Ambien to sleep.
30934,"Otherwise, nothing."
30935,Former has helped me with my appetite.
30936,Tried a lot of other medications and did not react to them well.
30937,"Made me a lot worst ... careless, etc."
30938,Extreme anxiety.
30939,Anxiety attacks.
30940,Makes me back out of school more often than not.
30941,No aspirations or real vision for myself.
30942,Kind of aimless.
30943,No goals.
30944,Just awake so I  can go back to sleep.
30945,Entire 20s have been wasted.
30946,Plenty of trips and opportunities I folded on.
30947,"Professional help is limited and hasn't been effective (Yes, stuck around for quite a few appointments)."
30948,Was browsing through some screenshots and bookmarks.
30949,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1468ov/does_anyone_else_suffer_from_anxietyrelated/ &lt;&lt; Inspired me to write something because I meant to get back to this.
30950,Kind of how I felt.
30951,Started with a bad reaction to some migraine medication and i had a panic attack and eventually went through some really bad depersonalization.
30952,i have been on meds since the beginning and they help mostly.
30953,"I know I'm not schizophrenic by any means but every thing he mentioned in his final rant of Facebook such as medicine he's been on, fidgeting legs and other issues just makes me think that when I become older it's something that could just randomly pop up in my life and become schizophrenic?"
30954,"I finished up on my anti anxiety medication a few months ago  
I celebrated within  
I thought I was finally free  
But no
Here comes the ""withdrawal syndrome""  
A vast array of frightening symptoms  
I search the internet  
So many other people experiencing the same  
Their doctors totally disregarding the fact that withdrawal syndrome is a real thing and that it doesn't just last ""a few weeks"" - it can go on for months and years  
So not even our GPs are really on our side!"
30955,I lost my insurance right now so I am not going to therapy &amp; am off my meds.
30956,"I'm also taking fish oil (just a quick warning for anyone reading this, fish oil is a blood thinner, so talk to your doc if you think this might interfere with any meds you're taking), vitamin D, and vitamin B, all of which (supposedly) help with mood."
30957,How long did it take you all to really feel the effects of your medication?
30958,Should I ask her to switch me to a different anti-anxiety medication?
30959,"A few years later, after a year medication free, I decided to go back on Prozac."
30960,"I know that its anxiety, after my meds kicked in i felt calm, relaxed.... but still it upsets me soo much that something so small can effect me so big."
30961,Does anyone know why meds make you gain weight?
30962,Is it the medication itself or do you just get your appetite back?
30963,"[18f], starting zoloft tomorrow for anxiety-- anyone else have experience with this medication?"
30964,I got there &amp; instantly started feeling uneasy since I had woken up late &amp; missed my medicine.
30965,"I HAVE NOT SOUGHT ANY TREATMENT FOR THIS, and I'm pretty much ashamed to and I really don't want any kind of medication anyway."
30966,"Hey guys, first time posting on reddit and I wanted to share my experience with anxiety and meds in hope that it could help somebody else."
30967,"In fact I was going to go tell the therapist and Dr I didn't need the meds anymore

This past weekend on Sunday I had another panic attack."
30968,"I have the opportunity to get medication, but I'm even scared of that."
30969,"I also have intrusive thoughts, and I'm worried that I may become suicidal at the drop of a hat on medication."
30970,What do the various types of anti-anxiety meds do to you?
30971,I've been off medication for about two months now after being on and off for six months.
30972,"Now, I'm only 23, so I don't need to take medicine to give me an erection but my stress and anxiety wasn't allowing me to keep a hard on and he was so keen on me fucking him."
30973,Every day I'm sick with anxiety just for a paycheck and no therapist or medication has been able to help me to stop feeling that way.
30974,Background: I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia when I was 12 years old.
30975,For the next four years I was on and off of various anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications and I also did weekly therapy.
30976,"I stopped medications and therapy for a short while and started again when I was 18, because my parents divorced and I was heading to college."
30977,"My anxiety has always been crippling, but I got it under control when I went to college."
30978,I was going to a top ten university and flourishing.
30979,"Although I was writing papers just before the deadlines, I was still turning them in on time and my grades were As all the way through."
30980,"Then my mom committed suicide my junior year of college, and I took a quarter off to get myself together."
30981,"I was then diagnosed with Depression, PTSD, GAD and Social Phobia."
30982,I came back at the very end of my junior year and struggled to keep it together but I did well in classes for the most part.
30983,Except with writing.
30984,"Every writing assignment I received I turned in extremely late, every time I would sit down to write my mind would go blank."
30985,"I would try to take it step by step using outlines, but if the outline wasn't perfect, or if I made a single mistake (like a word or letter), I would throw it away."
30986,"I was going through notebooks like it was nothing, and I had nothing to show for it."
30987,Obviously this led me to panic because a) deadlines were approaching and I had nothing to show for it and b) I felt like everyone in my department was judging me because I went from being a student that turned work in on time and was always participating to being a student that skipped the majority of her classes and turned in work really late (like I finally finished a paper that was due in 2012 a month ago).
30988,"I was placed in intensive therapy (12+ hours a week) and my medication was changed, but it didn't help much."
30989,I was still struggling with writing.
30990,"At this point its my senior year and my entire life was unraveling before my eyes; my gap dropped form a 3.8 to a 3.3, I stopped going to class, I was almost hospitalized several times for suicidal ideation and severe panic attacks, and my school's psychiatrist was telling me to take some time off."
30991,"I wanted to power through so I stayed for my final semester of my senior year, and it seems like thats when shit ultimately hit the fan."
30992,"I signed up for two courses with the least amount of writing (2 papers for one course, and 1 for the other)."
30993,Together they equal about forty pages of writing.
30994,I couldn't turn a single one in.
30995,I had panic attacks about going to class because my professor was the same professor for both courses and I wasn't turning work in for either of them.
30996,"I tried to start working but I would panic (crying, shortness of breath, heart beating fast, feeling a seizing sensation in my limbs, tremors, feeling like I couldn't breath and was going to pass out–the works)."
30997,I tried to explain this to my professor but in so many words he blew me off.
30998,That was back in June when I was supposed to graduate.
30999,Now its November and I still haven't finished these papers.
31000,"I haven't told my friends because they are all doing extremely well, and I'm extremely embarrassed that I haven't graduated yet."
31001,"When I did mention that I had work due, there response was ""oh, you'll get it done"" (they've said this multiple times and its not helpful) Only my family knows, and they keep telling me how ridiculous it is that I haven't finished three papers, and how I'm allowing myself to do this, how I have absolutely no excuses, that they've coddled me and that's why I'm allowed to get away with this behavior, that everyone (the faculty of my department) is talking about me behind my back."
31002,"Usually I find shame to be an excellent motivator in the face of fear, but I have stopped and started working on these papers for the last week (i can't go for more than an hour without starting to panic or needing some distraction) and I'm seriously scared that I'm never going to finish."
31003,"I feel like this is an insurmountable challenge, and as much as I want to rise to the occasion, I can't."
31004,"I feel so desperate, like if I don't finish this work I might as well just die since I will be going without a degree that I and my parents put so much money and effort into."
31005,I feel pathetic and worthless and like a piece of shit for just not being able to get it together.
31006,I used to find writing kind of fun.
31007,Now its hellish.
31008,"I keep reminding myself that it doesn't have to be this bad, that I can just finish up and graduate as soon as I finish this work."
31009,"But my inability to work on these papers is starting to create a new fear, one that this debilitating anxiety around writing will continue for the rest of my life."
31010,I feel this fear that I will never graduate and close this chapter of my life.
31011,"Even though I'm on zoloft and klonopin, I have to take xanax to feel calm enough to even think about writing."
31012,And the amount that used to knock me out does nothing for me anymore.
31013,"I'm so worried, I feel like my life is ending and I can't do anything about it except watch."
31014,I want to get this work done so desperately but I can't.
31015,I see a psychiatrist but my next appt isn't until december.
31016,I've tried to come up with solutions but I don't know anymore.
31017,I've just started using a medication three days ago called Cipralex which so far has made the feeling of detachment from reality only worse.
31018,"so I just woke up, slept for about 13 hours after the hellish experience that was yesterday."
31019,"I've been in therapy for a few months now, working with a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist."
31020,"Together they've diagnosed me with, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, O.C.D, moderate depression, A.D.D."
31021,"Each day is a struggle, I feel like I'm dying constantly, but everyone tells me I'm not."
31022,"So, through out counselling they've wanted to put me on medication, SSRI's, I've been wary, I didn't want to commit to the drug cause i had heard the first few weeks are horrible, plus I have a fear of medication."
31023,I won't even take a tylenol when I have a headache.
31024,"But finally, some stuff happened in my personal life and this monday I began taking 25 mg of Zoloft."
31025,"Everything seemed okay, I had a bit heightened anxiety, some drowsiness, a bit of diarrhea, but nothing I couldn't handle."
31026,Yesterday I took my pill as normal and went to school (i'm in college).
31027,"About 3 hours after I took my pill, while I was in class I began to feel a little restless, I have a history of drug use and it felt like I was coming up on E or some speed."
31028,"Very nervous energy, kept moving around my jaw."
31029,I tried to ignore it but the feeling was becoming very intense.
31030,"As class ended, instead of taking the subway with my friends I called a cab to my school because I was feeling very ill with this speed/e feelings and I just wanted to be in my room."
31031,"I get in the cab, tell him where to go, and we start driving."
31032,"The feeling is becoming very intense now, I feel like I've drank like 30 coffees, I can't stop moving my arms, my heart is beating HARD, this isn't a typical panic attack, I want this feeling to stop."
31033,It felt like i could stroke out at any moment.
31034,"I tell my cabby to pull over and call an ambulance, its an emergency, he pulls over on busy street, right in front of a bus stop, so we're making a bit of a scene, busses are lined up behind us, honking."
31035,"I'm freaking the fuck out, screaming help me."
31036,"I go outside, take off my jacket and throw it to the ground, people are staring, I've never felt so fucked up in my life."
31037,"the ambulance finally arrives, they take me in their truck, and check out my vitals."
31038,"Everything is fine they said, except my heart is going a little fast."
31039,"At this point though, somehow the feeling becomes even stronger and I'm burning up."
31040,They have me tied to the bed thing and I'm screaming I'm gonna die.
31041,"I felt like I was on 20 ecstasy pills, without the fun."
31042,"The ambulance took me to the hospital, without putting their sirens on because I ""wasn't a emergency"" we get there, and I'm having some sort of paranoid psychotic episode."
31043,"I'm on the bed, I'm screaming for help, the feeling like i'm dying is constant, my brain is going into overdrive."
31044,Will I always feel like this?
31045,Have I done some permanent damage?
31046,"Most of the staff are unhelpful, I'm screaming help in the triage, looking crazy, and they're all staring at me like I'm crazy."
31047,"One nurse is pointing at me, talking loudly saying ""see all those movements he's making, its like he has O.C.D"" she kept repeating it to her co workers like I was some fucking zoo exhibit."
31048,"They eventually call security because I couldn't keep still, they all wanted me to lie down but, how can I lie down, I'm DYING DAMNNIT."
31049,"Security comes and try to talk me down, one of them was named reeko, and he was a pretty cool dude."
31050,"Telling me I wasn't going to die, the other guy was a complete dick."
31051,Acted like I was about to go psycho at any moment pull out a knife and start going at it on everyone.
31052,"Everytime I'd sit up though, they'd push me back down."
31053,I waited in that triage for an hour and half and it was exactly what hell would feel like.
31054,"If you've ever seen requiem for a dream, I felt like the mother at the end of that movie, completely lost it due to prescription drugs, looked at me like I'm insane."
31055,"Finally I get into the emergency room, still feel like I'm burning up, still feel like I'm dying."
31056,"They hook me up to some saline, take some vitals again, eveyrthing is fine."
31057,"I'm starting to feel more myself, but the feeling of being on a mass amount of drugs still remains."
31058,"They put me in a glass room so they can see me, have a security guard outside my room (after they searched all my things mind you) and I begin to wait."
31059,"The doctor finally comes, gives me some ativan, and what a relief it was."
31060,Finally I felt a bit normal.
31061,"I napped until they said I could leave, and that my bloodwork was fine."
31062,took a cab and came home.
31063,"I was exhausted and just passed out then and there, and as I write this I'm still exhausted."
31064,"Now is the time I'm suppose to take the zoloft, but screw that."
31065,I'm not going through that again.
31066,I don't know what to do though.
31067,"I can't take medications like that, and I can't take feeling like I do forever."
31068,I will never get better.
31069,and that scares me.
31070,I don't know what to do.
31071,I refused to take any prescribed medication.
31072,"I don't have phobias in general, and certainly not of medication."
31073,Though the thought of being 'on' a medication freaked me out.
31074,"So knowing that I was not going to treat the anxiety directly with medication, and realizing that alcohol was making the anxiety worse, I decided to start looking into AA and recovery programs."
31075,Sometimes I think I should have taken the medication.
31076,I never took anxiety meds before but after searching this sub I found a lot of helpful information about the addictiveness how it helps some and not so much others.
31077,A little back story: I'm a 22 y/o female.
31078,"I've battled with depression for about as long as I can remember, but when I'm not sad I'm anxious."
31079,Until about a year ago I was depressed.
31080,I was in a bad relationship and a bad living situation.
31081,"Since then I changed my living situation, my school, and I'm even in the best relationship I could ever hope for."
31082,My depression has cleared up but only to unmask my crippling anxiety.
31083,Few things keep it at bay.
31084,Typically it only comes on randomly when I'm home watching TV.
31085,During the time when I should be relaxing is when it happens.
31086,"If I'm at school working on projects or I'm at work doing my job I'm generally fine, it's distracting."
31087,The two fail safe things that work for me are being around my boyfriend or alcohol.
31088,"Both seem rather unhealthy, alcohol for obvious reasons, and my boyfriend for other obvious reasons."
31089,"I don't want to be clingy and he says I'm not but that's just something else that makes me anxious, worry that I'm being too clingy."
31090,"I haven't had health insurance for about 4 years, so I haven't been able to get any medications or see a professional."
31091,I've thought about natural alternatives but I feel as though sometimes I'm over aware of my body and I'll think they're not working.
31092,I'm a bit at a loss.
31093,"Therapy and time have helped things a lot, as have meds (Wellbutrin)."
31094,"I'm prone to depression without the meds, as well as suicidal thoughts."
31095,"Anyways, has medication really made a difference in this department for anyone?"
31096,I am not a doctor and any advice given is strictly opinion.
31097,"To start, some back story."
31098,I had my first panic attack in December 2008 at the time I didn't know anything about Benzos and was all for a prescription for Xanax.
31099,My doctor obliged.
31100,I lost my insurance and now am at the mercy of government programs until my SSD and Medicade kick in.
31101,These programs do not like giving out Benzos which I am fine with because I am looking to wean off them anyway.
31102,That being said anyone thats been prescribed them knows cutting them cold turkey after 5 years is not only unpleasant but highly dangerous.
31103,I was 22 during my first panic attack and the condition has only worsened.
31104,"I have since developed Agoraphobia, Major Depression Disorder, Borderline Personality, redeveloped OCD, and what doctors tell me are the beginnings of manic episodes that could be anything from a new symptom of my depression to schizophrenia but only time will tell."
31105,I start my journey at a program called Crest in New Jersey.
31106,They have me fill out paper work and then give me a survey.
31107,I am 100 percent honest about everything including my past Opiate addiction and suicide ideation (The latter is something I still struggle with.).
31108,"They give me a meeting with a ""perscirber"" which I believe is a nurse practitioner within 4 days I am fresh out of Xanax until then."
31109,I tried to make it benzo free but check myself into the ER within 16 hours.
31110,The Doctor on duty luckily is a believer in Benzo Withdrawal and gives me an Ativan ASAP.
31111,I am taken to their psych ward where when asked what I was there for I answered truthfully.
31112,A 4 day script of Xanax to hold me over before my appointment.
31113,"He informs me they ""don't do that here."""
31114,"and tells me I can go on my way, they'll bill me later."
31115,"A nurse in the unit that has watched me break down takes pity on me and calls the upstairs doctor who writes a script for 6 .25 Xanax well lower than my 1 mg 3 times a day dosage I am used to, but I'll make it through the night."
31116,The next day I am forced to obtain Xanax from a friends dad.
31117,"I show up to Crest 3 days later not a complete wreck they ask how I am not in withdrawal, I tell them the truth about the friends dad and they say they can't co-sign those actions but understand and allow me to see the perscriber."
31118,Before I see her they tell me 99.9 percent of the people that are given meds in this program don't get benzo's.
31119,I say I understand and am ushered in.
31120,"The perscriber gives me another interview I tell her about my anxiety, history with mental illness, and general bleak world view she is sympathetic."
31121,"I tell her my current meds and she says ""That is way too many benzos."""
31122,I agree and ask her to help me taper off benzos completely.
31123,She says okay and gives me the plan.
31124,"I am well versed on my medication, she says she wants to give me a longer acting benzo so I don't keep having spikes and rebound anxiety."
31125,I suggest Klonopin she says I read her mind.
31126,She prescribes me 1 .5 mg of Klonopin a day for 10 days.
31127,I am not amused...but I have some left over Xanax and she says I can take 2 if the day is really rough.
31128,I ask her if she thinks the drop in dosage is safe.
31129,She assures me it is and the fact it is longer acting will do wonders in my taper and gives me another appointment for that Friday (6 days away).
31130,Flash forward to Tuesday and the plan has failed!
31131,I have taken all my Xanax and K-Pins sans one .5 K-Pin (Mind you I am still taking less than half the amount of benzos I was taking merely 4 days before hand.)
31132,My withdrawal is at critical mass and I am in a constant state of panic.
31133,"Im clammy, sweaty, I think my hearts going too fast, having episodes of numbness in my extremities, I can only sleep 3 hours at a time if I am lucky, and rent is due."
31134,I tell my roommate I am going to get my last check from Dominos.
31135,"I had been working their for about 4 weeks it was the first real job I have had post my first panic attack 5 years before, and I was starting to fall into a series of panic attacks and self isolation that caused me to call them and tell them I lost my license and can no longer work their."
31136,"I enjoyed the people and was sad about it, but I just couldn't pull it off any longer."
31137,None of this is helping my depression.
31138,I wake up the next morning all ready a little panicked.
31139,I live in Brick and worked in Red Bank which is about 40 minutes away.
31140,I didn't mind because driving is one of my few non stressors and the area was full of rich folks that tipped hardily.
31141,But now I am on a tenth of my prescribed dosage (The .5 K-Pin I had saved for the drive.)
31142,of a medicine I have been suddenly deprived of and I have to drive my car 40 minutes through a gauntlet of automobiles.
31143,The drive is terrible as one could predict and I spend most of it trying not to lose myself in my thoughts and panic.
31144,I have several ideations of just careening into on coming traffic and putting myself out of my misery but they are luckily just ideations and I manage to make it to my job.
31145,"I get my check and notice the hospital across the street, as I shake and sweat I realize what needs to be done."
31146,As I walked into the hospital emergency room I felt a sudden relief I knew I would not be allowed to drop dead in this place (at least not without a fight.)
31147,I walk up to the reception and tell them I am here because I was taken off my medicine and am now in a major panic attack.
31148,I am seen almost instantly as mental crisis cases take preference in this particular hospital.
31149,"The nurse sees  I am taken to the back, put in a robe that is not made for 6'7"" 350 pound man."
31150,"Greeted by an unsympathetic Russian nurse that probably has every right in the world to scoff at my first world disorder, but I really wish she wouldn't."
31151,"They take blood, an EKG, and a chest X-ray."
31152,I am interviewed by a crisis manager.
31153,"""I have OCD, BPD, Depression, yadda yadda yadda."""
31154,She asks if I would like to be admitted to the crisis unit for stabilization.
31155,I ask if she thinks it's a good idea.
31156,She says yes.
31157,So I agree.
31158,I was worried about being admitted to their crisis unit because *MORE BACK STORY ALERT!
31159,* I had been in a similar unit about 3 months before in San Francisco I had moved to LA to do Stand Up Comedy (another odd non stressor.)
31160,and ran out of money.
31161,Despondent I went to girlfriends house who lived in Oakdale a small farming town about an hour from San Francisco.
31162,I had planned to go there to essentially have sex one more time before I killed myself.
31163,"So I went over there had sex, hung out, we talked about life and love and all that shit and I was at peace with myself."
31164,I told her I was going to San Francisco to find work and I would be back soon.
31165,She wished me well and I b lined it to the Golden Gate Bridge.
31166,A police officer walked up to me as I stared at the beautiful structure he asked me if I was alright.
31167,I said yes.
31168,He asked again.
31169,I said no.
31170,The officer then escorted me to San Francisco General Hospital where I was 5150'd.
31171,The people were nice enough but the lack of funding meant I NEVER TALKED TO A SINGLE DOCTOR DESPITE BEING THERE FOR 10 DAYS!
31172,Also I was the only person that really really insane.
31173,"With no one to talk to but nurses and people that were nearly non functioning due to their illness, most of who stayed in their room aside from a nice man that was once a rich business man but had digressed into a child like mental state and a man that could be described as future me I soon went stir crazy."
31174,I called my mother (something I was highly against.)
31175,she called me a faker in nice terms sent me 1500 dollars and I proceeded to drive cross country back to NJ.
31176,All in all it sucked and I learned nothing of my illness.
31177,"So yea I was afraid this place was like that place, and it was not."
31178,I was wheeled down to the unit they took all my strings off my clothes (because I can't stab myself with one of the many pencils in my room.)
31179,at this point I was introduced to my roommate a man who claimed he was there for benzo withdrawal which he was.
31180,He then said the doctors here didn't give benzos at all.
31181,And I was then asked if I wanted to go to a group.
31182,I did but during all this riff raff of medical tests and what not I forgot I was having a panic attack.
31183,Which escalated.
31184,I left the group in a cold sweat the nurse tried to calm me down.
31185,I was given an Ativan I calmed down and went to sleep.
31186,The next morning I was antsy but the nurse assured me it would get better today.
31187,I was given 2 .5 mg of klonopin a day and learned all the people there complaining about not getting benzos where people that were abusing them and I was fine.
31188,I didn't get to see a doctor that day but it went off pretty good.
31189,I was introduced to the social people that where in there.
31190,"Some where comical, others sad, most were actually kicking heroin or another drug."
31191,I was forced to attend groups (not really but not going wasn't helping my case and frankly I hadn't talked to people for so long on a regular basis I welcomed it.)
31192,"much like the people some of the groups were comical, others sad, and most were based on kicking heroin."
31193,My first day went well.
31194,The next day I met my doctor and social worker.
31195,I was still not sure about the no benzo policy and at the time knew I was only getting my K-Pins because I brought my prescription bottle in with me.
31196,So I sit down the doctor asks how I feel.
31197,I say disinterested in life and constantly anxious.
31198,She asks me what I take for depression.
31199,I say nothing SSRI's have had bad side effects (more suicidal ideation.)
31200,in the past.
31201,She was shocked and immediately prescribed me Zoloft and the High BP medicine I wasn't taking due to finances.
31202,Then she got to my anxiety I told her about my attacks and medicines.
31203,She asked what I was on before.
31204,I told her about the Xanax 3 times a day 1 MG. She was pretty upset the persricber at Crest cut my dosage to what she did.
31205,I told her I really wanted to get off benzos but I wanted to taper off just like I told the people at crest.
31206,She said she was for that as well and re upped my K-Pins 2 2 1 MG pills a day to stabilize me.
31207,It worked.
31208,Over the next few days my meds were tinkered with mostly the Zoloft was increased and I asked the social worker what I should do about not working.
31209,She got me in contact with ICMS which is a case management program who are trying to get me on SSD and Medicade so I can go back to school.
31210,I was pleased but still having panic attacks.
31211,I made face to face friends for the first time in a long long long while and was finding myself attached to this crisis unit.
31212,I had massive panic attacks every time I realized I would be leaving.
31213,My doctor said it was normal and they were always there if I needed them.
31214,I felt reassured for the first time in a long time.
31215,I was mostly panic free aside from a few flairs (less than 30 minutes) over the next week.
31216,Until my mom visited.
31217,The day before that I had a massive panic attack as she does not believe I am ill. To her credit she tried and the meeting was pretty good.
31218,The days past the down side was this group of adults being treated very child like but that was the idea.
31219,Nothing was stressful everything was done for you.
31220,You were constantly reassured and were encouraged to talk to the other patients about whatever.
31221,Group therapy was amazing.
31222,I was happy.
31223,"Life felt balanced, but it was time for it to end."
31224,I was discharged last Wednesday after spending 7 days in the unit.
31225,I got the number of some great people I hope to keep in contact with.
31226,And was given a new prescription and outpatient psychiatrist also I am on a official and safe K-Pin taper and no longer in constant panic though it still comes and goes.
31227,"The second I stepped out of the hospital and into my car reality hit me and I spent the whole drive home having a panic attack, granted it was much less extreme than the one I had driving up there."
31228,I've went back to isolating since I've been released and am now working through the system and it's bureaucracy.
31229,My first shrink appointment is Wednesday.
31230,Tonight I went to dinner with my mother.
31231,I had constant panic attacks due to my agoraphobia.
31232,She was annoyed but realizes I am no longer faking it...after 27 years.
31233,She asks the questions most of you guys probably get asked by the people that try to understand your anxiety or depression but can't fully grasp it.
31234,"""Why don't you just roll with it?"""
31235,"""What is the reason you are so sad?"""
31236,"""Why do you think those hand movements help your panic attacks?"""
31237,"""Is there anything I can do?"""
31238,and there isn't really.
31239,It's going to be an uphill battle for life I suppose but I'll take it and the first spark was allowing myself to be helped by the crisis unit.
31240,I now know though pretty extreme my condition is manageable.
31241,And hope to continue to progress.
31242,I plan to take a walk in the park tomorrow and I think I am looking forward to it.
31243,In conclusion my crisis center did miricales for me.
31244,But after my trip to the SF crisis unit I know these vary from hospital to hospital.
31245,"Also there are some downsides like These places are filled with some iffy characters and uncomfortable things and after leaving there is an assimilation process back into the regular world, but if it is in a moderately well funded area and you really want to stabilize yourself and have the symptoms I have or any other mental illness including addiction you might want to check the option out."
31246,"Thank you for reading, sorry if their is spelling and grammatical errors."
31247,I'm sick of feeling this way and my medication doesn't feel like it's helping at all.
31248,she's going for therapy shortly and has some meds prescribed.
31249,I didn't start getting anxiety until I was 17 after I took meds for issues.
31250,"I stopped taking the meds for that reason and dealt with my issues on my own, but I'm permanently left with anxiety."
31251,Both times were directly related to my car accident and the visits were because my pain flared up and I could barely walk and was without pain meds.
31252,"I have no idea why, but on top of all the pain meds, I got a Valium each time."
31253,"I've been seeing a therapist since June, and spoke with a psychiatrist in July, but decided to hold off on medication."
31254,"With the meds, I feel a little jolt as the rollercoaster starts leaving the station, but it just rolls right back in."
31255,And I can't even take medication for reasons I don't want to get into right now.
31256,"I already am getting treatment for anxiety amongst a few other things, however, he's a new doctor (not new to treating, more like I just moved) and we are in the middle of figuring out if I'm on the right meds for the treatments."
31257,At the moment I take ZERO meds for anxiety and depression after taking them non-stop for a full year and a half.
31258,Since my medications being up (xanax and citalozorpram) I've been feeling better overall however my anxiety attacks feel stronger.
31259,"I've starting scratching myself to the point of bleeding and big raw areas, and started to binge and purge."
31260,"I cant seem to find a good therapist either I dont want a male, and I don't want an old lady."
31261,My anxiety and all these new problems are also causing a strain on me and my boyfriend.
31262,Advice?
31263,Comfort?
31264,Similarities?
31265,Went to the doctor the other day for some medicine for constipation.
31266,I take the medicine Amitiza and within 15 minutes I start getting anxious.
31267,"According to Wikipedia some studies have shown that passionflower extract works on par with some benzodiazepines as an anti-anxiety medication, has anyone had any experience with taking this herb?"
31268,"I am on medication currently for my anxiety/depression and I have never felt this ""normal"" before."
31269,Basics: I am having intense feelings of nausea at events for no apparent reason.
31270,Backstory: I am M/24/White/Healthy.
31271,"I am generally outgoing, love to play sports, socializing, traveling, meeting people, etc."
31272,"However, since March 2014 I have had a few events that triggered very intense feelings of needing to vomit for no obvious reason."
31273,Let me explain just three and see where this goes.
31274,"1) Jury duty late March: I show up, sign-in, and proceed to wait by doing my morning crossword puzzle and read the book I brought."
31275,The room slowly fills with 200+ people and with 20 minutes until the intro clip plays my body lets me know I NEED to go to the bathroom immediately to vomit.
31276,"Weird (this has never really happened before), but I quickly walk back there to a stall and prepare to hurl."
31277,"I'm there ready to puke but suddenly feel perfectly fine and am confused since I know my body wanted to yet completely reversed decision once ""safe"" in the stall."
31278,I wet a paper towel to cool the back of my neck and head back to my seat very confused.
31279,Not 5 minutes later the same urge but even stronger instantly hits me so again I repeat the process but feel fine once inside the bathroom.
31280,This is getting annoying to me so I decide to chill in the back the bathroom for 5 minutes to make sure I'm fine.
31281,I am feeling good so head back to my seat.
31282,The intro video is about to start and BAM I rush myself back to the toilets again this time positive I'll barf.
31283,But don't.
31284,All I wanted was to vomit (I always feel so much better when I do if I'm sick) but I just couldn't.
31285,For some reason in the bathroom my body had no need to barf.
31286,After running to the bathroom 4-5 times I manage to stay seated the rest of the time and am not called after lunch so leave by 3PM when released.
31287,That's the first scenario with 2 more major times to follow.
31288,2) Interview mid April: I am on my way to an important graduate school interview and am 5/6 blocks away from parking on campus.
31289,I suddenly have a massive urge to puke and barely pull over to a housing community in time.
31290,Luckily I had a plastic bag in my car trunk and proceed to puke in that for a minute or two.
31291,Once I know I got that out of my system I continue to the interview and felt perfect throughout the rest of the day.
31292,3) Amusement Park mid July: Me and a few buddies go to a major theme park and get there early enough that the lines are really minimal at the beginning of the day.
31293,I start feeling a slight queasiness walking to the first ride and prepare another plastic bag in case I need it.
31294,We are the first people to get there so we walk straight on and enjoy the ride with no problem.
31295,I still have the sensation bugging the back of my mind but I am fighting it this time because I want to ride the rollercoasters.
31296,Run to ride #2 and there's a 7 minute line which is great since that's super short for this huge park.
31297,"However, 1 minute into waiting my body sends the signal that I need to puke and gives me the options to either run to the bathroom or throw up everywhere in line."
31298,I chose to leave the line and head for the restroom.
31299,Like event 1 I find a stall and am ready to vomit but suddenly have no need to anymore.
31300,This time I try to force myself as best I can to puke since I just want it over with and get back to the rides.
31301,No matter what I did I couldn't throw up so I leave the bathroom feeling better but knowing this wasn't over.
31302,I find my friends at the ride exit and we proceed to go to the next coaster line which is another really short wait time of 10 minutes.
31303,No sooner did we get to the back of the line when the urge happens again and I bolt for the restroom only to not be able to puke (surprise surprise).
31304,I feel so defeated and subjected to this nausea.
31305,It's driving me insane and is really embarrassing that it's ruining the mood for my friends and me.
31306,They don't want to ride without me and I feel bad they feel guilty.
31307,Luckily that time was the last big sensation that day but it definitely put a huge damper on the morning there.
31308,"Now to present day mid August: This feeling seems to come and go only at places where there large amounts of people (big restaurants, Target, to name a few)."
31309,Ive thrown up only once more but the sensation to throw up makes me cut many of my outings short because I get so very uncomfortable with a seemingly constant upset stomach.
31310,It's become something that's just lurking in the back of my mind waiting to surface.
31311,I keep a plastic bag in the car at all times now and make sure to pick out the bathroom in restaurants while walking to the table to be seated... just in case.
31312,I can't really understand what's happening or if it's even related to anxiety.
31313,I have never had this trouble before around large crowds until ~3 months ago and it's completely changed my preparation in going out.
31314,The things I am most concerned about is a big graduate ceremony that's going to happen in 2 months for my school and I am afraid it's going to strike there and be really disruptive.
31315,The ceremony is all of us students seated in the center of the gym with family and friends in the bleachers.
31316,I am concerned 5 minutes into the program I get the urge and need to  leave the gym which will be noticed by all.
31317,All 250+ of us get called individually to the stage to get our placard and I can just picture my name being called but I am chillin' in the bathroom wanting to puke but can't.
31318,Such a sad mental image haha.
31319,Do y'all think this is some sort of anxiety or am I simply correlating events with unrelated random bouts of nausea?
31320,I haven't tried any vitamins or medicines but it just occurred to me I should go get some TUMS and see if that helps.
31321,I have a big gathering coming up Wednesday that will pretty much solidify my fears if I feel sick during that get together.
31322,Any advice or tips or personal experience would be great to read.
31323,And thanks for reading this crazy wall of text.
31324,I appreciate it!
31325,Since starting the medicine I haven't had a period.
31326,(He does have OCD and takes medication for it.).
31327,"I have a week and a half left before I'll be placed on medication, but for now it's entirely up to me."
31328,I tried medication for a while and it didn't help.
31329,tldr; Can meds be an easy fix?
31330,I'm out of meds.
31331,I have plenty of things in my life that would be easier if I could just drive without feeling a huge sense of anxiety.
31332,"I have a car, which I bought before I realised how nervous it makes me so it's pain to have this sense of being overwhelmed when I have a perfect tool to use."
31333,"First of all, I don't go to parties or events because I'm too freaked out to drive (unless they are close to public transport)."
31334,"Secondly, I don't apply for jobs that require driving and part (not all, only about 30%) of the reason I left my old job was because of the driving and how anxious that made me every day."
31335,I've done lots of driving in the past.
31336,"I've done 1.5 hrs trips, because of where I'm located I had to drive supervised for 100hrs before getting my license and I used to drive to work (not the job I just left)."
31337,I don't know how to fix this.
31338,I've tried before to drive a little bit more each day to get my confidence up but nothing has come from it.
31339,"If anything, I've moved further away from driving as a result."
31340,"It's not that I think I'm a bad driver, just that I'm terrified of something bad happening."
31341,I was in an extremely minor crash as a child and I think that may be connected but it was so inconsequential that I can hardly believe it to be the main concern.
31342,Is there anyone out there that is similar?
31343,What do I do and does this feeling go away?
31344,"Edit: I'm female, 21, have undiagnosed depression, I take no medications, exercise regularly, eat well and come from a nuclear family."
31345,For context!
31346,"I'm just really not sure if I'd be able to handle it, I'm between meds right now so I'm kind of up and down."
31347,"Someone I know has talked about their medication opening themselves up to emotions they were somewhat disconnected from, so I wonder if this is completely unrelated or at all similar."
31348,They have ADHD and take different meds so it's a stretch.
31349,"I've been on prozac for 4 months and at 60mg for about a month, so it's possible that the medication has ratcheted down my fight/flight response enough to where I am actually feeling some other emotions that are maybe related to why I'm in fight or flight mode so much... has anything like this ever happened to anyone?"
31350,I've been dealing with this for the past few months.
31351,"During the day, I feel great."
31352,"It's whenever 10 PM or so rolls around that I start feeling the chest tightness, pressure, and the cramps."
31353,I can't take it.
31354,I find myself staying up and googling heart disease and strokes.
31355,I'm perfectly capable of thinking rationally.
31356,"I'm 21, exercise 3-4x per week (running over a mile), I don't drink, smoke, or eat red meat often."
31357,"I had my doctor give me an ECG recently, and everything was normal except for left ventricle enlargement, which he said was probably the result of running."
31358,"Clearly, I'm at a pretty low risk of heart disease."
31359,"The problem is, I can never get the ""what-if"" scenarios out of my head."
31360,"My blood pressure is 140/90, which scares the shit out of me."
31361,"My uncle, a cardiologist, said it's nothing to worry about and that it means nothing."
31362,Fuck!
31363,I'm so sick of feeling like this...
31364,"I feel great whenever I take an ambien and stay up, because I'm super relaxed."
31365,"Otherwise, I get palpitations every few nights."
31366,Sometimes they happen during the day.
31367,I don't even know what question to ask.
31368,I have no direction.
31369,Does anyone else deal with this?
31370,I'd give anything to feel the way I used to.
31371,p.s.
31372,Not on any medications.
31373,Highly stressful job (programmer).
31374,I heard somewhere that Prozac can lose effectiveness over very long periods of time and some people have to change meds to continue to see progress.
31375,"I'm not on any meds, and I've really been struggling the past few days."
31376,"Also, any experiences with getting off effexor/venlafaxine and either switching to something else or no meds at all would be interesting to hear."
31377,"My brother has depression and used to take meds for it, but not is fine without them but says that they helped at the time."
31378,I was wondering if meds are the right choice for me?
31379,This detracts me from medication as I have also heard it is almost always a placebo anyway.
31380,But I can't help but think that meds would help me deal with work and school for my last quarter (usually get very anxious sitting in class).
31381,I would have an apointment scheduled once every about two weeks and they would keep tweeking my meds to try to get them to work right but they could only do that when I would go.
31382,"I have epilepsy and anxiety disorder, so I take meds for that - and the voice of course criticizes me."
31383,"Going back on the medication didn't help too much, and I've been carrying the same type of anxiety since then."
31384,"Hi y'all, I just want to preface this with a little blurb since I've never posted here before and I feel like having at least some background information would be nice."
31385,"I'm 18, I was diagnosed (is that the correct word?)"
31386,"with anxiety back when I was 16, but I've had it long before that."
31387,I've been on various medications but they all made me feel nasty or had no effect.
31388,"Ok, so I've been pretty good this year."
31389,I haven't had an anxiety attack or been severely depressed since May so I've been pretty happy.
31390,"But whenever I buy something (online, in a store, etc.)"
31391,I get very anxious and even depressed that I'm wasting my money and that I'm going to regret buying whatever it is I'm purchasing.
31392,"For example, I bought some games and a Wii U pro controller so I could play some new games with my boyfriend, but I was having a full blown anxiety attack."
31393,"It doesn't matter what I'm buying, it can be clothes, games, or whatever else and I'll still just be panicking like I'm wasting my money even though I really want and have thought about what I'm buying."
31394,I really hate it since it throws me into this self loathing state.
31395,Any advice would be appreciated.
31396,[Thanks!

31398,"Therapy/medication is out of the question (financial reasons, and I don't want to take pharmaceuticals), and I am open to stuff like meditation."
31399,"I don't wanna make this about alcoholism, I can stop but I've been using it as a crutch and I guess my problem is that it's now making me more anxious rather than helping and that makes me feel helpless cus I don't know how long it will take to get over that, and I don't want to go on medication."
31400,I've been so proud of myself lately since stopping therapy and coming off my meds (Lexapro).
31401,"I've tried medicine, but whenever I take it it makes me feel disconnected, almost stoned if you will, and it just makes me freak out more."
31402,PS - I'm not on mood medication and have no desire to take it.
31403,I've always been lazy and low energy so I was wondering if its me or my meds.
31404,"No meds, pushing along, working from home, making the ends meet just enough."
31405,"Hello,

Has anyone had weird dreams on medication?"
31406,My question is this: has anyone been able to control their anxiety without medication?
31407,I really don't like what taking medication did to me so I'd like to avoid it if possible.
31408,"I know there are other options besides citalopram, but I'd just really prefer to try and do it myself, I really don't want my decision making or sex drive or anything to be affected by medication."
31409,**TL;DR** Has anyone been able to manage their anxiety without meds?
31410,"I'm 25, have had panic attacks and social anxiety since I was 16, when my friend committed suicide."
31411,I thought this was just the way my life would always be.
31412,"My panic attacks, PTSD, social anxiety, and impending doom started getting worse this year; I was increasingly convinced I was going to die, or at least throw up or piss my pants in public."
31413,"I had severe anxiety whenever I had to talk to anyone, and moderate anxiety just waking up in the morning, which could escalate to panic without warning."
31414,It felt like the world was ending.
31415,I thought I was going completely insane and considered dropping out of my grad school program and getting inpatient psychiatric treatment.
31416,But that didn't happen.
31417,"Instead, here's what worked for me:

1."
31418,**Therapy.
31419,** It was awkward and stressful and terrifying at first.
31420,"Trust me, I had been avoiding it for so long."
31421,"But I finally went, and kept going."
31422,"It is seriously hard work, but when you are ready to put in the effort to be vulnerable and better understand yourself, it can be a transformative experience."
31423,"I went once a week for 6 months, then twice a week for 3 months, and will continue once a week for however long I need to."
31424,2.
31425,**Acupuncture.
31426,"** I know it might sound fancy or expensive, but if you go to a community acupuncture clinic, each appointment costs $15, which is MORE than worth it if you have disabling anxiety."
31427,Plus you get to stay as long as you want.
31428,"It helped me so much, especially at the beginning when my body was in a constant state of hyperarousal and tension; acupuncture was the only thing that could seriously relax me."
31429,[Check to see if you have a community acupuncture clinic close to you.
31430,"](https://www.pocacoop.com/clinics/) I went twice a week for a month, then once a week for two months, now whenever I feel particularly stressed or feel like I want to indulge in deep relaxation."
31431,3.
31432,**Finding something spiritual to ground me.
31433,"** I'm not going to go into my beliefs, but it was something I was neglecting entirely."
31434,"Once I had a renewed sense of spiritual presence, my anxiety (though persistent) didn't have as much terrifying weight, because I had more perspective on my existence as a whole."
31435,"I don't care if it's yoga, stargazing, Buddha, Allah, Jesus Christ, mindfulness, running marathons, or bird watching, but find something that makes you feel connected to living life in a deep, meaningful way."
31436,"It made my anxiety less important, though of course not any less real."
31437,4.
31438,**Being patient with myself.
31439,** I never expected myself to get better quickly.
31440,It has been 9 months of busting my ass to get to where I am.
31441,"I've had to allow myself to just accept wherever I am in the process, including being frustrated and exhausted and scared and all that."
31442,"This might be the most difficult part, especially for little old perfectionist me."
31443,5.
31444,**Taking care of myself physically.
31445,"** I eat whole, delicious foods that make me happy and only drink water and herbal tea."
31446,I get about 8 hours of sleep a night.
31447,"Being consistently physically active (walking, biking, practicing yoga) definitely relieves some anxiety too, but I think it's most effective when done in tandem with other treatments (evidence suggests this, too)."
31448,6.
31449,"**Watching these videos from the [Mindweather101: Navigating Mental and Emotional Distress](http://www.alloflife.org/Our-Classes/) ""class""."
31450,** The course is just a series of videos that you can watch whenever you feel like it (and it's free).
31451,One of the main ideas is that our brains are always changing.
31452,"Thus even those of us diagnosed with a ""mental illness"" have brains with the capacity to change."
31453,"Unfortunately, few mental health practitioners practice with this philosophy, even though there is tons of evidence on neuroplasticity."
31454,"The class is about working with the attitude that you can recover fully from the mental health issues you are struggling with (like anxiety, but they tend to talk more about severe depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia)."
31455,"I know that everyone's experience with anxiety is different, but I just wanted to share with you all to celebrate how far I've come and to encourage others to reconceptualize their anxiety as something they can grow past rather than something you always have to suffer with."
31456,Thinking about my anxiety with this hope and insight has helped me grow so much without using any pharmacotherapeutic medication.
31457,My therapist offered prescription antianxiolytics but I declined and said I would like to try without first.
31458,"Sure, there have been many times where I wished I had a benzo in my bag to pop in my mouth when my social anxiety seemed unbearable, but I survived without and with a lot of hard work I no longer have that need."
31459,"I am not saying this intending to make people feel bad for using medications, but I want people to know that *you CAN recover to a point that you no longer need meds*."
31460,Getting on meds does not mean you have to depend on them forever.
31461,"No single treatment could have led me to where I am now, but with therapy, acupuncture, healthy spiritual and physical practices, that Mindweather course, and a lot of patience, I am panic attack free and have hardly any social anxiety."
31462,I feel less anxious and more joyful than I have in my entire life.
31463,I want to help others feel the same way.
31464,"25 year old female here, not on medication and having some real work problems."
31465,"I've struggled with anxiety for a few years now, seeing a psychiatrist, on medication."
31466,"Hi everyone, first time posting in this sub."
31467,I have a lot of info and experience in regards to anxiety.
31468,"Id like to eventually write a book, but until then, here you go!"
31469,I started having panic attacks when I was 9 years old (I am 27 now).
31470,"I've had pretty much every symptom associated with it, but here are the most common ones:    

Feelings of dread."
31471,Feeling like you cannot swallow.
31472,Trouble regulating breath.
31473,"Feeling of ""blood running cold""."
31474,Feeling weepy.
31475,Shaking.
31476,Coldness in toes/fingers or more.
31477,"Faintness     
""Fight or Flight"" sensation."
31478,These are just some of the symptoms anxiety can cause.
31479,"Because anxiety is basically an unnecessary trigger of ""fight or flight"" alarm in your brain, it generally will try to find a reason for the trigger regardless of the fact there isn't one."
31480,This means anxiety can and will mimic symptoms of other issues; the brain is amazing like that.
31481,"Some common things that people worry about during a panic attack (trigger warning):    
    
Heart attacks."
31482,Dying.
31483,Others dying.
31484,Fainting.
31485,Other various ailments or health issues.
31486,"Suicide (fear of, more likely)."
31487,"So, now that we have established what anxiety feels like and what type of worry it brews, here are some tools and tips!"
31488,"Tips:     

Try reducing stress in your life."
31489,"Try yoga, meditation, hot showers, walks in nature or at the beach, etc."
31490,Remember that panic attacks are generally short lived (5-15 minutes).
31491,Ride it out and remind yourself that it's almost over.
31492,Drop bad friends.
31493,Negative relationships are a huge source of anxiety.
31494,Make time for you.
31495,Evaluate how you're feeling and process your emotions daily.
31496,"Tools:    
    
Logic."
31497,Your number one tool against anxiety and panic attacks is logic.
31498,Anxiety is generally not logical.
31499,"If you can logically process those anxious thoughts, you start to realize they are false logic and it speeds up calming down and more."
31500,I can avoid panic attacks as a whole most times with this simple method.
31501,Medicine.
31502,Meds are not the bad guy.
31503,Are many antianxiety meds abused?
31504,"Yes, sadly."
31505,There should be no stigma about these medicines.
31506,"If you have GAD or Panic disorder and it is not well managed, medicine can help."
31507,Therapy.
31508,Having someone to talk to can extinguish many of your environmental stressors.
31509,"Anxiety can come from nothing, but stress can give fuel."
31510,"Talk through the things you can, to make things more manageable."
31511,"I realize this is mostly for panic disorder, but many of the tools and tips overlap."
31512,I hope this helps even one person.
31513,I am so tired of mental health being stigmatized in many parts of the world.
31514,It is so common and such a pain to deal with.
31515,"If you have questions, please feel free to comment or shoot me a message."
31516,Id be happy to help.
31517,I'm studying abroad in Italy this semester.
31518,"The town we are in is not the best of areas, and the language barrier is also contributing."
31519,"Even walking around during the day causes anxiety, just less."
31520,"Once the sun sets, I don't like to leave my room."
31521,"And even after a certain point, just being in my room at night causes anxiety."
31522,How should I get over this?
31523,I'm not sure if my insurance will cover any prescription medications.
31524,"I took medicine for a while, but even she agreed that taking something with side effects that also make you feel physical symptoms is not the best idea for me."
31525,I also got an SNRI medication.
31526,"Both the therapy, which I'm still following, and the medication eased it a little so I could ""live"" again."
31527,"I have to ask, is shaking something that requires meds to deal with?"
31528,"After 5 years of anxiety (IBS, fainting, fatigue) and little improvement with meds (SSRI and benzo) and therapy (every second week) I recently realized that antihistamine (taken for my hay fever) cured 80% of my symptoms."
31529,"I am on medication, doesn't seem to work anymore."
31530,"When I'm sick, I sometimes I have to take whatever medication is needed to relieve symptoms, but also my Lorazepam so that my anxiety won't make me sicker."
31531,"I recently upped my dose, as per directed from my psychiatrist, and though I feel like I was experiencing anxiety and the symptoms BEFORE my dose was increase...I'm a little paranoid it's my meds."
31532,But...how do I know if it's the meds or situational?
31533,I was wondering if anyone else had experienced similar side effects while on this medication and what was done to resolve it.
31534,I'm not on any anxiety meds btw.
31535,"So after years without feeling any abnormal anxiety without medication, i experienced some of the horrors again."
31536,Glad that I'm okay now and don't need any meds while staying at home.
31537,I'm manic depressive and I take medicine for it.
31538,"I already thought I'd have to go back to medication, but as long as this strategy works for me in emergencies it's fine I guess!"
31539,"So I have severe social anxiety, I see a therapist and take medication for it."
31540,"Also I'd just like to note that I have gotten treatment for my anxiety from professionals in the past, but we've since hit an financial rough spot and are currently unable to afford any therapy or medication."
31541,"I'm considering talking to my doctor about this, but I don't want medication."
31542,"Background: 30M, GAD, Social Anxiety, taking three daily medications and have two different ""as-needed"" medications available to me."
31543,"Had a severe work thing happen last night, when I was already feeling a bit blue."
31544,"Ended up being awake most of the night, lying in bed, thinking about it."
31545,"Today I'm having all the same symptoms of an alcohol hangover (Cloudy head/awareness, taste in mouth, upset stomach, nausea, etc.)"
31546,despite not having a drop to drink last night.
31547,Anyone else have a similar reaction to a severe anxiety episode?
31548,"Now, my psychiatrist recommended 10mg when I told her that I was ""reacting well "" to the medication."
31549,I feel like I am at the same point I started at before I took any meds.
31550,I don't want this to go on that way I thought I was getting better I don't think I'll be able to handle it if it gets as bad as it used to be before I started taking meds .
31551,"I received medication in the past (that I was afraid to take at the time), and am hoping to be prescribed something similar again."
31552,"I've struggled with anxiety on and off, most of my life, although it's only been about six months or so since I've been taking medication/getting treatment."
31553,I just wanted to see if anyone else has tried this medicine.
31554,"Hello, I have posted here before in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jqav3/helpmeds_i_have_suffered_severe_anxiety_on_planes/) about my severe anxiety on planes and enclosed methods of travel (excluding cars that I am driving)."
31555,I start thinking about how I'm not worthy of actual medication and there's nothing really wrong with me and a doctor would laugh at me and then I start crying and I'm starting to actually tear up just typing this so I'm going to end my post here.
31556,"Basically thinking about getting help/seeking medication for my severe anxiety is giving me even worse anxiety and I physically cannot bring myself to step inside a doctor's office or even make a phone call, I end up paralysed and staring at the phone and shaking and convincing myself that it's a bad idea and then it triggers a huge panic attack."
31557,Maybe someone else can share their story of how they got themselves help and how they went about getting medication?
31558,ive had panic attack probs since 2007. was good for a while without meds.
31559,"I've been having a lot of sleep issues lately due to it, and I've recently (as in three months ago) stopped all my anxiety meds, including celexa, clonazepam and seroquel."
31560,Hi everyone.
31561,"I have major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety and OCD."
31562,I've tried over thirty medications and my doctor has told me that there is nothing left to try medicinally to help take the edge off.
31563,I have tried transcranial magnetic stimulation and it helped lift my mood a small bit but not significant enough to make me functional.
31564,I've tried CBT and DBT and several other types of behavioral therapy.
31565,My doctor said my next move would be to get a deep brain stimulator.
31566,"I heard though that people have had success with acid, ketamine and ecstasy."
31567,I am really searching though for some solution that will help.
31568,Feel free to ask me anything about the treatments I've gotten if you want more details.
31569,I really appreciate your input and I'm ready to try whatever it takes.
31570,"I've had anxiety for a while, was seeing a therapist in college who suggested meds but couldn't actually prescribe them, so I was never on them."
31571,"I think the Dr thought I was just trying to get medication off of her, because her recommendation was to an addiction clinic."
31572,"I end up shaking, feeling terror and nausea, I am sitting here right now unable to take my medication because my throat feels tight and I feel sick thinking of death."
31573,Only reason I got the job was because of the medication.
31574,"I don't want to rely on the medication for the duration of this job though, but I know I'm going to be in stressful situations on a daily basis now."
31575,"I'm not really sure what to do now, I can't take this medication everyday or I'll get incredibly addicted."
31576,I've been using this medication for two weeks now prescribed by my doctor to help treat my anxiety and depression stemming from it.
31577,I've been on this medication before a year and a half ago to treat anxieties I was having about finding a job and my home situation and don't remember having any negative effects like this.
31578,I want to know if anyone has found this medication to help them overcome their anxieties and depression.
31579,"I'm also bipolar, and other things, and I'm on meds for it."
31580,"The medication I take for anxiety is also for sleep, but I'm on such a high dose that I think I built a tolerance for it, which is why it doesn't help my anxiety anymore."
31581,"After some medication, patience, and the knowledge that these feelings were a product of my own doing, things got better."
31582,The medication gave me the ability to place myself in uncomfortable situations.
31583,After a year I was even able to stop taking the medication all together.
31584,What is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)?
31585,"It is a condition in which a person worries excessively about normal things, such as paying bills, making good on commitments, and meeting expectations."
31586,"Now, everyone worries – it's part of the normal human condition; however, generalized anxiety disorder causes someone to become consumed with fear and worry, to the point that it begins to interfere with their normal, day-to-day functioning."
31587,"If you're asking the question: ""What is generalized anxiety disorder?"""
31588,"because you think you or someone you know is suffering from it, you're not alone."
31589,"It's a disconcertingly common disorder, present in almost seven million Americans."
31590,That's more than 3% of the population!
31591,"Moreover, generalized anxiety disorder tends to afflit women twice as often as men."
31592,"This disorder doesn't always start as a huge, rushing panic attack – often times it develops gradually, usually in a stressful period of life."
31593,"The problem is, once the normal period of anxiety has passed and the life events which caused the heightened fear and worry are in the rear view mirror, the body and brain don't readjust to the new pace and continue overproducing stress chemicals."
31594,Generalized anxiety disorder doesn't negatively impact everyone's life to the point that it shuts down.
31595,"There are many people that live with a mild form of the affliction who are able to function socially, maintain personal relationships, and find professional success despite their tendency to worry excessively."
31596,"However, when someone's anxiety becomes so great that it prevents them from living to their fullest, doctors and psychiatrists then take the next step to begin treatment."
31597,"There are many treatments available for generalized anxiety disorder, and they usually work best in a combination – though every individual is different and will respond in unique ways to different therapies."
31598,Here is a quick list of the treatments.
31599,"Medication - There are a host of medications available for generalized anxiety disorder, ranging from SSRI medications (also used to treat depression, which like anxiety, is a disorder of the executive function of the brain) to drugs like Valium, which depresses the central nervous system."
31600,"Talk therapy - Oftentimes, our subconscious works against our conscious minds in ways we don't fully understand."
31601,Appropriate psychotherapy and counseling can help us identify subconscious motivations for anxiety and fear and then work to address the causes of those problems.
31602,"Alternative therapies - There are many alternative therapies available, from herbal treatments to technologically driven options, such as neurofeedback."
31603,"Neurofeedback is proving especially effective in managing generalized anxiety disorder, because it teaches a patient to control their physiological responses to neurological triggers."
31604,"There you have it: the answer to the question, ""What is generalized anxiety disorder?"""
31605,"If you or someone you know are suffering from the symptoms of this affliction, talk to a doctor or health care professional right away."
31606,"My grades are up, I have a boyfriend, I find things just overall less stressful (meds helped a LOT), but I still find it hard to make and maintain friendships."
31607,"I refuse to take medication because normally my OCD is under control through the use of exercise, diet, and meditation."
31608,What happens if I don't have my medication?
31609,"Having never had problems with anxiety before (besides minor nerves), I would like to avoid meds if possible."
31610,The past 2 years of my life haven't gone well.
31611,I got fired halfway through an internship in Florida and moved back in with my mom for a while.
31612,"Came out of the closet, fell in love with an amazing young man (who's honestly been the BEST thing that's happened to me since I moved home), and scraped by on a waiter job until I had enough to move elsewhere."
31613,"I found a full-time job that ended up exacerbating my anxiety, as did the next one."
31614,"I've played brain juice roulette with a total of 3 different medications and 1 supplement, and the 3rd medication is doing reasonably well."
31615,"My car died September of last year, a couple weeks after I went to the ER for suicidal thoughts; I returned in an ambulance 2 months after that."
31616,"I got on that 3rd medication, but a few weeks later, I turned 26 &amp; lost my insurance."
31617,The last full-time job fired me on my anniversary with them--the longest I've ever continuously been employed with a company--because of those mental issues.
31618,So now I'm on Medicaid but I can't see a psychiatrist for another month.
31619,"Unfortunately on Sunday night my cell phone was stolen right out of my hands on the bus ride home from work; it took me over the edge and I wanted to throw myself down the stairs at work, but thankfully I got help for that and spent Monday night/Tuesday morning in the ER."
31620,"However, my medication just ran out today but the doctor who prescribed it apparently won't even talk to me because I'm not on her insurance anymore."
31621,"The grocery store won't fill it and because I'm on Medicaid, I was told to go to the city walk-in clinic to see a psychiatrist who could authorize a refill."
31622,But it turns out I was misled and they don't have a psychiatrist; they scheduled someone with the city earlier in March than my other appointment.
31623,"I'm afraid that 

I feel mentally, physically, and emotionally tired and spent and I'd like to take a vacation to someplace warm ASAP."
31624,"Good news is that I have about a thousand dollars in savings, mostly for rent, as well as some awesomely supportive friends and family."
31625,TL;DR---Last couple years have sucked; I lost my insurance a few weeks after I got prescribed a new medication that actually works for me but I can't see a psychiatrist for a month; lots of trouble refilling the prescription and now everything's just more of a huge mess.
31626,Any viewpoints on sleeping meds is also appreciated as I have started to consider it as of late.
31627,"I just saw a new psychologist on one of my ""down"" days, when I was super anxious, depressed, very tearful, and she immediately suggested I try medication."
31628,I feel like if I try medication there's going to be no endpoint.
31629,I don't see what medication would be helping me with.
31630,"Junior year of high school has started and thankfully my medication has been curbing the ""new year"" anxiety."
31631,"Hi All,

I have my first psychiatry consultation in a few weeks, and I want to come prepared with some well-researched medication ideas/combinations/suggestions, so as to discuss the benefits &amp; drawbacks with the doctor."
31632,"I would like to avoid medication again, since the Celexa, although it was effective, made me feel dumber."
31633,I've been feeling like my anxiety is getting out of control again and my T wanted my meds reviewed ASAP by a doctor.
31634,I've been taking extra doses of my anti anxiety meds but if I take too many I won't be able to think because they slow down brain activity.
31635,"Hi all,

I've been prescribed Sertraline for the first time and I'm actually quite nervous about taking it as I've never taken medication before, and all the potential side-effects are fairly off putting."
31636,"Having said that, I do  badly need help (I'm constantly scared to leave the house and feel like everyone is talking/looking at me when I do) and so requested the medication myself."
31637,Is it fine to lift weights whilst taking the medication?
31638,I'm going to see my doctor tuesday about getting on some much needed medication.
31639,i have little to no insurance and i need to be on anti depresents and anxiety medication.
31640,"It helped, but what worked for me was the medication and the effect it had on me."
31641,"By March next year, it will be four years since I began medication and I am hoping to have finished."
31642,"Been mildly depressed for about 10 years now, currently on medication."
31643,"I am currently trying to sort out my anxiety and I feel its growing everyday, I am at the point where I am worried about being worried and I am now wondering do meds really help that much?"
31644,"I saw a doctor and was diagnosed with ""major depression/anxiety"" and was just put on 20mg lexapro and 1mg of klonopin 2x a day (I guess until the lexapro kicks in)

Before being put on medication I would self medicate my depression with cannabis and it was great when I had it but when I was out I became very agitated and I guess what you would call anxious."
31645,I wouldn't have to take meds so I can leave my room or whatever safe place I'm in if I could just snap my fingers and stop worrying.
31646,So I don't know if all this is what's causing my random bouts of anxiety/sadness/overwelmness or if I'm building a resistance to my meds.
31647,Anxiety for me has been so high lately.
31648,I've been shaking.
31649,My heart has been pounding so hard.
31650,I've been having trouble eating and thinking clearly.
31651,"However, I have abused drugs and alcohol in the past but I'm sober now."
31652,"I'm worried I have very few, if any options."
31653,I'm going to discuss this with my doctor next time I see her but I wanted to get some feedback here first.
31654,"Here's a list of meds I've tried for various mental health issues:

Strattera

Concerta

Prozac

Xanax

Lexapro

Cymbalta

Wellbutrin

Paxil

Ativan

Effexor

Klonopin

Seroquel

Trileptal

Hydroxyzine

Lithium

and I'm currently on Risperdal and Zoloft."
31655,"The only medications I've found to help some with anxiety has been the benzos (but even that did very little) and Seroquel and Risperdal, to an extent."
31656,None of the SSRI's or SNRI's have helped.
31657,Most of my anxiety is related to social things but lately it's been more general.
31658,I'm doing a lot of hard work with exposure and therapy and all that.
31659,It's just not enough on it's own.
31660,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and Social Anxiety by a doctor, and am prescribed medication for it."
31661,"Neither my parents nor I wanted to try medication at that point, so we decided to try therapy."
31662,I have a few appointments for Monday and my mom (who takes medicine for her anxiety) says I don't have to go.
31663,My therapist is putting me on anxiety meds.
31664,Was given anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds.
31665,"So what I'm wondering is those of you who take daily anti-anxiety medication, does it help with overall anxious feelings?"
31666,"I went back to my PCP for a follow-up, and he brought up the topic of medication."
31667,"I have always been very afraid of medication, and especially afraid of any kind of anxiety medication."
31668,"She also recommended that I see a psychiatrist for a second opinion on the medication, and to follow up with the psychiatrist while on the medication."
31669,Did you go on meds?
31670,What meds and what side effects did you experience?
31671,"Therapy, so far, hasn't been particularly productive and I'm very wary of medication."
31672,It was so nice to hang out and he was so comforting and excited to make me food and bring me my meds.
31673,"I took the fluoxetine for 8 weeks, when the doc and the phamacist and dr google all said it would take 6 - 8 weeks to become effective, and it made me feel even more depressed &amp; anxious over those 8 weeks and after that time I only recovered to a level that was about the same as before I started the medication."
31674,"Reddit, what can I expect whilst coming off my meds, ie."
31675,"Which is why I'm asking.. Would it be possible to be prescribed a medication first, before actually going to a therapist?"
31676,I've tried meds but I hate dependence and I'm trying to be straight edge.
31677,"I am having my first full on attack since I went on some new medication, and I don't know who to turn to."
31678,"I had a very negative coming out experience, and was kind of anxious to begin with, so that bit got worse."
31679,"Stayed in a bad situation for too long, lost all my friends, and kind of internally freak out whenever I run into homophobic crap on the internet or in real life."
31680,"Anyways, anyone have any experience with dealing with this?"
31681,"So far medications have been helpful, and I finally found a good therapist."
31682,"My last two were terrible, and the most recent one was trying to practice covert ex-gay christian therapy on me."
31683,"Talk about violation of professional ethics, anyways..."
31684,i'm 16 and have been on medication (escitalopram) for around 6 months.
31685,"In 11 days I'll be seeing a doctor to look into medication, but that feels like an eternity."
31686,He [20] stopped taking his medication because he's joining the military and he has to work to hold it together so he won't get diagnosed again.
31687,"As for basic info, I'm 18 and female."
31688,"I'm not prescribed any anxiety medications, but I do occasionally take recreational diazapam."
31689,I have been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder.
31690,"I've been in and out of therapy since I was 13, and ultimately every therapist has decided that I have good enough coping skills, making therapy really isn't the right place for me."
31691,I view consistent medication as a last resort both because of cost and overall hesitance towards potential dependency.
31692,So anyways.
31693,The details.
31694,"This is my first year at uni, and I moved 500 miles away from home to go to a school that exponentially increases my chances of getting into medical school."
31695,I'm miserable here.
31696,I'm always stressed.
31697,"I mean, I know college is supposed to be hard, but it's worse than that."
31698,"I am exhausted all the time, but I can't fall asleep."
31699,I can't get aroused enough to masturbate (something I'm able to do both quickly and frequently at home).
31700,I'm so stressed that I can't even begin assignments because all I can think about is how much I have to do.
31701,"My mom used to ask me, ""how do you eat an elephant?"""
31702,"and of course, the answer is ""one bite at a time,"" but it's getting harder and harder to stop looking at the entire elephant."
31703,"I've tried all sorts of things, both good and bad."
31704,"I've tried exercise, drinking relaxing teas, planning my time, playing video games, smoking, drugs, crying it out, deep breathing, sleeping almost exactly eight hours every night...it doesn't really work."
31705,The only two things that make me feel better are the tea and the drugs.
31706,"At the end of the day, I'm just a mess."
31707,I hurt everywhere.
31708,I'm exhausted.
31709,I have a headache.
31710,I'm hungry but I don't want to go get food (I live in a dorm so food is a short walk away from my building).
31711,I think my stress is causing my IBS.
31712,I think it's exacerbating my acne.
31713,I think it's impacting my solo-sex-life.
31714,"I've always figured that as long as I'm not thinking about killing myself, I really don't need anti depressants, and as long as I'm not having panic attacks (I used to) I don't need anti anxiety meds."
31715,"Right now, I think being so far away from home, where all my loving, supportive relationships are, is one of my biggest suppliers of stress."
31716,"That, and school work, which should be easy as a lot of my classes are reviews of things I already learned about in high school."
31717,"Since I think living here and not home is the biggest factor, I'm planning on transferring back after this school year."
31718,I don't know what to do until then.
31719,I know you guys probably aren't doctors.
31720,I'm not going to take your advice *over* that of a medical professional.
31721,"I just can't seem to find time in my schedule to make it to the campus doc (since I'm not a suicide risk, I'm on a pretty long waiting list...) and I don't really have the money to go see someone else."
31722,"So, I'd just like to hear some ideas."
31723,Do I sound like I should consider medication?
31724,Do I sound like I could just tough it out and move back home?
31725,"Am I being immature and giving up by moving back home, or am I making a good decision based on my health?"
31726,I don't know.
31727,I feel so very lost and so very small.
31728,"I'm shaking I need my meds, not only I am missing those im missing plenty of other shit for the autoimmune problem but this one is the one that I feel I need the most right now."
31729,I was nervous about taking any medication but I knew I needed a change.
31730,"It was working in other ways though, so my psychiatrist wanted to add in another medication to prevent the anxiety (but keep me on wellbutrin)."
31731,"I slowly weaned off both the meds since they seemed to cause my panic disorder, which I hated even more than feeling depressed."
31732,"Had severe depression when i was 14 y old started meds didnt work so i decided to cope with it all by myself, it was hard, i had suicidal thoughts."
31733,"At 18 y old i thought i was just fine to stop taking the pills, one day while i was off the meds i saw my cat being run over by a car decapitated shaking in its own pool of blood."
31734,So i got back on the meds.
31735,SOOO after a few years on meds again and lots of work on myself i decided id become a nurse.
31736,"I was just wondering, when did you start to really notice improvement with your medicine?"
31737,"(i.e., ""I feel 80% better.."") That is, once you found the medicine/dosage that was right for you?"
31738,And is it normal to still have occasional anxiety episodes or bad days when you're on medication as long as you feel better the majority of the time?
31739,I'm terrified of taking new meds.
31740,I'm very sensitive to meds that make you sleepy (I take 1/4 the recommended dose for sleeping pills and they still knock me way out).
31741,"I find the last one quite suspicious as half the information leaflet of that one reads ""no tests conducted and no reliable literature""... probably want to discuss with the doc next week if it's really necessary since I get obsessed with losing track of my meds and the more there are the worse it gets, so I want to only have what's absolutely essential."
31742,I have a really strong opinion agaisnt meds but now i think its the only way... please give me your opinion.
31743,I saw him for about six months and I stopped taking my medicine.
31744,"Quick background: diagnosed w/ GAD, MDD and been on a few different meds over the past 4 or 5 years, Lexapro being the latest and most successful."
31745,"I can't tell if it's the meds leaving my system and causing problems, or if it's a return of my anxiety and depression to pre-medicated levels."
31746,"I had a list of psychosomatic symptoms a mile long before I started meds, and while they aren't returning in similar ways as before, I'm worried that I'm working myself into SSRI discontinuation syndrome-like symptoms."
31747,"TL;DR - stopped meds, shit sucks, help?"
31748,"I'm on meds and see a therapist, but I don't see her all that often because aside from the occasional panic attack, and now my sleep issues, things aren't too bad."
31749,"This has kind of been a bit awkward for me to discuss with anyone except random strangers anonymously over the internet, so I was hoping someone could let me know if they have had the same side effects while taking any meds, and if they went away over time?"
31750,"I know that some of the side effects of these meds, like nausea for example, go away after you've been taking them for a few weeks and your body adjusts to them so I was hoping that this would also apply for my problem."
31751,"I've seen a psych and she's diagnosed me with type two bipolar, and I'm taking minimal amounts of Seroquel (had a bad reaction and waiting on medication advice from her)."
31752,I want to apologize beforehand because this is going to be a pretty long post.
31753,A lot has happened to me in the past few months and I hope that getting it off my chest may help.
31754,"Three months ago, on the way to Easter dinner on Sunday, I was in a car accident where I was the driver."
31755,"The other driver ran a stop sign at a four-way stop intersection and clipped the front of my (technically, my fiancee's) car."
31756,"Initially, I was pretty shaken up, but it wasn't a very serious crash and everybody came out fine."
31757,The most damage I received was slight neck discomfort over the next week and some bruising to my abdomen.
31758,"When those finally got around the fading, I felt like it was finally over."
31759,Boy... was I ever wrong.
31760,Fast forward to a month after the car accident.
31761,"My fiancee and I had been carpooling to and from work since he was in the process of getting a new car (his previous car was considered ""totaled"")."
31762,"We were just around the corner from getting home and were discussing what we were doing for dinner (considering going to a new restaurant), when the first jolt of chest pain hit me."
31763,My heart started racing and I told him that something was wrong.
31764,"He started driving me to the emergency while I experienced the same sensation a few more times, feeling faint every time the sensation came."
31765,I also felt a strange pressure near my right temple (in between my right eye and ear) that felt very intense.
31766,"I got the hospital where they proceeded to do an EKG, blood work, and a chest X-ray."
31767,"I'm only twenty-four years old, so they found it very concerning that I was having chest pain."
31768,"However, after all the test results came back, they said everything was normal and sent me home."
31769,That night was absolutely terrifying for me--I had never experienced any kind of chest pain before in my life and everyone was telling that I was completely fine.
31770,"I felt like I was going to die while sleeping that night, but that obviously didn't happen."
31771,"The next week at work started a little slow for me, but I quickly felt myself come back to feeling normal."
31772,"It was almost the end of the week when I started feeling the pain coming back and decided to leave work a little early so I could try to get some rest and possibly ""sleep it off""."
31773,I didn't even make it home before I had the strong chest pain and palpitations again.
31774,I went to the emergency room which resulted in a similar experience.
31775,"EKG, blood test, chest X-ray: normal, normal, normal."
31776,I felt like I was losing my mind.
31777,The emergency room doctor told me that I was probably experiencing panic attacks and he prescribed me with Xanax and sent me home.
31778,"I looked up everything there was about panic attacks, and since they come in so many shapes and sizes, I figured that I MIGHT be having them."
31779,I still wasn't convinced.
31780,I ended up visiting a walk-in clinic (long story short: I still haven't met my primary care physician and will be doing so for the first time next week) after feeling chest tightness and pressure and they referred me to cardiologist.
31781,Said cardiologist promptly scheduled me for a stress test (the kind done on a treadmill) and an echo-cardiogram.
31782,It was around this time that I started experiencing the pressure around my right temple all of the time.
31783,The results came back for those two tests saying everything was normal and that I shouldn't worry about it being a heart issue.
31784,"At this point, my every day was being effected."
31785,My anxiety levels were through the roof and I kept having to step out of the office to just take a few moments to calm down.
31786,"I've always been an anxious person, but never to this degree."
31787,I couldn't keep still for more than an hour without needing to at least excuse myself to the bathroom and curl up.
31788,I started seeing a therapist to try to help with my anxiety.
31789,She said that it sounded like I had PTSD due to childhood trauma I had experienced that was triggered by the car accident.
31790,"After reassuring me that we could eventually fix it and that I should come back once a week, I left feeling a little more confident that I could get better."
31791,That's when I started experiencing the numbing sensations at night.
31792,"I would wake up once or twice a night with the sensation of my arms going numb, even though I was lying on my back at the time."
31793,"Also, sometimes I would feel like my lips were going numb."
31794,The headaches/pressure were pretty much a constant at this point as well.
31795,"I went to another walk-in clinic, where I was prescribed Zoloft to help with my anxiety as well as a stat referral to a neurologist."
31796,The neurologist did a brief physical exam and reassured me that nothing I had been describing sounded extremely alarming and that I might be suffering from PTSD.
31797,"Even though I'd had a pretty hectic day (Friday), I felt like my anxiety had been at an all-time low that day and I actually felt pretty good."
31798,Besides the fact that I lost my appetite about a week ago and hadn't really been able to eat anything.
31799,I started taking the Zoloft that night after my visit with the neurologist.
31800,"Around this time, I started feeling leg pain in my right thigh."
31801,I noticed (or I might be imagining) a slight lump where the pain is originating from.
31802,The beginning of the next day (Saturday) felt mostly all right.
31803,I didn't feel super anxious at first and felt that maybe the medicine was working (I've never been on AD medications and thought they might take effect quickly).
31804,"However, towards the end of the day, I started feeling my anxiety starting to get work."
31805,"That night, I had the most terrible heartburn I have ever experienced."
31806,I wasn't able to sleep all night due to it and then my anxiety was through the roof on Sunday.
31807,I took some Xanax to try to sleep that night but still had little success.
31808,"I decided that I was going to come back off of the Zoloft and try just doing therapy for the time being, so I stopped taking it Monday."
31809,"Yesterday (Tuesday) during work my teeth, tongue, and brain felt like they were constantly vibrating and I sometimes had blurry vision.. like I just couldn't focus my vision (I'm assuming these are just withdrawal symptoms from the Zoloft)."
31810,But I started feeling pretty good and cheerful towards the end of the day and so I felt optimistic that I could handle this anxiety.
31811,I also started eating bananas and taking a multivitamin gummy to help make up for the fact that I haven't been eating.
31812,"Last night I woke up a couple of times from intense heat/prickling that spanned across my chest, shoulders, and upper back."
31813,"I was luckily able to fall back to sleep after the occurrences, but today I'm feeling very out of it."
31814,I've also been having chest pain coming and going as well as leg pain.
31815,I just feel like everything is falling apart and I don't know whether I need to keep going for more tests or whether this is concretely anxiety.
31816,I wish I had something for sure so I could just feel better and not have to worry every time I get a pain in my arm or feel my fingers going numb.
31817,"Sorry for this huge rant, but I just needed to vent everything that's been going on for these past couple of months."
31818,I'm going to try to go out to lunch and now and maybe eat something...
31819,I've been trying to force myself to eat (which sometimes does not work at all).
31820,Thanks to anyone who makes it through this post.
31821,=( I just feel so scared that I might be silently dying and that no one can find what's wrong with me.
31822,"If you have any advice or thoughts, I would greatly appreciate them."
31823,&lt;3
31824,"anyway for the past week or so, i've been getting anxiety attacks like i used to get before taking the meds."
31825,i don't know if this is my anxiety that has always been there underneath the meds or if it's a symptom of trying to quit these meds.
31826,"I also have issues with allergies easily, dust, hayfever, sometimes cats (not always), etc and while I did take anti-hestamine for when I'd have an issue for it, I don't take any medicine regularly at all."
31827,"Given that this is the thought pattern I want to interrupt, can anyone recommend medication they've used to deal with plane travel?"
31828,I've heard some meds are better for short flights and others for long-haul travel.
31829,"Unfortunately she is dealing with a lot of issues, serious depression (she is on meds), a type of OCD, some anxiety issues, she self harms and has suicidal idealization and has tried to kill herself before."
31830,-- I don't have the money for medication at this time) but it's gotten worse in one specific area.
31831,"Now, they've stuffed my nose with nasal packing and given me medication."
31832,I am terrified of being put on meds.
31833,"He first suggested to go see a therapist, but that would cost a hell of a lot of money (which I cannot afford right now), or medication."
31834,I chose the medication and was prescribed a small dose (10mg) of Citalopram.
31835,My medication for anxiety gives me more anxiety.
31836,Im on a few meds.
31837,I want to come off the meds.
31838,"Anyway I stop taking my medication in January this year, and I have been trying to improve doing other things, for example Yoga, meditation, relating to other people, I believe that I am far more stable right now, that my thoughts are more rational most of the time, that I no longer think things as black and white."
31839,"I take meds (celexa, klonopin, and ambien prn)."
31840,"I finally got the strength to send her a long and heartfelt message, thanks to my great therapist and decent medication to give me some clarity."
31841,"After some time in therapy, my therapist suggested I take medication to help with both of these symptoms."
31842,"So I'm nearly 5 months into having my medication now (Trazodone and occasional Diazepam), over that time I've been increased from Trazodone 50mg to 100mg and a few days back reluctantly 150mg."
31843,Anyone else hating taking medication?
31844,"She's not in therapy or on any medication, though she has been in therapy in the past."
31845,"However I have been working out everyday, seeing my therapist, and adjusted my medication."
31846,I've been dealing with GAD and panic disorder.
31847,"I currently take Xanax as needed, which roughly comes out to between .5 - 1 mg a day."
31848,My doctor is really pushing for an SSRI and to get off the xanax and SSRIs scare me.
31849,I hear horror stories and side effects.
31850,Plus it lists nausea as a common symptom and nausea is one of my biggest panic and anxiety triggers.
31851,I don't know what to do.
31852,I think it might help me but I am very scared to take it.
31853,What could I expect to happen if I do go this route?
31854,"NOTE: I have been doing therapy (had to stop due to insurance - trying my best to continue CBT on my own and with books), have taken celexa in the past (but it stopped working for me), and have currently found out I am hypothyroid and working on getting the right dosage of medicines for that."
31855,How long should I stay on it before changing to another medication if the tiredness does not go away?
31856,Tomorrow I go talk to the doctor on staff for a physical evaluation (they like to do a full body treatment) and discuss possible medication to help me through this first phase.
31857,"I sent this message to another user, but I feel like it might be helpful to a lot of people on here."
31858,"This explanation is based on scientific research and my personal opinion, but there are a lot of people who disagree with me or even get angry at me when I talk about it."
31859,"I am very happy to answer questions or offer support in the comments, but if you don't like my viewpoint, please feel free to dismiss it and move on."
31860,Okay?
31861,Okay.
31862,":)

The good news is that anxiety problems?"
31863,Totally treatable.
31864,I have lived it.
31865,"I struggled with depression and anxiety for over a decade, tried all kinds of medications, and I would get better for a while...until I wasn't."
31866,What I finally found out was that a LOT of psychiatrists and therapists don't know what they're doing.
31867,"The advice I'm about to give you may go against what you've heard or always done, but it is supported by the medical literature and scientific research."
31868,"Anxiety - specifically, let's talk about panic disorder and social anxiety, because I had those - is a functional psychological disorder."
31869,"It is NOT a disease, and it is not just a ""chemical imbalance in your brain""."
31870,"I know we've heard a lot of people saying that, but those ideas actually increase stigma against anxiety disorders, and prevent people from getting the help they need."
31871,Let's think of it like this.
31872,"Imagine you slouch very badly, all day, every day."
31873,You don't even realize you're doing it.
31874,"Because of this, you've developed back pain."
31875,You go to several doctors and they give you painkillers.
31876,"Maybe the pain gets better, although you still feel it from time to time."
31877,"And of course, using the painkillers means you are not getting any natural feedback from your body, so you don't learn naturally that slouching more causes more pain, etc."
31878,"You've learned, over time, that leaning on something can relieve the pain."
31879,"So now whenever you walk around, not only are you slouching, but you're hanging onto walls, banisters, your friends, etc."
31880,Desperately trying to relieve the pain.
31881,"But the more you use these objects, the weaker your back muscles get, and it progresses to the point where you can't even walk at all unless you're leaning on something."
31882,"Now it's not only painful, it's physically impossible."
31883,"What is wrong with you in this scenario is not that you have a fundamental problem with your anatomy, nor that your nerves are messed up."
31884,It's a functional disorder.
31885,"And it's not your fault, because you didn't even know you were slouching, and your doctors failed you by trying to just medicate the problem without fixing it in the first place."
31886,Anxiety is very similar.
31887,"Social anxiety, for example - most people are a little nervous about meeting new people, but they do it anyway and it's not a big deal."
31888,"If for whatever reason you start avoiding people, that's where it turns into an anxiety disorder."
31889,"""I am nervous about going out with this group of people."
31890,"I think I'll just stay home instead."""
31891,"It sounds like a reasonable thought process, right?"
31892,"What we don't realize is that this is a form of ""slouching""."
31893,"Without you realizing it, your mind has made this connection: ""I was scared, so I didn't go out, and nothing bad happened to me."
31894,"Therefore, not going out saved me."
31895,"Going out is dangerous."""
31896,"Eventually we start noticing increased anxiety at even the thought of going out - heart racing, even panic attacks."
31897,"We know something's wrong, so we go to the doctor about it."
31898,The doctor provides us anti-anxiety medicine (specifically talking about short-acting drugs like Valium or Klonapin).
31899,"Now whenever we feel nervous, we take the drug."
31900,It brings down our anxiety.
31901,"Now our brain has learned a new tool - ""When I feel anxious, I take this medicine, and I'm okay."
31902,"If I didn't take this medicine, though, something bad might have happened!"""
31903,"This is similar to an object you leaned on in the back pain scenario - it made your pain go away temporarily, but it also makes you weaker and less able to deal with the problem."
31904,"Anything can be a ""crutch"" like this - deep breathing, talking to a friend, etc."
31905,Anything you do to avoid your anxiety actually functions to make your anxiety worse.
31906,"As far as anti-depressants, these are more similar to the painkillers in the back pain scenario."
31907,I don't think anti-depressants are always bad.
31908,"However, they are not going to help you - and could actually make things worse - if you are not also trying to fix the behaviors that caused your anxiety in the first place."
31909,"If you take anti-depressants and feel better (less anxiety or depression), but you continue avoiding people or situations that you're frightened of, your anxiety and depression will continue to get worse because you are still ""slouching"", even if you're not in any ""pain"" anymore."
31910,"In a similar way to taking painkillers, however, antidepressants can prevent you from naturally learning how to overcome your anxiety."
31911,"When you feel anxious about something, you realize that this is an area of your life you need to improve."
31912,"So if you feel anxious about going out and meeting people, you know that means that you need to practice getting out of your house, you need to practice meeting people."
31913,"If you're taking anti-depressants and you still feel this anxiety, then you can still work on the issue, so it's okay."
31914,The problem only develops if you feel fine all the time and don't try to face your fears because of that.
31915,[Here](http://cognitivedefusion.tumblr.com/post/90597778372/while-the-focus-for-this-is-placed-more-on-panic) is an excellent series of slides that may help you with panic attacks.
31916,"If the things I've said resonate with you, I would be happy to help you guys come up with a practical plan of attack for your anxiety issues!"
31917,I know I probably need to get diagnosed and get medication or something but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to go to a doctor or a psychologist and even thinking about going makes my heart race and tears start to well up.
31918,"Recently, for the past two months, I've been feeling this weird lightheadedness."
31919,"I get these waves of lightheadedness, like I'll feel tense and then my head ""loosens"" and I feel light."
31920,I'm very easily fatigued.
31921,"I feel like when I walk, my legs almost want me to go in a different direction."
31922,"Been having some tingling and muscle spasms as well, along with tinnitus."
31923,"Sounds are way too loud for me, lights are a bit bright as well but not as bad as the sound sensitivity."
31924,"I've been having panic attacks too, not very much lately."
31925,"I'm honestly not sure whether the anxiety is causing these symptoms, because I've had anxiety for all my life but these physical symptoms are what made me start to get panic attacks for the first time ever."
31926,"Sorry if this is a bit rambly, I just don't know what to do."
31927,"I can hardly leave the house, I still see friends but I can only stay inside because walking makes this worse."
31928,Do anxiety medications help with this feeling?
31929,I was prescribed some but don't really want to take it if it will make the lightheadedness worse
31930,"I've never taken medication to regulate my anxiety, and when I was originally diagnosed, my anxiety hadn't seemed like it was severe enough for medication."
31931,It was also a bit of a wake-up call that I might need to talk to my doctor about finding an anti-anxiety medication that works for me.
31932,Is this a side effect that will lessen - everything I've read seems to suggest it will stay around as long as I'm on the medication.
31933,"Coupled with that my mom is pressuring me to get medication if they suggest it, and i'm not sure what i should do about that specifically."
31934,I hope that some can offer insight.
31935,I've been trying to find good places to unload that will still protect my sister.
31936,I can't talk to many people in my life because I don't want it to affect my sister and her relationships with others.
31937,"While she's stressing me out, I still love her and don't want to hurt her."
31938,"The issue: over the last few (about 6) years, my sister (24 years old) has developed a serious mental disorder."
31939,Possibly bipolar disorder but to my knowledge she has not been diagnosed.
31940,She mentioned to me that a psychiatrist talked to her about it but she didn't want to be labeled with anything and I hadn't heard anything more about it.
31941,Since she's an adult my mother and I don't know anything from what she tells us.
31942,She was hospitalized for several weeks due to severe depression (unable to function) and suicidal thoughts a few years ago.
31943,Since then her life has improved a lot.
31944,She got some training done and is going to school again and working.
31945,She's visited me several times and I thought she was doing much better.
31946,She visited a few weeks ago and was definitely manic.
31947,My parents (who she lives with) and I had no idea she was manic until she got here.
31948,"She didn't sleep for four days straight, then had a series of panic attacks which caused me to have to take her to the ER to get meds to make her sleep, then the rest of the week was spent taking care of her."
31949,"I am usually very patient and understanding, but I'm really struggling."
31950,I feel like a b-word but I'm losing tolerance towards her.
31951,I know that she can't control the fact that she has a mental illness but she's also not taking things seriously and doing things to keep her stable.
31952,She doesn't remember to take her medications every day.
31953,She makes really inappropriate comments to me.
31954,I have two young children and I had to watch her like a hawk while she interacted with them while she was here.
31955,She kept trying to do inappropriate things or say strange things around them.
31956,She was obsessed with sleeping in their room (or in the 4 year old's bed with her).
31957,We said no.
31958,She snuck in there one night.
31959,Another night she dragged her bed in there and my husband dragged it out once we realized it.
31960,She was incredibly demanding and needy.
31961,She needed to go places every day.
31962,Places that were 40 minutes one way.
31963,I was doing my best to keep her from having a panic attack so I obliged with carting the kids and all of us to the places she wanted.
31964,But it was a lot to put on the kids (and me).
31965,We went to a parade and it was about to start.
31966,She realized she forgot her camera battery at home and wanted to go back to get it and come back.
31967,40 minutes one way.
31968,I told her that if we did that we'd miss the parade…it'd take almost an hour and a half to go home and come back and it's starting any second now.
31969,She started crying.
31970,I gave her my camera and she took pictures of the parade that way.
31971,This is just one example of the lack of understanding/not in reality that she was in.
31972,"Nothing was thought through, but everything had to happen now."
31973,I also feel like I have no relationship with her.
31974,Everything revolved around her.
31975,"Talking to her was frustrating because I would tell her things or point out when what she was thinking/saying wasn't making sense, and it was as if I wasn't talking at all."
31976,So I ended up feeling like a wall that she bounced off of for the whole week.
31977,"After she left, I started having serious problems with anxiety."
31978,"Trouble sleeping, eating, and I started clenching and grinding my teeth throughout the day and at night."
31979,I ended up going to see a counselor which helped some.
31980,I've been trying to do things that I enjoy more and letting the little things go.
31981,But my sister was the biggest issue and it's hard to ignore the problems and issues that WILL come up again in the future.
31982,I'm feeling better.
31983,I don't feel like I'm on edge as much as before.
31984,It just took me a long time to unwind myself after that visit.
31985,I'm worried.
31986,About our future relationship.
31987,How can I have my children around her if she may become manic at any time?
31988,It wasn't safe and I didn't want them to have to be an emotional crutch for her (she was very overly attached to them).
31989,I wanted to kick her out but she was visiting from halfway across the country and she's so needy that I don't think she'd be able to get home (not to mention the cost of changing plane tickets).
31990,Her flight home got pushed back due to snow and she wanted me to call the airline to set up her rescheduled flight for her!
31991,I told her no and that she had to do it.
31992,She did but insisted on me hugging her after because it was so stressful.
31993,I didn't want to hug her.
31994,She didn't notice and did it anyway.
31995,I'm just…I don't know.
31996,I feel like I was being drained of all my energy around her.
31997,I love her.
31998,I wish I could help her more.
31999,But at some point she has to help herself and I feel like she's not focusing on her mental health issues and taking it seriously.
32000,"For those that stayed with me through this, thank you."
32001,"If you have any insight, I appreciate it."
32002,I've never had stress affect me this strongly.
32003,"If you have insight into my sister's issues and any way I can have a healthy relationship with her, I'd appreciate it as well."
32004,"-----------------
tl;dr Younger sister has mental health issues (possibly bipolar) and visited me for a week in a manic state."
32005,Spent that time managing her and keeping it from affecting my two young children.
32006,"After she left I had severe anxiety (grinding teeth, on edge, tense, no panic attack but felt like I was always on the edge of a cliff) for several weeks that I am just starting to get over."
32007,Advice or insight is welcome.
32008,Thanks for reading!
32009,Ive been trying to get some xanax or any sort of medication to calm me down but they refuse to even get me  simple motrin if i have a migraine so that sort of gives you an idea of how they are.
32010,"It stresses me out even more..


My point though is, can anyone explain to me what is going on or how i can help myself without medicine/doctors incase my parents just dont help me?"
32011,Both my parents want me to get back on it( who are also on anti-anxiety medicine) and they think I don't want to take it because of the stigma.
32012,"I am doing well now on meds and taking positive steps in my life, but four months ago I was having a complete breakdown due to my anxiety and could barely eat or sleep."
32013,"I'm scared that if my anxiety keeps coming back, if my meds don't work anymore and that type of episode occurs again, that maybe someday I would become suicidal."
32014,"I'm not new to mental health issues, as I've lived with depression a number of years, as well as anxiety, OCD, depression, and addiction running in my family."
32015,"I've always known I'd had some anxiety, but nothing too major or worth getting treated for."
32016,"More recently, however, I've been having nausea/vomiting and near-anxiety attacks."
32017,"This has been a result of school stress (in a rigorous nursing program), family stress, and personal stress."
32018,"It's not continuous anxiety, but as I'm nearing finals and have to deal with a lot of deadlines what anxiety I have is getting debilitating."
32019,"I get so anxious I cannot bring myself to work on an important assignment, or I get nauseous, or I generally collapse in a feeling of ""dis-health""."
32020,"I have a history of self-injury and when I get really worked up I feel compelled to hurt myself, as I know it's a full-proof way of quickly relieving my anxiety for the time being."
32021,"I plan to begin psychotherapy, so please don't think I'm just wanting an ""easy fix"", I am well aware pharmaceuticals only go so far in treating mental health."
32022,My question is as follows: what can I do in the immediate future (think 24 hours) that can help this?
32023,"I'm thinking I could go into the student health center tomorrow morning and talk with a doctor - maybe get some prescription to deal with episodic anxiety (I already have a list of meds I'm on, and I don't want to add to the daily pills)?"
32024,Does anyone have experience with anti-anxiety medications?
32025,I can never go a week with out having a panic attack and I already take medication for my anxiety/depression.
32026,I'm about to give up on this medication because I have NO idea what's going on with my body.
32027,"I have found myself to be very influenced by my anxiety, and I like music that reflects it, and art styles, and clothing styles and that can be related to it some way or another."
32028,"I am afraid that I will lose this, and lose my uniqueness if I begin taking anxiety medication."
32029,I am also afraid that I will be too tired all the time.
32030,I would also like to ask if anyone has had problems after taking anxiety medications where you don't worry ENOUGH about things you should worry about?
32031,"So I take daily prescription medication for anxiety, depression, and migraine control."
32032,I've been in a relationship for 4 years and he still is working on understanding my anxiety disorder and how to help work through my panic attacks.
32033,"But he is against using any medications, of any sort."
32034,I believe that my anxiety Meds are keeping me sane.
32035,I take a 30mg dosage of porzac per day and use to be on burspar when I was under 18.
32036,I've been on my anxiety meds for 6 years and I completely forgot who that person was without the meds.
32037,I'm working with my therapist to be better with my anxiety but it wont be enough.
32038,I wonder if going off my meds for a month (with my therapist's permission) to show him the real uncontrolled me would convince him that I need the medication... ideas?
32039,"I'm scared of driving, using the computer, drinking coffee, laying down, talking to family, socialising in environments over 1-1, taking medication for a recent head trauma, playing video games, just basically anything that could increase heart rate or cause slight emotional tension."
32040,It made it understandable but never gave us a way to cope or to minimize these thoughts with out medicine.
32041,I am not currently on any medication.
32042,"I'm just feeling torn because I really don't want to medicate myself if I don't need to... And for the most part I'm pretty content with myself and my life, but I'm wondering if this medication will improve my quality of life, especially with winter (SAD season) coming."
32043,It's getting really uncomfortable to live now i mean forget medication and therapy i don't even have someone to talk to someone to pour my heart out too.
32044,"After going off and on meds, struggling with daily nausea, ruminating thoughts, and panic attacks I went to the doctor who found a B12 deficiency."
32045,All the doctors just wanted me to go back to anti-anxiety meds which I had a bad experience with.
32046,"I'm not saying that I won't ever go back on meds, or that everyone with anxiety has leaky gut, but I have noticed a huge difference in my anxiety since altering my diet."
32047,I never thought it would come to this but I may consider taking medication.
32048,so after a really really terrible breakup (fiancé cheated on me) I reacted in way different then most and I for a few months was happy having fun and drinking a lot (denial I guess and freedom.. My fiancé was also manipulative and controlling) and without my doctors recommendation stopped taking my meds pretty quick.
32049,For a while it was fine and I realized I also lost a lot of weight and feel that was a result of going off my meds  and I felt pretty good but for the last 2 months I've been more depressed than ever...
32050,"I am not functioning well, my social anxiety and depression are both skyrocketing  I'm having more panic attacks then ever and I'm even afraid to go back to my doctor..
One of my concerns about possibly going back on the meds I need is the weight gain."
32051,So gaining weight again by going back on meds to get the help I need would be pretty much as bad as feeling this way..
32052,"I posted this last friday on r/bipolar, but sadly didn't get much advice, except for getting help from a proffessional."
32053,Maybe over here there are few of you who go through similar issues.
32054,My saturday shift was a true nightmare with constant anxiety for over 3 hours of work.
32055,"Here's the text:

Hello everyone."
32056,"I decided to try and get some suggestions and advice here, rather than in r/schizoaffective, as I'm sure that my issues are covering matters very similar for both, bi-polar and schizoaffective, while r/schizoaffective is not as active."
32057,"I have been ill since 2009, and from 2010 I've been constantly taking medications - anti psychotic Olanzapine is the only one of them that hasn't changed in the course of time."
32058,"I'd also like to underline that I'm not an English language native speaker, so if there are any mistakes, I apologize in advance."
32059,"Last week I was diagonized schizoaffective, but for all these years I lived with a conviction of being a bipolar sufferer."
32060,"My major problems are, however, not mood related - I suffer very bad paranoias around people, especially at my work place."
32061,"I just came back after 2 weeks of holiday back to the UK, the journey went well and I was feeling rather positive - past two weeks were simply fantastic, I felt as if I embarked upon slight remission with rare, random paranoid thoughts that were being easily overcome with rational thinking."
32062,"My main issue revolves around a direct contact with people, something I am faced with all the time at work."
32063,"One smile, one comment I overhear are able to skyrocket me towards paranoia - 'people laughing at me/ mocking me'."
32064,I went on the second train today and everything was alright until a couple (daughter and father) decided to sit opposite myself.
32065,"First I just felt tense and anxious, but the longer they were talking - me never looking at them, trying to avoid the eye contact, almost physically escaping to the left and to the right with my head, the more paranoid I started to feel; I had a feeling (while having my headphones and ipod on all the time) they were talking about me, that they were making mocking remarks, and I felt little and vulnerable."
32066,I went out of the train and whole delusional thinking I didn't experience for weeks came back.
32067,"I'm glad it doesn't reach my private zones - I am okay with friends and flatmates, but everytime I go out, I just feel tense."
32068,"I'm a little scared while thinking of going back to work tomorrow: it's saturday, it is going to be very busy."
32069,"At some points paranoia is so strong, that my overly self-conscious self starts reading the subtext, just to find some irrational 'proves' to an almost paralyzing effect."
32070,"I am in possession of 11 diazepams, it's all I have."
32071,"My regular meds seem to fail, even though I have just been put on SNRI this week, and while on holiday I felt the difference."
32072,"It unnerves me immensely how easily I snap, how irrational is this fear."
32073,"If there are any of you out there, who have a bad time when someone is laughing in the other room, while you think they are laughing about you, or someone who has got a very hard time maintaining eye contact, someone terrified of being negatively judged - help."
32074,"I will be working tomorrow, I need some advice folks."
32075,This F***s up my life.
32076,Tl;dr: people watching me make me ill. Work tomorrow.
32077,How do you cope with similar issues folks?
32078,Have you got any coping strategies except medications?
32079,Could this be mania or just the medicine still working itself out?
32080,I've seen people wiped clean of all emotions when they start taking meds for this and if that happened to me I'd basically be nothing.
32081,Does anyone know any methods of coping that don't involve meds?
32082,"(And if not, do you know of any meds that people don't usually have the ""emotionless"" problem with?)"
32083,"I have no family history of brain tumors, my vitals are all normal, and the headaches are inconsistent and usually respond to medicine."
32084,I have been on medication and been in lots of therapy over the past 6 years and don't believe there is a silver bullet to getting rid of anxiety.
32085,One of the hardest things is actually having to pick up the medication I take for anxiety (klonipin) from the pharmacy.
32086,"Background:

* F/28
* Off psych meds since June 2010, previously on 150mg Effexor 2005ish-2010."
32087,"When he started the meds he had strong disassociation, he was hearing voices, he went from 1-2 panic attacks a day to a constant stream of panic."
32088,The doctor said that he over-metabolizes medicine and that the dose was way too strong.
32089,Before we started the meds he could at least get out the door.
32090,I'm worried the meds are just making things worse.
32091,"I don't want him to stop taking meds that he NEEDS, but I seriously question whether they are at fault for this break."
32092,I have started seeing a counsellor again after a year of being off medication and seeing my counsellor.
32093,"I don't take any medication (other than weed, which doesn't count I guess) and don't go to a doctor - I have health insurance, but the deductible is so ungodly high because I'm self-employed and thus I can't actually afford it."
32094,"And I'd been off my meds - back on them now - since I'd ran out, so wasn't feeling great."
32095,"Afterwards, she caught up with me and asked how long I'd been off my meds, telling me it was seriously bad to do that (she's a pharmacy student) and made me promise that I'd get them asap (I already had a few hours ago, but they hadn't taken effect yet) and asked if I had anyone to talk to about this."
32096,I am not on any medication for my anxiety/depression.
32097,"I finally broke down the other day and went to a psychiatrist with the intention of going on medication, because I am driving myself and my fiance crazy."
32098,"She told me that I could seek therapy, diet, and exercise ""until the cows come home"" but because I'm biologically broken, I will never be happy without medication."
32099,"People don't understand--I don't hate myself, and there are parts about myself that I love that I know would go away on meds."
32100,"I went to the Doctors today, and this is my first time taking prescribed medicine for anxiety."
32101,I was hoping if anyone could share some of their experiences when they took this medication.
32102,I am kinda worried on the side effects of it and was hoping for some stories to read !
32103,"Edit: if you guys need more info I could always post up more &gt;_&gt;, but as of now I am anxious to take the medications.."
32104,Anyone else have any experience with this medication?
32105,"I've spent time talking with my therapist about keeping a small supply of depression medication with me, as I've traveled to unfamiliar places before and I tend to suffer from sensory overload, but I haven't been on drugs since high school and I'm not sure what would help."
32106,I am freaking out right now because I forgot my anti-anxiety meds at my dorm and I will be away for three-four days.
32107,I try not to take my anxiety meds too often because they make me so tired/unproductive at work.
32108,"I have suffered from anxiety ever since my sophomore year of college, which is now about six years."
32109,Which is a really long time now that I think about it.
32110,I smoked pot for the first time (and last) and ended up on campus in full panic attack mode.
32111,"I saw someone I knew by chance and had him drive me to the ER, where I was berated by nurses for the entire length of my panic attack (around 4 hours)."
32112,"Since then it's been a wild ride of medications, therapy, and friend support."
32113,I'm current off medication and not going to therapy ever since I moved to Canada from the US.
32114,I get health insurance next year but I'm not sure if they cover therapy.
32115,But the point of this post is that my GAD has slowly evolved into hypochondria.
32116,I fear having a heart attack when I wake up in the morning (I'm 26).
32117,"I fear aneurysms, brain amoeba, HIV."
32118,My aunt had Hodgkins lymphoma when she was in her mid twenties so I also fear that.
32119,It's become a situation where I'm afraid all the time again.
32120,I'm not in fill panic mode like the year or so after my firsr panic attack.
32121,That was truly awful.
32122,But now it's more insidious.
32123,"It can't ever be happy because I think, oh crap, was that heartbeat a sign of a heart attack?"
32124,Is that pressure a heart attack?
32125,Is this headache brain cancer?
32126,And so on.
32127,Any tips or encouragement or advice would be extremely welcome.
32128,Thank God this subreddit exists.
32129,You're all amazing people and it comforts me to know I'm not alone.
32130,"I cant afford therapy, I'm already on meds so that isnt the issue."
32131,I just want to push through but its so hard without medication.
32132,"Hi I'm not sure this belongs here, but I'm not sure where else to ask...please this is an emergency I think I've messed up...bad

So I've just been put on the meds again (Zoloft/Sertraline) and my dosage is 125mg, but I'm not sure if I was supposed to gradually increase first???"
32133,I was still riding high on the medication they gave me.
32134,"And I am on meds, but they make me feel like a zombie a lot of the time."
32135,"I made a lot of medicine switches lately, and I started celexa about two weeks ago."
32136,I'm not taking any meds as I have not had any medical attention.
32137,"Because of the effects on my appetite and motivation, I had to stop taking this kind of medicine."
32138,I realize that everyone responds to medication differently and that there is no one solution.
32139,I've dealt with my anxiety on my own for most of my life and recently i've seen a psychologist who has given me breathing and relaxation techniques to help me manage on my own.
32140,However i'm finding that they're more short term solutions that are only effective when I can't sleep or when I get too worked up to function.
32141,"They allow me to collect myself, but only for a moment."
32142,She recommended that I could talk to my doctor about medication options (specifically anti-depressants) that could help me better manage the overall feelings I constantly have.
32143,"Specifically, I constantly feel like i'm waiting at the starting line of a race anticipating the whistle to blow, but it never does."
32144,So i'm always feeling revved up and ready to go.
32145,"Coupled with that i'm constantly worrying and turning over the ""what if's"" for every scenario in my life in my head which really affects my ability to concentrate and get things done, which then makes me feel irritable and overwhelmed."
32146,"I know meds won't make it ""go away"", but i'm considering medication to help me manage this better because I just don't want to have these feelings this intensely anymore."
32147,"This would be my first time talking with my doctor about the options and potentially taking anything for my anxiety, so I was just wondering what people's experiences on medications, both good and bad, have been?"
32148,**Using a new account as people IRL know my main account and I'm quite ashamed of all of this.
32149,"**


**Little back story."
32150,"** 
I gave birth last year."
32151,March to be exact.
32152,I had the perfect pregnancy except when my blood pressure would be high at the office.
32153,130s/80s.
32154,So the doctors started having my record my blood pressure 3 times a day to keep track at home.
32155,This I think is where it all started.
32156,After I gave birth everything was fine for the first 3 days.
32157,Then I was discharged from the hospital.
32158,My heart rate dropped into the mid to high 50s and I normally run 70s-90s.
32159,My blood pressure also shot up.
32160,The highest it went was 180/110 and then I was placed on an ACE inhibitor for post-partum hypertension.
32161,I was in and out of the emergency room multiple times thinking there was something wrong with my heart.
32162,"I had every imaginable test done, echo, ekgs, even a 24 hour holter and all came back 100% normal."
32163,My heart is excellent.
32164,Anyway.
32165,I was taken off the blood pressure medicines in May of 2013.
32166,And told I didn't have to monitor my pressures anymore.
32167,Here lies the problem.
32168,I kept tracking it and still do.
32169,Numerous times a day.
32170,I worry about if the number is too high or too low.
32171,Recently it's been me freaking out that it is too low.
32172,I'm terrified of getting sepsis.
32173,"I have bad teeth, well what's left of them anyway."
32174,"I have ""broken down root tips"" and am getting them removed next month but I read somewhere that having bad teeth can cause a blood infection and a sign of that is low pressures."
32175,"I've made *""safe""* numbers* **110/70-123/83** is what i consider ""*normal*""."
32176,Anything below that and I start to freak out and check it over and over and over only to keep getting low numbers.
32177,It interferes with my daily life.
32178,"I get angry when I don't get the ""*right*"" numbers."
32179,I want to stop but I don't have the first idea on how to do so.
32180,I want to be me again.
32181,Not this woman who relies on a machine to tell her if she can feel good or not.
32182,**Expanding on that last sentence**.
32183,I feel normal/good until I check my pressures.
32184,"If i get a ""good"" number then I continue on about my day in a good mood."
32185,"If i get a ""bad"" number it ruins my whole day and i start feeling symptoms."
32186,"Dizziness, feeling blah, anxious, etc."
32187,I'm a stay at home mom and this takes away time from my son.
32188,And I hate myself for it.
32189,He doesn't deserve to have me like this.
32190,He deserves better.
32191,**More details I guess.
32192,** I take aspirin every day.
32193,Not on doctors orders but because I feel that it will help raise my pressures and keep me from having any heart issues (that I have been told I don't have and have no signs of getting).
32194,I quit eating carbs because I read that they lower your pressures.
32195,"I have limited my diet so much so I will get ""good"" numbers."
32196,I lost 70lbs from the day I gave birth.
32197,30 from my normal pre-pregnancy weight.
32198,I miss food.
32199,I miss being me.
32200,I need help but my insurance doesn't kick in until next month.
32201,I saw a therapist last year and was in the hospital twice for PPD and anxiety issues.
32202,***I'm sorry this is so long and if you have gotten this far thank you so so much.
32203,Any advice or tips or anything at this point is welcome.
32204,If you want more details or want me to expand on something further I will.
32205,"Thank you /r/anxiety*** 

**Edit:** I forgot to include general info."
32206,"I'm a 24 year old female, I have been diagnosed with  ADHD, Social Anxiety, Panic Disorder, Health Anxiety, PTSD, and GAD."
32207,I take .25mg of clonazepam 3x a day.
32208,"I am located in the USA, and I don't have insurance at the moment but I will be on insurance starting August 1."
32209,Attended therapy from April 2013-January 2014.
32210,"Hospitalized March 25-30, 2013 and again May 11-24, 2013."
32211,Attended Intensive Outpatient Therapy from May 2014-July 2014.
32212,I have been in therapy for over a year and am on medication.
32213,"Every night it's the same thing: I take my meds and wait to pass out, mid paragraph of whatever I'm reading."
32214,"Then I'm up all hours, so I sleep all day, I end up with a wasted day, an anxiety trigger, and a cycle begins, at least until the meds ""work"" swiftly enough some subsequent night."
32215,I'm not taking medication and every medical professional and therapist I've seen have told me this is simply acute anxiety/stress responses that I need to deal with.
32216,Does medication sound right for me?
32217,"Hi,
I'm not sure this is even the right place to say this but everyone dismisses  
me since I have GAD."
32218,"So here goes:

I don't think I can handle being a human."
32219,"I do not want kids, a house, or  
money."
32220,I just want to be left alone.
32221,"I mean really alone, not the I want to be  
alone that most people say when they just want a day or two to themselves."
32222,"I'm  
sure this is partially due to depression but a part of it has always been  
there."
32223,"I feel like I was ""built"" different."
32224,I've spent most of my life trying to do the right thing.
32225,"I got good grades in  
school, stayed out of trouble and then went to college, like I was told (by  
everyone not just my family)."
32226,I eventually just ran out of steam.
32227,"I feel as if  
we are all just working towards nothing."
32228,"Almost everyone I know spends most of  
their lives living paycheck to paycheck."
32229,"Wasting away at some dead-end (or  
""career"") job for the majority of their time on this planet."
32230,"People my age  
(and hell, even my parents) won't have the luxury of being able to retire."
32231,"We  
will all just work until we're placed in the ground."
32232,"I've tried to work when I  
can but can only stomach it in small portions."
32233,"The set schedules (you better  
be dead if you miss a day), the increasing responsibility/expectations (for no  
increased pay of course), and the expectations to be grateful for such misery  
all make me question why I'm even working in the first place."
32234,"As such, I've  
never been able to hold down a job."
32235,This is even assuming I can find a job.
32236,"Places constantly say they are hiring  
yet don't want to talk to applicants."
32237,"""Go apply online"" they say."
32238,"The whole  
""job gap"" and college drop-out thing aren't doing me any favors either."
32239,"Not to  
mention that when you eventually find something it will be for pennies (I mean  
who can survive off of min wage or even 10$ an hour?)."
32240,"But you should be  
grateful."
32241,Grateful for your debt.
32242,"No wonder more people have given up on  
finding jobs."
32243,"I've tried getting help, everyone has always said I needed some."
32244,"Now I'm just  
on some meds to ease the anxiety and panic attacks."
32245,"I had a counselor but  
eventually that just boiled down to trying to think of a job I could cope with  
so at their suggestion I've stopped going."
32246,"My doctors (psycho/regular) have  
basically told me (after trying a handful of different medicines) that I'm  
getting all the help they can give, the rest is up to me."
32247,"Everyone else is  
just treating me like some sort of lazy good-for-nothing with teen angst that  
""I should have grown out of by now""."
32248,"As long as I'm not suicidal (it's a  
miracle I'm not), I don't think I'll get any more help."
32249,"No one wants me around  
but nobody wants me gone either, I suppose."
32250,"My father's only advice is ""deal with it"" or ""that's just how it is, be a  
man""."
32251,My mother thinks I just need more jesus.
32252,"Others tell me to just pull  
myself up by my bootstraps (My boots don't have straps and really that just  
seems impossible to me, isn't that breaking a law of gravity or something?)"
32253,"or  
just invent something and make millions (the american dream!)."
32254,"None of this is  
helpful at all, but it worked for them they are all so happy (they aren't)."
32255,"It  
feels as if they are just as tired as I am but it doesn't matter."
32256,"Maybe they  
are just tired of making excuses for me to others."
32257,This is not to say that I am miserable.
32258,"There are still things that I enjoy:  
reading, music, games, and just lounging outside with my dog and some stray  
cats."
32259,"But I feel little to nothing in common with the people around me or  
anyone I've ever met."
32260,"As a matter of fact, I feel more in common with  
""animals"" than people (both seem like animals to me, one group is just more  
enjoyable company)."
32261,I understand emotions.
32262,I can sympathize with people.
32263,"I'm  
even told that I handle conflict well."
32264,"I still can't shake the feeling that  
it's all just fake though."
32265,"Still, I keep in contact with a few friends I'm told  
that they're good for me."
32266,But this isn't good enough.
32267,"My family is waiting for  
me to find a woman to ""give me purpose"" and the media plays it up as if you  
have nothing without romantic love."
32268,"I have no real interest in these things  
though."
32269,I've seen more than my share of people get torn to bits in divorce.
32270,"But it isn't fear that disinterests me, I feel as though this too would be a  
facade."
32271,But no woman equals no kids.
32272,"It isn't even the lack of a relationship that causes my disinterest in  
children."
32273,"I don't hate kids, I feel like they are easier to be around."
32274,"Their  
simplicity is similar to the animals I'd rather be around."
32275,"But they are a long  
term commitment, that most people do not really think through."
32276,"I've seen the  
unholy hell that is a teenager, lived with them, conversed with them, tried to  
blend in."
32277,I refuse to believe I ever had this stage of life.
32278,"Even after this,  
most children aren't going to be self-sufficient after school."
32279,"Hell, the fact  
that I'm stuck living with my parents at this age seems like one of the few  
normal things about me."
32280,"But the main reason that I do not want kids is that I  
want to break the cycle."
32281,"We all just seem to trudge through life, to provide  
for our kids so they can wind up just as miserable as we were."
32282,"I know that  
that is an awful black/white statement but the basic idea holds true (is this  
how super villains are created?)."
32283,"As for a house, I feel that they hold us down more than keep us safe."
32284,"The cost  
of having a house is so expensive in current times."
32285,"My father who has worked  
all his life and has a decent job puts almost half of his monthly earnings  
simply into paying off his house."
32286,"My mother struggled for so long to get a  
house of her own."
32287,"Now neither can barely keep up and if they were to lose a  
job or something they would be out in the streets."
32288,"Heaven forbid they take  
some time off or get injured and need some down time."
32289,"Even the people who rent  
homes are stuck renting with several people if they are just starting out."
32290,"Not  
to mention the fact that they are stuck in a lease for so many odd months."
32291,"Even without these factors, I still am not a fan of being tied down."
32292,"Maybe  
it's just because I've never had a place that was truly my own but I can never  
feel comfortable in a home."
32293,"My parents used to jokingly call me a gypsy  
because I keep most of my important things in a bag that I keep on me for  
hopping between homes/dorms/anywhere."
32294,"The same holds true even now since I've  
gotten to the point that I cannot even stand to be around my own family now  
some days."
32295,"Everyone talks of responsibilities and homes and jobs as if they are the only  
way to be truly independent."
32296,"Yet these same people are stuck depending on jobs  
and money."
32297,"I've known many people who are suddenly let go, thrown to the  
lions."
32298,"Everyone gets stuck relying on others so there is no such thing as  
independence."
32299,"Even thinking or writing about all of this gets me exhausted (I've had to take  
a few breaks)."
32300,"The truth is that I'm just tired and not just a physical kind  
of tired, but the deep mental fatigue that I'm sure many of you are familiar  
with."
32301,"I find myself asking what the point of all this struggling is when we  
all wind up with nothing anyway."
32302,"So I'm currently 25 (almost 26) and at a  
crossroad."
32303,"I could just ""man up"" as they all say and go get a job and be  
miserable."
32304,"This road would most likely lead to self-termination (suicide is  
such a touchy word)."
32305,"Or I could simply enjoy my time, no matter what the world  
throws at me."
32306,This road leads to homelessness I fear.
32307,"When I see homeless  
people or see them portrayed in the media I don't feel sorry for them like  
most people do."
32308,I see where I'm more than likely going to end up.
32309,"And I'm not  
just talking about someone without a home either, I mean full-blown crazy  
hobo."
32310,"I can now see how people become so mad they babble to themselves or  
drink themselves silly."
32311,Other choices seem to just be just as unappealing.
32312,"I  
could go live in a mountain but that is just another form of homelessness."
32313,There doesn't seem to be a real middle path.
32314,You're either all in or all out.
32315,I don't think I can just bury these feelings either.
32316,"I tried that for a good  
ten years but then I just had a breakdown."
32317,"I feel as if I've opened Pandora's  
box and now it can't be closed."
32318,I apologize for the length of this post(it's more of a rant now I suppose).
32319,"But  
no one really wants to listen."
32320,"I've fallen through the cracks and now I'm  
worthless to society."
32321,"I hate to be such a downer but I feel like everyone is  
just walking around with blinders on."
32322,"I would really like some feedback or  
advice or even just acknowledgement that you read this whole wall (please no  
""man up""s or ""deal with it""s)."
32323,"I'll be back in a few hours to see if anyone  
bothers posting."
32324,tl;dr: Life sucks?
32325,Crazy seems like the way to go.
32326,I wanted to share this because it actually worked for me personally.
32327,I like it because it doesn't involve any drugs/medications and anybody can do it!
32328,":)

Here is some really relaxing background music:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoN4MD7G2is&amp;feature=related"
32329,"Overall, I slowly got better after my first attack with the help of meds and some therapy, but it seems like I am experiencing bouts of depersonalization again here and there, and most of the time, it doesn't accompany an anxiety attack."
32330,"Hi all, I've suffered with what I assume (and have been told my by doctor) is anxiety for a while."
32331,"I'm very nervous of other people - when I go out I hate crowds, and I'm always scared of drawing attention to myself."
32332,I'm also an immense worrier and often feel sick and stop eating with worry.
32333,"I'm getting really sick of being so anxious all the time and I want to be able to enjoy myself, go out and be myself especially by July as I'm going away for a week with my girlfriend!"
32334,I'm on the waiting list for CBT currently but it's quite long - I've tried a number of SSRI's (currently on Escitalopram which isn't helping) and also Pregabalin and they haven't helped at all.
32335,What medications do you guys find helps?
32336,As I'll mention any to my doctor as I'm willing to try anything.
32337,I'm thinking of some of the TCA antidepressants as they're totally different to what I tried.
32338,Thanks!
32339,"A couple months ago I got on anti anxiety meds, started exercising and really focusing on helping myself with my anxiety."
32340,"I've been taking 10mg of Citalopram for the last 4 months - most medication generally hits me pretty hard and it affected me badly straight away, so I stayed on a low dose."
32341,Does anyone have any advice on coping with meds withdrawal?
32342,":/ 
So reddit, can anyone specficially explain what is happening to me, and how exactly can I get over this in some way, shape or form without resorting to medication?"
32343,"Hi, I'm a 22 y/o Respiratory Therapy student and I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety concerning my clinical placement in the ICU and other high-stress clinical areas."
32344,I was originally diagnosed with depression about five years ago.
32345,"Now my depression is quite a bit worse, I remain medicated for it, and I've been having panic attacks."
32346,I've been seeing a counsellor and my family physician has added some new medications to help balance me out and help me return to the hospital and finish my degree.
32347,"Problem is, I'm still having panic attacks regularly and haven't yet been able to return to work."
32348,"I really do love the profession and feel that I'm good at it, but I'm not sure if it's what I should be doing if it causes me this much stress."
32349,"Although, maybe if I can regulate my illness I'll be able to get back on track... Not sure what to do right now."
32350,I'm about six months from graduation.
32351,Help!
32352,"Now I'm on medication for it, it seems to have gone."
32353,I'm on meds and I am currently trying to find a psychiatrist.
32354,"I've tried meditating, journaling, counseling and medication."
32355,Hi guys.
32356,To start off I need to say that I work at a group home for the developmentally disabled.
32357,"It's usually a pretty quiet job, considering I'm the night worker there and spend my time simply watching over the house and cleaning, but I also have about 5 hours of interaction with the guys each shift."
32358,"This morning an altercation was going down between two of the guys, one was being administered his medications while another barged in and refused to leave out of pure laziness and spite for the other client (they have a history of hating one another)."
32359,"One thing led to another and the one who barged in started threatening to physically aggress on the other, raising tensions."
32360,"After a cup of milk was thrown at another staff member and I as we tried to persuade the ""intruding,"" client to leave, the other staff member left the office to grab another staff member to see if he could help de-escalate the situation as we were having no luck; leaving me in the office alone with the clients."
32361,"The intruding client then, completely unprovoked, decided to start threatening even more and grew louder, and more antsy physically (hopping up a little, showing signs of physically aggression)."
32362,"I stood between the two as to protect the client who was trying to receive his meds, when the other jumped up without a word and started coming at *me*."
32363,Everything happened so fast.
32364,"To explain, I'm a 6'0 19 year old with ~8 months of experience in this company / field, while the aggressor is a 40 some year old 6'7 man."
32365,"He attempted to punch me with one arm after the first, resulting me in grabbing both of them to protect myself."
32366,"Eventually he pulled away extremely hard and while doing so slipped backwards, falling."
32367,Since I still had ahold of his arms I lowered him to the ground to the best of my ability so he wasn't hurt during the fall.
32368,"By then my coworkers ran in and simply stood around me, not knowing what to do."
32369,"All I could do is hold on to his arms until he was done showing signs of attacking me further, then I went outside for a break when everything calmed down and was safe for everyone."
32370,Here's why I'm worried.
32371,"My company has been known to be extremely strict, even furthermore than state guidelines, towards staff rather than clientele."
32372,"I was told straight up by my boss that this would likely get investigated by the company, which isn't unheard of but is very worrisome."
32373,"The company has a small list of ""approved,"" holds for situations like these, but in that moment the training I received ~9 months prior proved to be not as easy to implement on someone who's hellbent on ""breaking your fucking face in""."
32374,"I wasn't able to do an approved hold, but nor did I do a *banned* hold... Or any real ""hold,"" for that matter..."
32375,But I'm still worried.
32376,I love this job and now I feel like I'm on the radar.
32377,"I know I did my best and did nothing wrong, but it's still nerve wracking."
32378,"Like having a cop pull up behind you, even though you've done *literally nothing* wrong, you still have that sense of dread and worry."
32379,"Not to mention the fact that he's the most unhygienic client in that particular group home, and he left a bleeding scratch down my chest with his feces ridden fingernails (due to laziness and lack of washing hands thoroughly)."
32380,"After the altercation I had to write a report, and I was as thorough and honest as all possible, but I'm still worried..."
32381,"Even with him showing no signs of harm post-incident, and me being scratched up."
32382,"My anxiety can't handle much more from this incident, and it's not even *truly* begun."
32383,"(i realize that you can't 100% rely on meds to cure anxiety and that therapy plays a crucial role, but for this question i just want to focus on the drug aspect in particular)"
32384,"After I was put on medication and began to feel better, I started to go back to my normal self."
32385,"I skipped meds again that day, And I go to this guys office, walk in and freak out."
32386,Can medication curb this kind of overpowering concern.
32387,"Since he is only a therapist he doesn't have the ability to prescribe me medication, so I will likely be seeing a psychiatrist or General Practioner/Pediatrician to discuss medication."
32388,**b)**Should I go into the meeting asking specifically for SSRIs or should I simply say I am interested in medication and leave the rest to the doctor?
32389,I was going to therapy and was on meds for over a year and was doing fantastic.
32390,"So now, one month later been off meds and no therapy and was doing okay till the headaches started."
32391,"I refuse to take medication, I just dont like the idea of being on drugs, ive been on one before and it gave me all these side effects and dumbed me down."
32392,"I've been in therapy for my current anxiety for a little over 2 years, I've tried as-needed medication a long time ago but did not continue with it."
32393,I'm considering going back to the as-needed medication but I've always been against meds.
32394,Guess I'm going to have to take some meds ugh.
32395,"I've researched this medication a bit, and to be honest, my anxiety medication is now causing me anxiety."
32396,I need to talk to my doctor on Monday but I'm seriously considering getting off the medication and trying to deal with anxiety through therapy or other non-drug methods.
32397,"I take meds that keep my anxiety and depression in check but whenever it comes to jobs, it just loses it effectiveness."
32398,"Also, do you think I should look into medication?"
32399,My 72yr old father has been suffering from chronic anxiety the last 2 years.
32400,"He's been through 4 psychiatrists over that time, who have prescribed him multiple medications."
32401,"His main complaint is the severe headache and pulling sensation in the temples, that he's convinced are aggravated by the meds."
32402,"If any of you fellow redditors suffer from similar symptoms, how do you cope with it?"
32403,I've just started having him practice controlled breathing.
32404,"It seems to show some encouraging results while he's doing it, but I guess it will take time to have any permanent effect."
32405,Any other method (without medication) that has worked for you?
32406,Even the medication I took was just masking my situation temporarily.
32407,I'm at a point in my life where I have some time to stay away from full-time work and I've decided that I want to move on from the Xanax; I feel chained to medicine that I may not need any more.
32408,I guess I am posting this as an opportunity to talk to others who have dealt with similar circumstances: have you been happy with the transition to a life without anti-anxiety medication?
32409,"My problems are not severe enough that I would ever consider medication, but to simply ignore them for the sake of social normality is just silly."
32410,"Before I had my medication my panic attacks were horrible, and I'd often scare myself into having them by thinking I had cancer, or a brain tumor, or somthing like that, and I'd feel numbness I'm my mouth first, and then arms and legs, and I'd have trouble breathing and my heart would be pounding and I'd feel like I was detached from reality, but most of those symtoms have stopped happening since I got my medication (100 MG zoloft and .5 MG xanax)."
32411,Tl;dr : panic attacks have lost most of their symptoms since upping medication.
32412,My wife stopped taking her anxiety medication 2 weeks ago.
32413,"Her current doctor wants to put her back on the medication, but she doesn't want to take them."
32414,"I have struggled with anxiety since I was a teenager, and I only started taking medication for it a few years ago (I have a fear of meds that is slowly lessening)."
32415,"I no longer have the physical symptoms of anxiety, and when I do enter stressful situations, the meds make the situation easier to handle."
32416,"A few years ago shortly after this started I stayed 3 days at an inpatient program and I had a terrible experiene (I had about 2 minutes with an actual psychiatrist and I was taken cold turkey off of my meds) so even tho I would be potentially going to a much, much better facility I'm still reticent to do so."
32417,I've been struggling with really awful GAD for a few years now.
32418,"I also have co-morbid depression, acute noise anxiety (misophonia) to the point where i get constantly misdiagnosed for PTSD, and Panic Disorders."
32419,"I was on cipralex for 3 years and that helped a lot with my depression and a bit with my GAD (though my misophonia was never helped), but it just absolutely drained me."
32420,"I was sleeping 14 hours a day, nauseous, had frequent headaches, and was lethargic."
32421,I went off my cipralex in early fall because  I thought I was doing well enough to not have the side effects worth it.
32422,"I was fine for a few months of tapering and then in January, and again from March to May I have absolutely gone to hell with my anxiety."
32423,"My anxiety is so bad that I can't even make simple choices anymore (""should i brush my teeth first or shower first?"")."
32424,I end up either avoiding decisions or end up paralyzed and doing nothing because I can't bear the thought of making the wrong decision.
32425,I've been in counselling and am in a group CBT thing now but they don't seem to work well for me.
32426,I've tried other medications since my breakdowns.
32427,I was taking Ativan for a while to treat the panic episodes but i took them so often that I started having memory loss and disorientation so I had to stop.
32428,"I was prescribed Prozac and took it for about 4 weeks but i got headaches and didn't find my anxiety improved at all (in fact, i only got more irritable)."
32429,"My doctor has suggested anti-psychotics for me, especially since physical irritability is a really present symptom of mine (and she thinks my noise anxiety might be related), so I was prescribed an anti psychotic (abilify)."
32430,I went to buy it though and found out it was much too expensive for me ($7/pill!!!!!)
32431,and so I couldn't afford it and decided not to take it.
32432,"She then prescribed me another anti psychotic (risperidone) which should be more affordable, but i'm a bit scared."
32433,"I don't have bipolar or schizophrenia, and using it to treat anxiety is an off label thing."
32434,Has anyone tried this?
32435,I've been reading about the side effects and they seem awful.
32436,"Apparently some neurological disorders (face twitch, constant restlessness) are reported side effects, but extreme weight gain is another one."
32437,"I'm not talking about the 5-10 pounds i gained with cipralex (which i never lost) but people have gained 50, 60, even 100 pounds on it."
32438,"It apparently destroys metabolism, impacts prolactin, and has a high incidence of obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol even among people with no prior proclivity to it."
32439,"I'm scared, but at the same time i'm not functioning very well right now without any meds and i'm a bit desperate."
32440,I am wondering if anyone has tried risperidone for anxiety control and their experiences.
32441,I've also had people suggest to me Effexor and Buspar.
32442,"Effexor seems to have a smaller weight gain side effect but more worryingly i hear that it is impossible to withdraw from, which worries me given that i have had bad luck with meds in the past."
32443,Has anyone tried effexor and found it helpful for anxiety management?
32444,I was also wondering whether anyone has found wellbutrin useful for anxiety management.
32445,"I took wellbutrin for a while while i was on cipralex to counteract the fatigue and it was great, the only side effect was sweatiness."
32446,the problem was that i started developing hives three months in which apparently is not rare and i remember feeling good on it---i don't know if the anti anxiety part was from the wellbutrin or the cipralex.
32447,i'm kind of willing to try it again despite the allergic reaction if that is my only option.
32448,"tl;dr: 24 year old female (middle eastern origin, lives in Canada, petite) looking for an effective drug for anxiety management that doesn't have severe memory, fatigue, or physiological side effects."
32449,Prescribed anti-psychotics but am worried about side effects or even effectiveness.
32450,"Looking to hear about positive experiences (or negative ones) on risperidone, effexor, abilify, wellbutrin, buspar, prozac, or other medications to treat anxiety, especially anxiety related to inability to make choices and sound-irritability."
32451,Thank you
32452,"People tend to label you as awkward more when you don't make eye-contact, lose your balance frequently slur your speech occasionally, have a flatter-affect, and don't smile - even though I'm really empathetic, and without medication, come off as friendly and confident!"
32453,"I just want to tell random people, I'm on heavy pain-meds that make it so I can write and use my hands without acute pain (which is true, and why my physical health is decent but not excellent, but it isn't the real cause)

Without it, I feel a burning sensation in my head and feel a dull anger that eventually grows to the point where I can't function."
32454,"Many of these people should not have licenses to practice, and any adjustment to my medication, besides trazodone and ADHD, has been a failure."
32455,"Most of these people, both therapist and psychiatrist, do not know what they are doing, do not realize how incompentent they are, and are effectively trying random things till something sticks, which is what happened to get the medication I am on."
32456,"The next day he called and scheduled an appointment with his family doctor to see if he could get a prescription for anxiety meds but he couldn't get in for a few weeks -- those weeks were painful for both of us because every day he woke up scared of having another panic attack, which would in turn cause him to have another (thankfully less severe than the first) panic attack."
32457,"He's not against the anxiety meds, but he's very against anti-depression medication - he thinks it creates too much of a life-long dependency and also read that SSRIs and anxiety medication mixed can make things worse."
32458,I was just wondering what it would feel like when the medication kicks in so I know if it's working or not.
32459,And I can control that with medication and some minor therapy (usually just talking with others about it).
32460,I was really relieved to find this reddit.
32461,"I've struggled on and off with anxiety and depression for years, but my anxiety really sky-rocketed when I moved away from my hometown and family."
32462,"Now, it's become fairly debilitating."
32463,I've already set up a Dr. appointment to discuss anti-anxiety medications (which I haven't tried yet).
32464,I was seeing a counselor for years during middle school and high school.
32465,"When I moved out here to CA, I found a program through a university where you could sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy and work with a grad student and licensed Psychologist."
32466,(This program was extremely affordable and gave the grad students opportunity to practice in a supervised setting.)
32467,"That worked well for a while, but I ended up re-locating again and the commute isn't doable."
32468,Does anyone have any suggestions of coping methods that work for them?
32469,"Ideally, I'd like to be seeing a professional counselor/therapist regularly, but I can't afford to yet."
32470,This is affecting my work and my relationships--especially my relationship with my boyfriend.
32471,Any help or advice or suggestions would be appreciated.
32472,Meditation became my medication.
32473,Hi so i've been off and on medication and seeing therapists for anxiety/ocd for years now.
32474,ive been pretty pride blind about it mainly because everyone telling me its in my head but i know at this point i probably need some meds my anxiety has been getting horribly worse even affecting my driving and other daily activities im looking for pros and cons about some of the drugs you've been prescribed for anxiety and or panic attacks i know my doctor will tell me about them but i doubt he will have taken them and when i google it its just a bunch of kids trying to find out if they make u high so help me out here reddit
32475,"I'm not looking for a doctor to tell me what medication to take, I just want some first hand experience advice on what has worked for them."
32476,I'm tired of having meltdown from switching meds.
32477,"Well, folks, I'll be really frank (the first of many penis jokes in this thread): sometimes, because of our anxiety disorder and/or our medication, our plumbing might not work like we'd like it to."
32478,"But, like any anxiety-related problem, it doesn't have to cripple you- it's something you have to work through."
32479,"Many anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications cause erectile dysfunction- I take buspirone, and I have intermittent erectile dysfunction with my current partner."
32480,"Sometimes it's as simple as needing fifteen seconds to get back into it, but plenty of times, it's just been a no-go."
32481,"It makes me feel like a complete and utter failure- I couldn't fulfill my basic biological function!- and my girlfriend takes it very personally- every time I have the problem, she gets very upset and asks what's wrong with her."
32482,"My doctor prescribed Cialis for my ED, and while it will help, it's not the total fix."
32483,Cialis won't *give* you an erection; it will let you *maintain* an erection.
32484,That's the physiological function- it prevents blood from leaving your penis as easily.
32485,"I cannot, though, emphasize how much it won't give you an erection."
32486,You HAVE to be aroused to get one with Cialis or Viagra or any other ED medication.
32487,What I've realised now that I've worked past it is this: my erectile dysfunction problem got worse the more I thought about how bad my erectile dysfunction problem was.
32488,"If I really just let go, and started focusing on how good she smelled, or how much I wanted her, or any other things OTHER than ""my dick isn't going to work"", voila!"
32489,I'd get aroused and be on the train to Boner Town.
32490,"Mindfulness- being present in the moment, and not worrying about what might happen- is usually one of the best anxiety-management strategies for anything, not just when your flag won't fly at full mast."
32491,"Taking the ED medication is only a partial solution, and it might give you the little bit of confidence you need to relax, or give you the physiological support required to stay erect."
32492,"What really fixed my problem was mindfulness- being focused on my partner, the situation, and not worrying about my physiology."
32493,"I know it's not as simple as ""Stop thinking about it"" for all of us, but even making a little bit of effort to not think about it was usually all it took for me."
32494,"So, guys, fret not if you're suffering from Mycoxafloppin- there is a way through it."
32495,"I know that different meds work differently for everyone, but I just wanna hear some success stories, as well as non success stories from people who have been taking it for over a month."
32496,"Hello again, I thought I'd drop in a progress update on my no medication therapy for Post traumatic stress disorder, Social anxiety disorder, and general anxiety disorder."
32497,"After that episode I went to the doctor, and he put me on anti-depressants (daily, naturally) and anti-anxiety meds (when needed)."
32498,I'm going to go to my doctor tomorrow and see if I need a change of meds (the current doses aren't helping).
32499,"I don't remember what I said in particular that would stick out that session causing her to decide I needed any meds for my anxiety, however I describe it as: a net that is suffocating my chest, holding some form of pressure making my heart beat fast and breath come quicker, and thoughts that don't end with every possible question linked to it."
32500,I was put on medication when I was 10.
32501,The day I first tried anxiety medication to get through exams at uni changed my life.
32502,Anxiety medicine changed to an antidepressant version which I still take every day.
32503,Thanks to the medicine I finally see myself and the disease as separate.
32504,It’s hard to accept that my brain isn’t wired right and that I will most likely have to take medicine for the rest of my life so that I can continue to feel normal.
32505,It’s hard to know that my monster and dog still get woken up and push their way past the medicine.
32506,"Anyway, back to the title: I don't have and cannot afford insurance to get more therapy and medication that I desperately need."
32507,I'm taking 10 mg and I'm just wondering before I actually take the medication if Paxil is a strong drug.
32508,"I'm currently on no meds, as I've had several therapists and doctors inform me there's nothing to help my particular mix of issues (anxiety pills would make me too suicidal, depression pills would make me too anxious, etc.)."
32509,"So I had a panic attack Wednesday, which is rare for me since I'm usually pretty stable on my medication."
32510,"I don't know if it's me just scared that more time is passing, if it's my medication making things wonky, or what."
32511,I've been diagnosed with moderate depression couple of years ago but refused to take medication and stopped seeing the shrink because of the costs.
32512,"Anyway, I've tried CBT and various medication; cut out caffeine, sugar, alcohol."
32513,"I have and appointment on friday with a pyschiatric nurse and i have no idea how to ask for help, specifically with medication and such."
32514,"I dont want her to think I will abuse the meds because I have had a drug problem with heroin, but have been clean since the 24th of last month."
32515,"I don't know, it's hard to explain :s)

Edit: I'm a 22 year old Male in my 5th year of University for Engineering and am on no meds, although I have minor asthma"
32516,My mom is worried because of the side - effects of meds like xanax.
32517,My concerns are whether its bad to use Xanax to help me sleep and if I should never have alcohol again while I'm on these meds (usually 1 wine cooler is all I do).
32518,"At 31, I was raised during the ADD/ADHD craze in the late 80s and early 90s."
32519,I was (mis)diagnosed with ADD at only 8 years old and pumped full of experiemental medications until my senior year in High School.
32520,"I grew up under the influence of ritalin, dexadrine and every other form of legal speed you can imagine."
32521,"As an adult, diagnosed with GAD nearly five years ago during a brief stint in rehab, I rejected it."
32522,"After being through hell as a child, force fed drugs I didn't want and reprimanded by family and doctors for resisting, it was impossible for me to accept."
32523,"And yet, this morning, after years of day drinking to curb my anxiety and an inability to mainstain a steady job, a seemingly ridiculous fear of everything and an active resistance to discussing my anxiety with anyone, I looked it up."
32524,I looked it up because one of the most healthy relationships I have ever been in has found me miserable and terrified all the time.
32525,And I burst into tears realizing how incredibly calming it is to know that I am not alone.
32526,Now I have to brace myself for reaching out to my doctor.
32527,"Which, I'm sure some of you understand, feels like the most terrifying thing in the universe."
32528,Wish me luck.
32529,"I have been trying to avoid medication but two GPs, a psychiatrist and my regular psychologist counsellor have all recommended it, so I've accepted my GP's script for Escitalopram (Lexapro) and had it filled out but I can't bring myself to start taking it."
32530,"She got on medication (something related to Lexapro), started exercising, etc."
32531,"Recently though, she has been wanting to get off of the medication due to birth defect warnings (we may want a kid soon) and her general attitude which makes her want to be able to handle this on her own."
32532,She also has picked up a new source of anxiety based on the fact that she may never be able to get off of her medication without losing control of her life.
32533,Are people with this chronic anxiety ever able to get off of medication?
32534,Has anyone completely stopped taking meds for their anxiety and feel good about it?
32535,I am taking meds for my own case of anxiety and depression which is no where near the intensity she feels.
32536,My opinion is that I wish I had never started taking it as i would't have to deal with the 'lightnings' I feel when I am without the meds and other reasons.
32537,"tl;dr wife tried to get off anxiety meds, relapsed badly 

On a side note, I read this subreddit a lot and it really helps me gain perspective for both my anxiety and my wife's."
32538,Any natural medicine I can take to feel more relaxed?
32539,I was suggested to go to a psych for an evaluation but I'm scared of taking more meds on top of my ADD medicine.
32540,"I took medicine, went to a therapist, et cetera."
32541,I really don't want to go on meds again and risk it getting worse.
32542,Then I found a study that told me that herpes medication could slow down HIV.
32543,I forgot to take my meds this morning and realized once I got to school.
32544,I am just sick of being dependent on this medication and being on something that makes me have withdrawal symptoms when I'm not taking it.
32545,"I just feel zoned out, tired and not myself on this medication."
32546,And they wont let me get meds because they think I'm going to abuse them or something.
32547,"I've taken other benzos in the past for panic issues  - clonazepam, xanax, and ativan to be specific."
32548,"Whenever I take a valium, it makes me slightly depressed and hypersensitive even to the point of crying."
32549,"I've never had that issue with other  anti-anxiety medications, just valium."
32550,"I'm on 10mg a day, and I'm not sure it's doing its job."
32551,"I feel sleepy-ish, yawn more, a bit slower reactions, but my emotions are through the roof."
32552,"I broke out in tears today over a simple criticism from a teacher, it's pretty embarrassing."
32553,What is supposed to be keeping my panic attacks at bay is actually causing them where I've never had them before.
32554,Does anyone have any similar experiences with Diazepam/Valium?
32555,"My story of depression, panic attacks, anxiety started since elementary school."
32556,I'll spare all the details and focus on right now.
32557,I am 24 years old and my anxiety has pushed me to the lowest of lows.
32558,"I've spent the last year with extreme agoraphobia, trips to the emergency room, attempted suicide, and have about $100 left."
32559,"I am getting really exhausted and with the new year coming, I can't help but think ending my life is a good option because I can't bear to live another year trapped in my room because of ""my little problem""."
32560,"I've tried different medications, but they made me feel worse."
32561,"I decided to post in reddit for the first time, hoping to hear if there are others like me and how you got through this."
32562,I have never felt so desperate for change in my entire life.
32563,Which may be a good thing or a bad thing.
32564,This ends one of two ways: either I die before the year ends or I somehow learn to manage my problem which has escaped me for over a decade.
32565,"For several years I was able to trudge through life despite my problems, went to a high ranked university in the west coast, held several jobs, but within the last 2 years, I simply fell apart."
32566,I cracked under blow after blow from random harsh setbacks in life and my panic attacks got in the way of participating normally in life and I became reclusive after I had to quit due to several health issues that resulted from my attacks.
32567,"Only 5 people in my personal life know this, and I am sure everyone else would be shocked to know any of this since my natural personality is actually quite cheerful and I genuinely enjoy being happy...This year I discovered a lot of new things and learned a lot through reading simply from spending so much time alone."
32568,"While reading saved my life, it gave me an anguish I can't explain.."
32569,"It showed me all these wonderful things out there in the world and I desperately want to do, that it is causing me despair...Does anyone know or understand what I am talking about?"
32570,"If anyone is out there reading this, any kind words of advice would help me feel like I am not alone..."
32571,And I am currently taking no meds.
32572,"I have been working with my doctor to try and find the right meds to be taking, which has been very frustrating."
32573,"I'm at a loss and don't know if I should take her advice or find another doctor (she's my medicine doctor, not my GP)."
32574,"My whole family is on anti-anxiety medication, so perhaps I should have made the connection a little earlier :P. I am currently on 20mg of Cipralex, which for me helps a lot."

### Exercise  

Exercise is without a doubt the most important thing (other than medication, probably) for me regarding anxiety."
32576,"This can cause you to not get restful sleep, and is very common with people with anxiety/people who are on anxiety medication."
32577,"For example, medication has 100% helped me with the 3rd version."
32578,I've gotten the meds.
32579,I have been on meds before and I made a pact that I wouldn't go back because the first 2 weeks were terrible but I am at a loss of what to do.
32580,"I have terrible insomnia, waking with anxiety every night around 2AM."
32581,Anxious dread about EVERYTHING in my life swims in my mind.
32582,I'm currently on 20mg Fluoxetine (started it about 1 month ago).
32583,I take a different variety of antihistamines.
32584,I keep Valium near my bedside and take a half 5mg pill if my mind can't stop racing with dread.
32585,"The valium absolutely works, but I really don't like relying on benzos, as I don't want to get addicted or build a tolerance."
32586,"I was on mirtazapine for about 6 months over a year ago, and it helped me sleep, but I gained over 10 pounds while on it and stopped taking it."
32587,"My doctor recently recommended seroquel, but I've read it can cause serious weight gain, and I don't want to gain weight (causes anxiety in itself)."
32588,What other medications can I talk to my doctor about?
32589,"Anyone take Ambein, Lunesta, or other sleep aids?"
32590,Alternatives to Fluoxetine?
32591,Thoughts?
32592,"I can cope logically, but I'm still extremely physically uncomfortable, even on medication."
32593,And all they are going to do is prescribe me medication that I'll refuse to take.
32594,"Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I don't take any medication for sleep, and then Friday and Saturday I usually go out drinking with friends so that helps me go to bed."
32595,"The past couple of weeks, I have had a really hard time getting quality rest, especially on days when I don't drink and don't take medication."
32596,Decided to skip my meds this morning.
32597,"Don't always need them, plus, it was a morning shift -- which requires a LOT of concentration on prep, and doesn't really allow time for my meds to fully kick in anyways, so I figured why bother?"
32598,Feeling like maybe I won't need my meds at all after today.
32599,"Sadly, my medication slows down brain processes."
32600,"My sister Sam has suffered from severe depression and anxiety throughout the past ten years, but took medication and went to therapy to deal with it."
32601,"Since I started medication for my anxiety (celexa) last August, I have gained 40 lbs."
32602,How do I combat my cravings/constant hunger without stopping the meds?
32603,I wouldn't mind taking the meds if I could get this weight gain under control!!!
32604,I was taking ADHD medication a few weeks ago (having taken it from seven years of age to my age of now 21) and I finally stopped since I don't enjoy being on medication constantly.
32605,I also don't enjoy the wave of anxiety that my medication was apparently holding back.
32606,I stopped taking medication and suddenly I was worried about everything and exploding at every single thing.
32607,"I don't want to start a debate about medication, thats not what this is about."
32608,"I hate being on medication, but it is sometimes a necessary evil."
32609,As of yesterday I am now taking medication again for my anxiety.
32610,"I have chronic pain, there's nothing that can be done besides meds, meds, and more meds."
32611,I'm going to see my Pain Management doc on Monday to up and switch my meds to something stronger.
32612,I don't love the idea of anxiety meds but maybe I need to go that route.
32613,"He said he felt in over his head and referred me to a psychiatrist to figure out

- are my symptoms side effects of medication
- or something else, concurrent and undiagnosed

I feel."
32614,"One day everything goes right and I have no anxiety whatsoever (whether due to meds, God, luck, therapy, I don't know) and it makes me uncomfortable."
32615,Im trying everything to avoid medication... just bought these on a recommendation... curious if anyone has tried these and if they help?
32616,My first time trying a medication and not feelings too up for it honestly.
32617,I always wanted to take medication but my parents have always talked me out of it..
32618,I havn't had my medication (prozac) for a week now and stuff like this feels like it's getting harder to handle.
32619,i'm on medication but i'm still pretty messed up.
32620,Had no idea this subreddit existed.
32621,I'm 28 and I have dealt with this every single day since I was 8 years old.
32622,I've had to be physically dragged into school in my pajamas in elementary school.
32623,"Growing up I had no friends, I barely spoke to people."
32624,"I ended up dropping out around 12, I would get up in the middle of class and walk home, and my family and therapists could do nothing to help me."
32625,It turned me into an agoraphobic anti-social hermit at 16 who didn't leave her home for two years straight.
32626,"It's crippling, and terrible, and I HAVE to tell you: IT GETS SO MUCH FUCKING BETTER."
32627,Four years ago I was at a rock bottom point.
32628,"I was living with my verbally abusive mother, I had no friends, no education, no means of income -- nothing."
32629,I considered suicide everyday and buried my pain in video games and internet.
32630,Something snapped inside me and I decided to change everything.
32631,I've been working so hard on my anxiety issues since then.
32632,"I learned to drive, I got my first job, a car, made friends."
32633,I can FINALLY use a phone now to make appointments and check business hours.
32634,"(Like, seriously, that's a huge milestone for me.)"
32635,"I've traveled, and I've had some life experiences I never thought would've be possible."
32636,"I did this all on my own, without the help of medications or therapy."
32637,I forced myself into situations I would normally run away from and absolutely hated.
32638,Recently I've hit a wall again.
32639,My panic attacks are horrendous lately.
32640,"But, I promise that whatever you and I are going through right now, we can totally overcome it."
32641,You want someone to talk to?
32642,I'm right here.
32643,"If anyone here takes medication, specifically serax, I was wondering if you could answer a couple questions."
32644,"I really just want some help, and idk if medication is the way to go."
32645,From 20-22 I was okay and medication free.
32646,What medication is most appropriate for this?
32647,"My meds the primary care doc prescribed (Lorazepam, 1mg) don't seem to do anything (in fact, it sometimes makes my mind wander and the effects worsen)."
32648,"I've tried deep breathing, meds, massage, lowering stress, but nothing helps."
32649,None of the medication has worked.
32650,"The psychiatrist told me that if it's necessary, medication is an option further down the line but..."
32651,I am on my meds but I am having a resurgence in this anxiety.
32652,Is it something I will grow out of or should I take medication.
32653,Should I tell my doctor to higher my dosage or maybe switch to an other medication?
32654,I heard that adderal is the strongest medication for ADHD so if it doesn't work for me what is gonna work?!?
32655,I'm only 17 (and new to reddit) and have been feeling this way for well over a month.
32656,This isn't the first time I post on here either.
32657,It all started at a restaurant.
32658,"Long story short, I had a random panic attack while eating a burger.."
32659,I was thinking about death at the time for some reason and I guess my body responded negatively.
32660,"I was far from home, so the thought of dying so far away is what I think triggered the panic attack."
32661,"My vision got blurred, I felt like I was dreaming, my heart felt like it was pounding right out of my chest, I had to take a massive.... (you get it)."
32662,So yeah.
32663,(I even felt some weird sensation in my head like I was about to die of brain cancer or some kind of brain disease).
32664,"Ever since, I've felt dizzy and ""dreamy"".."
32665,I don't know if that makes any sense.
32666,I also feel like I have something.
32667,Like I'm sick.
32668,"I've gotten blood tests done, urine exams done, blood sugar and pressure are both fine, I even got an EKG (electrocardiogram) and a CT scan of my head that both came back fine."
32669,But still I feel like I have something.
32670,"Sometimes, in certain situations, I feel like if I don't keep it together I can just collapse into an attack that I've never even had before (or the same one in the restaurant)."
32671,It's weird..
32672,It's this feeling I get in head that's like a combination of dizziness and...
32673,I can't think of the other one.
32674,"It's the same sensation I got in the restaurant, but the only difference is that I keep it together whenever I feel it now so I don't go into full panic like I did that day."
32675,"Also, EVERY morning, as soon as I get out of bed I start shivering/trembling."
32676,It's the same kind of trembling as I would get when I smoked marijuana (which I don't do anymore because I'm scared of having an anxiety attack while on it since I always seem to get paranoid when I smoke it).
32677,"Since it's the same kind of tremble, my guess is that it truly IS anxiety."
32678,I also get this nervous tick in my neck that goes away quickly after I finish eating breakfast.
32679,My general doctor had put me on Tranxene 7.5mg.
32680,It was a prescription for 10 days.
32681,I only took half a day (even though the bottle said 1 pill a day for 10 days).
32682,The last pill I took ended up being a full pill.
32683,The next day I felt extremely tired and slightly dizzy.
32684,I heard this can happen with these anxiety medications.
32685,The only thing the Tranxene did was bring my appetite back.
32686,"I wasn't eating, in fear that I'd experience what I did in the restaurant."
32687,I'm eating perfectly fine now (though I doubt I could ever have burgers again..).
32688,I just want to know what I have.
32689,I don't wanna live life in fear.
32690,My greatest fear is death.
32691,I'm not religious and therefore believe death to be the end.
32692,(No religious spam please).
32693,Well the point of me writing this is to see if anyone can reassure me that I'm not sick (at least not physically) and maybe give me some advice on what to do.
32694,I'm only 17.
32695,No longer go to high school (that could play a major role if it *is* anxiety).
32696,she sent me to a psychologist and we started meds.
32697,I've been experiencing horrible depression and anxiety for a little over 6 months now.
32698,I've switched medications twice.
32699,Changed my diet.
32700,Have been trying to exercise.
32701,Nothing has been working.
32702,Finally found affordable counseling.. And now I feel even worse than ever.
32703,I was supposed to have my second session today.
32704,I couldn't go.
32705,I was so afraid of having to go and sit there and tell all the bad things I feel and all the pain I felt.
32706,I'm tired of crying.
32707,I'm tired of talking.
32708,Can't I just go back to being myself?
32709,!
32710,"I'd rather they just give me meds and send me on my way, with as little feelings discussion as possible."
32711,"I've been seeing an awesome therapist, I'm on great meds, and I basically just have a much healthier approach to stress."
32712,I was taking meds for social anxiety but they did not ever really help.
32713,"After stopping I experienced, and still am experiencing symptoms including working memory issues, fatigue/lethargy, lots of tension and anxiety that I never had before meds, and a feeling of being ""spaced out"", foggy thinking and having trouble concentrating."
32714,Is it possible to eventually reach a point where you can live a basically normal life without being on any medication at the end?
32715,"The best I ever see people talk about here are periods of normalcy while on medication, which eventually goes back to how it was before."
32716,"I have just been worrying about it a lot, because as I am now I haven't left the house since 31st December 2013, I'm not on medication, but I am stable."
32717,I am considering medication though I am somewhat skeptic about the benefits it has as they are temporary.
32718,"My mother suffers from Anxiety and is on medication for it but this was from a significant event in her life, my symptoms are just there."
32719,Apparently we're going to talk about the possibility of me starting medication for the first time.
32720,Isn't it weird or a bad thing to start taking medication before I know what's wrong with me?
32721,Does medication often make you gain weight?
32722,What's it like when starting medication?
32723,I'm worried that I'll become a different person when on medication.
32724,"last week his medication was giving him stomach aches,  or so he thought."
32725,so when i get up and it's time for work i can't even get out of bed i'm so dizzy and i begin to hyperventilate so by now i call my doctor who told me to go to the emergency room i might be having a bad reaction to the medication since it is working full blast now.
32726,when i get off the train i stumble my way to the ER and tell the woman i am having a bad reaction to my medication.
32727,he suggested i stay on my meds.
32728,"i am not taking ANY more meds, which i am told is quite hard."
32729,However my medicine/prescription is only $12 for a month supply.
32730,"I waited 25 minutes in the waiting room, and he only asked me 5 questions about the medicine, which took a total of 3 minutes with the doctor."
32731,"**I've been on this same medication for 2+ years, and wanted to tell him I didn't see the point in coming back every 3 or 6 months to talk to him for 5 minutes for a script that works for me, but costs me $300 every visit."
32732,Any advice on finding a new health insurance plan that covers my specific medication?
32733,My dad took me to the doctor and I started medication and therapy.
32734,I started medication again but I feel like it's different this time.
32735,So what are meds you guys are on?
32736,My doctor won't prescribe me a benzo (anti-panic medication) and I can't afford therapy right now.
32737,"So I am an axious person, I get panic attacks and have been medicated for my GAD (am not on medication at the moment) 
My mom is sick and I am flying from the states to canada to help take care of her, my flight leaves tomorrow evening and the longest I will be in air is about 6 hours."
32738,or will he switch me entirely so ill be on just one medication?
32739,I've noticed im sensitive to different meds (mainly SSRI's) so im always worrying what ill have to try next...
32740,This is all over the place...
32741,I'm sorry ahead of time.
32742,TL;DR in the title.
32743,My anxiety is pretty severe.
32744,"I haven't had a job in years, I don't have a driver's license, and I haven't had friends offline since high school - and it won't be long before my 10 year reunion comes up."
32745,"My ""best friends"" live across the country."
32746,They know each other offline.
32747,I know them only through Facebook and an MMORPG.
32748,"More and more lately, I just feel like I'm too different for us to relate to each other."
32749,"I love them, we talk all the time in a group chat on Facebook and in-game, but so often, they talk about things like work, and hanging out, and things that involve money, and I just shut down."
32750,I can't contribute to any of that.
32751,"I felt like I belonged for awhile, but now I'm not so sure."
32752,I feel like I'm weighing them down.
32753,I'm awkward.
32754,I can literally go weeks at a time where my only face-to-face interaction is with my husband.
32755,I make stupid jokes.
32756,I regret the stupid jokes.
32757,"I have nothing to contribute to their conversations about being normal, functioning members of society."
32758,I don't feel like I can talk to them about personal things anymore.
32759,"I'm terrified for our financial situation, but I panic every time I go to the ""job listings"" page for a local place."
32760,"I feel worthless and out of place, I'm associating everything about this entire month with the loss of my grandmother and family dog and old teacher, and I just feel like I'm set so damn far apart from everyone, but I can't talk about any of that with them."
32761,Or to anyone except my husband.
32762,"And that should be enough, right?"
32763,"It should be, he's my everything, I love him more than words can say."
32764,But there's something to be said about having *friends.
32765,"* And I feel like I'm drifting away from them, already so out of place, shrinking, and by the time I'm done, they won't even remember I was there, like an ice cube in a volcano."
32766,Insignificant.
32767,We can't afford treatment.
32768,I tried different medicines and therapy when I was a kid and they didn't really change anything anyway.
32769,"I was on Zoloft for a little while a year ago, but the side-effects were so awful that I had to quit."
32770,"The doctors treated me like I was a child who didn't know what she was talking about, and I left with a week of anxiety so bad that I had to have my mother and brother take turns sleeping over so I wouldn't be alone."
32771,I just don't know what to do anymore.
32772,"They haven't said anything to make me feel like they care any less, or that I don't belong, but we're thousands of miles apart in so many ways."
32773,"EDIT: Thank you so much for all the comments and support, everyone."
32774,It really means a lot!
32775,I feel like even if i get medication how could these thought possibly get any less terrifying.
32776,"I feel ready to quit the medication.But I've gained 40 lbs over the last two years 
It works great a little too much ."
32777,My question would be: What is it that the medication did to me that my body wasn't already doing ?
32778,"So now my meds are relatively in order, but everything else is incredibly uncertain and up in the air which just makes my anxiety skyrocket."
32779,"I'm 25f (almost 26), and I think I might have anxiety (at least, more serious anxiety) but I'm too embarrassed to go to a doctor and kind of in denial."
32780,"It's not that I'm afraid of everything or leaving the house, it just seems like I can't NOT be worried about something."
32781,"I can never relax, and I admit I'm a busy person (work full time, part-time grad school, two dogs, live-in boyfriend, etc), but laying down and doing nothing just leaves me uneasy."
32782,"If I'm not worried about finishing my homework, I'm worried about a deadline at work that I have no control over."
32783,"I feel like I worry irrationally about things I know aren't a big deal, but I just can't talk myself out of it."
32784,I've been reading posts in this sub and I'm just not sure if this is anxiety or that I'm just a worry-wart.
32785,"As I type this now my chest is very tight, last weekend was difficult (overdrank at a wedding, fought with boyfriend for no reason) and I just can't stop dwelling on how embarrassed I am about it, so I'm just in a constant state of crying/chest tightness."
32786,"I feel like that's normal, to kind of dwell on things, but I also had a near mental breakdown yesterday about it and get very self-destructive/negative about myself, wrote e-mails to my boyfriend about how terrible of a person I am, etc."
32787,"A few weekends ago I was worried about being late to another wedding and also felt like it was hard to breathe, but I knew we had plenty of time."
32788,"My brother used to be on klonopin, alcohol withdrawal medications, etc because he has a history of anxiety, so it seems like that might be likely."
32789,"As a teen I was kind of depressed, eating disorder-ridden, and one year I just never left the house except for school/sports."
32790,"But aside from that one year (I was about 15 at the time), I've never had these intense, long-lasting feelings of anxiety."
32791,"I feel like I fly off the handle at the most ridiculous things due to pressure I put on myself(for example, I decide I want to get to work by 8, anything that delays me just sends me into a rage-fest that makes me want to just throw things and cry)."
32792,"I'm also on birth control, drink a lot of coffee, probably don't sleep enough, though I do try to exercise several times a week."
32793,"I want it to just be something else so that I know if I just do certain things (stop with caffeine, sleep more) it will go away, is that just naive though?"
32794,"A few years ago I felt like some things would make me nervous (interviews, public speaking, normal stuff), but that for the most part I was pretty carefree, open to doing new stuff."
32795,Now I just feel like I'm ALWAYS worried/nervous/in crisis mode.
32796,I'm just not sure what to do.
32797,"Sorry this turned into a wall of text, I'm just really confused and after reading through other posts I don't know how much I relate to everyone else :("
32798,My anxiety is terrible when it comes to my health.
32799,Any unidentifiable feeling I get in my body immediately leads me to believe there's something very physically wrong with me.
32800,"So I have a couple questions..

What are some ways you manage the health related anxiety that don't involve medication?"
32801,I've taken advice I've seen here before about avoiding googling symptoms and the like but I'm curious to know what methods people use to relax and reassure themselves they're okay.
32802,"If you're taking medications, what ones and do they help reduce the worry/thoughts about your health?"
32803,Currently I only have lorazepam for when I'm having an attack.
32804,My doctor has suggested antidepressants but before I go back and talk to her about it more I'd like to know what other people with the same issue have experienced and if the medication really does help to reduce the thoughts of health related anxiety or if it just makes the anxiety itself more bearable.
32805,"Also, How do you guys feel about the medication Citalopram?"
32806,"My birthday is in a few days, and I still have my anxiety."
32807,My anxiety is so bad that I'm stuck at home.
32808,I can't work or study.
32809,I can't even use public transport to get to the shops.
32810,"I really, really need advice."
32811,"It may be a long read, but please bear with me."
32812,I've always been an anxious kid.
32813,"When I was 11, I was forced to go to a school camp that I begged not to go to."
32814,During the camp I fell ill (homesick and bad food) and was yelled at by my principal.
32815,He yelled in my face because I was crying.
32816,I would feel sick before school every day after that.
32817,And even felt sick in anticipation (I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about).
32818,So I missed large portions of that grade but still maintained a really good report card.
32819,"After I finished that grade, I was much better."
32820,Went to school every day.
32821,"Then when I was 13, I suffered severe side effects during my period."
32822,So I stayed home for the entire week.
32823,Every four weeks.
32824,This was sorted out and from age 14-16 I had literally no problems with anxiety.
32825,"When I was 17, I suffered tonsillitis very regularly."
32826,"And since I felt poorly, I missed chunks of school."
32827,This meant I had to catch up and it was never a problem.
32828,One of my classes was an exception.
32829,The teacher forced us to study behaviour of a plant or animal of our choice and write a university grade thesis (her words).
32830,I struggled to keep up and her constant yelling at me and belittling made going to her class feel awful.
32831,"But my anxiety started one day when I felt the urge to pee (this may seem silly but I need advice here too...)
I NEVER used the school bathrooms."
32832,I'd hold my bladder from 8-3:30 every day no matter how painful.
32833,"This one time it was particularly desperate, so I had to use the bathroom."
32834,"From then on, I had no issues using the bathroom."
32835,But I started using it often and usually when I didn't need to go...
32836,"When I first arrived, before the bell, after class, during lunch, after school."
32837,It became an obsession furled by anxiety.
32838,I'd feel anxious if I didn't pee during these opportunities.
32839,"The anxiety made me feel desperate and I developed what I think is called ""urge incontinence"" (where you feel like you HAVE to go, and the anxiety exasperates the sensation, regardless of how full your bladder is; and despite all that, you don't actually ever wet yourself, but feel worried that you will.)"
32840,This developed into full blown panic attacks.
32841,"I'd be sitting in class and then think, ""do I have to pee right now?"
32842,"Not rea- OH I DO!"""
32843,and then I'd have to be excused.
32844,Teachers only allowed one toilet break during class and sometimes I'd require two or three.
32845,Some teachers talked to me about it and allowed me to go whenever.
32846,"Some flat out refused (such as the teacher that yelled at me for my ""thesis"")."
32847,"One day before school, it came to a head and before I left for school I was throwing up."
32848,I started crying and informed my folks that I just couldn't continue my schooling.
32849,Fights ensued.
32850,They went to the school and spoke to my principal and he spoke to them about anxiety (he supposedly had bad anxiety and found ways to manage it).
32851,They bought the book he recommended and came home and cried with me.
32852,They told me they understood and have been supportive ever since.
32853,"I've been to the doctor to get diagnosed, been subscribed many, many medications (all had HORRIBLE side effects), and I've seen so many psychologists and even a psychiatrist."
32854,"After all of that, I resigned to trying to figure my stuff out myself."
32855,"And after four years, I've finally made progress."
32856,I can leave the house if I'm driven by my folks or my SO.
32857,"But the only part of my anxiety that remains, is the peering thing."
32858,"I have to pee before we leave, when we get there, another time whilst there, and before we leave to go home."
32859,There are many situations that I refuse to try simply because toilets are unavailable.
32860,"When I have to pee during these situations with a toilet, I have to completely empty my bladder and keep trying to pee until only a drop comes out."
32861,This peeing thing is fucking frustrating to me and the people around me.
32862,They have to wait for me and I hate making them wait.
32863,"If I were rid of this problem, I'd be able to seek employment or study."
32864,A couple more things: I've been tested for bladder and kidney problems and there's nothing wrong.
32865,It's all psychological.
32866,No medication.
32867,No therapy atm (therapy sent me so far backwards - I've only improved by tackling my anxiety myself).
32868,"My anxiety used to consist of panic attacks, nausea, physical ailments, etc."
32869,Now it is ONLY the peeing thing.
32870,Have you ever had problems like this?
32871,"Even if you haven't, can anyone offer any advice or tips?"
32872,Please?
32873,Thank you so much if you've gotten to this point.
32874,"Any help is so greatly appreciated, you might not even know."
32875,Tl;dr: have had anxiety for a long time.
32876,"Currently have problems where I feel like I need to pee when I don't, and it causes all of my anxiety."
32877,I need advice please.
32878,Would medication make this go away?
32879,"On top of this, my mother recently started dealing with her own life-long anxiety issues and then suddenly quit her meds and went right back to her old cycle of Tylenol PM at night, and 2 pots of coffee every day."
32880,"I've been suffering from GAD since puberty, and I was first prescribed Xanax for my panic attacks at age 13."
32881,I've been on various cocktails of psychiatric medications ever since.
32882,"Now I take 5 mg of lexapro, 50 mg of buspirone and have clonazepam (.5mg) and hydroxine (25 mg) as needed."
32883,I try to avoid taking my sedatives - especially my clonazepam.
32884,"Yet, with graduate school and all my other obligations, I find myself feeling like I need at least half a hydroxine every day."
32885,"I just wonder, what is the threshold for taking a pill?"
32886,"Do I need to feel anxious, as in stressed out and frazzled, or do I need to be actively headed towards a panic attack to take a pill?"
32887,"Grad school is getting less stressful, but I do not like feeling like I have to take pills to function."
32888,"I'm in therapy, which helps, but the problem is obviously not going to go away."
32889,Edit: Asking for personal experiences here.
32890,I hope I can avoid going on anxiety medicine.
32891,I plan to drink during this vacation and don't want to have a bad time or negative effects because of this medication.
32892,I feel like I'm slowly conquering my anxiety without medication and went to the doctor this past week just to make sure it wasn't my heart and thats when he prescribed me this stuff.
32893,"Any information will help, the doctor and the pharmacy told me two different things and websites list 5-15 symptoms alone so I'm looking for previous experience with this medication."
32894,I still have barely lost any of that contempt for SSRI's and psych meds in general.
32895,"For the past few days, even with medication, both self and prescribed, I have had an increase in mini panic/anxiety attacks in social situations."
32896,"I keep telling them that this is bullshit because none of it works for me, but they want me to jump through a thousand more hoops before I can have any chance of getting a medication that can ACTUALLY help with my anxiety."
32897,I hate to be negative but I fear that the only way I will get any relief from this is by an anti anxiety medication.
32898,Diagnosis and therapy and meds came soon after.
32899,I tried all the meds back in the day (mid-90s) and finally settled on Celexa 20mg and have been on that for the better part of 20 years.
32900,"Despite years of therapy and meds, I never could prevent or control my panic attacks."
32901,"Possibly more appropriate for /r/depression, but it seems like the posts there are more sad poetry than logistical issues..."
32902,"I have GAD, and mild depression."
32903,"Unmedicated, both of these issues are NOT mild at all and can have severe hypochondria, but meds work wonders for me."
32904,But I'm really sleepy all the time.
32905,I sleep 10-12 hours a night if I don't set an alarm and I'm sleepy when I wake up regardless of how long I slept.
32906,"I've always been a long sleeper since babyhood, I've been on and off different meds for 5 years, and I am 20 exiting the teenage years...so there are so many confounding variables, I don't know if they are related to medications or just other physical issues/poor sleep habits."
32907,"Ive been on Zoloft, Prozac, Celexa, Effexor, and Lexapro; currently taking Celexa (+Wellbutrin) anybody else have this problem?"
32908,Hi r/anxiety.
32909,I'm terrified for my boyfriend.
32910,We're in a long distance relationship while he finishes six years in the Navy and I finish four years at my university.
32911,"Long distance of course puts a strain on our relationship, but nothing we haven't dealt with (we've been together for 1.5yr; long distance for 1.)"
32912,Last night I had a long phone call with him about his anxiety.
32913,It's bad.
32914,I've never seen someone so taken with their anxiety that it's affecting their life this much.
32915,He needs a haircut and he gets anxiety about the thought of walking to get one.
32916,He needs to get important signatures to phase up so that he can get higher in his ranks and he's scared of asking all of those higher ups for help.
32917,He knows he can easily go to a counselor and talk to someone about this but he's petrified to even *knock on the door*.
32918,He's not getting sleep.
32919,It's hurting his school work.
32920,"The other day he told me he got ""awake"" pills to stay awake during the day because he's not getting sleep at night."
32921,I'm honestly frightened.
32922,He's in the Navy of all places.
32923,What can I do to help?
32924,Have any of you been in a situation like this?
32925,Where you've had incredible anxiety and your SO is trying to help?
32926,What can I do?
32927,Should I be sweet to him; should I be demanding of him?
32928,I just want to help him.
32929,I just want him to be able to live his life.
32930,It's incredibly frustrating being so far away and unable to help physically.
32931,Edit: Forgot to write this: he's not on any medications.
32932,The Navy has no idea he's having this anxiety even though they should.
32933,He's almost 20 and he's on Tricare.
32934,"I haven't seen my therapist in over a year, and I have been (unwillingly) off medication for the same amount of time."
32935,He actually asked for more or different medication.
32936,"I am dealing as well as can be expected, I suppose, but after not having any emotions for the 10 years I was on the meds, now all my emotions are back."
32937,"I'm interested in therapy AND medication because the problem has gotten so extreme and is having physical effects (I can feel it in my heart, lungs and feel shaky, and constantly on edge) How should I go about doing so, and in the mean-time what can I do to alleviate the issue?"
32938,"I recently found the Goldilocks of meds/therapy for my anxiety, but I'm 34 and feel like I've missed all the important events in a normal persons life."
32939,I was diagnosed with GAD 11 years ago.
32940,"I saw therapists for years and was prescribed way too many anti-anxiety medications, all of which did nothing to help me."
32941,I'm on my own with my anxiety now.
32942,"Self-help books have eased my anxiety a little, but not too much."
32943,I don't know what else to do.
32944,There are a few high-stress things going on in my life right now that I'm unable to solve or really do anything about.
32945,They are what they are.
32946,"Unfortunately, those things plus just having GAD is making it very hard to actually *live*."
32947,I can hardly leave my house anymore to run errands.
32948,I struggle to basically do anything at home either.
32949,All I can manage is to stay in bed all day.
32950,"Still, I worry and have panic attacks, even when I'm doing nothing, and it's starting to make me physically sick."
32951,"My anxiety has caused my IBS to flair up in the past week, which is making me even more anxious."
32952,"My anxiety about going out has gotten so bad that I'm pretending to be sick (and on occasion, *making* myself sick), so I have an excuse to stay in and gets people off my back."
32953,I don't know what I can do.
32954,"Medication doesn't work, therapy doesn't help."
32955,I'm losing my life because of my anxiety.
32956,On Tuesday (tomorrow) I'll be going under general anesthesia for a minor procedure (not related to anything serious at all or an illness that has exasperated my anxiety).
32957,About 6 weeks ago I suffered an awful panic attack (from weed) that brought back a ROUGH battle with anxiety.
32958,It was such a desperate time.
32959,Physical exhaustion.
32960,Dozens of symptoms.
32961,The cycle lasted a few weeks to nearly a month.
32962,This past week I've begun to feel WONDERFUL!
32963,"I still have symptoms here or there, but I'm beginning to feel much like I did soon before I got over my anxiety COMPLETELY the first time earlier this year (first time was triggered from alcohol)."
32964,Some in here might even be familiar with me b/c I post in here so often.
32965,"Anyway, I've begun to feel good again (this is the light at the end of the tunnel for the second time, so my mood is improving-- I hit some bad lows this time around, including a few days where I felt so depressed I had to drive 2 hours to see my parents and stabilize, if you will)."
32966,"The only thing is, there are three things that I've linked to my anxiety: alcohol, weed, and even a few medications I tried for anxiety and eventually trashed."
32967,"I've been stubborn about avoiding medications, substances and battling this anxiety with my mind."
32968,"It's working, again, but I guess I'm afraid of anesthesia causing a pre-surgery (thoughts of it) panic attack or post-surgery panic attack (irrational fear and freak out from effects of coming out of anesthesia) that could recycle this again."
32969,I really don't want to fight that battle.
32970,"My therapist suggested, ""Best case scenario, you get out of the anesthesia with flying colors and this greatly boosts your recovery!"
32971,"Look forward to that accomplishment, OR you experience a bunch of anxiety, maybe a panic attack and you have to fight this battle again...but you've proven to be good at fighting them, right?"""
32972,I'm a weird mother fucker...
32973,"I really am hoping for the best and definitely not going anywhere but to my friends, parents and this sub for information."
32974,"Wish me luck, folks!"
32975,"I have a doctor's appointment in a couple of weeks and will definitely bring up my issues then, but I'm not sure if a need a therapist, medicine (which I'm a bit afraid of due to side effects), or a different diet perhaps?"
32976,"After completing it, he said he's going to put me on some medication."
32977,"I am so afraid of taking medication out of fear of the side effects, no matter how rare."
32978,I have read through almost all the threads on anti anxiety meds and libido.
32979,"I'm thinking about meds like Lexapro, celexa, and Zoloft."
32980,"I'm thinking I'll probably need some medication, and I have no real idea what my triggers are other than if you say the word ""money"" around me now after what happened to the apartment I start to feel tingly in the bad sense :( Sometimes they seem to come out of nowhere."
32981,"I've had a 2 week break from it and I'm now getting back on the meds since I'm having a full-blown anxiety relapse (insomnia has been gone during the break though)

A few people I haven't talked to for 10 years suddenly tried to get in touch with me (I ignored them) and this triggered a huge anxiety attack in me that's been escalating over the course of several days."
32982,I've been taking my meds...but they're running out soon and my mom (being the one to drive to the pharmacy) does not intend on picking up a refill because she wants to work on getting me 'normal.'
32983,"It's just so intimidating to me, it looks like once you start you're on meds forever."
32984,"Btw, meds in question are Prozac and Mirtazapine."
32985,"The meds that i took made me sick for a bit, which i was told was normal.. but all of the symptoms went away except drowsiness...   i was sleeping all of the time.. i gave it time, to see if that too would go away.. it never did... i really wish i would have noticed that this was not right... after four weeks... of sleeping about 14 hours a day, along with a nap... just watching tv all of the time.. too lazy to do anything, i finally went back to the doctor.. this was not right.. it was ruining my life even more then dealing with the anxiety in the first place was.. but i didnt want to go back to no life at all.. i finally got back to how i was before my anxiety go the better of me... dating again, being social, i was happy.. not spaced out as much...  

been on the new medication for a while now.. and i actually feel back to normal.. this is the first day that i got up early, had a full day of school, chores, and went back to parents for dinner, came home, still not tired...  up playing video games past ten thirty... it is weird to actually be productive... such a great change... i feel normal again... :)

i believe i have said thank you before..
but again, i may not comment on this sub, but, reading other peoples stories really has helped me the past couple months, getting up the courage to talk to someone, get help, realizing what is wrong and what is right..."
32986,"I can't really ask this question specifically, since I have no prior experience."
32987,"Also, I experience no panic attacks."
32988,"But social anxiety and generalized anxiety tend to be more what I experience, sometimes to severe levels."
32989,"It's starting to wear me down physically, and I'm starting to distance myself from friends/family, but I am still hesitant about taking medications."
32990,I just want to hear how long you've been on whatever you've been prescribed for your issues.
32991,Thanks!
32992,I recently (about 6 days ago) discovered my blood pressure is high and I am now on medication.
32993,"Besides help with the meds (doctors can do that), any suggestions for the restlessness I feel?"
32994,Should I ask my Doctor to put me on Anxiety medicine to help clear my head?
32995,"Last PET scan I had they gave me meds that should've knocked me out, I had a panic attack in the machine and barely made it through."
32996,I'm on 10mg of paxil and I've gained forty pounds since I started taking the meds a year and a half ago.
32997,How have you guys handled managing weight gain on meds?
32998,My question for you fellow members is when was the right time for medication and has the medication been effective for you?
32999,"A few months ago I tried Zoloft for the first time, but went through some terrible side effects with it and it completely deterred me from trying any other medication leaving me to try talk therapy which was great at first but the anxiety just came back."
33000,"I know most medication with anxiety is a trail/error process to see which one best fits you, so I'm just wondering how/why you chose medication and if it's been good."
33001,It’s usually around this stage that I know I have to take my medicine or I will definitely have a panic attack .
33002,I take my meds and I start to feel like the thoughts are still there but they are muted.
33003,"Then when the meds wear off , everything comes crashing down on me ."
33004,Has anyone else experienced anything similar from this kind of medication (hypnotics/sleeping tablets) while suffering from anxiety?
33005,With the help of medication (Paxil for about 4 years and Lamictal for about 6mo.)
33006,"Since I’ve been on this medication, this constant edginess and feeling of being horribly unsafe in the universe has been muted to such a degree that often, it’s not even noticeable."
33007,I am 20 years old and have had social anxiety for about 6 years now with frequent panic attacks kept down to about once a week with daily medication and colonopin/xanax when needed.
33008,"I am scared to get on a bus, scared to be in a room of people, scared to take the medication that makes me better!"
33009,"I don't want to be out on meds or told by the doctor that they can't do anything again, more than anything I don't want to admit that there is anything else wrong with me, I already have a long list of problems with health which add to the anxiety."
33010,* What if they have to run tests and/or give me prescription medication?
33011,"I can't keep asking people to stay here with me, my husband going to a later shift is not an option, and we don't have the money for therapy or medication."
33012,"I take cetirizine daily (allergy medicine, think Zyrtec)."
33013,"I'm on ADHD medication and that helps me with work, but I also had an argument with my boss (over something stupid) where I amped up the aggressive defensiveness that I feel when I start to get really anxious."
33014,"I got a job at a local bakery, and I am starting to realize that I am not cut out for working in the industry."
33015,The problem being is that I have no clue what else I would want to do and I am supposed to be a temporary replacement for when the pastry chef has to go on leave for a couple months...
33016,"I am getting anxiety to the max, depression is creeping up and I am starting to get anorexia/bulimia..."
33017,"I cannot just quit, I love the people who I work with."
33018,"I honestly do not believe this is the right career for me, I keep screwing up in the kitchen and what not."
33019,"I have a passion for food, but some people are just better suited for it and can work in the kitchen."
33020,"I'm currently not on anxiety medications, became drug resistant and meds put me in a zombie state, not to mention massive weight gain.."
33021,"I haven't told anyone, I'm 19, not really close to my parents."
33022,I don't want to fail anyone or my coworkers.
33023,But I don't know if I can make it out of full on depression again.
33024,"First of all, I'm new to this sub and I'm not sure whether you encourage or discourage the use of medication."
33025,If it's discouraged I will gladly take alternative advice.
33026,I'm 20 and I don't really know much about healthcare.
33027,I remember getting off of my parents healthcare when I was 18 and now I'm pretty sure I'm covered by my Universities healthcare but I know nothing about how it works and what it covers.
33028,How expensive are these medications?
33029,Are there any over the counter pills?
33030,(I don't think I need anything too powerful).
33031,Do I have to take these daily?
33032,Or can I take them situationally?
33033,(i.e.
33034,if I'm staying in today then no need for a pill).
33035,Thanks in advance.
33036,"Will I need to write down that I take XYZ every time I go for medical help and they ask what meds you are on, such as the dentists office?"
33037,"I pick at myself for hours then spend stupid amounts of money on makeup, creams, and medicine to cover it up."
33038,FYI: I'm not on any medication at the moment.
33039,"It helped, I'm not sure if it was the medication or just the knowledge that it was all in my head, or both (probably both)."
33040,I took the medication for about 4 years.
33041,"In January of this year, I wanted to quit the medication for personal reasons, so I did, with my doctor's approval and guidance."
33042,"I'm seeing my doctor early next month for my quarterly blood work, I think I'm going to ask him to put me on meds again."
33043,"As much as I'd like to be free of medication, I would like to go to sleep normally and not have to worry about whether or not I'll be dealing with this crap all night."
33044,"No medical tests have provided any conclusions, meds havent worked, CBT, counselling, acupuncture, exposure therapy."
33045,"After months of visiting a therapist with little to no progress, I went to the psychiatrist and was prescribed medication for my anxiety and depression."
33046,"Thanks guys and if any of you have questions about medication, feel free to ask!"
33047,Hey everybody!
33048,This past month has been the worst for me over one dumb thing I did over March Break.
33049,I went and did 2 tests for my body (blood test and ECG) and have been to my doctor around 8 times in this past month.
33050,"I felt fine after those tests but now I'm worried if I might have DVT

I'm almost sure that I have developed health anxiety because I'm always worried about my health and when I have any pain like chest pain or leg pain I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack or die."
33051,I hate this feeling so much and I see how it's tearing my family apart.
33052,"I've made my parents feel like crap in this month, making them feel stressed and made my dad cry a couple times because of my anxiety."
33053,Only this weekend my mom had enough and also ended up crying a little and I never have seen my mom cry.
33054,I see how my anxiety has tooken a toll on my parents and its killing me thinking about them like this.
33055,My parents say that they never seen me happy ever since then and that I have changed a lot which before I was the person in my family who was the happiest and friendly.
33056,I see my oldest brother seem fine but I know it's bothering him too but he just doesn't want to show it.
33057,He comforts me usually and that helps.
33058,I then see my youngest brother who is 7 seem very confused and worried for me and I love him so much and that hurts me thinking he doesn't even know thoroughly what's happening.
33059,Then it all goes down to me.
33060,I sometimes cry for myself and for my family for putting them through what is my own doing.
33061,"I can control my anxiety but when I get too much, I just break down and be in tears."
33062,I don't want to either be taking any medications for my anxiety either because I can control it and don't think it's necessary for it.
33063,I just hate this anxiety that I'm facing now and I just want it to go away so I can live my normal life as I am still young (14).
33064,Thank you so much for reading and have a good day.
33065,"I say average because I understand everyone is different with heigh, weight, and the way our bodies metabolize medicine."
33066,"So, as I write this, I can't sleep."
33067,This happens every couple of nights but the reason is always the same: I always have an overwhelming fear of death and dying.
33068,More of my family and loved ones than myself but I am definitely included.
33069,"I know that's ridiculous (everyone in my life is more or less healthy) but, there it is."
33070,This happens during the day too sometimes randomly however it's mostly just at night.
33071,Sometimes it gets to be so bad that it literally feels like the inside of my head is burning; it's just so all-consuming.
33072,I've been to a therapist a few times about this.
33073,"She tried to be helpful, but since she is religious it was hard to be relatable."
33074,"I personally am not religious myself, hence the fear."
33075,I don't take any medications.
33076,I don't know what I hoped to gain really by posting this.
33077,I guess I just want to exercise what limited control I do have over the situation and vent a little bit.
33078,"I don't even know what I'd make of responses to this, but if anyone has read this far, let me know what you think I suppose."
33079,I'm hoping that some positive results for other people will help me stay with the meds and not give up.
33080,"I'm looking to get off my prescription medications, there are just always so many side effects and I hate relying on chemicals to ""fix"" me."
33081,"If anyone has found something non-rx that works, I'd be happy to hear!"
33082,"On the other hand, if you tried something that didn't work, I'd like to hear that too."
33083,"I'm no longer taking any type of medication

After years of battling with anxiety, I'm better."
33084,I've been flat out refused medication for my anxiety.
33085,"Naturally, bipolar medication heightens anxiety (and vice versa; anxiety medication puts you into mania)."
33086,"* after my nervous breakdown i started to visit psychiatrist and i started to use perscripted meds 
* at the same time i resumed to studies (that i considered a step-down from a job), but i couldn't cope with increasing anxiety, so after three months i quit my studies and for 7 months stayed at home doing a heavy medication course with a hope to cure my anxiety (yeah, right) 
* after those 7 months i was ""encouraged"" by some of my relatives to finaly get back to earning money for myself, so i started to look for a job, hoping to find a ""simple and stress-free job - a first step in my recovery to a self sustained citizen"", 
* with the approval of my psychiatrist i took a postman job, 
* the ""first and easiest step"" turned out the most stressfull and intense experience i have had in my life (it was even harder that in my first job, where i ended in ashes), i was so scared of making mistakes and getting punished, that during the two month period, that i worked as a postman, i developed a lot security measurements and procedures (most of them were based on OCD patterns) 
* i left my job as a postman only after two months, because my body started to show buning-out signs again."
33087,"* at the same time, after consulting with my psychiatrist i quit using medication, because it didn't help me to recover, however they made me feel like a ""zombie"" with almost no interest in anything, i was just existing (It wasnt necesarily an awful experience using those drugs, but it definetly wasn't pleasant either)."
33088,"After ending using medication (and seeing the psychiatrist) i got a feeling, that the treatment i got was not so much to help me get better but more, so to say, to make me pleased."
33089,And I need to get back on meds to control them.
33090,"My mother is bipolar, not seeking treatment or medication, and taking out her frustrations on me."
33091,I've been put on a light dose of meds for anxiety but not for ADHD.
33092,"I took the meds, and they sort of calmed down that rising bubbly hysteria feeling, that out-of-control sensation."
33093,"When I told them no to things like wanting a psych just to get meds or wanting to hurt myself, they put words in my mouth and insisted that i was - suicidal or a pill pusher."
33094,"My sister was recently talking about how she takes medicine for anxiety but has never had or felt like she's been close to a panic attack, just feeling very nervous or scared at times, anxious I guess."
33095,"A few years ago I was on medication (Effexor) but as things were going well went through the long and difficult process of weaning off it until I was free of withdrawals, etc.."
33096,I definitely need some help in managing stuff right now but really don't want to find myself back at square one with medication...but as I said I feel really sad and scared right now.
33097,Not entirely sure what I'm looking for here - perhaps someone who has been through something similar - either as a new dad or needing to return to meds after being away.
33098,My sister (29F) has anxiety and depression which she's beginning to address through therapy/meds but needs to start applying for jobs so that she can pay rent etc.
33099,"Burning up, up up in flames

Try to put it out but it starts again

Something’s gotta give, something’s gotta give

Something’s gotta give, something’s gotta give


Someone’s gotta pull me back

Back back from the edge

Clean me up and refill my meds

Something’s gotta give, something’s gotta give

Something’s gotta give, something’s gotta give


Someone’s gotta tell my friends

“He’s so sorry, today’s not good for company”


You know what they say, you know you’re insane

When the voices in your head are starting to make sense

Every day you keep (burning?)"
33100,So I really need to get back on meds.
33101,"I used to take Wellbutrin for GAD, but I don't know what would be the best meds for me now."
33102,"I plan on starting to see a psychologist soon, but need to start medication immediately."
33103,"One thing that I have been told frequently from my doctor and therapist is that the medication I am taking to help cope with the symptoms of my GAD is really only a temporary band-aid, and that if I don't take care of the underlying causes of my anxiety Ill be stuck this way when the medication is over."
33104,"So, I tried going to sleep as well, but before I did, I had take my usual anxiety medication (Prozac)."
33105,I forgot that I recently increased the dosage so the medication ran out faster than usual.
33106,Anyone got this restlessnes when they are anxious?
33107,"I didn't take any medications for depression/anxiety, but I've read that there is something called Akathisia and this is due to medications."
33108,I'm just anxious about my college.
33109,"I changed my major, but now decided it was a mistake and I'm super anxious about my future."
33110,I don't want to do the thing I do right now.
33111,"I want to get back and I can't just relax, let it go."
33112,"I walk in circles, in fron of my friends for the whole day."
33113,This is tornment.
33114,"I now this is pointless, but still."
33115,"I'm having a meeting with the dean, so maybe I will be able to get back to my previous major, but I'm still anxious he will say no :/"
33116,"I learned to deal with it without medication, and I can say that I have a almost 'normal' life."
33117,"I don't wanna take any medication again, I hate the way it makes me feel u_u"
33118,I am on medication.
33119,"I've looked around for a bit, but haven't exactly found anything to specifically help me out."
33120,I'm a bit of an interesting case.
33121,"I don't have an eating disorder, I'm of normal weight, I look very normal, and overall I'm very happy with my life (I'm definitely not depressed or have any mental issues)."
33122,There is just one problem: I get anxiety when around food...
33123,I have no idea what this stems from.
33124,"I grew up a very picky eater, so maybe from that."
33125,"But here's the jist of it: whenever I go out somewhere, I get anxiety about eating the food."
33126,I have no idea why.
33127,"I know I'll like it, but still, I just get this anxiety flowing through me."
33128,"What happens is that my adrenaline increases, blood drains from my stomach, and I feel absolutely terrible."
33129,"I'm starving at some points, yet I feel so sick that if I put anything into my mouth, I'm unable to swallow."
33130,"Or if I do swallow, I feel like throwing it back up."
33131,"Here are some examples of when it happens: Prom - I had a beautiful date, great night, and all that other fluff."
33132,But dinner was absolutely terrible.
33133,"I was a little nervous about the night, but because I've got this crazy over-sensitive stomach, I felt as if I couldn't eat a single thing."
33134,"I WAS hungry, my stomach WAS rumbling, just for the life of me I felt as if I couldn't swallow the food."
33135,I felt like throwing it back up (even though I  never actually threw it back it).
33136,"Weddings - I always have a good time, I know the majority of people, I'm definitely not nervous about weddings."
33137,"Yet somehow, when dinner is served, I feel sick to my stomach again."
33138,It's just looking at the food on a plate in front of me that's driving me crazy...
33139,"Moment I step away from the table to go to the men's room or something, I'm back to myself... that is until I get back to the table."
33140,"But here's the funny thing: I'm not allergic to any foods, and when at home, or on my own, I NEVER feel this way."
33141,"I only feel like this in foreign environments (restaurants, banquets, etc.)."
33142,"I could even bring home-made food to a banquet, yet still be unable to eat it."
33143,Where this stems from is a bit of a catch 22.
33144,I know that I have anxiety around food.
33145,I'm worried about getting sick during dinner.
33146,"But by worrying about getting sick, I actually do get sick, which is what I was worrying about in the first place!"
33147,It's not like I just can stop worrying.
33148,I can't really help it.
33149,"During this time I'm feeling sick (only during dinner), I see other people finishing up their plates, and I can't seem to finish mine."
33150,"I find that I sweat, sometimes shiver, and all these other funky things, all the while trying to get a piece of chicken down my throat."
33151,"I manage to hide most of it, so no one really suspects anything."
33152,"To give you an analogy, imagine that you just got some terrible news."
33153,"You immediately get that gut-wrenching feeling, lose your entire appetite, and feel horrible."
33154,Now try eating a full course meal with that feeling in a situation where you shouldn't be anywhere close to this nervous!
33155,"To remedy this problem, I've been taking antacids, which help, but only to a certain point."
33156,Maybe I'm not taking enough (I'm very conservative with taking pills/medications).
33157,"Is there any sort of over-the-counter medication that I could use to relax myself, or get rid of my anxiety?"
33158,"If it's a prescription based medicine, who should I talk to to see if it's right for me?"
33159,"This is just a problem that I would really like to address that will greatly improve my life, and I ask you guys for your assistance in helping me solve this."
33160,Thank you very much!!
33161,"TL;DR I get anxiety around food in foreign environments, to the point that I can't eat and it hinders my social interactions because I'm so focused on trying to finish a meal."
33162,At this point I went to a doctor and after trying a bunch of medication the doctor thought that cymbalta was the best medicine.
33163,I finally went to someone to talk about my anxiety and see if the person thought I needed medication.
33164,"Since I've never taken any medication for my anxiety, I want to know how it will affect my thoughts that triggers my anxiety."
33165,That's why I need advice from people who take that medication.
33166,My anxiety felt slightly worse today and I'm not sure if that's from the medication or maybe that I've been alone most of today
33167,I'm just wanting to know your personal experiences and if EMDR has helped you in any way.
33168,Some history: I'm 22 years old and was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder when I was 10 years old.
33169,I have been in and out of therapy for both anxiety and depression.
33170,I have also been on various medications for my anxiety although none of them seemed to help.
33171,"I took myself off my last medication when I was 17 years old and have been handling my anxiety very well since then..up until recently it just feels like I'm just starting to unravel again, so I have gone back to therapy."
33172,My therapist suggested EMDR and briefly explained what it is.
33173,My first EMDR appointment is next Thursday and I'm pretty nervous about it.
33174,I've had runs like this before and have gotten through it with relatively little or no medication.
33175,"Zyprexa seems a little extreme at this point, as I have gotten through runs like this without ANY medication at all."
33176,I'm not on any meds or anything so this period of not worrying anymore in between having constantly been picking apart every small symptom and thought in my mind for the past few months feels a little strange...
33177,"I've been a subscriber to r/Anxiety for some time, now, and I can't even count how many posts I've read that say something to the tune of ""I was fine... then, I smoke a bunch of pot and had another panic attack"" or ""Smoking's been giving me panic attacks... but, obviously, I'm not going to stop smoking"" or ""Can I smoke weed while taking [insert name of medication]""."
33178,I don't know what's come over me- I take my meds as usual (200mg Sertraline/Zoloft for 2 years) and make sure to eat/drink regularly.
33179,"Why am I so anxious even though I'm on meds and ""take care"" of myself?"
33180,That's why I want to stop using the medicine.
33181,"-my nickname once was ""stressful my_name"" ...i don't know why, i just become stressed with the little thing, if i go on a date to meet some girl, at the 1st time i can't even take my coffee cause im trembling so much that my coffee almost flies...sometimes im smoking,trembling, and eating my nails at the same time...
-i have capilar acne and some ""alergies"", i mean, i scratch my legs and arms all the time, i use a medicine to stop it but im good for like 2-3days and then the itch returns, dunno im it's my nervous system but no dermatologist could find what i have
-it takes just one simple case...like...me droping some shit, and getting instantly annoyed or angry...

wtf can i do?"
33182,I have been forgetting to take my meds as of late so that's probably exacerbating the problem.
33183,i posted a posted something recently asking about medication and breathing etc but i really think i need someone to talk to.
33184,I have anxiety medicine and am going to therapy and they only help so much.
33185,This week I'm going to a national research conference for undergraduate research.
33186,"I know this is great for when I apply to graduate school, and I am thankful to be going to the conference, but I am really, really nervous about it...to the point where it's effecting my physical health."
33187,My anxiety has transformed into psychosomatic symptoms.
33188,"I can't eat normal amounts of food (meaning I eat very little), I get tired easily, and I always have a stomach ache."
33189,And this isn't even when I'm presenting.
33190,I still have stomach aches but my voice is a bit shaky during presentations.
33191,"I've had problems with speech anxiety for a long time, no thanks to Catholic grade school, but I have gotten somewhat better."
33192,"I've been just fine with prose and being on stage for plays and what not, but speeches always make me anxious...I just don't get it."
33193,"Anyway, I want to go into research for my long term career but exposure therapy obviously hasn't helped, and I will have to get used to giving presentations."
33194,Should I get anti-anxiety medications?
33195,"If I can I would like to avoid it, so if I could get any advice on how to work on this, I'm open to it."
33196,"Note: I've never been diagnosed with any anxiety disorder, nor have I ever been put on any kind of psychotropic drugs."
33197,"Before medication, I had severe mood swings and sudden irrational anxiety that was interfering with my daily life and relationships."
33198,"So, after starting the meds, I pretty quickly felt a difference."
33199,"Since starting my meds, I've had a baby, something I wasn't sure I'd ever be able to handle before."
33200,I totally transposed my medication with another.
33201,I'm a mid 20's male who has been dealing with anxiety / depression and borderline disorder for many years now.
33202,"Been seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist for some time, and have also seen and been through a douzen or so different medications."
33203,Ive been on my current one the longest as up until now it's been most effective.
33204,Yet the past few weeks the effectiveness has been slowly disappearing.
33205,While my depression is still at bay my anxiety is skyrocketing.
33206,Daily anxiety attacks and panic attacks aren't uncommon at all in the last few weeks where as for many months i went almost symptom free.
33207,And they're much more intense then before.
33208,Is this common for meds to suddenly stop working after a while?
33209,Benzos are all that calm me yet my addictive personality has already clashed with them a few times before hesitant to ask for more.
33210,Aaaand cue number 2 for today.
33211,And i wish i meant poop.
33212,Should I try to get some medication?
33213,"The problem is that I need to be able to drive and not freak out, but I think most meds that calm you down also cause sleepiness and things like that, which might hinder driving."
33214,Are there any meds like this?
33215,Are there any meds that relieve the anxiety but still keep me in a clear state of mind so I'm able to drive?
33216,"So I've been on meds for anxiety for a few months now, after a series of panic attacks last semester."
33217,"So I moved to New Orleans 7 months ago, after having been off meds for about 5 months, (thus making it a year med free.)"
33218,"I've been coping with anxiety for the past couple of months, and I've tried everything, from meds to therapy to meditation, to make it less bad."
33219,And I don't take any meds at all.
33220,"My own mom refuses therapy and medication, and turns to my dad instead, and insists it won't help me."
33221,"As the title says, I like a girl, but when I really feel affection, instead of butterflys I feel terrible physically and emotionally, almost sickly, and my mind just feels like shit too....I really wish I could provide you all with a better description, but I lack the vocabulary for symptoms."
33222,I'm very afraid that the medications i've been on and gotten off of before have permanently damaged me.
33223,I'm basically going to go with self-help and meds.
33224,"Hey guys,

I originally posted about my anxiety [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lreeq/after_anxiety_rendered_me_unable_to_function/) and got some good advice and words of encouragement (thank you mystery person for the pm's!)"
33225,"I am on 2mg of clonozepam per day (the psych said she's going to bump me to 3 doses of 1mg per day in October), and 50mg of Zoloft at dinner (vivid dreams, anyone?)."
33226,"**Early progress (about 2 weeks):**  I have had 0 panic attacks (oh my god, the difference that has made), and am generally able to function as I was prior to this outbreak."
33227,The shrink has given me the hypothesis that all of my anxiety problems (agoraphobia and panic disorder being the worst of them) are probably deep-rooted in my PTSD that I've lived with my whole life.
33228,"She explained that my emotional disconnection with myself, learned as a defense mechanism growing up, has caused a blockage of what need to be emotional recognitions and resolutions in my current life."
33229,"It's like a sociopath (I'm not a sociopath), except I care deeply about the emotions of others, but am completely dis-jointed from my own."
33230,We are working very hard to figure out what these internal conflicts are so that we may gently coax them into resolution.
33231,"**Cool side note:**  Some of my emotional problems have been coming to me in what have been a series of extremely vivid dreams, sometimes of past events."
33232,"When I wake up, I actually feel the emotions of those events (like I had just lived them), and can come to terms with them as I need to."
33233,"An Example:  Two of my good friends graduated and I didn't feel bad or anything, but after a dream of having a beer with them like I used to, I woke up with the actual realization of how much I miss them in their absence, and have since made emotional amends to it."
33234,"Long post, so I apologize."
33235,"Here's the TLDR

**TL;DR**  My medications have sedated me to a normal functioning person again, and I am beginning to actually learn to emotionally take care of myself."
33236,Mental illness is a real illness.
33237,Take care of those you love and are close to you.
33238,Love your life; life is a beautiful thing.
33239,Anxiety is real.
33240,"It is scary, and it's favorite place in your life is the driver's seat."
33241,"Never be afraid to seek help (you're gonna be scared, but just seek help anyway."
33242,Best decision of my life)
33243,I'm not on any medication nor have i ever been diagnosed.
33244,"The thing is, after realizing I didn't take my medication, I noticed I haven't had any withdrawal symptoms at all."
33245,I am able to adjust my posture because the medication relaxes my muscles.
33246,"Called my PCP today, because in an HMO network, you can't just choose your doctor, and I wasn't satisfied with the outcome of yesterday's visit."
33247,"I've decided I'm not going back, but I do need some assistance with my anxiety, of course, but I feel, at this point, like nobody can, or wants to, help me."
33248,"The receptionist and nurse, bless them, have been so extremely helpful throughout this entire ordeal."
33249,"They've taken all my calls when I told them my referrals weren't going to work, they set up an appointment with the psychiatrist when I couldn't get through, and today when I called, they booked me an appointment with my PCP this afternoon."
33250,"When I went in they even gave me the name of an office that was affordable, just in case none of the offices in my network worked out."
33251,"I went in and told the receptionist and nurse about the whole ordeal yesterday, since they've sort of walked through it with me, and they were completely shocked."
33252,"When I got to the PCP, though, she couldn't understand why I didn't want to be partially hospitalized, and wanted to know what she was supposed to do."
33253,"I told her that I just wanted to know if there was anything she could do for me because I couldn't afford the time, the financial commitment, any of it."
33254,She offered yet another referral.
33255,"I've already sunk $100 into this, and all I've gotten out of it is multiple referrals, increasing anxiety, and a feeling that I'm going nowhere."
33256,"She asked me what has helped before, and I told her I hated to go through the list, but I listed all the coping mechanisms alongside multiple medications (SSRI, SNRI, klonopin, and ativan)."
33257,"All she heard was klonopin and ativan and she said ""you know those are addictive. """
33258,No shit!
33259,But they fucking helped!
33260,I haven't taken them in years.
33261,"It's not like I've never tried anything else, it's not like I don't undergo extensive treatment, it's not like I take it on a daily basis."
33262,"FFS, this was why I was afraid in the first place."
33263,"I started crying, again, took the damn referral, and left, defeated, again."
33264,"Tomorrow, I call to set up yet another appointment."
33265,"I'm freaking out, and it won't be for at least another week or so."
33266,"In the meantime, I have an out of town conference for work, and I'm mentally completely unprepared."
33267,"I was hoping to have everything sorted by now, but it didn't work out that way....."
33268,"I thought it was depression, but I'm on super medicine now and still don't want to bathe."
33269,I got a referral to a psychologist but it's not covered by my provincial health care insurance so I didn't follow through - didn't want to waste my money on seeing someone if they couldn't prescribe meds or waste my time if they didn't know anything about anxiety disorders.
33270,I am usually very anti-meds but I was so desperate to feel better that I took them with pleasure.
33271,All of this can be attributed to my body adjusting to the new meds.
33272,Sometimes on the way home from work I'll get nauseous if i think about taking my meds when i get home.
33273,"Or if i start to think ""oh i should go get my meds to help"" ill get really nauseous."
33274,"and then when i actually go to take my meds i get extremely nauseous, especially when i put the pills in my mouth, and will sometimes even throw up while trying to take my meds."
33275,He recommended that I start taking anxiety medication daily and an SSRI.
33276,"Once I told my friends/loved ones that I had finally been prescribed medication, most of them flipped."
33277,"When I started taking my anxiety medication, when I felt anxious, I was able to calmly tell myself, ""It's no big deal, we'll figure it out, calm down."""
33278,I've been out of my meds for 3 weeks because I'm in the middle of finding a new doctor.
33279,TL;DR (don't blame you): I'm almost 25 and finally started taking anxiety medication 2 months ago.
33280,"Anyways, my point... 

Due to some recent events, I'm wondering if I should seek some sort of medication."
33281,"To be honest, the thought of medication starts to make me anxious."
33282,Are any of you strongly for or against medication?
33283,So I get to continue suffering and having paralyzing panic attacks every day because she's lazy and the time I spent waiting could have been spent getting meds but oops too bad.
33284,There seems to be a lot of negative associations that come with taking medication for anxiety/depression and it got me thinking how much this really impact our society and culture.
33285,I often hear on this sub and others about how adverse people are to resorting to meds and that they see it transforming them into an emotionless zombie.
33286,I also hear the notion that using meds is equivalaent to giving up on improving yourself through hard work and therapy.
33287,"While I obviously can't speak for everyone who has taken medication and the experiences they've had, I think this sort of negative stigma prevents people from actually exploring a path that could potentially help them dramatically."
33288,I think more education needs to given on how medication plays a role in getting better with these mental conditions.
33289,Sometimes medication may be the only way to help tame the beast so that you can have the chance to put in the hard work necessary to make lasting changes in your life.
33290,"Now of course, I don't want to sound like medication should be the first resort to treating any spectrum of anxiety and depression."
33291,I have been working nonstop on becoming more and more functional and recently gone from as needed medication to a less habit forming all day medication and then the previous supplimental medication as needed on top of that.
33292,Has anyone else had eye issues like this or had a new symptom manifest just as you manage to suppress the others through medication?
33293,I talked to a counselor who recommended medication.
33294,Does anyone have recommendations as to meds?
33295,I'm a university student and I feel as though the medication impacts my learning/test performance.
33296,"Hi everyone, although I have a lot I'd like to say, I'll try to keep this as short as possible."
33297,"I grew up (probably like most of you) as a shy, introverted, and somewhat-awkward child."
33298,"I got good grades, was in gifted programs, won awards for science fairs and various projects, never once got in trouble with anyone and was constantly told how I would go places."
33299,"I always had strange phobias and fears, and after years of having weird stomach aches, racing thoughts, and et cetera, when I was in my Junior year of high school I was diagnosed with having General Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder."
33300,"A few medications kept me going through school, until midway through my senior year I thought to myself 'I can't do this anymore'."
33301,School was complete nonsense for me at that point.
33302,"My grades had slipped so bad that I lost all hope of a scholarship, and might have even failed the 12th grade."
33303,"So I made the decision to sign myself out of the school system, and instead I got my GED through the local college in a month's time."
33304,During the next year I really didn't do anything except tell myself that I would apply to college as soon as I could.
33305,"The local community college, as something to start off with and prep myself for an actual University."
33306,"Semester after semester passed, and I kept telling myself that I'll apply next semester, or next summer, or winter, or next year."
33307,"In the midst of all this I worked at a chain grocery store as a cashier, trying to save up as much money as I possibly could but not really going anywhere with it."
33308,"The little that I did save up would either have to be put toward an unexpected bill, or our hours would get cut at work so it would dip back down."
33309,I pretty much had an average balance of 200 or so dollars at a time in my account.
33310,Around two or so years ago I had a massive string of panic attacks each time I would go into work.
33311,"I called out sick a few days (which our new manager was furious about, despite previous knowledge of my condition)."
33312,One day I had to leave early because my heart rate was going crazy and I felt like I just needed to leave ASAP.
33313,"My manager told me if I left he didn't want me back as an employee, so I told him that's fine and walked out the door."
33314,That was the only 'real' job that I have ever had.
33315,"So, here I am now."
33316,"I'm almost 22, and currently am 'working' as a self-employed freelance web designer and computer repairman."
33317,"I got into web design after I left the grocery store because I thought there was money in it, and it was something that I could learn about/do in the safety of my own home."
33318,"Now I've come to realize that this is something that I'm really miserable doing, and that doesn't even get me that much money in the first place."
33319,"I'm currently averaging around 400/month, and am constantly searching reddit and various other sites to find work."
33320,"My anxiety is a bit better, panic attacks are few and far between, and I'm not on any steady medication (I do have a prescription of xanax that's for as-needed use only)."
33321,"However, I just feel so absolutely stuck and useless."
33322,"I have tons of useful (I think) talents, and a passion to learn, but I have nothing to use these towards."
33323,"I can program in a variety of languages, I can build front and back ends of websites, I've developed several site projects on my own time."
33324,Even though the one that I'm currently working on I feel will fail just like all the others I've tried and be a waste of time as well.
33325,"I had dreams of becoming a scientist, or an engineer, or a physicist, but with no money, and no education I really don't see that becoming a reality anytime soon."
33326,"I used to have a good amount of friends that I would constantly hang out with, and no I rarely see anyone at all."
33327,"The last two close friends that I started doing a large amount of drugs constantly, and wouldn't want to hang out unless I tried it with them, and I don't want to so I never see them."
33328,"I used to be so good at work, and at school."
33329,"When someone told me what they needed to get done and when, I was your man."
33330,"I could learn anything necessary, and would pour effort into it."
33331,"Now that I'm 'grown up' and have literally thousands of options of what to do next, I'm completely paralyzed."
33332,"I take steps down one road or the other, trying to find out which option would be best for me, which would help me reach the goals that I want to reach the quickest and easiest."
33333,"I just want to be happy, to be comfortable."
33334,"I don't want to have to worry about not having any money to do anything anymore, I want to have a stable job, I want to travel, to live, and to experience things."
33335,"I want to control my anxiety and get rid of my constant negative thoughts that whatever I'm doing at the present time is not good enough, and will just end up being a waste of time that could be spent doing something better."
33336,"I have tried, started, and stopped so many hobbies, projects, sites, 'businesses', etc, it's ridiculous."
33337,"Most people keep telling me that I need to apply for a job instead of trying to do something on my own, but I'm terrified that if I start another job I'll just have to quit from anxiety, like school and the jobs before."
33338,I have been thinking of volunteering though.
33339,tl;dr I just want direction.
33340,"From friends, family, I'm tired of being cast adrift on my own merits."
33341,"I just wish for some sort of guidance, for someone to tell me 'You need to do this, this, and this if you want to get started on becoming a scientist.'"
33342,"Sitting in front of my computer day in and day out has helped me relax and helped me to forget about the problems I normally have to face, but I would rather start being successful and contributing something to mankind."
33343,Anyone else with me?
33344,"Whether it be medication, therapy, or whatever."
33345,"I don't know what types of medication there are, how they can or can't help me, but I'm more than willing to try."
33346,"I am on medication for Bipolar Disorder [type 1, rapid-cycling], I was diagnosed a couple of years ago."
33347,"I just started a new medication a couple of weeks ago, so far things are going fine with that."
33348,"Also, it makes me feel like it doesn't matter what medication I take or how much meditation I do, if my brain decides it's going to throw a wobbler then that is it."
33349,"As it is now, I have been weighing the options to take meds for my ""disorders""."
33350,I started getting panic attacks after my daughter was born in 2005 and ever since then I've been a homebody.
33351,I get them out of nowhere but they're also triggered by certain things (specifically being out in the country away from emergency help and new foods/medications that may cause anaphylaxis) and I also have generalized anxiety disorder.
33352,I've pretty much been a homebody ever since and seldom go anywhere or do anything.
33353,"Over the years and thanks to Paxil and Ativan, I've gotten better at controlling my panic attacks, but I'm still scared to travel anywhere outside of ""civilization"" if you will, and the farthest I've been is to the state capital which is about an hour straight-shot from the interstate."
33354,"My problem is that my best friend (who moved to Los Angeles about 5 years ago) and his partner offered to fly me out, all expenses paid, to visit for a week."
33355,"They want to take me around Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Monica since I've been under a lot of stress lately and could use a vacation."
33356,"My daughter would be in good hands with her dad so I'm not worried about that, but I've never been on an airplane before and I'm worried about my anxiety kicking up while I'm on the plane or when I'm with my friends and exploring the West Coast."
33357,"I keep trying to calm myself down and tell myself planes are safe but the ""What If"" questions always start, like ""what if the plane crashes while we're flying?"""
33358,"""what if the fuel tank catches on fire?"""
33359,"""what if there's a mid-air collision?"""
33360,"""what if we have a car wreck in Los Angeles?"""
33361,"""what if something happens while we're driving around between the cities?"""
33362,"""what if I have a heart attack or stroke while I'm on the plane?"""
33363,I refuse to let my anxiety stop me since this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me.
33364,I live in the middle of Ohio and I'm poor.. the chances of me getting another all-expense paid free vacation to Los Angeles is slim to none lol.
33365,I'm just really worried about my anxiety making me freak out while I'm trying to get on the plane.
33366,Do you have any advice?
33367,"I'm not currently on any meds, and am an 18 yr old female, if that helps any."
33368,And which medication will be useful in treating these symptoms?
33369,"Well she is over 50 and doing totally fine, despite high blood pressure, which she gets medicine for."
33370,"I feel sick all day, my stomach is killing me, I'm itchy all over, I'm having trouble falling asleep 9with and without meds),having bad sleep, and having hard time waking up."
33371,"Now I'm meds free, and I don't have anything to treat my GAD."
33372,I do have a question though: what are things I can do to help my anxiety other than seeing a therapist and medication?
33373,"As a result, I now have to change the medication that I was FINALLY getting used to (after 3 months) because of tachycardia."
33374,"I feel like the anxiety is out of my control, even when it's tempered by my meds, and the only reason *I'm* not out of control is because I don't have anything to obsess about at the moment."
33375,after years of being without medication I'm coming to realize that my anger issues are causing alot of issues in my love life.
33376,But I have a fear that the meds have stopped working for some reason.
33377,"I figure that isn't the case, but I'd love it if someone could chime in and either:

A) reassure me

or 

B) Explain why my meds would stop working overnight"
33378,I am on no medication.
33379,"I'm on medication (celexa daily &amp; klonopin when needed), and the combination of the meds and therapy has me feeling great."
33380,"After many months of therapy and medication and searching desperately for the quick fix, I came across this site last week (http://anxietynomore.co.uk/), created by a man named Paul David, and read his book called At Last a Life."
33381,We're still working to see what meds will be best for me.
33382,I've always been one to have detailed and strange dreams but since being on my meds they have increased in number (I feel like I remember all my dreams from the entire night when I wake up the next morning) and they are so freaking strange.
33383,I'm not sure if I need to re-evaluate my medication with my doctor.
33384,I know everyone responds differently to medication.
33385,But I'm wondering if anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medication is supposed to be a very obvious/significant help or if it's just supposed to keep you functioning at a basic level.
33386,First time discussing this with anyone other than my SO and a mental health provider.
33387,"Since high school, I've battled on and off with anxiety and DP/DR."
33388,"Like most of you, I didn't know what it was at first, it just felt like my consciousness was pulled back a bit, and that I couldn't connect with myself or the world."
33389,"I worried about never reconnecting and ""pulling away"" permanently."
33390,"I worked with mental health providers for years, and they provided me with a set of medications that for the most part helped - prozac, seroquel, and klonopin."
33391,"After a bout with having no medication left (no insurance, no money to get prescriptions), and going through a pretty awful withdrawal, I decided I wanted to wean off the meds with the help of a doctor."
33392,"Around half a year ago, I was successful, and was relatively symptom free."
33393,It has since come back in a big way.
33394,"I have an appointment set in a week, but wanted to share my experience as a coping technique and see if anyone has been in a similar place."
33395,"A few weeks ago, I had some minor anxiety and perceptual shift, which I was able to work through."
33396,"I had an appointment with my GP, and he checked my thyroid levels (normal)."
33397,"About one week ago, it got really intense where I ended up taking some of the old klonopin I had left, but didn't get much relief."
33398,The feelings I'm experiencing now are all related to accidental existential introspection.
33399,"It's not something I looked into on purpose, but for whatever brain chemistry reason I started thinking about non-existence and the nature of reality."
33400,"My SO's grandfather then passed away, which cause me to rationalize myself as a finite conscious being, furthering these thoughts of non-existence and separating further from any sort of concrete reality."
33401,"The thoughts become so intense and intrusive it feels like I will ""snap"" and lose my tether to the world."
33402,The DP/DR perceptual shift occurs during these thoughts and is accompanied with anxiety.
33403,"It almost feels as if I'll ""think myself out of existence"" or lose touch with myself/existence."
33404,"Logically, I know I've been here before, and my SO has been a huge help in trying to give me grounding exercises."
33405,"But logic doesn't play a huge part when it feels like everything is on the verge of shattering, so I'm looking for additional resources/similar experiences."
33406,"Rambling, I know, but sometimes even discussing this is off-putting."
33407,"This used to happen a year and a half ago, before I went on my meds."
33408,"I've been on meds since last summer, I did CBT, meditation, doctor visits etc - but I just felt like posting to say I was able to get back to my usual self and take on an adventure much larger than the one that brought my anxiety issues forward in the first place."
33409,"My medications definitely are helping with my depression, but my anxiety levels haven't decreased as much as I'd like."
33410,"I started back at college again last week, and while things have been pretty great, I still have these pangs of agoraphobia and panic, especially when it's just about time for me to go to my classes."
33411,"I've been able to get to all of them so far, but I'm afraid that once things get really busy, I'll fall back into my pattern of never leaving my room even for food and class because everything's just so overstimulating."
33412,I'm looking for some specific methods of keeping myself chill.
33413,"I know ""breathing exercises"" are supposed to work, but what exactly does one do to do that?"
33414,"I was put on a month's trial of medication and told to wait a month (for best results) to set up an appointment with a counselor because the Psych wanted to see how this specific medication affected me, especially it being my first time on medication."
33415,I'm embarrassed to say that I'm going to go back next week to talk about how the medication has affected me so far and know next to little about what afflicts me.
33416,If it happens again I'll heavily consider trying meds again
33417,"Even if it is, I just want to have some therapist of meds."
33418,I feel like I need medication because nothing makes me feel better and my condition severely impacts my quality of life.
33419,I've never tried any medication but I think it will be necessary to make this succeed.
33420,Any medicine tips?
33421,"ive been on 150mg effexor for a few years, whilst my anxiety has went up and down i do not think  it has worked particulary well and my counseller suggest i ask my GP to switch to meds more suiting my condition and with more sedative effects such as lexapro???"
33422,I've always had my general practitioner prescribe my medication.
33423,"So I was thinking, if I asked my doc for this medication, would they prescribe it?"
33424,"After being off it for two years, I've started experiencing GAD symptoms again and today started a new medication (Sertraline) for it."
33425,I was so proud of myself to get off the Effexor and live without the medication looming over my head.
33426,"Now my wife and I are trying to get pregnant and the meds have killed my sex drive and when I try, I don't feel anything (I'm a guy)."
33427,"Is there any everyday meds or should I go see a Docter so I can get a per-scripted pill to end this, because Ive talked to people about it and nothing has worked."
33428,Please someone help me (meds wise) Or if you got any tips that would be great too
33429,I'm currently taking meds (long term) for anxiety and ADHD.
33430,More info: Specific meds are Prozac and Concerta.
33431,Do any of you wear bracelets for your meds?
33432,Hey guys.
33433,I'm a 23 y/o female from Canada.
33434,I've been reading posts on this subreddit for a while and decided it was time to ask for some advice.
33435,"I started having panic attacks about 4 years ago, and the first time I had one, like many people, I thought I was having a heart attack."
33436,I felt like I was going to die.
33437,"After being calmed down and was explained what happened, I was told that both of my parents experience attacks as well and mental illness has been in our family for generations."
33438,"The things is... After I started experiencing attacks (and social anxiety that seemed to tag along..) I started to notice that I became extremely sensitive to any medication or substance, even food."
33439,"It started off with caffeine, which I hear is common for people with anxiety, but then it started happening with foods with high sugar, and any sort of medication."
33440,"I can't take cold meds, I have even felt high off of antibiotics."
33441,It's like any substance can change my mental state.
33442,"It has gotten so bad that I get worried about going out to eat with other people, and at family gatherings."
33443,"I pretty much refuse any medications because I'm scared they will trigger anxiety or make me feel ""high""."
33444,"I'm fortunate that I have been able to live a pretty normal life (I graduated college, and I have a decent job where I interact and feel normal most of the time) but sometimes it feels like this anxiety and sensitivity is ruining aspects of my life."
33445,I guess I just wanted to see if anyone else has had this problem and how they have coped with it?
33446,"I've already taken my anxiety meds twice today, and I'm still not doing ok."
33447,"It's bad enough to the point where on days I know I'll have intercourse, I skip my medication."
33448,"I've considered stopping medication altogether, as well."
33449,I've been on anxiety medication for 6 years and was on 10mg of Lexapro.
33450,Is it common for a medication withdrawal to stop and then come back with a vengeance?
33451,I was on meds for a while but I don't believe in it.
33452,"I've had medication induced sleep hallucinations in the past, but this is really weird and I've never had my mind play tricks on me like this."
33453,What can I do to smooth out these symptoms when I'm not under medication?
33454,"I was on medication and missed almost all of my teen years due to anxiety, but I am not currently on anything consistently."
33455,"Even when I was a teenager and on meds, I couldn't go to school on a consistent basis because I would get overwhelmed and leave or just stay home (where I usually cried out of frustration, like I am now), so having a job was out of the question."
33456,Also I don't have medication as an option as I am pregnant.
33457,"Today though, I got on a plane to Denver and I've spent a full day in the city without taking any medication."
33458,"I don't believe I would be moved to read about others' anxiety if I wasn't seeking help - I think I've been crying out for help for over a year now, and my meds haven't changed, and I reach out to my supports/friends, and they don't help me."
33459,"I was on prozac and then had ativan as my ""rescue"" meds for panic attacks."
33460,"Well back in like, March, I decided I didn't need the meds, stopped taking my prozac(I still used the ativan when I needed it, but I didn't need it really at all, despite going through a really rough time), skipped my appointment with my psychiatrist, etc."
33461,"Especially the anxiety, but since I kinda skipped out on my meds and appointments, I'm freaking out about making a new appointment and I already have bad phone anxiety without thinking about how I broke the rules and such...."
33462,"TL;DR thought I could handle the world without meds, turns out I can't, too anxious to fix the problem."
33463,"this causes me to do many things i often turn over and over and over in my head when im trying to sleep
- I've seen about this- 2 therapists (one currently), 2 psychiatrists, 1 natropath, 1 Bio-meridian doctor (high-tech chinese medicine, they told me my biological pathways were inflamed, and that my body was so malnourished, it started to eat itself- this was when i really wasnt eating ANYTHING at all)
-My entire family has struggled with it at some point or another, my brother is a daily smoker for the same reason, my dad has told me a great deal about his experience, and it still affects him daily, my sister has attempted suicide because of it, and many of my mom's family members are affected by it."
33464,"and not having come up with a good conclusion, i am tempted to turn to medicine, which is something i don't believe in."
33465,I've been struggling with a severe anxiety disorder for almost fourteen years now (over half my life) and in that time have been prescribed to practically every anti-anxiety medicine that's been out since I've had the issue.
33466,"With or without self-medication, because at this point I'm hopeless."
33467,"Please, I've done everything... cbt/dbt/deep trance-state/medication/hospitlization/etc."
33468,"I see a specialist, I've seen 6+ counsellors and I take medication for these things."
33469,"When i try taking my prescribed medicine, I end up having a near panic attack so i just stopped trying."
33470,"Hello all, just ""discovered"" reddit yesterday and decided to do this just because."
33471,I'm turning 25 in a little over a day and honestly I'm not looking forward to it.
33472,"My life isn't satisfying at all to me, and really I feel like I only have myself to blame."
33473,I was diagnosed with anxiety in my senior year of highschool along with major depression.
33474,"All of the way to K11 I had been a top A student, easily top 10% of my class."
33475,That suddenly changed before my senior year.
33476,"I couldn't get work done, I didn't show up to class, I was failing."
33477,"I got through mainly because of my parents, who basically helped write essays and drove me, a 17 year old with his own car, to school to make sure I was getting there."
33478,"I passed and graduated, and I thought the worst was over, but I was wrong."
33479,"I went to college the next spring to Carnegie Mellon, and promptly failed out in November."
33480,"Since then I have been through programs, several college attempts, community college attempts, Outward Bound expeditions, KNOLS expeditions, and lots of therapy."
33481,Nothing has worked.
33482,"I've considered joining the army, but an unfortunate accident involving a cliff when I was on a manic high from a new prescription has disabled my left elbow from full extension or rotation."
33483,"I've been to programs, but so many don't feel like they fit me, or are too involved with students that are either drug addicts or too crazy for me to relate with."
33484,"I've tried medications, but even sticking with them for over a year doesn't really seem to benefit me."
33485,"I've tried working, but I get so stressed out about job interviews that I'm not how to start."
33486,I'm just tired really.
33487,"I know this is a bitch fest, but I just wanted to unload somewhere, and this thread does feel like the place to do it."
33488,I'm wondering if the medication could play a role in it.
33489,Hello.
33490,"This is my first time here posting, but at times it feels so bad that I felt I needed to reach out."
33491,I will try to keep it short.
33492,Just some background.
33493,I am 28 years old.
33494,I have felt anxious for a very long time.
33495,I have also felt depressed for most of my adult life.
33496,"People tend to perceive me as morbidly pessimistic, a drama queen, they suggest I enjoy being sad, that I derive some kind of a kick out of it and that it's all about my refusal to reject this anxiety and unhappiness."
33497,This simply isn't true.
33498,I have been to doctors many times.
33499,"Most of the time these are psychologists and psychotherapists who are covered by health insurance, so they are not particularly motivated and probably deal with drug addicts and alcoholics a lot."
33500,What it comes down to is - I've never felt any of them take me seriously at all.
33501,"I think it's about something I come off as - very analytical, sort of as if I was just a bit worried, as if their advice to just take a walk and get fresh air and eat a balanced diet will make a difference."
33502,"IT DOESN'T, I've tried it all, honestly."
33503,"I don't yearn for a diagnose, but I wish I got the feeling my problem was dealt with."
33504,"I've taken a few medications over a course of time, but nothing very strong."
33505,"When I developed difficulty breathing (pressure in my chest), I was prescribed valium, which helped to cope with everyday life, but hardly did anything in the long run."
33506,"The last I used was cipralex, went off it in spring because of pregnancy."
33507,"Yes, I am also pregnant now."
33508,This means I cannot numb my natural anxiety with any of the usual means and sometimes fairly often it gets the best of me.
33509,I also recently lost my job and have very little income.
33510,"My relationships with people are very difficult, and waning."
33511,"Just yesterday I was told people can't handle cooperation with me or even just being around me because I am always sad and messed up, as if they had to make enormous efforts to protect and repair me."
33512,"I feel let down by all, I have very severe issues with trust and betrayal."
33513,I have been cheated on.
33514,"I had an agreement that I could continue working until I delivered the baby, but was let down in that, too."
33515,I try not to accuse anyone but I feel a grudge.
33516,These days the anxiety has gone so bad it sometimes peaks with hysteria that I cannot control.
33517,"I have a mild history with self-harm and abuse of sleeping pills/tranquillisers, but clearly I do not do it now, because as bad as it gets, I fear for pregnancy and don't see suicide as an option anymore."
33518,But it doesn't mean the pain is any less.
33519,"It has got so bad that I am completely unable to perform in some tasks, I keep passing deadlines which only adds to my anxiety, of course."
33520,"Things that are not difficult per se, but need more confidence."
33521,"I keep putting them off, because I feel nothing I do is good enough, that I am unable to perform well."
33522,"My mind is constantly too foggy to focus on anything, sometimes it gets so bad that my speech is blurred and I am unable to finish a coherent sentence."
33523,The advice I need is - how to address this problem?
33524,How can I get a doctor to actually look at my problem and make my life better?
33525,"Does anyone have experience with medications during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding, or should I just try and put up with it for now and return to the problem in a few years?"
33526,I am terrified of actually having the child in the condition I am in now.
33527,"Also, having lost the job, I have no money for some sketchy therapy that may or may not work."
33528,"I am really hoping for anything, here."
33529,Anything that would ease this pain.
33530,"At the same time, I feel I have no hope for anything anymore."
33531,I cannot picture a future.
33532,"No tl;dr, because the problem is simple - I am pregnant and my anxiety is getting worse, I didn't have any good ways to deal with it before, but I cannot use even the bad ones now."
33533,"I can barely keep a thought in my head, even with ADHD medication (Concerta 45mg) and Xanax 20mg, for anxiety."
33534,"Hey everyone, throwaway here because some of my friends know about my reddit account

I am a 25 year old grad student."
33535,"I’ve been prescribed Xanax for panic attacks before (3 mg), but never really had the need to use them until last year when I started having sever anxiety after a particularly rough patch in my life."
33536,"During this period I also had depression and OCD, for which I didn’t get help for the longest time and mostly tried to self medicate with xanax and alcohol."
33537,I am ashamed to admit that but at the time I didn’t want to see a psych.
33538,And for the longest time this combo worked until I started having problems with memory and my interactions with others in general.
33539,"I mostly took xanax when in a position where I couldn’t have a drink to ease my anxiety, such as before going to class or driving."
33540,"In retrospect I feel so dumb to admit this, but I just never have experienced such unbearable anxiety before so that I didn’t know what to do."
33541,"During this time a lot of my friends and especially my roommate, kept telling me that I was acting different than usual and was kind of an asshole to not put it so politely."
33542,Apparently I got into a fight with one of my closest friends over something very trivial (I accused him of stealing my cologne.
33543,Wtf) I don’t remember this at all.
33544,"One time my roommate told me that I was chugging down alcohol in the middle of the day and then started yelling at her, only to try to make out with her."
33545,These were the two major ones but also a lot of other things where they were annoyed by me.
33546,I felt like they were messing with me at the time because I just wouldn’t remember these things.
33547,"So I still kept taking them, bc if I didn’t my OCD and the resulting anxiety would hit panic-attack levels."
33548,But that changed this past summer when I got arrested after a flight.
33549,Before this flight I took a xanax for my fear of flying.
33550,"I have patchy memory but I remember asking the person sitting next to me on the plane to move, and then deliberately stepping on his shoes and being really angry."
33551,I don’t remember engaging in any sort of fight.
33552,But apparently I was escorted to a different seat and when I landed they detained me.
33553,Thankfully the guy dropped the charges.
33554,After that I threw away the pills because I was genuinely scared.
33555,It’s one thing where a friend thinks you are an asshole and another if you get in trouble with the law.
33556,"I also started seeing a therapist by that time and I was responding better to therapy and medications (Wellbutrin)

Sorry if my post is getting too verbose."
33557,I am just curious if anyone else experienced such problems with xanax or any other benzodiazepine in general.
33558,"I am gonna see my therapist soon bc Ive been off my meds and my anxiety is getting  worse again, but I don’t want to be prescribed xanax anymore after my experiences last year."
33559,I googled a lot about these adverse effects and apparently it could be something called a “paradoxical reaction”.
33560,Has anyone experienced this?
33561,Would this keep happening to me if I took a different type of benzo other than xanax?
33562,"I just hate having swiss cheese memory and doing stupid things, but I also feel like I need them to control my anxiety."
33563,Thanks!
33564,"(BTW, I'm seeing a therapist and on medication."
33565,"Clearly things are worse lately, since I can't get meds until close to the end of the week."
33566,"For those of you not on meds, how the hell do you handle this??"
33567,"I'm clearly not functional AT ALL without my meds, but I need to try and work through the next couple of days."
33568,She hates the doctors and obviously wouldn't let me on medication unless it was really bad.
33569,"I lost my health insurance, so I've been off meds for about two months now."
33570,"Will I be taking the mind numbing medication forever or, one day, will I be that awesome kick ass spunky kid I was only a few years ago without any klonopin, or celexa, or atarax, or trazadone?"
33571,"I was in therapy and on meds (most you could name) for most of my teens, but gave them up when they weren't helping at around 18."
33572,"This summer at 22, being unable to go to school or get a job, and after another in a long line of family outings I ruined, I finally decided to try medicine again, because I had been at least a little better before."
33573,"He gave me blood pressure medicine as a rescue, to lower my heart rate to make me not panic, but it has little to no effect."
33574,I'm losing my mind.
33575,I don't have a good sleep schedule and its messing with me bad.
33576,I keep going to bed at around 9am every morning and wake up at around 5pm.
33577,"I hate it, i don't understand because just last month i had a somewhat normal sleep schedule, going to bed at 2am and waking up at 9am."
33578,My psychiatrist has prescribed me 2 different sleep medications but i stopped taking each one after one try.
33579,The problem was that i would feel the sedation of the sleep medication and it would send me into a panic attack.
33580,I don't know what to do.
33581,Do any of you guys have any advice on how to control your sleep schedule?
33582,thank you all in advance.
33583,I struggle enough with just taking my meds everyday and remembering to eat and shower.
33584,The thought of not having my meds to control my anxiety is enough I'd probably throw myself off a bridge before trying to go back to controlling my anxiety without them.
33585,"I realize most people need some form of medicine at one point or another in their life just to make it day to day, but I still feel like such a failure not being able to just breathe normally without some pill to keep me relaxed enough not to immediately hyperventilate and have a complete meltdown."
33586,My anxiety began in December of 2013.
33587,At that point I realized I was anxious and decided to go see my primary physician.
33588,She decided that I likely had Generalized Anxiety Disorder.
33589,"To assist this issue, she prescribed me Venlafaxine(Effexor) and Lorazepam."
33590,Few weeks later I returned with the same issues and felt no impact from the medicine.
33591,I tried taking 3-4mg of Lorazepam at a time and it did not even dent my panic or anxiety.
33592,At this time she sent me to a psychiatrist.
33593,"The Psychiatrist appointments began January of 2014, up until August of 2014."
33594,"During this time period I tried:

Seroquel
Xanax
Klonepin
Prozac
Risperidone 
Trazodone
Lithium
Lamotrigine 
Escitalopram

Therapy with a therapist who spent three sessions talking about his methods, not actually assisting me with anything."
33595,"This is the second time it has happened with two different therapists, and it deters me from trying again."
33596,None of these medicines impacted my anxiety much.
33597,They did however cause severe depression and mild bipolar disorder.
33598,In August I decided to stop taking them because at this point nothing was helping.
33599,After two weeks off of them my depression went away along with the mood cycling.
33600,"Unfortunately, the anxiety stayed."
33601,"Now, I am back at my primary doctor taking 60mg of Buspirone and 1mg tablets of Xanax as frequently as I want."
33602,My issue is this; Anxiety is still very present in my life.
33603,It has cause my to drop out of all in-person classed in college because I couldn't make it through the hour.
33604,"I would become sweaty, my stomach would hurt, and I would have this overwhelming anxious feeling that made me feel as if I would faint."
33605,Yesterday I had an orientation for a volunteer opportunity.
33606,I have no idea how I made it through because within ten minutes of the orientation beginning I was having the same symptoms.
33607,Never before has anxiety interfered with my life.
33608,But now that I can't go to school and am panicking in public I am starting to become worried.
33609,"I have tried so many medicines, (aside from Abilify which is what I was told would work, however insurance won't cover it and I can't afford $956 a month), and at this point I am unsure where to go."
33610,What have you done once you feel a panic attack coming to fix it or calm yourself down?
33611,"I don't have insurance, so I can't get on meds."
33612,"Its not very bad, like I don't take medicine or anything, however its to the point where I decided to tell my parents about how I've been feeling different and now I go to like a therapist or psychologist once every 2 weeks."
33613,"When I'm on my meds, something dies, some sort of emotional depth, which I now realize I've missed, and I procrastinated getting my prescription refilled (which I could have done today), because, well, I get to daydream, and fantasize, and I keep wondering whether my future relationships (owing to a currently somewhat nomadic lifestyle, I'm not in the dating market at the moment) wouldn't be better off, deeper, more meaningful, more emotionally rich, if I went off the Zoloft."
33614,"I believe I've had anxiety for most of my life especially after being thrown across a room by my babysitter / being held back in 1st grade and losing all the friends I had started to make / and being pumped full of Ritalin and Adderal for most of my elementary school years that just gave me such terrible headaches I had to lay on the floor all day after school and then go in the next day dreading the moment we would turn in assignments and I'd have to walk up and say ""I didn't do my homework, I had a headache."""
33615,This happened almost every day for a few years and I feel like the medicines broke the motivation / dopamine part of my brain if that's possible.
33616,I still have regular stress dreams related to not getting my work done.
33617,"I think lately my anxiety is making me depressed and think it's time to get medicated, my wife thinks that's dumb and says I'm just looking for an answer in a pill and I should just get therapy."
33618,I don't know if therapy would do anything for my anxiety as I feel it's just part of who I am.
33619,I'm afraid to just cross the street and get the mail because neighbors might look at me and judge me for whatever reason.
33620,I need an oil change in my car but I'm afraid of the waiting room I guess or the fact that I also need new tires.
33621,I don't know where I wanted to go with this post..
33622,Some questions.
33623,Can SSRIs fix my motivation?
33624,Will they also help my attention span?
33625,Am I addicted to police chase videos because of anxiety?
33626,"sorry for the rambling and irrelevant info, I've just a few minutes ago been reading and realized that my depression might just be anxiety."
33627,"I got off track though, so I eventually got put on a lowish - medium dose of a anti-anxiety/depression medication called Lexapro and it seemed to work."
33628,"About 3 months ago I decided it was time to try to get off the medication I had been taking for the last 3 years every day, so I went to my doctor and he had given me directions on how to come off of the medication, so I did."
33629,"Last month everything came back to me like it did 3 years ago, I tried to fight it but I eventually got back on the meds.. which I have been back on for a month or so now."
33630,Do I ask if I need to up the dosage of my anti-anxiety meds?
33631,"I stayed on my meds up until last year, because I felt that I had things under control."
33632,"After reading about how often anxiety medicine is abused, I'm scared they wont take me seriously or think that I plan on abusing the drugs."
33633,"To be denied medicine after 8 long years and wasting a little over $100 on the appointment, would be beyond devastating for me."
33634,So back to my question: Was it difficult to be prescribed anxiety medicine?
33635,"So, as an attempt to dig myself out of my little hole (along with seeing my pdoc and taking meds),  I've decided to pick up knitting as a hobby, since I can easily do it at home while watching tv (which is what i spend most of my time doing anyways)."
33636,"I want to ask you guys: Is cognitive therapy the way to go, or do I need meds as well?"
33637,"I had tried to commit suicide when i was on depression meds now,  depression is a taboo in my family they all hate that word every single day i am in some subtle way reminded how i am destroying my fucking life."
33638,"I am desperate so I came close to ordering Paxil @10mg from this site:
http://www.safedrugstock.com/medicine-products-anti-depressants-en.html

It claims no prescription is required."
33639,"Really needing to hear some stories about people who are successfully managing their anxiety, either with or without meds."
33640,"Fast forward to 2011, one of the therapist I was seeing at this point suggested that I consider medication, I was insulted."
33641,"Even though I'm not the ""taboo"" type, I felt like she was incompetant to suggest I should try medication."
33642,I'd like to spend the money on meds...but can't.
33643,Have to do that so I can have meds again.
33644,Need meds to feel competent enough to work online.
33645,"The doctors seemed to think I'd made progress, but taking me off of meds 1 month before starting a new school perhaps wasn't the best of ideas."
33646,"I've been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder in the past, but after some treatment I was weaned off of meds and therapy had become not as useful."
33647,So I'm transitioning from lexapro to zoloft to help with anxiety brought on by meds I take for ADD (80 mg strattera and 40mg vyvanse).
33648,"I'm not currently on medication, but I do have one."
33649,I don't want no medicine.
33650,"I tried getting some treatment when I was 18 - the dr. perscribed fluoxetine and citalopram, and I had no positive or negative effect from either, so I discontinued use, the dr. agreed I should just keep managing it on my own rather than with medication."
33651,I'm on anti seizure medication now.
33652,"Everything is going well for her in life, and she has been taking her medicines regularly."
33653,"For seemingly no reason at all, she feels like she's losing it."
33654,It doesn't make any sense.
33655,"She is very organized, and she is doing well in work and school."
33656,She always feels fatigued doesn't want to face the day when she wakes up and feels like crying all the time.
33657,She questions how anyone can understand her if no one can understand herself.
33658,She feels like she lashes out often at those she loves and has trouble remembering what happened in the last month or week.
33659,How can I be there for her even though I live hours away?
33660,What does she need most that I am capable of providing?
33661,"As far as meds go, I have been on Prozac, welbutrin, lexapro, cymbalta, etc."
33662,"the meds made me worse, but also made it so i could go out of the house by myself and go shopping without freaking out and just sitting in the parking lot feeling fear."
33663,3rd day off the meds i heard the voices again.
33664,"told my person who prescribes meds, she freaked, gave me abilify."
33665,"i dont know if i should be taking any anti anxiety meds, i also dont know if i should be taking any meds for ADHD since that increases anxiety."
33666,My wife and I were traveling back home from out-of-state on New Year's Eve.
33667,"We were crossing a bridge and hit a slick spot of ice, causing the car to smash into the concrete barrier, spin around, and almost go over the edge of an embankment."
33668,"We are both physically fine, but the car was totaled."
33669,I have been treating my anxiety for 5+ years now and had it under control.
33670,"Life was going great, school was going well (Grad student), and in general nothing was really wrong."
33671,After this happened I am unable to eat almost anything and have been unable to sleep.
33672,These symptoms haven't been this bad since I have been seeing someone/taking medications for it.
33673,"I have also become fixated on death, not so much worrying about it, but rather that it is starting to invade almost every thought I have."
33674,I plan on making an appointment with my psychiatrist to see if I can up my dosage of Cymbalta from 30 to 60.
33675,"I was on 60 for a while, but it started making me feel lethargic so I went back to 30."
33676,"I don't really know if I am asking for help or anything, but just needed to share my current state of mind with the rest of you."
33677,"I'm hoping this will last, but I really wanted to share because often times medicine is stigmatized."
33678,My parents were a little worried about me starting up medication because they feared dependency and side effects.
33679,"I'm having a much easier time with school and social situations and I'm glad I decided to seek out medication after a not-so-great experience with counselling (there were positives and negatives, but it was totally circumstantial)."
33680,"This is rather long, so bear with me."
33681,"Earlier today, my girlfriend said I never smile."
33682,"I don't show any kind of enjoyment in much of anything, the most exciting event of the night was when I finally cleaned years of buildup worth of grit and dirt out of the bathtub."
33683,I don't have much to smile about.
33684,"Most of the time people tell me I should be thankful of what I have, but when I live in constant worry and fear to have these things, it's not a good trade-off."
33685,A few months ago my mother ended up in the hospital.
33686,I remember selling my electronic cigarette gear to get gas and go see her every day.
33687,"I never accomplished anything significant in my life, so I previously worked a dead-end job until recently."
33688,"However, my new job, while it pays more, is still not enough to afford the bills."
33689,"Anyway, my dad lost his job, and I moved out so he wouldn't have to worry about me living at home."
33690,"I'm 20 years old, without a college education, and the job I do now is security analysis for a bank, and the pay isn't as good as anyone would imagine."
33691,"I have to drive long distance now to get this job, so I still break even."
33692,I guess it's a nice change of scenery.
33693,It's hard convincing businesses that require degrees that you know what you're doing.
33694,"Anyway, I've got car insurance coming up, my car payment itself, rent, electric, and my internet bill which is required for me to remote in to work when I'm working from home (and no, they don't pay for my internet, if I stay and work from home it's my responsibility to have a connection)."
33695,"Who can live without the internet, anyway?"
33696,"Basically I bring in X, and Y (bills) is more than X. I often go without eating more than a single meal in a day, just so we have a bit of extra food."
33697,Food banks are nearly non-existent in our area.
33698,"To add on top of that, my girlfriend moved in with me."
33699,"She has an extremely rough home life, and she would often cry because of the crap that goes on in her house, including her mother's drunk boyfriend constantly emotionally abusing her."
33700,"I had her move in, and we've been trying to find her work, she receives state benefits, but she doesn't receive the cash benefit."
33701,I make too much to qualify for assistance programs.
33702,"Next, the relationship itself."
33703,I feel like I never get any time to think.
33704,"She wants to go with me everywhere because she's stuck home bored all day, and there's only the two of us, so there isn't much to clean and whatnot."
33705,"She always wants to have sex, but I barely feel motivated enough to even ""perform"" and to me it gets boring and the worry and anxiety prevents me from being at the ""top of my game."""
33706,"On top of that, I get so irritated and ridden with anxiety that I often want to be left alone, and I can tell she's starting to feel like she's not good enough for me."
33707,"It's more realistically the other way around, I'm simply not good enough for her."
33708,"I talked to her tonight, asking if I ran into trouble and got evicted if she would want to go back to her mother's."
33709,"She said she'd stick with me no matter what, so I guess that's a good thing."
33710,Often times I sit on the balcony porch for endless hours at a time trying to figure out how to get out of this mess.
33711,"Help from family isn't a possibility, and I don't want to ask friends for help either, because chances are I'll never be able to pay them back in a decent amount of time."
33712,"I don't have any real ""unnecessary"" expenditures, every now and then I'll buy a pack of cigarettes, the cheapest ones they sell, but normally I go without and just bear the brunt of the day without anything to get me by."
33713,I feel like I'm losing a grip.
33714,"I was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder, they give me medications, but I haven't been able to get them filled or see a doctor since I lost my insurance for 3 months until my new insurance kicks in, and even then it scrapes the bottom of the barrel and they don't cover mental health services."
33715,I can't sleep at night.
33716,I stay up and wonder what the next day will bring.
33717,"I always try to hold on hope, but I've lost all hope at this point."
33718,"I'm stuck in the same situation that millions of others are, and I see no light at the end of the tunnel."
33719,More and more tunnel.
33720,"Normally I wake up within two hours of getting to sleep, and just sit on the porch looking at the few stars I can see among the light pollution (and often times clouds)."
33721,I put on a fake front to keep people from worrying.
33722,"My mother sees right through it, but she never tells family or anyone else, because she knows how much it means to me that she doesn't."
33723,"My girlfriend assumes everything is fine, though I often daze off and worry about the bills, our relationship, etc."
33724,How exactly do people get through this?
33725,More than anything I fear being homeless and I fear her being homeless as well.
33726,"My father said once we move out we can't move back, and since he lost his job he's now worried about being homeless as well."
33727,"I wish I could help him, but I can't even help myself."
33728,I guess there's always drinking.
33729,"I'm hoping that i can go to a near by urgent care and they would be able  to help me not only get medication but resources for counseling options for ""low income"" uninsured types like myself."
33730,I feel like if I had these meds back then that wouldn't have happened and I could have lived a productive life.
33731,Now however it's like I become a completely different person... Can it be an added side effect of the medication?
33732,"I've gotten progressively more insane when I drink and want to know if this can be a side effect of medication mixed with drinking, or if I'm just an insane person."
33733,I am not in general one of those holistic medicine people but since I stared a stack of vit d magnesium and vitamin b12 my anxiety has reduced greatly it was worth a shot
33734,"Yesterday morning...I tried to let myself sleep a little late after breakfast/meds (ceiling fan squeaking, ugh) ...then got up, proceeded to change and wash bedsheets, put away dishwasher contents, and dusted/vacuumed the house...and obviously wore myself out."
33735,I've tried therapy and I'm on medication i take every day for it.
33736,Also I'm paranoid on these meds.
33737,I was doing fantastic for a few months there.
33738,"I had gotten through a patch of loss in my life, ex-girlfriend breaking up with me in the middle of losing 2 of my childhood friends to both suicide and murder(separate cases), my cat of 12 years to scar tissue around the throat, and also my only grandmother who partially raised me while my mother worked 3 jobs."
33739,"I was making huge progress at my job, having plenty of spare time for myself that I would actually enjoy, hanging out with my friends just enough to keep me occupied."
33740,I had been doing so well I felt I needed a reward.
33741,"I went on a vacation for a week and had more fun than I think I ever have had in my life, so a big part of me wants to leave everything I have here behind."
33742,"Which really, isn't that much, and it's not very far."
33743,I could still visit my family once a month if I really wanted to.
33744,"I have a decent job(but underpaid), and I believe I could get another one that would be better in the location I want to move to."
33745,"I have enough money at the moment to just do it, but I'm afraid of doing it I guess."
33746,So I get stuck in this feeling bad for myself because I realize how much I don't like it here and how much fun I was having just a few hours away from here.
33747,"There is also a girl, but I don't think things will work out."
33748,"She's too young, 18, I just turned 25."
33749,I've been taking her on dates for a couple months.
33750,"We get along, but she definitely appears to have much more partying and I'm turning to the point where I would happily give up drinking multiple times a week if it meant I could settle down with a smart, beautiful girl and start building a foundation for a family."
33751,"Then again, there are little hints of her wanting a commitment."
33752,I don't think she knows what she really wants and I'm just trying to give her this option of being with me.
33753,"I would take her to Colorado with me, we've known each other for a couple years(only dated for a couple months, don't worry."
33754,"all legal, and no sexual things anyway.)"
33755,"I live in a place where marijuana is illegal, and they also are very harsh on people who are caught with it, however it's what has helped me most through the years of different prescription medications."
33756,"I was forced to take breaks because of being arrested a couple of times, but it only made me realize how much it was helping me when I wasn't about to have it."
33757,I would be going to Colorado if I do end up moving out of here.
33758,"At this point I sit at work all day and stare at reddit or try to play whatever games I can so I can pass the time to go home, then I either try to figure out what game to play and end up not feeling like playing ANY game (out of over 200...), or play some game I think I'll enjoy for 5 minutes and eventually laying down in my bed waiting until it's a reasonable time to fall asleep for my schedule."
33759,On the few days a week that I get out of the house after work I'm drinking with some friends or watching Star Trek with the girl I mentioned and cuddling.
33760,"I feel really lucky to be where I am, but that only makes me feel even shittier that I don't feel like I'm fully appreciating everything that I have."
33761,Do you guys think that it would be good to look into moving?
33762,I've looked at a few jobs but I really haven't looked at housing or anything.
33763,"**TL;DR:** Tempted to move to a state with legal marijuana, being held back by anxiety and people."
33764,Plus when I met the doctor at the hospital for medication he was a total asshole (my boyfriend has actually met him as well for different reasons and the doctor treated him the same way) anyway basically Im unable to take medication so therapy was my only option.
33765,i have tried CBT and meds.
33766,"I also have the flu at the moment, and I'm actually scared to take my medicine as I'm scared I will have some allergic reaction or whatever."
33767,"I said ""screw you, anxiety"" got up, took my medicine, and got ready to go."
33768,I'm on medication so I don't get the full on anxiety attacks but I still feel generally anxious and depressed.
33769,I believe I have GAD and when I'm not on my medicine anxiety attacks.
33770,"I'm not on any medication except for the occasional xanax to manage my most acute symptoms, but I try to go sparingly with those."
33771,Are there any recommendations to dealing with anxiety that don't include therapy and medicine?
33772,"I'm not even on meds now, but will probably have to get some."
33773,"I have had a few drinks tonight, i know i shouldn't with the medication i'm taking, but it was the only way to get out of the house and go to class and participate in social interactions."
33774,"Given my anxiety issues (well controlled, actually, but with medication and decades of practice) I'm a walking fucking pharmacy so I give her a xanax in front of everybody and in violation of federal law I am sure (fuck you, Eric Holder)."
33775,"Anyway, I just completely stopped taking my meds two weeks ago because I had become so numb to everything around me that despite not having anxiety, I felt as if I was going through the motions with everything."
33776,Just a little rant for those who have been relying on meds and are thinking of stopping.
33777,"i went to the doctors for a checkup and she gave me some medicine, which helped with the stomach aches, but didnt really help with the anxiety as a whole, but i attempted to cope with it, as i did the last 3 years (the current time in the 'story' is me around 15 years old, maybe 14)."
33778,"from day 1 in the school year my medicine hasnt been helping, so i got new medicine that helped for a bit, so i thought everything was alright."
33779,So the beginning of this story starts with me being harassed and emotionally abused.
33780,I started getting panic attacks so badly that I would hyperventilate and black out.
33781,I've tried taking a variety of medications to control my anxiety and depression but I hate being so dependent on the medication to be happy.
33782,Any advice on how to get back to being normal and happy without a prescription?
33783,I've tried a psych and I regularly exercise and that helps a bit but not enough.
33784,Thanks..
33785,"And I know that I could be on anxiety meds, but the one I take that actually helped really made sex not just dissatisfying but depressing."
33786,But when I am on my anti-anxiety meds I just can't feel anything and get really dry (sorry this is graphic but I need to rant) and then sex can't happen and I just feel like bawling my eyes out because I feel like a failure.
33787,"So, I was given some medication to treat my anxiety and depression (Zoloft, if it matters), and I started it very recently so, as the prescribing doctor said it would, currently it's doing more harm then good, but I have a question regarding how it'll work after it starts to do what it's supposed to."
33788,"My entire life I've wanted to be a social, friendly person; genuine kindness is a big thing I aspire in my life, and I view friendliness as a part of that, but, obviously as I'm posting here, my anxiety and other emotional problems didn't make it possible for me to be quite what I wanted, so, will the medication make it easier for me to be outgoing/eliminate the nervousness associated with conversing with people I barely/do not know?"
33789,**TL;DR:** Does anxiety medication make it easier to be outgoing or does that come later?
33790,"Maybe anxiety meds could help, but I've heard some bad stories about people dying from overdose or something related and I dislike taking constant medication when I can avoid it."
33791,"I've been on the medication for about 2 months, and I used to drink quite a bit before starting the meds, I haven't drank in about 5 months."
33792,This is the first time I've ever considered resorting to medication for my anxiety.
33793,"Over time, my Bipolar (Type I) SO's self-medication has turned into a full-fledged addiction."
33794,"diagnosed with: PTSD, Panic/Anxiety disorder, and aggravated depression."
33795,Current Medications: Switching today from Celexa to Prozac.
33796,Have been using Xanax for panic attacks I cannot control.
33797,"I apologize if this is a repeat, but I've been having nightmares for as long as I can remember, and I'm getting to the point, once again, where I just don't want to go to sleep anymore."
33798,"I've been like this before, and I know where I'm heading."
33799,"Last time my nightmares got this bad was a few years ago, I was on no medications."
33800,"I think the Celexa may have a hand in making them more frequent and more emotionally painful, because when I wake up, I can't just shake it off; It hangs over me like a douchebag cloud."
33801,"Anyway, last time I got this bad, I just started NOT sleeping for days at a time until my body got pissed enough to make me zonk out for 16 hours at a time."
33802,"Has anyone found a way to make the nightmares .. lessen, in any way shape or form?"
33803,Most of them now make NO sense.
33804,"IE: Things my current SO would NEVER EVER do , nor has he given me any reason what-so-ever to think that he would."
33805,"And nightmares that mostly deal with the near future and my inability to be a normal, functioning, useful, working person who makes money (that I'll never get better, ever.)"
33806,.
33807,"Or I wake up not remembering it, but knowing I had one and I feel terrified and miserable all morning/afternoon."
33808,"Some are based off of my past, that my psychiatrist believes to be the root of my PTSD and most of my anxiety, as well."
33809,"But lately it's been crap that I wake up KNOWING I shouldn't worry about, but do anyway."
33810,Thanks in advance for any advice to help with these asshole nightmares.
33811,I asked my Psych about Lions Mane and he said that would be a bad idea since it may interact with my medication(s).
33812,"He's getting professional help with both medication as well as therapy, and he is keeping up well with the doctors' advice."
33813,"I have never been offered or given medication, as my parents always accompany me to my first sessions (I would not be able to afford them by myself) and explicitly say they don't want to put me on medication."
33814,"I've been on depression/anxiety medication before for several years, but the side effects became too much to bear (I was tired ALL the time)."
33815,"I stopped taking that medication, and switched to another that also did not work (I got suicidal, which I had never been before), and stopped taking that medication."
33816,It has been approximately a year since I stopped taking any medication whatsoever.
33817,"I do feel that without medication included in my treatment, I am slowly retreating back into my anxious brain."
33818,I need help on asking for medication.
33819,"My doctor absolutely refuses to give me any medication that she deems ""addicting,"" saying that they do not give those out unless it is a ""special"" case (example: Xanax)."
33820,"Many of my friends are offering to refer me to their doctors, but I'm nervous that I'll be seem as ""shopping"" for doctors in order to get medication, and that makes me terrified."
33821,TL;DR: My primary doctor makes me uncomfortable asking for medication.
33822,I need assistance on how I can effectively communicate how much anxiety meds are necessary for my mental health.
33823,Today after a grand total of three visits to a therapist I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.
33824,"Just for some clarification, I'm a 17 year old female with possibly also a personality disorder (this hasn't been diagnosed, the only thing given to me was GAD, whatever else is going on is a completely unknown)."
33825,"I'm paranoid beyond belief, have issues sleeping, worry about everything, major depression, all of those things."
33826,My therapist has given me options: medication or cognitive therapy.
33827,I've spent some time looking everything up on the internet and I'm still unsure of what I want to do.
33828,"At first I wanted to try both combined (medication and cognitive therapy) and would like to avoid benzodiazephies/benzos because of addictions in the family (specifically involving benzos) and I'd like something to be more long term and regular than a few weeks of medication and I have to go off of it (I like things to remain the same and be regular or else I begin to panic)

If anyone has had any experience with certain medications/therapies it would be awesome to have some opinions or suggestions."
33829,I know everything is different.
33830,I just have zero clue where to go from here.
33831,My therapist is also going to mail me information on cognitive therapy before my next appointment.
33832,for the last six months the medication has helped but here I am today bawling my eyes out for no good reason.
33833,I guess it's time to have my medication adjusted.
33834,"After that, i realised i have to change something about myself, and i started seeing a psychologist (before that i was seeing a psychiatrist and i was taking meds, but i decided i don't want to take them anymore)."
33835,"So i have always had anxiety issues since i can remember, but my biggest trigger has always been  school."
33836,"I was lucky enough to be one of those kids in high school that never studied or had homework but pulled off decent grades, not so much in college."
33837,"I need to study, but i get such bad studying anxiety that i will spend hours *trying* to study, but im so anxious and frazzled that i can't fully grasp the information."
33838,Studying days ahead doesn't seem to help and it is really starting to effect my grades as i get into my upper-level classes.
33839,Usually after a study session i go into full anxiety attack mode for days after.
33840,"So im wondering if anyone has any advice that can help me, because at this point i can't afford to do poorly...and the anxiety attacks are only increasing."
33841,"Im really trying to avoid getting on medications due to the side-effects, but am starting to wonder if thats my only option."
33842,I started with medication 1½ month ago and have been feeling better.
33843,"Not sure if It is me getting better at dealing, the medication or perhaps the fact that I have started accepting my new situation, city and job."
33844,I was always against meds but I am so glad I took the plunge.
33845,"Some background: I've had a history of mild depression and self esteem issues, I went to therapy for about 6 months and am doing much better for the most part now."
33846,"I have made some great new friends, have a very supportive and loving boyfriend, I know where I want to go in my career after I graduate from college in May, etc, but I still get anxiety attacks that are often (mostly) unprovoked."
33847,"My boyfriend is very very supportive and is there for me when I need to talk myself through these attacks, having had experience with anxiety himself."
33848,"I get these attacks maybe a couple of times per week, depending on what's going on, and I tend to get into the recursive thinking and can't distract myself, but it's not a big enough deal to warrant going to my doctor for a prescription; I can still manage my day to day life, I just have periods of anxiety and sadness for no real reason."
33849,Are there any good herbal remedies or over the counter medications I can take just for when talking doesn't seem to help and I just need to get out of it?
33850,tl;dr What are some over the counter remedies that can be taken in the midst of an anxiety attack?
33851,My anxiety used to take over my life until I got professional help and the right meds (which was hard because I have anxiety over taking most meds!).
33852,My daily anxiety medication isn't working like it used to.
33853,I've been on different types of meds for nearly 10 years now for my anxiety.
33854,I'm pretty sure I need to stay on the meds because before them I couldn't even make a phone call without nearly having a panic attack.
33855,"I've been on plenty of meds, been to see cognitive therapists, counsellors and had visits with my doctor weekly."
33856,During one of our early dates he  mentioned he had anxiety (most likely GAD; generalized anxiety disorder) and he had been seeing someone for it previously (and was given medication which he now only keeps for extreme circumstances) but has since stopped doing so due to some issue with his insurance.
33857,I really want to add Klonopin to my medication but I don't understand how to bring it up to my psych without seeming like a drug-seeker.
33858,"I am going into medicine, so I have a really strong scientific background, and I always read things trying to dismantle any possibility for an afterlife, and it freaks me out."
33859,"I'm going to start tapering off the medicine by cutting the pill in half (I know 10mg isn't a lot to begin with, but it's worth a try.)"
33860,"He continues to brush it off as something my brain is reacting to the medication, and says I need to ""keep drinking to find my limit"" BUT WHAT."
33861,"Also thinks my manic episodes when drinking are just classic alcohol poisoning and not the antidepressant affecting my brain, but I never acted this way UNTIL on the medication."
33862,"Okay so I'm 19 years old and have been dealing with anxiety for years and years now, probably since 13 or 14 and since then I've tried many anti depressants to try and combat depression that I had at the time, as well as anxiety."
33863,"Panic attacks made their way into my life at about 16 and whilst my anxiety has somewhat improved over the years, I'm still facing a big barrier."
33864,"A month ago I was diagnosed with ADHD and I'm now on Dexedrine for it, it seems to be helping those symptoms, but it's not improving nor worsening the anxiety."
33865,In particular it's social anxiety (approaching people etc.
33866,which I have to deal with a lot as a job) and also driving anxiety.
33867,I still haven't got my driver's license and have had minimal hours driving experience since I've been too anxious to even attempt learning a lot of the time.
33868,I'm very well overdue to make that happen but even thinking about it overwhelms me.
33869,"The lessons I've had in the past I've been quite a good driver and I should be feeling confident, yet it still triggers anxiety for some stupid reason."
33870,I feel like I'm seriously lagging behind.
33871,Anyway.
33872,My psychiatrist recommended I try Paroxetine for the anxiety and panic.
33873,He also gave me Ativan which is meant to be used to abort a panic attack if it happens and I can't control it.
33874,"The medications I've used before are sertraline, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine and escitalopram."
33875,I've had minimal benefits from them but tons of side effects which very much have outweighed the positives.
33876,I am seriously stuck.
33877,Do I go for it and hope it works?
33878,Will it interfere with the dexedrine?
33879,Will I turn into an apathetic potato again... etc.
33880,"Right now I'm just over a year free of escitalopram (Lexapro) and I feel fine, mood wise."
33881,Anxiety isn't too bad but I still get those attacks sometimes and it does hold me back a lot.
33882,I just don't know what to do.
33883,Can anyone make suggestions?
33884,"I just, want to try beating it without medication."
33885,Hi reddit.
33886,I thought some of you might be able to help me or even talk about something similar.
33887,I have recently moved courses and i seem to fit into a group of people but i cant shake the feeling that i make things weird.
33888,like i say the wrong thing or get over excited.
33889,"does anyone know of any methods/medications that allow you to feel normal, in control and not get overly excited."
33890,"without food, i cannot take my medication."
33891,"I got so anxious I couldnt calm down for about 1 hour, my mother gave me some medication to make me cool down but it did not help that much."
33892,"Regardless, I've been off my meds for the most part (other than the rare xanax for emergencies) and have been fucking great."
33893,But I just feel shitty and ashamed that I'm going to have to call him and set up another appointment pretty soon to tell him about this shit and get my meds refilled.
33894,So I was hoping to crowdsource some information on meds.
33895,"Alright, to give a little background, I am a 21 year old woman (girl?)"
33896,"who has a history of learning disorders, depression, anxiety, agoraphobia, and EDNOS."
33897,"I have been on some anxiety medications, and am now on an antidepressant."
33898,"I live with two friends and my boyfriend, I am recently unemployed, and I'm trying to get my life back together."
33899,"I am enrolled in a few classes at my local community college, however..."
33900,I can't seem to actually go.
33901,"This is a pattern that really has fucked me over for a long time, and I'm trying desperately to not fall back to my old, unsafe routine."
33902,I'm failing.
33903,"If anything, it is getting worse."
33904,"I have attended maybe a handful of my classes over the past month+, and I'm sure I am failing all but one class (which I am re-taking)... 

Now, my real problem is that I can't leave my apartment."
33905,"Yes, I know that, logically, I *can* leave my apartment, but there's a mental block."
33906,"If one thing doesn't go perfectly while I am getting ready to go somewhere, I just don't go."
33907,"I have a full blown panic attack, I stay home and cry and sit on my couch and watch trash tv all day."
33908,Usually while finishing off a bottle of wine.
33909,I can't seem to make it out the door to buy food for myself anymore.
33910,I just don't know what to do.
33911,I feel as though I'm imploding.
33912,"I know I need help, I just can't get it."
33913,"I have a counselor, who I do not see due to not being able to leave the house."
33914,"(Even today I had to call and cancel our appointment due to my foundation not looking right... wtf) Anyway, any helpful tips or advice or even a comforting word or two would be helpful."
33915,"I'm not sure what I want, I'm just going crazy."
33916,And I am thinking about meds as a possible fix.
33917,I'm also re-starting CBT so the medicine would be in conjunction with therapy.
33918,They just assumed I was trying to take the attention away from my younger brother who is diagnosed with both an anxiety disorder and depression and is currently on medication.
33919,I've always been a really nervous and worried type of person.
33920,But in the past month I've been having really bad anxiety.
33921,"To the point where I've been to the ER twice, and a general practioner once because I swear I was having heart issues."
33922,I've become a hypochondriac.
33923,"A sore chest muscle, means I'm having a heart attack."
33924,"My stomach growls, means I have stomach Cancer."
33925,I finally went to the Dr about anxiety.
33926,"He did put me on Lexapro 10mg (adding it to my wellbutrin, which I use for social anxiety) and Lorazepam 1mg for when I have an attack."
33927,I just have some questions.
33928,Will the physical symptoms go away eventually?
33929,I just started these medications last night.
33930,"Today, I noticed I still get dizzy spells, I'm still really fatigued, weak, and tired."
33931,"I still have that hollow/empty chest feeling, and still have a mild headache."
33932,"I also have no interest in anything, all I want to do is lay in bed and just sleep until this all passes over."
33933,Those were my main symptoms before I realized I had anxiety.
33934,"My mind is better, I no longer think I'm dying."
33935,But the physical symptoms are still lingering.
33936,How long do these symptoms typically last?
33937,"Even though my mind is at ease, I still think that these symptoms are part of some underlying disease because I'm still having them."
33938,Which then puts me back into panic attack mode.
33939,"I know I'm fine, due to the Dr telling me so, but i just can't shake the little thoughts because i'm still experiencing the physical symptoms."
33940,"I'm getting sick of them, I've been feeling this way for the past couple of weeks and it's driving me nuts!"
33941,"I thought now that the Dr put me on some meds, that I would become back to normal."
33942,"I know it's only been 1 day, but I'm still nervous that these symptoms won't go away."
33943,You get all of the short term positive effects of anti-anxiety drugs without the long term negatives of taking that kind of medicine all of the time.
33944,"Thanks to my medicine and friends, I managed to go throughout the whole school day without the thought crossing my mind."
33945,"I don't exactly know where to start with this story, but I have suffered from generalised anxiety disorder for over four years now and ""minor"" depression for over two years and even though I'm taking medication for both and seeing a psychologist about it, I feel like I'm getting worse."
33946,I'm not a medical doctor but I believe that medication only masks the response to the trigger (numbing the effect) rather than clearing the root cause.
33947,"When I'm on my depression meds, I feel nothing."
33948,I have diagnosed anxiety and don't take medication anymore.
33949,"Do I see a therapist, try to handle it on my own with exercise and a healthy diet or maybe meds again...idk 

Please give me your advice."
33950,I just started half tablets of depression medication on Thursday and was told they probably won't kick in until two weeks.
33951,My doctor prescribed me extremely low doses of sertraline and then imipramine on separate occasions and each time it caused me crippling anxiety and I wasn't able to keep taking them more than a few days.
33952,Has anyone had these reactions to certain meds and found success with another?
33953,I'm nervous about trying more medications at this point.
33954,"Long story short- during our time together she was usually unemployed and thus leaving me with all our expenses, I found out she had BPD and wasn't taking her meds, and that things were getting bad between us."
33955,"I was worried about bills, she was acting crazy without her meds, and I was stressed beyond stressed at times."
33956,I don't love the idea of anxiety meds but maybe I need to go that route.
33957,It worked really really well for me (haven't taken any other meds for my anxiety aside from clonazepam to offset a panic attack in the moment.)
33958,"Things I do are, watching when and what I eat, avoiding caffeine, anti nausea medicine(Works wonders) Acid re flux medicine, tums, and cold water."
33959,Months ago I realize that the prozac made me feel sad/low so I talked to my doc and switched medicine.
33960,"I was thinking that maybe the alcohol could have this effect, though ive been drunk multiple times on my medication and havnt had problems."
33961,"Prescribed: 
60mg Vyvanse (it replaced 20mg AdderallXR &amp; twice daily 10mg Adderall IR)

1.5mg Klonopin (bottle says to take daily, but in practice--and doc knows and approves, I take it as needed, maybe 3 times a week."
33962,"Recently I've taken it to fall asleep from Adderall

40mg Prozac (don't feel a thing but supposedly it helps with ""baseline anxiety"" and obsessive thoughts



I used to take the Adderall ""as needed,"" even though I was prescribed it daily, but eventually took it daily because I was totally useless on the days I didn't take it."
33963,"But if that's not enough, I also take the following OTC items to ""supplement"" Klonopin &amp; especially Vyvanse/Adderall:

Tagamet (to boost Klonopin and also reduce stomach acid, which also boosts Vyvanse/Adderall

Zantac (to reduce stomach acid, boosting Vyvanse/Adderall)

Magnesium, Calcium, and Zinc: To help w/ Adderall tolerance and its cardiovascular side effects

Fish Oil: to be ""smart,"" but it supposedly goes good with Adderall."
33964,"Arginine &amp; Citrulline as vasodilators to counter Adderall's vasoconstriction

5HTP (as a ""building block"" for Prozac

Tyrosine &amp; Phenylethylamine (as building blocks for Adderall



So my routine would be to wake up, take Tagamet or Zantac to lower my stomach acid, Magnesium &amp; Arginine &amp; Citrulline ""to brace myself"" for Adderall's bad side effects."
33965,Then Vyvanse/Adderall daily.
33966,"Take Klonopin as needed (less than daily) if I need to be ""chill"" around others."
33967,"Then, at ""bedtime,"" which is just whenever I fall asleep, usually early morning hours, I flush down Magnesium, Fish Oil, Arginine &amp; Citrulline, 5HTP, Prozac, Tyrosine &amp; Phenylethylamine, and a multivitamin."
33968,All at once.
33969,"Since starting everything above (almost a year ago now), I'd get either constipation or diarrhea (mostly constipation) pretty much every day."
33970,"And my stomach is always ""lurching"" as if churning what's inside, not growling in hunger."
33971,So I eat less to try to avoid the GI side effects and just drink protein shakes.
33972,I've lost 10-15lbs in the 9 months and 25-30lbs in the last 12 without really trying to lose weight.
33973,"Went from 200--&gt;175, and I'm at a height where I look rail thin."
33974,I didn't think I did.
33975,I thought I had yet more weight to lose until someone told me I looked pretty anorexic (I'm a guy).
33976,"But beyond all that, what I hate most is how all of the above would improve my mood, life, performance."
33977,"Instead, they've made me worse off in pretty much all respects than before I even started them (anxiety, ADHD), and I was someone who visited his 1st psychiatrist appointment ""knowing what to say and what boxes to check."""
33978,Should I quit the medications?
33979,How else can I improve my anxiety &amp; ADHD?
33980,Talk therapy isn't really working.
33981,How/when did you decide to get off of meds and how did everything go for you?
33982,"I don't want to take medication unless it's the only solution anyway, and it wasn't helping."
33983,"I've been on SSRI's and sedatives for my entire adult life; for the past year and a half, I was on 300 mg of Seroquel XR (taken at night for sleep), 0.5 mg of Clonazepam, and 60 mg of Prozac."
33984,"Recently, I decided I wanted to see what kind of person I was without them."
33985,I stopped the Prozac a few months ago and was more less okay.
33986,"Then I started seeing a new therapist who doesn't really use meds, and on his advice I switched from 300 mg XR to 100 mg normal Seroquel."
33987,"It was way too large a drop all at once, and 2 days after switching I had the worst panic attack of my life: heart palpitations, nausea, muscle convulsions."
33988,After that I went back on 150 mg (half my original dose) of the XR.
33989,That was two weeks ago.
33990,Since then my depression has improved a little but my anxiety has steadily been increasing.
33991,Every day for the past 5 days I've been having panic attacks.
33992,I don't feel like I can keep on like this.
33993,"My therapist doesn't believe my panic attacks are being caused by medications or lack thereof, but nor does he have any suggestions for coping."
33994,"I practice slow deep breaths, but only time cures my panic attacks."
33995,I'm starting to wonder if it's really possible for me to be off of psychiatric medication.
33996,"Basically, I see three possibilities:

1.)"
33997,Do nothing.
33998,Try to wait it out in the hopes that I will adjust to the reduced Seroquel dose.
33999,2.)
34000,Start taking an SSRI again to mitigate the withdrawal effects and wean myself off of the Seroquel while on that.
34001,3.)
34002,Resume my original 300 mg Seroquel dose.
34003,"I would appreciate if you could tell me how you got off of Seroquel, or just pharmaceuticals in general."
34004,"I might be going to a therapist soon, my mother suggested it but she is strongly apprehensive and scared of medication or drugs so I think I'll have to bring it up again when I get back home."
34005,"I don't want to be dependent on meds for life just to feel normal, so over the years I've found ways to relieve it."
34006,"Ive struggled with anxiety and depression over the last four years, mostly untreated, never took medication before."
34007,I expected that I would be sent to a specialist to receive a proper assessment before being prescribed medication.
34008,The reason why it might be so bad right now is because I havent taken any meds for almost 6 months and I was seeing a therapist.
34009,This is my first time interacting with a guy since I have been off my meds.
34010,"I really dont want to get back on my meds.... 
Any help at all?"
34011,"For those of you who have had to make the decision to take drugs, would it be better to stick to his diagnosis and take the medication or would it be prudent to look into other alternatives?"
34012,"I feel like I have a good handle on my anxiety (meds that work, positive self-talk, supportive friends &amp; family), but there's one tick I just can't stop: twiddling my hair."
34013,I've tried medicine and meditation and all of that but nothing works.
34014,"Has anyone here found anything helpful for that, besides meds (already on them) and alcohol?"
34015,im starting new meds soon.
34016,I stopped my meds (Zoloft) because I was tired of gaining weight (15 lbs in two years).
34017,"After taking 2 of my emergency benzos, I've finally calmed down to the point where ~~I can finally go to sleep~~ I feel only slightly like simultaneously shitting my pants and throwing up."
34018,Is there anyone else out there with a diagnosed Panic Disorder?
34019,"My symptoms feel like they're just ridiculous, and I'm hoping some of you can share your coping wisdom with me."
34020,"When I get panicked, these things happen/feel like they're going to happen:

-I'm going to lose control of all bodily functions
-Hyperventilating, numbness in hands and feet."
34021,"-Severe twitching, shivering across my entire body
-A feeling that what's happening isn't real
-The feeling of being so totally overwhelmed with raw fear that I need to somehow get out of my own body."
34022,"-Crying
-Stomach pain, nausea

That's a fun list of symptoms."
34023,Does anyone else deal with these things?
34024,"How do you cope, or what medications do you take that help?"
34025,"I know everyone here is a viking warrior of perseverance, I humbly request your advice."
34026,All I want to do is lose this weight and I am thoroughly convinced that my medicine is not allowing me to do so.
34027,"I pulled myself off of the medicine cold-turkey (I don't recommend) two months go, have been working my butt off and eating even better and cannot lose a pound."
34028,I really feel like the medicine screwed with my metabolism.
34029,"A lot of people will claim that this medication will not cause weight gain, but like I said, I didn't change a thing."
34030,I was just wondering if anyone else on anxiety medication (preferably SSRI's) have dealt with this and what they did to combat the weight gain?
34031,Does anyone have any better experiences with medicine?
34032,"Things are really tough, my parents have taken him to many different therapists, he's tried hypnosis, meditation, medication, CBT not a lot seems to be changing..."
34033,I have dealt with panic disorder for a while and I haven't had issues that lasted this long since before I was on medication.
34034,It is a major issue for me that went away when I started taking medication but has now returned with the rest of my symptoms.
34035,"Bulimia for me started after highschool, roughly 2007, I began to binge and purge food."
34036,The thought of being able to eat whatever you wanted too and purge it back up without any immediate consequence was too appealing.
34037,"It began as a few pieces of pie once and awhile, or other desserts."
34038,But quickly grew out of hand.
34039,"I finally stop in 2013, after having some mild acid reflux issues which continue today."
34040,"&amp;nbsp;

I honestly don't remember certain times of my life between 2008-2013, not because of drinking or other drugs."
34041,"Because of repressing so many memories, up until a year ago, every time something would remind me of bingeing I quickly repressed that memory."
34042,"Some of the most funny years of my life, are repressed, almost deleted because of how bad I feel."
34043,I am ashamed and embarrassed.
34044,"When someone walks past me on the street I would appear very normal, but how would I be treated if they knew if I practiced bulimia."
34045,I bet they wouldn't feel the same about me.
34046,"&amp;nbsp;

I finally came out to a family doctor in 2014."
34047,After suffering serious anxiety fearing death.
34048,"I thought I was dying that year, I wasn't sick or really anything major."
34049,I visited the doctor maybe 3 times in 3 months with probably minor issues that I thought were life ending.
34050,The fear overtook me.
34051,Some days I couldn't go to work.
34052,"Others I could, but I would spend all day thinking about leaving my baby (wife gave birth to a daughter in 2014) behind."
34053,Finally when it was beginning to interfere with so much of my daily life I knew I needed to be done.
34054,I had to visit a medical professional.
34055,"&amp;nbsp;

I cried and shook uncontrollably when I admit to the family doctor what I had done."
34056,"He was just a family medicine doctor, this wasn't his expertise, but he was very helpful and gave me hope and started me in a path of recovery."
34057,"&amp;nbsp;

I begun to visit a therapist regularly, she prescribed me some medicines(citalopram 20mg, risperdal .5mg) taken in tandem worked well for awhile."
34058,But eventually I stop feeling like myself and more like a zombie.
34059,I didn't really like that so I stop my drugs cold turkey with no side effects.
34060,"However, I started to relapse into my previous fears of death, embarrassment, and shame."
34061,"So I started my medicines again, this time only the citalopram."
34062,"&amp;nbsp;

Currently, I stopped taking the medicine again, because I think they make my heart feel flutter."
34063,"But now after stoping the meds, my fears have roared back into thinking i'm going to die of a heart attack."
34064,"&amp;nbsp;

I have an appointment with a family practice doctor regarding my heart, to see if they can run any test to see if this is a real symptom or something I am making myself believe because of the fear."
34065,"&amp;nbsp;

I have scheduled an appointment with my therapist who prescribes my medicine, I am wanting to try something else, with less effects on the heart and maybe less of zombie feeling."
34066,"&amp;nbsp;

Has anyone else been in a similar situation?"
34067,And is it wrong to want to try other medicine?
34068,"&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr: (male, 26)started with bulimia, moved onto serious anxiety about death, on and off citalopram/risperdal, want to try something different."
34069,**
34070,"This morning when I got up and started going about my business I started feeling anxious and thinking about all of the bad things I've ever done in my life (which is the typical spiral I go into when anxious), and had to take some of my panic medication, on top of my regular medication."
34071,Everyone is telling me medication is awful and won't help.
34072,"I've been put on medication for it, a decent size; I've tried 4 others before and they haven't had results."
34073,"I've thought about going back on medication, however each time i get close to calling the doctor i remember the terrible month of withdraws  that i had when cycling off."
34074,24 F here who has GAD for about 3 years now.
34075,I am currently on Abilify 15mg at night and Neurontin 600mg at night.
34076,"I used to take an additional 400mg of Neurontin in the morning, but figured out I didn't need to take it--my body is functional without it in the morning."
34077,Other medications not relating to Anxiety that I take are: Sprintec (birth control) and Solodyn (for acne) 80mg.
34078,"I gained, not too much, but around 10lbs, but I'm 5'1 so that is a lot of weight for someone short like me."
34079,"After extreme dieting I lost about 3lbs, but as soon as I started to eat only a tiny bit more food, I gained the weight back on and then MORE weight."
34080,I tried dieting again but I just can't lose weight.
34081,I asked my PDoc what's happening.
34082,They said they don't know (I asked two different PDocs) and one said it MIGHT be Abilify but she isn't sure.
34083,"As for my sleepiness, I can sleep 8 hours in a day or 6 or 9, and STILL be sleepy all day."
34084,I heard about people feeling sleepy with Abilify but then there are lots of people who can't sleep while on Abilify.
34085,"I asked my Pdoc and General Practitioner why I'm perpetually tired, neither could give me an answer as to why I'm tired all the time."
34086,What is going on with me?
34087,I can drink coffee and it still be a little bit ineffective.
34088,I already got my Thyroid checked to see if that was the cause of my tiredness but blood results came out normal.
34089,Blood results also said my Vitamin D is okay.
34090,I mention that because my cousin's (who has GAD too) Vitamin D was low and that made her tired and so now she's on Vit D supplements and has her energy back.
34091,TL;DR: Gained 10lbs and am perpetually tired but PDocs and Gen.Practitioner don't know what's causing either.
34092,Help!
34093,"I've been with him for 5 years, and sometimes he is such a pain."
34094,"He has generalized anxiety disorder, but I think there may be something else."
34095,"He's been on several medications over the years, Lexapro, some other one, but none of them seemed to help."
34096,He has been taking Lorazepam for almost 3 years now (which is supposedly only for short term)?
34097,"Anyway, he worries constantly about everything."
34098,He worries about a passing comment he made to some girl three days ago.
34099,He worries about a funny comment he made on Facebook.
34100,This is the stuff I understand.
34101,"I know that he worries about stuff, that's what he does."
34102,"Usually, as he's talking about what he's worried about, I tend to ask him something like ""hmm, how many countries in Africa"", where his mind goes off of what he is worried about."
34103,But he definitely has good days and bad days.
34104,Sometimes he hates it where we live.
34105,"If a shop keeper doesn't say hello to him friendly enough, that's it!"
34106,He will hate it here.
34107,It just sends his whole day spiraling down into a bad day.
34108,"He'll say he's had enough, he wants to move, he wants to go back to England, anything!"
34109,"Then he gets upset, and goes to bed at like 7pm."
34110,"Then tomorrow, maybe he'll start planning the awesome Christmas party we will have here."
34111,"If people meet him, they would have no idea this was going on."
34112,"He is super outgoing and friendly to people, so it's sometimes weird to me."
34113,Is this normal for anxiety?
34114,Ugh.
34115,"I love him to death, but it is actually really hard on me, and sometimes I think WHY can't I just be with someone HAPPY?"
34116,Often I have to drive long distances and I suffer from anxiety and do not want medication.
34117,Many years ago I had a bout of anxiety which led me to get on medication to help control it.. it worked for a while and then I decided to quit taking it and I ended up not needing it again until now.
34118,I don't want to have to get back onto medication for this so I'm looking for simple ways to help relax my mind and body.
34119,"I want to talk to my psychiatrist about it, but I am afraid she will just try to up my meds or add something."
34120,"Long story short, I'm just really anxious about medication and what it could do to me."
34121,"I have pretty severe GAD with hypochondria, I'm not on any meds for it except Xanax which I take sparingly (usually a half of a .25mg pill)."
34122,"I know I said in the title that I am running out of single meds, and that's because I don't consider Klonopin to be a permanent or long term solution."
34123,I could take all the side effects if the meds worked on the actual problem as well.
34124,I have dealt with panic disorder and general anxiety since I can remember.
34125,"However, I got lucky in that the acute panic attacks were almost gone for the last eight or nine years or so - until 3 months ago."
34126,"Also, I've been on psychiatric medication on and off since I was 12 or 13 (24 now)."
34127,"3 months ago, I had one, out of nowhere, at 4 in the morning while in the bathroom."
34128,"It was, by a huge amount, the worst panic attack I've ever had - complete and utter disassociation/derealization, racing heart, waves of fear - I'm sure everyone on this sub knows what I mean."
34129,And that has started the spiral.
34130,"I started having them constantly after that one, and even ended up in the ER (even though I knew what the outcome would be)."
34131,The depersonalization/derealization was so bad for awhile that I almost wanted to commit myself or get a lobotomy.
34132,"For me, it feels like being stoned on bad dope when you desperately want to be sober."
34133,I am (and had been) on a good dose of 3 medications that have really worked for me up until then.
34134,"Since that attack 3 months ago, it has been ON and OFF - one week I'll think oh, finally, this may be leaving for good and then BAM it slaps me in the face again - racing heart, fear of insanity, and the hellish feeling that if I don't anchor myself down that I'll float away into nothingness, and above all, that the feeling will NEVER go away."
34135,"I can't really take benzos - I used to have a really bad drug problem and my drug of choice was benzodiazepines and barbiturates - and in my opinion they are the only rx meds that work ""in the moment""."
34136,"I have an extremely small supply of Ativan and valium, but the thought of using it makes me feel sooo guilty, and that makes me anxious, and then...

To top it all off, I took some Ativan while seeing my family over the holidays and it made me MORE anxious (I felt ""altered"" and ""out of it"") when, a month before that, a higher dose of the same Ativan completely erased one of the worst panic attacks I had had since the first one."
34137,I am just so tired of dealing with this.
34138,I have been sober for 3 years now and my life is finally on track again...so the panic attacks are coming back NOW?
34139,Not when I was doing huge amounts of drugs?
34140,Ok brain.
34141,Thanks for letting me rant.
34142,I love this sub reddit.
34143,Do you seek the same treatment (medication or behavioral)?
34144,"Many people I know take anxiety meds, but I wanted to be strong and get out of this hole by myself."
34145,"Now my question is say I'm ""addicted"" and take 3 a day what's the big deal it's just like any other medication people Need to survive"
34146,"I am going into the doc on Monday to discuss this, but will generalized anxiety meds make me feel the same that Xanax has?"
34147,"She just took some medication, but it isn't working."
34148,I am drinking now to try and dull symptoms but I just don't want to be on the medication anymore even though I have severe panic attacks and anxiety.
34149,"Despite therapy and three types of medication (Cipralex, Buspirone, Quetiapine) I still have my ""off"" days."
34150,"After being off of my meds for 6-8 months, I haven't felt like this since I first had anxiety issues 2-3 years ago."
34151,"My doctor keeps decreasing my meds because I don't think he thinks I really have depression at all, and it feels like I'm just getting swallowed into a black hole."
34152,"So I recently started a new medication, totally unrelated to my anxiety/depression, for my rheumatoid arthritis."
34153,"Have a bad hip due to inflammation that made it hard to walk sometimes, and that has improved in the couple of months I've been on the meds."
34154,But my anxiety medication?
34155,"Anyway, I feel like I might need to raise my dosage of the anxiety meds at the very least."
34156,"And I'm expected to see a therapist and take meds, even though neither of my parents are willing to do either of those things themselves."
34157,I thought my experience might be helpful to anyone who is dealing with anxiety but is either reluctant or does not have the means to seek medical help toward the end of obtaining prescription medication.
34158,Where do I start to talk to someone about meds?
34159,"I'd rather be on meds and go to therapy at the same time, but I need meds asap."
34160,I have decided not to take medication anymore because I want to conquer my anxiety myself without medication.
34161,"I can function normally on medication for my everyday anxiety, but even that doesn't quell my fears at work."
34162,In early August I was diagnosed with and operated on for appendicitis.
34163,The surgery went well.
34164,Prior to surgery I was examined by a few doctors who were surprised I wasn't more symptomatic.
34165,"I didn't really have a fever, no vomiting, no intense pain, nothing usual.. but I did have very frequent stomach problems and a pain on my right side."
34166,"They took some scans and determined my appendix was inflamed, and boom.. appendicitis."
34167,"However, one of the surgeons wasn't so sure this was appendicitis, and didn't want to operate just yet."
34168,"He said it could be something else.. perhaps something treatable with medications, maybe colitis or something."
34169,"He gave me an antibiotic and sent me home, but it wasn't working and within two days I went back."
34170,"I saw a different ER doctor this time who was very sure I had appendicitis, and refused to let me go."
34171,He was very kind and told me he would have someone operate on me.
34172,"He was very convinced because when he told me to relax, not to flinch, and to try to allow him to push into my side (I kinda tense up) I felt a sharper pain than before."
34173,That confirmed it for him.
34174,So.. new surgeon.
34175,He's very convinced as well.
34176,"The nurses tell me this surgeon is very respected, and knows his stuff."
34177,"I bring up concerns to the surgeon about it possibly not being appendicitis and about how the previous surgeon said my appendix looked odd (had some weird problem with the intestine), but he reassured me everything would be taken care of."
34178,So..
34179,I go to surgery.
34180,Wake up.. everything is fine.
34181,"I'm in a lot pain, but no more stomach problems."
34182,Fastforward about 3 weeks later and I'm experiencing weird sensations where my appendix used to be.
34183,"It's like a cramping.. no real pain, more like an annoying pressure."
34184,"My stomach gurgles sometimes, and I'm a little more prone to heartburn and what feels like bloating."
34185,I call the surgeon's office and speak to the front-desk.
34186,I don't know if they're nurses or what but she tells me I shouldn't really be symptomatic.
34187,She tells me to take some tums and make an appointment in a week if it doesn't go away.
34188,Well..
34189,I've done that.. it hasn't went away.
34190,"Before hanging up she said it could be something unrelated like with my spleen or whatever, but I think she was just trying to calm me down."
34191,It didn't.
34192,That really drove me crazy.
34193,"I have extreme health anxiety, so now I'm convinced I have something terminal."
34194,"They're going to have to remove my spleen, and then they're going to realize that it was cancer I had this whole time -- not appendicitis."
34195,"This is the first time, throughout my entire time of being a hypochondriac, that I feel like death is real and coming for me."
34196,"I'm going to die this year, and I'm terrified."
34197,I'm going to make an appointment.. but I don't think I can handle the news.
34198,I'm going to have an anxiety attack and break down.
34199,That's what happened when the first surgeon told me it might not be appendicitis.
34200,I was sure he would tell me I had cancer.
34201,I wept and hyperventilated for about 30-45 minutes and had my boyfriend console me.
34202,I don't want to die.
34203,"I don't want to have something terminal, whether it be my spleen, my intestines, or my stomach."
34204,I just started college.
34205,My boyfriend and I want long lives together.
34206,I'm petrified.
34207,I'm only 25.
34208,This can't be the end.
34209,"I need someone, anyone, please."
34210,I'm desperate for comfort.
34211,"I keep trying to tell myself the following things: They cut me open and looked around (laparoscopic) and my surgeon told me he didn't think I needed a colonoscopy or that he saw anything suspicious (I asked), the surgeon who operated on me said the removal was smooth and that there wasn't really anything too odd about my appendix after all, they biopsied it and everything was clear and it was definitely appendicitis, the surgeon said I also had inflamed intestines so maybe I'm just having bad post-surgery complications, this could be a disease I just have to live with that won't kill me and is treatable, this could be nothing serious

Sometimes I'm okay.. other times, like right now, I'm not."
34212,I just need some reassurance.
34213,"I'm so, so scared."
34214,I feel like crying all the time.
34215,Thank you.
34216,"Edit: It's been about a month and 3 weeks since surgery, and a month since feeling the sensations I described above."
34217,"I've recently become ~~very~~ incredibly nervous in social situations, and no amount of medication or reasurrance will stop me living every waking moment in a state of constant anxiety and paranoia."
34218,"He is going to give me the medication I need to cope with my life, thank goodness!"
34219,"I haven't picked up or taken my meds yet, and I know it will be a long road ahead before life is ""normal"" again, but geez, the idea that that is even a possibility.. &lt;3

EDIT: I just realized I said ""today"" twice in the title.. annoying.. and unfixable."
34220,I was wondering what was better for anxiety medication.
34221,It just seems like meds can be dangerous and they should be only an extremely last resort.
34222,Next week I have two appointments one with the nurse for blood pressure and blood test and one to see my doctor about the panic attacks to perhaps get my medication increased and a new prescription.
34223,"I take my medication with food an hour after waking and it has made me a little better, it has made me have less attacks but the prospect of leaving the flat next week is something that is making me worry."
34224,The only person I have now is my husband.
34225,I don't feel that it's fair to him that I rely on him for social interaction (aside from Reddit).
34226,"Mind you, that he doesn't like to be around people either, but he's forced to because he's in the Army."
34227,"I had friends in grade school, until I graduated high school."
34228,"I pushed everyone away and became a recluse, allowing myself to become addicted to the Internet."
34229,"I replaced local friends with online ones (people from MMOs and chat rooms), and made numerous friendships that I thought would last."
34230,"I was very satisfied with online friendships, because I didn't have to deal with face-to-face contact."
34231,"However, years ago, my anxiety reached a point where I became afraid to interact socially on the web and lost all of those friendships."
34232,Many of the friendships also died because we all grew up and didn't have time to chat so often.
34233,I guess I was the only one who didn't grow up since I can't even leave the house.
34234,"I'm ashamed to rekindle any of them, and fear that too much time has passed."
34235,"My husband has to go away for 3-4 months starting June, and I will be faced with the responsibility of going out and getting things done, which I'm extremely terrified of doing."
34236,"I was able to do all of that when he was in basic training, but I had a vehicle then."
34237,"Now I live in a place across the country from family and I have no vehicle (we have one that is a stick shift, but I don't know how to drive it)."
34238,I'll have to take cabs (which is extremely expensive) or ride the bus.
34239,Can anyone relate to this?
34240,Am I just a freaking loser that needs to suck it up?
34241,I don't know how else to be.
34242,I'm even afraid to go to the doctor to try to get help.
34243,"I pondered if medical marijuana could help me, but I'm too chickenshit to ask my doctor about it."
34244,I figured he would look down on me for even asking and think I just wanted to get high.
34245,"Mind you, I've tried drugs before, but I don't do anything now, and don't want to."
34246,"I've tried anxiety medications, but they only worked for a month or so and required me to take a higher dosage."
34247,"By the time the meds ran out, I was anxious again and afraid to go to the doctor."
34248,"alksjdflakjsdflkjasdf  
How do you cope?"
34249,How do you deal?
34250,What if you were alone and had no one to talk to?
34251,"I feel like you're going to say ""Get out of the house, even for a little bit a day."""
34252,I've done that.
34253,I try to get out about twice a week and sit at the park and read.
34254,"Whenever I try to talk to someone, or someone engages conversation with me, I never know what to say, and stumble through my words, saying the wrong things, or taking to long to think of a response."
34255,"I've tried many things, and always fall back into the same rut."
34256,The main problem is not having support.
34257,"That's my problem, and it's my fault for being this way."
34258,Downvote this all you want.
34259,I just wondered if anyone could relate to even a bit of this.
34260,OK so I know how that might sound but heres the deal.
34261,I am a 21 year old female.
34262,Ever since I was 16 and had my first panic attack I have felt like I have anxiety.
34263,I obsess over past situations and go over and over them in my head which sometimes makes it difficult to fall asleep or wakes me up in the middle of the night I nervously bite the inside of my cheeks to where I have scars on the inside of my mouth from doing this for years and rub my hands together very often and sometimes chew on my hair as well as other things.
34264,Small things such as checking my voicemail or certain social interactions cause me anxiety for no apparent reason.
34265,It took me a while to come to the conclusion that I have anxiety and I honestly feel that I do despite any formal diagnosis and I understand that many many people have it way worse than I do ( one of my really good friends does and I feel like he is the only person who believes me).
34266,That being said I have just dealt with it for years.
34267,Recently I had to complete many scuba diving classes in order to take a class I need for my major in order to graduate.
34268,I started feeling very anxious and had a tightness in my chest whenever we were first using all the gear underwater in the pool.
34269,It caused me to have to stop the class as I did not feel ok with going back under the water and I do not believe I would have been able to continue the way I was.
34270,But I really needed to complete this class on time and so I got some xanex from my friend.
34271,I one pill per class.
34272,"Finished and then went on Un medicated to complete advanced, and rescue scuba."
34273,I just really feel like being able to have some control over my anxiety and overcome this obstacle was completely made possible by the medication.
34274,So That is where I am at right now.
34275,I do not want medication for every day and understand that I need to continue to work to overcome my anxiety but sometimes it gets too overwhelming.
34276,I am a student and have health insurance though the school and have tried to ask the nurse practitioner about my anxiety.
34277,"She prescribed me ativan once, then canceled my prescription claiming that it is too addictive and insists I take Lexipro which is an anti depressant."
34278,I am not depressed and feel like her opinion is entirely wrong.
34279,The only advice she keeps giving me is to change my lifestyle and try to reduce my anxiety or take herbal remedies.
34280,"I have done everything in the book from more exercise to less caffeine to yoga classes , st johns wort, hopps you name it which help somewhat but sometimes there are incidents in which I really feel like I benefit from anti anxiety medicine which I take non perscribed ."
34281,She also referred me to a phychologist  on campus which was a complete dead end because she also insisted upon trying to make lifestyle changes and did not take me seriously.
34282,I understand that some people abuse these medications but I honestly feel like I would benefit from a moderate prescription of anti anxiety medication to be taken when things get too overwhelming so that I can continue to function and get though it.
34283,I feel like I have no options and that no one takes me seriously and I just want to be able to have a little bit of control over my anxiety to get through some situations.
34284,How do I go about trying to get these medications?
34285,Should I just come out and make a appointment with a doctor and just directly ask for them?
34286,I don't feel like therapy is beneficial because honestly there isn't really that much to talk about.
34287,I have a normal  happy life....I just have some anxiety for no reason.
34288,I am so tired of no one believing me and dismissing me as another college student trying to get drugs.
34289,I have become so discouraged about it that I have for the most part just accepted that things will always be this way.
34290,"I've gone through this for 8 years, with 2 hospitalizations, 5 therapists over 6 years, and 4 years on medication."
34291,"I stopped medication and therapy right before turning 18, and arguably I was good for about 6 months, but then everything just started coming back and much worse than before."
34292,"Other than the medication that knocks you out(not suitable while I attend school), I seem to be extremely resistant to medication even at high doses."
34293,"I also had severe withdrawals upon stopping SSRIs, so I don't want to be on medication after the pain I went through with those."
34294,"She says I'm too old, and that if I go to a doctor they will just tell me I need medication, so it's not worth her taking a day off work to take me."
34295,I have been on the drug as part of a combined therapy/medication treatment for GAD and side effects of the drug have steadily gotten worse the longer I was on it.
34296,Should I try another medication?
34297,"Hey there, guys."
34298,I discovered this subreddit today and I'm really glad I did..it's nice to know I'm not alone and there are other people out there who can understand what I'm going through.
34299,"Anyways, I've suffered from anxiety for a long as I can remember."
34300,"I always thought I was just *shy*, but I now realize that it was more than that."
34301,I never thought much of it until recently.
34302,"Over the past year I've been having panic attacks, and even began to get depressed, but I never really told anyone about how I felt."
34303,"Reading comments in Reddit helped me realize that I'm to the point where I should seek help, and that I shouldn't be ashamed."
34304,"It's affecting my life and preventing me from doing things that I want to, and NEED to do, especially at this point in life (just turned 21) when I need to get my ass in gear."
34305,"I finally told my mum most of what I've been suffering through, and we went to the doctor earlier today."
34306,"He was very nice, and said it sounded like a lot of my anxiety was being triggered just my the stress of life at this age (boyfriend issues, school/tests, being kicked out of the nest."
34307,"growing up stuff) but he decided to put me on Propranolol, and recommended that I start exercising to help release some of my built up energy and help sort of balance things out?"
34308,"(which I've been wanting to do, but I was too afraid to go to the gym)  I also think therapy would be something I'd like to try, but I don't have insurance and it ca be pretty pricy /: so we'll see."
34309,I'm so happy and hopeful and relieved that I finally got some help; and I'm really happy with my doctor- he's very kind and not one to really push medications on you.
34310,"So if any of you are even questioning if you should get help, DO IT!!!"
34311,"Continuing to suffer because you're too afraid to get help is not worth it:(
I was a bit nervous at first that I would be stuck on antianxiety drugs my whole life, but my doctor said with this, I would only need to take it when I felt an attack coming on, or before a situation that would/could cause an attack (for example in my case, before my CNA skills test in front of judges)

There's so much more I could write, but I'll leave it at that."
34312,"I finally feel a glimmer of hope, and even happiness, for once."
34313,"Since a year ago I take Rendetil when I panic, its like a natural solution for anxiety (it has passion flower/valerian in drops) it kinda helps me in my moments, but a part of me doesnt want to depend on medication (althought it isnt like severe medication), i cant go out without my drops."
34314,I think if I do the endo and it comes back clear I need to seriously think about medication but I am scared to go on it.
34315,"I'm currently a junior in high school, and overall I've done well all throughout school (good gpa, academic honors etc.)."
34316,"However, I've been out of school for over a month due to my anxiety."
34317,My anxiety just reached a point where I could no longer go to school on a consistent basis.
34318,"I would walk into my first class and have the classic symptoms of a panic attack; heart racing, legs shaking, upset stomach, the feeling of being trapped."
34319,"These symptoms wouldn't subside until I ran to the office, told them I was sick, and went home."
34320,"It seemed like everyday I would walk into class, have a panic attack, and go home."
34321,This raised a lot of questions among both students and teachers.
34322,"Even on the ride to school I would began having a fit of anxiety, or just thinking about going to school the night before would give me angst."
34323,"Overall, I like my school, I like most of my classes, I've done well academically, I have a pretty good group of friends, but I just couldn't handle it anymore."
34324,"However, it wasn't just school that gave me anxiety."
34325,"Going to public places, especially places where I was likely to see someone I knew (grocery stores, restaurants etc."
34326,"), even getting a haircut, made my anxiety run rampant, but not to the point where I felt trapped as I did at school."
34327,"I talked to my primary care doctor about my anxiety and he was very understanding, and has given me a medical excuse for my absence up to this point."
34328,"I was suggested to see a psychiatrist which I did, but that didn't seem helpful at all."
34329,"My psychiatrist had the ""tough it up and get back as soon as you can"" mentality, of course with the use of medications involved."
34330,"After trial and error with one medication, I was recently put on a very low dosage of an SSRI a month after I started ""treatment."""
34331,"I was also suggested by my psychiatrist to see a psychologist for here on out instead for CBT, and have made an appointment for this week."
34332,"This SSRI had bad side effects for me, even on a low dosage, which eventually led to a trip to the ER and overall, a set back in my treatment."
34333,"I've had to lower the dosage even further and gradually increase it over the course of weeks, which is just delaying my return to school even further."
34334,At this point I just don't know what to do.
34335,So far I've seen no improvement in my anxiety and I feel hopeless and lost.
34336,"Although I've been able to keep up with some homework assignments online, the exams just keep piling up."
34337,"In total, I probably have about 25 tests, labs and quizzes to make up, which is pretty much 25 hours worth of work."
34338,"I feel like the workload is just too much to overcome by the time I get back, if I'm even able to get back."
34339,"I have no idea how I'm going to be able to make up all that work, on top of maintaing my current workload."
34340,"My school is being supportive for the most part, but even their patience is wearing thin as we've been vague with my ""medical illness"", for fear that they would be unsympathetic if we told them it was a mental illness."
34341,"I don't want this to get to a point where I've missed so much that I would have to repeat the semester, therefore I'm thinking that homeschooling for the rest of the term (2 months) would be the right move for me, although my parents are strictly against this."
34342,"I just feel like I can't go back, I'm nowhere close to getting my anxiety to a manageable state, I'm dreading having to answer to all the students about where I've been, and I'm extremely concerned how this will look to colleges, especially if I was to leave to homeschool mid-term."
34343,Just the thought of going back and being in the same situation I was in over a month ago makes me extremely anxious and depressed.
34344,Getting interrogative texts nearly everyday from peers asking what's wrong with me or when I'm coming back just sets of my anxiety.
34345,"This just feels like a nightmare that I can't wake up from, and is causing me to spiral down into a state of depression."
34346,"I figure I need meds, which kind?"
34347,"What kind of meds work somewhat instantly while youre panicking, if any?"
34348,"About three days ago, I ran over and consequently killed one of my cats."
34349,"I had just conquered my anxiety, or it faded, and then, today, I felt it."
34350,I feel on the brink of a panic attack.
34351,I don't take medication.
34352,"I used to take zoloft, but it didn't help, so I just never went back to get a authorization on another 3 month supply."
34353,"I used to go to therapy, but she never remembered me so we'd always start over."
34354,I stopped going.
34355,I suppose the underlying causes started when one committed relationship of my fell apart.
34356,"Then, I was in another very committed relationship, it fell apart."
34357,"In between those two, I lost my house in a flood."
34358,I was also verbally abused by my pill-junkie step-father.
34359,"Eventually after losing so many boyfriends and friends, I decided I would put all my love and trust in my cats."
34360,And now I feel empty again.
34361,"It used to be that I couldn't be on my own, even just in my room by myself - I'd freak out, have a panic attack, and have to call someone on the phone so they could soothe me until I cried myself asleep."
34362,"I'm just tired of no medications working, no therapists doing their jobs, and nothing going the way it should."
34363,"I wish I could just be done with this god awful, gut-wrenching anxiety."
34364,"Just as I was getting better, too."
34365,"If someone could offer me some kind of solution or help, I'd appreciate it more than words could describe."
34366,Should I consult my doctor and see if I could get ant-anxiety medication or what should I do?
34367,I have only one concern about the medicine and that's the suicide risk.
34368,"Also, how should I expect to feel on this medication?"
34369,Not everyone wants or is able to get medication for their anxiety.
34370,I'm posting this for those that are on the edge about looking to get medication.
34371,"I don't need medication when I should just learn to pull myself out of these situations."""
34372,I didn't want or even think I needed medication.
34373,"In all honesty, I don't know what he's been diagnosed with in particular, but he does take daily, physician prescribed medication and has a second medication for specific moments when he is overwhelmed."
34374,I was officially diagnosed with GAD when I was 25 but pretty much had it my whole life(I'm 31 now).
34375,"It runs in the family as my mom deals with panic attacks she takes ativan as needed which is very rarely, 0.5mg MAYBE once a month at most."
34376,My sister has GAD but refuses to treat it.
34377,I have tried a variety of different medications with no results and no side effects.
34378,I was first put on buspirone by my pdoc since I had never been on SSRIs he thought that would be a good start.
34379,"Dosage was eventually ramped up to the max 60mg and nothing, after about 6 months I got discouraged and stopped taking it cold turkey."
34380,"It was as if I was taking a sugar pill, absolutely nothing changed."
34381,"I moved onto the SSRIs, started with Lexapro 5,10 and eventually 20mg was on that for about 8 months once again nothing."
34382,"Moved to Zoloft 200mg for half a year, nothing."
34383,"I got discouraged and stopped cold turkey, no withdrawal symptoms no anything, after reading the horror stories on not ramping down SSRIs slowly I thought it would be bad but once again nothing happened."
34384,I thought I was literally taking sugar pills.
34385,"Doc wanted to try Benzos which I tried before but they did nothing, I have taken 3mg of ativan at once and felt absolutely nothing, tried xanax once again nothing."
34386,"The only time I ever not feel anxious is when drinking which I rarely do, maybe once a year I have a couple but generally I would call myself a non-drinker and I'm not about to rely on alcohol for relief."
34387,"I have read books, CBT, have no vitamin deficiencies, my bloodwork is normal."
34388,I tried various supplements with no results.
34389,"All of this is extremely frustrating and discouraging I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here, to try all these medications and have no effect, side effects or withdrawal symptoms is mind boggling to me."
34390,"The pdoc talked to me about TCAs but I'm not sure where to go from here, I'm extremely discouraged is anyone in the same boat and can give me some advice?"
34391,Has anyone had any success with TCAs?
34392,I'm on two meds to control my anxiety.
34393,":(

If I go to the GP, would they prescribe me more medicine?"
34394,I'm highly sensitive to medication so if I take one I get too fucked up but it's the only thing that gets rid of my crippling anxiety.
34395,[Help] I've had anxiety my whole life.
34396,I started getting treatment about 6 years ago and have been on all sorts of medication as I was diagnosed Bi-Polar.
34397,Almost a year ago I stopped taking my birth control (Yaz) and was then able to stop all my psychiatric medications save for Trazodone for sleep and Neurontin because I felt like I was in withdrawal when I stopped taking it.
34398,"After stopping Yaz I had minimal anxiety, depression, and just plain crazy thoughts."
34399,But it all came crashing down last month.
34400,"I've been having horrific anxiety, I'm talking constant sweating, shaking, crying, freaking the fuck out honestly, it's so freaking bad."
34401,"Nothing in my life changed, no new stressors or triggers."
34402,"Everyday I feel terrified, it's beyond anxiety, it's pure, unadulterated fear but for the life of me I can't pin point what I'm afraid of but with this level of fear you'd think I was facing imminent torture and death."
34403,I haven't left my house other than going to the doctor.
34404,I'm not even talking to my friends or family and my fiance has been handling all of my business outside the house.
34405,"It got so bad today that I woke him at 6:30 am begging him to stay home from work, which he did."
34406,He was scared that I'd finally reached the point where I would hurt myself just to make the horrific fear go away.
34407,I have only 1 theory and it's that I'm having hormone issues.
34408,"None of my coping skills work and I even took a heavy duty pain killer today out of sheer desperation and although I'm enjoying myself, I'm still scared."
34409,"My period is now 10 days late and I'm not pregnant, I even took a test just in case even though it's not possible for me to be pregnant."
34410,I've searched Google for a late period causing anxiety but all the results are for anxiety causing a late period so I'm kind of lost.
34411,Do any of you know if I could be on to something here?
34412,"I'm going to call my gynocologist on Monday to make an appointment and I'm hoping to get the birth control patch because that's the only form of birth control I've tried that didn't make me completely insane and I figured out today that the years I was on the patch we're my best, most productive years in my life thus far."
34413,Am I grasping at straws here because I'm desperate for an explanation that doesn't involve an escalation in my illness that I just don't think I can handle?
34414,"It's so bad that I'm thinking that if it doesn't get better soon I'm going to have to check into long term psychiatric care because I don't think I could handle living like this for the rest of my life, yes, it's THAT bad."
34415,My heart rate has been hovering around 100 beats per minute for the past three weeks.
34416,I'm probably going to ask my primary care doctor for an increase in my medication that's for lowering my heart rate (Toprol XL).
34417,"Please help me, this is horrible, I haven't slept for more than 3 hours a night for weeks and I'm just crying all day."
34418,"Benzodiazapines have never had an effect on me, I might as well be taking sugar pills."
34419,"Edit: I'm gonna add that I was doubtful about it, but I've been waiting to get on medication for so long that I thought I might as well give it a shot."
34420,So I started having anxiety for about a year now it started when I went to the hospital and had a really bad experience with the people before all this I was very active and out going many years in mauy Thai and mma so fear never really fazed me but now it's as  if I can't go a restaurant without having one I've seen doctors and all tht stuff but I don't wanna rely on meds and my family just get annoyed and say it's all in my head but they never had this so they don't understand and I'm the back bone for a lot of people and lately that's just been to much for me I guess what I'm saying is that it be great to have some friends that have anxiety as well who understand and have leaden to control it better to talk to thanks for your time guys
34421,I've been considering trying to find a counsellor as I really don't want to go the medication route.
34422,My doctor tried to humor me by giving my samples of some meds which I know are placebo doses.
34423,"I don't actually feel depressed just sometimes I have strange scary thoughts, or I can't sleep the neurologist gave me 0.25mg of clonazepam ,thought my family doctor recommended I take 50mg of Zoloft daily currently I'm taking neither I'm not sure I want to be dependent on medicine."
34424,"I have tried so many meds, different types of therapy and so much shit but I just cant to get past this stage."
34425,"Yes, medication does help to a certain extent."
34426,"I live with my mother (I am embarrassed about that), I have a boyfriend (also 26 and he lives with his parents)

I also thought nothing can be done, and in a way I still feel that way, because I am VERY sensitive to all medication I have taken throughout my life."
34427,I tend to have side effects that are worse than the symptoms the medication is meant to treat.
34428,That makes me VERY hesitant to try any medication.
34429,I really don't want to take medication.
34430,"But it still happen, and already tried with 7 different kind of meds too.."
34431,I'm reverting back to a bad mental state like before I started my meds (which I'm still on) and it's really taking a toll.
34432,They even doubled my meds!
34433,I haven't been on meds in ten years and my anxiety is catching up with me again.
34434,Does anyone know how to treat bloating/indigestion caused by anxiety?
34435,"It is stopping me from being able to eat enough calories, and I am losing weight."
34436,"Similarly, are there any medications that are known to ease up bloating and/or stimulate appetite?"
34437,Or any anti-anxiety drugs that cure this symptom?
34438,It is currently the only physical symptom of my anxiety and very debilitating.
34439,I just want to be able to live a healthy life.
34440,I want to start new medicine right away.
34441,I struggled with panic and anxiety for five years before going on medication after a bad breakdown.
34442,"Originally on the medication, I felt relief from anxiety for the first time in years."
34443,"I took meds, for about two months, but they didn't help."
34444,I'm thinking of going on a daily medication and was wondering if anyone has any experience with daily medication and could offer some advice for going forward?
34445,"We ended up getting high, which only fucked with my head, maybe because of my meds, I don't know."
34446,Just wanted to share a positive story about being on meds.
34447,No meds?
34448,Attempted suicide at 10 with overdose of medication.
34449,"I don't want to get medication that just makes me feel nothing, and then makes me super-depressed some day when I drop it."
34450,"I'm a 22F, diagnosed with MDD recurrent non-psychotic, and OCD (which is the closest match, but doesn't exactly fit - it's more of a clusterfuck of obsessive/cyclical anxiety and intrusive thoughts)  I've been on meds like Prozac and Zyprexa in the past, so I've experienced the, um, ""fun"" side effects of withdrawals."
34451,"Right now, I'm back to having apocalyptic dreams ever night (I've had them all my life, but they subsided mostly with the meds)."
34452,"I want to make this work, but I don't know if my experience so far is a sign that I should try another medication."
34453,I had an emergency visit to my family doctor and she upped my meds and gave me a few days off.
34454,"I keep having this anxious feeling like I need to change friend groups or like I'm immature or like I'm not cool or like my hobbies are dumb and it just comes from so much confusion and I'm so stressed out over it and I'm afraid because I honestly don't want to change but the anxious thoughts and I've questioned everything, my sense of humor and my friendships and my relationship and my taste in music and why I do this or that or why I believe in this thing or that thing and it's so distressing and I keep telling myself ""okay I just won't focus on it"" but it's still there brimming on the edge of my mind and it's so hard to just let it go and I've tried taking my medication and it doesn't help and I just want to cry but it's so hard and I'm seriously freaking out right now

how can I accept myself it's all I want to do"
34455,Should I try medication?
34456,After having an anxiety disorder since I was 12.
34457,(I am 18 now) I am finally getting some professional therapy.
34458,I've had medications to help me for the past few months and I was formally diagnosed by a psychiatrist last winter.
34459,Thanks to the medication I was able to walk in and talk about making an appointment.
34460,Anyway I am under a lot of stress right now and I though I would share this small victory with you.
34461,"Eventually, I think I just pass out from the sedative effects, but the panic is unpleasant and not what I was expecting from an anti-anxiety medicine."
34462,Any meds that just relax you without causing that lethargic feeling?
34463,Woke up late and didn't take me meds the time I usually do.
34464,"I'm on bipolar meds, and beta blockers for anxiety."
34465,"So, yeah, I was wondering if any of you had experience with this, for how long, what meds you might have been put on, your results, ect."
34466,Is there anything I can do to fix this besides resorting to therapy or medication?
34467,"I've been good about taking my meds, but for some reason today I am feeling particularly anxious and just full of rage."
34468,She advised that as I suffer with anxiety (not on any medication) that this sounds like a panic attack.
34469,"I found a new job at which i feel confident and relaxed and i feel the time is right to get off the meds, since i also take something for my migraines and for my thyroid and I feel like a walking medicine cabinet at times."
34470,What medication were you prescribed?
34471,I go to therapy and I'm thinking about going on medication but it scares me.
34472,"For those who take medication to help their anxiety, have you been told that you should no longer be feeling any anxiety symptoms?"
34473,I ask as I'm in between meds right now as my last medication wasn't working and my doctor wanted to try something new.
34474,"I'm still feeling a lot of panic symptoms, so I don't know if this current medication is helping or not."
34475,I've been dealing with anxiety since I was 17 and it has been a roller coaster of emotions.
34476,"I have been with my current boyfriend for over a year now, and I think I love him, but I'm constantly feeling like I'm missing something."
34477,"I always dream about falling in love, but now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever been in love."
34478,"I love us together, he is good to me and I want to be with him, but I also want to feel love."
34479,I don't feel a real connection with anyone though.
34480,"I try to talk to people about my feelings, but I don't feel like they ever understand."
34481,They just blow me off like it's not big deal.
34482,I don't trust anyone.
34483,"I've tried switching medications, I've tried Viagra."
34484,I'm running out of ideas.
34485,I'm so unhappy and I don't know what to do.
34486,I just want to feel something besides sadness.
34487,I'm scared and been thinking a lot about suicide.
34488,"If I can't ever be happy, then what's the point."
34489,I don't want to hurt anyone.
34490,"I used to pride myself in being a good person, but now I'm having all of these thoughts about other men and I don't want to."
34491,"I just feel like a sad, terrible person."
34492,I don't know what else to do?
34493,:(
34494,My sister used to have anxiety and she had the same medication and (I know I can't base my experiences off of hers) she would take the Xanax if she felt a panic attack coming on.
34495,"I'm no longer on medication but I think I should be, I used to have clonodine to take when I had something anxiety-provoking coming up."
34496,My medicine isn't working.
34497,So I have the choice of that or side effects from this stupid medicine.
34498,I just turned eighteen a month ago so now I stay at my house and watch all my acquaintances having the time of their life for senior year while I wait for medication to kick in so I can get my GED and then get a job and live in the real world because now that I'm eighteen my mom's made it pretty clear I have to get a job or move out.
34499,"I have GAD, and take daily medication for it."
34500,I had my first trip after experiencing it a couple years ago and I got a prescribed medication to help.
34501,I went into it armed with knowledge and was ready to fight it without medication.
34502,"I know I have anxiety, but I feel that I'm not so bad off that I need medication."
34503,"I have been experiencing these issues for about ten years now, I think maybe I'm in denial that I really do need medication."
34504,"I am still on medication- the doctor helping me when I was covered by student care was kind enough to give me enough refills to last until the New Year, so I have time to get settled/get a job/maybe be able to cope with my anxiety well enough to the point where I don't need the medication."
34505,"I think this post is going to end up as mostly a huge wall of venting, but despite taking medication (Celexa) and seeing a therapist once a week, my anxiety has continued to go through the roof over Winter Break."
34506,"I can't remember how I ended up being referred to a Psychiatrist and a Psychologist (who happened to be our family preacher years before), but the decision was made it was time to try and get me on medicine and I was diagnosed with Panic Anxiety Disorder and slight OCD tendencies."
34507,"I was prescribed liquid Prozac, GOD what an awful taste, but medicine alone wasn't enough."
34508,Because of the pain I was causing myself from not eating they pulled me from school and put me in an out patient psychiatric hospital to monitor my medicine intake and get me eating again.
34509,Around my 10th grade year I stopped seeing the psychologist and psychiatrist and my family doctor took over maintaining my meds.
34510,When I take new meds I fixated on the 'possible' side effects on the box and am semi convinced it's gonna happen to me.
34511,"My Prozac ran out 4 weeks ago, I spent three weeks not taking ANY meds because I was worried about switching meds and side effects etc."
34512,After week three of no meds I called the doctor and told him the concept of switching to Pristiq was causing more anxiety than anything.
34513,"Middle School : panic attacks, out patient treatment, begin therapy and meds."
34514,"Basically, finally saw someone to treat me with meds for anxiety and depression because I was having constant panic attacks following starting college."
34515,"I've been in psychotherapy for 5 years now and I tried out different medication (Paxil, Prozac; but also Valium and Xanax and even got dependent on it and had to do a very unpleasant withdrawal) but none of it helped me to beat this tormenting disorder."
34516,"I started to smoke weed (from a bong) about three months ago and at the same time I tried out a new medication, Venlafaxine."
34517,* They gave me *three times* the usual dosage of medicine that clears it up *and it didn't work*.
34518,Did I mention the usual medicine wasn't working fast enough?
34519,"* So when the medicine didn't work the way it should the *first* time, the anxiety kicked in and started overriding the medicine to give me symptoms again because that's what my body thinks is an appropriate reaction to stress."
34520,If the medication doesn't work *next time* I can probably expect a tube shoved down my throat at best.
34521,but i also dont want to be on meds.
34522,I was off my meds for about 3 days.
34523,"Going for xrays, got medicine and referral for physical therapy."
34524,"When it is probably just related to the original pain, or the meds, or whatever."
34525,I'm so anxious and wondering if there is anything I can do to quell the anxious thoughts without medication.
34526,"Before taking the medication, I felt like I had loads of information in my head that makes it hard for me to concentrate."
34527,ive had anxiety for awhile and it mostly occurs right when i wake up for an hour or so until i take my medication (xanax) and it will subside until the next day.
34528,"my question to you all is first, does this ever happen to you (waking up suddenly in the middle of an epic panic attack,) and if so...since i've already spoken to my primary doctor and i'm on medication (clearly not working effectively), and each time i try to make an appointment for CBT/therapy there is a huge wait for new patients."
34529,When I first walked in the Doctor told me I probably wouldn't be put on medication but after a questionnaire and an explanation of my symptoms I was prescribed Citalopram (20mg).
34530,I would love to go on meds or see a shrink but its just not in the books for me right now.
34531,I feel the medication at its current dose is helpful.
34532,"I know there are meds, supplements, cognitive tricks, etc."
34533,"We can keep it under some control with medication and for smaller problems with breathing exercises [to an extent] but it is there and you are not FORCED to BEAT it, because you can't."
34534,"Despite medication (that was working), I can't stop my thoughts."
34535,"This medicine will not let me cry to release any pressure building up, alcohol isn't helping me relax at all, and prayer isn't doing anything."
34536,"Klonopins, pain meds and drugs aren't taking it away."
34537,I go there once a month to get my meds and they assign a counselor that I meet once a week.
34538,Hi everyone I am new here and just wanted to explain my story and as for help/advice.
34539,When I was in high school I had anger management problems and was sent to therapy by my parents.
34540,Some odd years later and I am still in therapy.
34541,My therapist and I have a very close relationship and I can talk to him about anything and he will give me a straight up answer whether I like it or not.
34542,Anyways my anger stems from my anxiety and depression.
34543,And the past few months we have been talking about my social anxiety.
34544,I actually was thinking about taking a break from therapy for the summer since nothing was getting better or worse.
34545,But then this month my therapist moved to a new office in a huge business area (his old office was in a little hick town).
34546,So I had to fill out paperwork and stuff and he asked me what do I want to focus on for insurance purposes and I of course said anxiety and depression.
34547,We talked and he asked if I ever wanted to try out medications.
34548,At first I said I think I would be ok with it but since I had some time to think about it I am not sure.
34549,"My anxiety is pretty mild and serious episodes of trembling/eye twitching, panic only happens 3-4 times a year."
34550,"I can talk to just about anyone it's just keeping eye contact, new experiences, making new friends and keeping them after a class ends."
34551,We decided that most of my depression is coming from my lack of friends and activities I do.
34552,So I guess my question is what is it like being on meds for mild anxiety?
34553,I really just have images of me being dependent on them or taking it months before I get the right dose or type of meds.
34554,I have no idea what he wants to put me on yet probably beta blockers or anti depressants.
34555,I know I am probably worrying about nothing but it's my first time being on any medication other then for my allergies.
34556,Thanks a lot for reading and the advice.
34557,"Long story short, i've suffered of social anxiety disorder and depression since my early teens (I'm 22 now), been on meds for the past three years and they've really made a difference."
34558,"Ok so I have a tendency to get panicky when I'm away from home for an extended period of time, and in a couple of weeks I'll be going out of the country for the first time in ages."
34559,"It's only a short break with my boyfriend, but I just don't want to spoil it by having anxiety attacks."
34560,"The last time I went away I was given beta blockers, but they did absolutely nothing, and I pretty much had a panicky episode every day."
34561,"I imagine this was because my anxiety is quite deep seated psychologically, so while they supposedly block the physical aspects (sweating, shaking etc), they did nothing for my peace of mind and I just felt trapped."
34562,"At the time my doctor said she could have given me diazepam but she was reluctant because of the risk of addiction...however a few weeks ago I sprained my back and a different doctor gave me diazepam as a muscle relaxant, and after taking it for 3 days I had no issues with it."
34563,Would this help more than beta blockers if I was prescribed it?
34564,What other medications/herbal remedies etc.
34565,would you recommend for a period of 4/5 days?
34566,"No one thinks I can get better and neither do I. 
Fuck my medication, fuck my shitty friends that don't take this seriously and fuck everyone that can go around their days without this feeling holding onto them."
34567,"I've suffered from Anxiety/GAD for almost 8 years now and I've been through CBT and took both Lexapro and Celexa for a while, which I no longer do."
34568,I'm at a point now where I no longer get really bad or frequent panic attacks and generalized anxiety doesn't interrupt most of my life.
34569,"However when it comes to public speaking, my anxiety is at an unmanageably high level."
34570,I routinely have panic attacks during work presentations and even small group meetings.
34571,Even just one on one with some individuals.
34572,Even the thought of a future meeting or presentation can be enough to give me a high level of anxiety or outright PA.
34573,"It doesn't matter how prepared I am for the presentation, the anxiety is always there."
34574,It ramps up right before the presentation and my mind just shuts off sometimes.
34575,"The only thing I've found that has worked to prevent this is alcohol, but I know that's not the right way to handle this."
34576,I don't know how to handle it.
34577,"It is the biggest obstacle in my life, and I feel as though it is holding me back in my career and living life to the fullest."
34578,Is there anyone else there who has been through this and/or overcome it?
34579,"Anyone know of any therapies, medications, and/or strategies that could help me and others like me."
34580,I have to get past this.
34581,Right now I'm in between meds.
34582,what medication would you recommend for a returning college student?
34583,"Also, I am on Lexapro and Klonopin before anyone suggests medication."
34584,So when I could really be taking 1 to 2 different types of meds I'm really taking 5
34585,Maybe meds would help?
34586,I have generalised anxiety in addition to depression that is mitigated by medication which I only started about a month ago.
34587,"I almost feel like I don't deserve to take time off and get help, like everything I am dealing with doesn't warrant time off to sort everything out and get on medication."
34588,"I told my boss yesterday that I have anxiety and panic disorder, and that I needed some time off to get on meds because it was making it hard to do my job and making my overall personal life hell."
34589,"I need to get on medication that helps with food addiction, I've read that Wellbutrin may help with this."
34590,I'm scared I won't be able to get into see a psychiatrist within the time they need me to so they can fill out the disability paper work and get me started on medication.
34591,It has been extremely difficult to stop this medicine due to feeling sick/dizzy/etc.
34592,Long story short: I've been off my anxiety medication for about four days.
34593,"I know that it's not real and that when the medication kicks in, I'll be better."
34594,im taking an axiety medicine that helps and ive started an anti depressant.
34595,"I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depression a year and a half ago, but I hated the meds and my psychiatrist, I told everyone that I'll be okay I just need time."
34596,I don't know how I even survived without the somewhat helpful medicine I was on.
34597,I can only hope that the next medicine works better and has less side effects.
34598,"Luckily, new me called in on Monday and worked very little most of this week, napping throughout the day, taking medicine and going to bed early."
34599,"* taken medication in the past, didn't help, doing group therapy now

So I finally landed a job I think I MIGHT be able to hold down for more than a few days."
34600,"It's lessened with medication, but I'm hoping I'll pull out of it and my body will just go back to normal."
34601,"Thing is, it'll still be a couple of weeks before I get put on medication, and a few more for my body to adapt."
34602,"26F, cymbalta 60

I've been on Duloxetine (Cymbalta) 60mg for about 5 months, after failing other meds for 4 months prior."
34603,I have a few reasons for wanting off meds.
34604,"First and foremost, I've been seeing a therapist for the past 5 months with great success, and I've begun a regular exercise program, which has helped a lot on top of the meds and therapy."
34605,"I think I'm well enough with my therapy and exercise to talk to my doctor about cycling off my meds, at least so I can enjoy my anniversary in the middle of March."
34606,"I've been going to talk therapy for my anxiety, for about 7 months now."
34607,And I feel like my relationship with my mom has never been worse.
34608,"We don't fight, or anything like that."
34609,"It's not a passive aggressive, or aggressive aggressive relationship."
34610,"But every time I talk to her on the phone, I am just filled with this anxiety, and panic, and.... silence."
34611,I just let her do all the talking.
34612,"And I get out an ""mhmm"", ""yup"", ""oh yeah?"""
34613,throughout it.
34614,And a lot of the time it is because what I am feeling is really overwhelming and distracting that I can not even pay attention to what she is saying.
34615,"And she just goes on and on, she can talk to someone on the phone who doesn't participate in the conversation for quite a while it seems."
34616,And then what's worse is that I feel bad about it.
34617,"My feelings around my mother have not been great for a while, and that's one of the primary reasons why I started therapy."
34618,But I feel like therapy only made it worse.
34619,"I don't know, I'm writing this cause I just hung up the phone with her and I feel terrible."
34620,She's not doing anything wrong.
34621,But my head is spinning and my chest is vibrating.
34622,"******

When it comes to what triggers my anxiety, she's the only concrete one."
34623,Otherwise when I feel severe anxiety there doesn't seem to be an obvious cause.
34624,"It just sets in, and while I'm *""freaking out""* on the inside."
34625,"I am pretty good at keeping it from manifesting outwardly, except that I shut down most interactions."
34626,Become pretty quiet.
34627,Distracted.
34628,I don't talk to anyone about it except my therapist.
34629,I'm not on any medications.
34630,"I am a transwoman, 10 months HRT."
34631,"I am out at work, and aside from a few very minor incidents they have been incredibly supportive, and most incidents have been rectified in an incredibly timely manner."
34632,"Unfortunately, anxiety continues to rear its ugly head."
34633,"Whether it be from stress from my yet to be finalized divorce, work stresses, or just a bad day with the hormones, I still manage to find those days where I just can not function."
34634,"I have tried to limit those stresses as much as I thought was possible (unwillingness to accept my own limitations, fear of repercussions for not being a productive enough member of work, etc.)"
34635,"I did finally recently break down and limit myself from one, large, work duty due to the inability to cope with the stress it caused, and this only added to me feeling like I was unable to ask for help, or accommodations when I needed them."
34636,"I'm currently seeing a therapist for my anxiety (3 whole appointments now), and I am on an antidepressant and 15mg buspirone."
34637,"(Plus a handful, no literally, they fill my hand, of other various meds....)

Anyways, finally last week, a combination of hormonal craziness, therapy cutting deeply (yay tears!"
34638,"), and being piled on with too much work, I screwed up."
34639,It was bound to happen.
34640,"How I have not done it yet is the real question, but that is not the point."
34641,I screwed up.
34642,Now I am terrified I am going to lose my job.
34643,Freaking out several times a day and spiraling myself into more panic attacks.
34644,"I know that realistically, I probably will not be fired."
34645,"They are well aware of my anxiety issues, and the many changes in medications I have gone through in this past year."
34646,"That said, I am still terrified."
34647,What protections do I have under the ADA?
34648,"They were aware of the conditions/medications leading to issues, but no formal requests for accomodations (other than exemption from the one duty) were made on my part."
34649,Does this leave me unprotected?
34650,As a bright side to this event...
34651,I have learned that I must accept my limitations.
34652,"It is ok to swallow your pride and ask co-workers, or your manager for help, and I need to remind myself of that."
34653,How do I go about working with my employer to make necessary accommodations?
34654,What is it reasonable to ask for?
34655,Well there.... asked for help and I already feel a bit better :)
34656,"Between medication, the support of my parents (who were absolutely saintly about the whole thing, even though they must have been going to pieces inside), and an inborn stubbornness, I got through it."
34657,There are troubles with the medication.
34658,I recently got diagnosed with General Anxiety disorder and have been trying to start dealing with it naturally before I turn to medication.
34659,"Anybody else dealing with this, battling medication?"
34660,"I would have a panic attack a day and need to medicate when I began to feel one coming on, if I didn't down my meds quick enough the panic attack would be so overwhelming I would have to take double the dose and lay in bed or a calm/quiet environment."
34661,Now I have to take my medication spaced out throughout the day as prophylaxis to prevent attacks from coming.
34662,"I spend most of my time at home studying, and when I'm home I don't have any issues with panic attacks as long as I take my medication around 9-10AM and again around 12-1PM."
34663,I'll admit that graduate school is more stress than I've had to deal with in my entire life but I really want to fight this beast and take less meds.
34664,I can tell it's an anxiety thing because I can eat if I take a double dose of medication before meals or if I go out on the town with friends and have a few drinks(I do NOT mix my medication with alcohol) I can happily enjoy pizza or whatever afterwards.
34665,"Hi, I'm female, 21, and I have a therapist and a psychiatrist to handle my panic attacks, general anxiety, and mild depression."
34666,I take low doses of most of my medications because I seem to be very sensitive to them.
34667,"I was on Celexa 15mg for about a year and anxiety-wise, I felt great."
34668,"No panic attacks, stable mood."
34669,"However, I slept constantly, lost all motivation and lost my ability to orgasm."
34670,Lowering the dose cancelled out its effectiveness towards my anxiety problems.
34671,Boo.
34672,"I went off Celexa for a few months and afterwards tried Wellbutrin, which my psychiatrist said was good for sexual side effects, but might not be good for my anxiety."
34673,"Well, my sex drive went up the wall and my ability to stay awake and focus was amazing."
34674,"However, after a few weeks I started having horrible panic attacks, so I went off that completely."
34675,"Tried Prozac for a few weeks, didn't really help my anxiety at all."
34676,Now I've been back on Celexa for three months.
34677,Same deal.
34678,"I feel great mood-wise, but I'm constantly sleeping, unmotivated and can't orgasm."
34679,"Doctor gave me a little Adderall which is okay when I really need it to wake up and focus, but doesn't do anything for my sex drive and my mood crashes when it wears off."
34680,"When I try to bring up these issues with my psychiatrist, she doesn't have any real solutions for me except to try different medications."
34681,"She doesn't offer any explanations on which medications would be a good fit for me, trying to have a conversation with her about the difference between SSRIs and SSNIs is like pulling teeth."
34682,Does anyone have any experience with difficult psychiatrists or different types of medications for anxiety that might work for me?
34683,"I'd love to get a different psychiatrist, but it's not feasible at the moment."
34684,Thanks!
34685,"In recent years I have been able to function OK without meds or weekly therapy, while in college."
34686,"so asking for help is a no go, because they'd think I'm over dramatic, or whiny, or a drama queen or trying to scam meds or something."
34687,"I take my medicine, but I also am prescribed ADD medication."
34688,I was supposed to be asleep already but instead my ADD medication gave me an anxiety attack  that's lasted for two hours so far.
34689,"Go away, I hate taking medicine for you every night, I hate the fact that you're in my life and that you're invading every single aspect of my life slowly, one by one."
34690,"Hey r/anxiety,

Anyone else here involved with weight lifting/body building/bulking?"
34691,I've been doing it for a year but you can't even tell due to me being inconsistent.
34692,"I'm inconsistent because my anxiety causes a lot of physical symptoms, especially an upset stomach most of the time."
34693,I wake up with bad anxiety and can't eat breakfast until over an hour later and it has to be small meals throughout the day.
34694,My stomach is almost always generally upset.
34695,What do you guys do to alleviate the physical anxiety symptoms?
34696,I also have depression.
34697,"I go to therapy, however I just started and no, I'm not on any medications."
34698,Maybe I need something for the physical symptoms because I'm really tired of this.
34699,"So far I have tried these meds: Escitalopram(gave up after ~6months of no positive effects), Venlafaxine(gave up after ~3 months of no positive effects), Wellbutrin(currently on my 6th week), Mirtazepam(for sleep, 1st week), Quiteapin (only for a couple of days, for sleep), Imovane (for sleep, 1st week, wont get another prescription)."
34700,"I am getting real sick of these meds like Escitalopram, Venlafaxine and Wellbutrin."
34701,"I'm not bashing on medication, I'm just asking if anyone has ever actually felt better while using them."
34702,I still don't think I feel any differently now than when I wasn't on medication.
34703,I'm thinking of calling my therapist at home for permission to up my meds.
34704,"So I've been living with serious social anxiety for the past 3 years finally decided to get some help, I'm on medication, teaching myself CBT and have finally left the house and started talking to old friends."
34705,I never thought Id be prescribed medication since my anxiety symptoms are only really bad when Im trying to make friends or get to know people on a personal level.
34706,Going to University has my anxiety pretty managable as long as I didnt talk to anyone but I didnt want to have a lonely University expierence and opted in to try some meds to relieve some social anxiety and get to know people and make friends.
34707,I also feel like Ive failed but I think a large part of that thought process is because I have a slight taboo of medication.
34708,"Then there's this other thing, my breath, I can't breath whenever I'm anxious, it's literally suffocating I try to go to the balcony and take deep breaths but it doesn't help and I'm becoming hysterical...I read someone asking if meds can help them, I thought of asking too, 'cos I just can't take this anymore, I always shake, I can't type on my phone because the screen is small and my hands shake too much to type on it, sometimes I can't even hold a book because I'll drop it because of all the shaking."
34709,"I don't know what to do, can meds fix this?"
34710,"EDIT: The first time I went to get help my mom found me a psychiatrist and he just started lecturing about the difference between psychiatrist and psychologist and started saying that he can't give me drugs because i'm under 18, so will it be a problem to treat my shaking with meds?"
34711,"Recently he's been open to the idea of taking medication, but I'm hesitant to him taking anything and getting a dependence off of it (just from my personal experience taking medication for a mental disorder)."
34712,"I'm open minded however and because I'm just biased to medication, if anyone could weigh in and offer any advice on whether it's worth taking or not, I'd be happy to hear."
34713,I feel like unless I start taking medication he will leave me.
34714,"Hello, I am a 20 year old female who has struggled with anxiety for most of my life (since adolescence), but became the point of panic/inability to cope within this last year or so."
34715,"Things have gotten tough and through seeing a short-term psychologist, group therapy, and trying different medications (benzodiazepines work best for me), I have finally become able to control the monstrous state of panic that I used to let control my life."
34716,"I don't take medicine anymore for the most part, unless I'm feeling extra anxious that day."
34717,"Usually, instead I will smoke a cigarette, lay down and stretch, do yoga, etc., and the fits of panic go away quicker than in the past."
34718,However sometimes panic attacks do happen and i am grateful for my prescribed medicine.
34719,"I don't think I need to be on my medicine regularly (I haven't been for months), but I don't want to have my doctor take me off the prescription entirely because it really is there for me when I need it immensely."
34720,HOWEVER..
34721,I am very positive I suffer ADHD.
34722,"Having parents who ""don't believe in ADD,"" going to a competitive school that frowns upon such medicine and is very scrutinizing of it, and even my own prescription-happy psychiatrist has said ""No."
34723,"You don't want to be ADD."""
34724,(as if it were a choice).
34725,I'm very certain in this.
34726,"It is not self-diagnosis, it is fact among my peers and even some educators/bosses."
34727,I have tried different medications and they have made my thoughts so much clearer.
34728,"I desperately want to be put on a trial low dose, but ...

1) My doctor says I must rule out fatigue, insomnia, and anxiety before being looked at more seriously for ADD/ADHD."
34729,"- HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS PROBLEMS with their doctor doubting ADD/ADHD because anxiety may be the ""distracting"" symptom??"
34730,"If so, what did you do about it?"
34731,2) Is mixing downers such as benzodiazepines with uppers like Adderall amphetamine salts dangerous?
34732,"I know a few people prescribed both so I guess they MUST have the doctor's okay, yet something about mixing uppers and downers sounds dangerous to me, at least in terms of thought process, decision making, and emotional state."
34733,Thank you.
34734,"Once I get up and take my meds and go get an hour of sun I feel much better, but when I wake up life feels pointless and just doing those two things is so hard."
34735,I have been neglecting to take my thyroid medicine.
34736,I am sure that the fact that I have not been diligent about my medicine for a year and a half has really affected me.
34737,I have been researching ways to overcome my problems without relying on modern medicine and I wanted to see if anyone can shed some light on the effects of marijuana on someone with anxiety?
34738,"Hello Anxiety Gang,

I ran out of 2 medicines yesterday (or the day before?)"
34739,and had a LOT of trouble sleeping last night.
34740,"I know that I did sleep, because I remember certain dreams."
34741,"And I remember waking up at one point and feeling well rest, but that was like 2 AM, so I kept trying to get back to sleep...  

And now today, I feel like my head is a camera floating around near my body and the stuff my hands and legs are doing are like only distantly connected to my thoughts."
34742,Robotic.
34743,How concerned should I be about this?
34744,In my head there's not much emotion -- other than anxiety about missing something happening around me because I'm in a fog.
34745,Thanks...
34746,"After I graduated (and it didn't look like I was getting a job anytime soon), I decided that I was ready to go off of my medication, being back at home and with the support of family and friends."
34747,I am proud to say that I have been off of my medication for a month now and have been feeling very good.
34748,"Before I went on medication I would have really bad episodes, and this is only about 1/1000th of those, so I am not sure if these quick flashes are signs of improvement on my part or what."
34749,"I had fatigue earlier today after hearing about medication side effects, but not anymore."
34750,I understand that a psychiatrist is a medical doctor and would probably prescribe some medication while a psychologist would probably help me through therapy.
34751,"Are psychiatrist good at therapy, or they just prescribe medication according to your symptoms?"
34752,"EDIT: just to add, i'm currently in cbt, no meds"
34753,I don't really know how I feel about the medication.
34754,"I have seen therapists, and a general hold on my issues with anxiety that I've chose to live medication free."
34755,"Also worth noting that I am on medication for anxiety which I took before each test, so I have not idea why I am still doing poorly..."
34756,I'm open to medication but want to also try to take care of myself in other ways.
34757,I already am on medication which was working well.
34758,I have been on this mix since 2008 and have been on medicine since late 2006/2007.
34759,The medication was a success.
34760,"(I might not get replies on time) 

My boyfriend (a non-doctor) thinks it's irresponsible of my psychiatrist to prescribe me a benzodiazepine for sleep issues when I'm trying to quit pharmaceutical medicine."
34761,I want to be medication free because I feel it's the best option for me right now but I'm willing to try the Ativan.
34762,"Since we've been together, she recently lapsed into a big ""rut""
We've been going to therapy, she's on medication (for the first time ever) she's been officially diagnosed with Major Depression and Anxiety Disorder, but things have been getting better than they were right before we decided to go get help."
34763,I want to ask a question to anyone who has personally overcome their panic disorder without the use of prescription drugs (or knows someone who has!).
34764,"**Some background:** Many years on different medications, with different forms of therapy of varying effectiveness."
34765,"All worked to some degree, but most were centered on changing me, the individual, to better assimilate to the broader society (I am a sociology major and have many issues and anxious concerns about our culture at large."
34766,You can imagine how badly this worked for me.
34767,It also intensified rather than eased my existentialism).
34768,"Throughout all of this, depression and feeling of aimlessness was overwhelming, though."
34769,"I won some battles, but felt like I was losing the war."
34770,**Today:** I have found what I am passionate about.
34771,"It took a while, but I know in my heart that it is what I love to learn about and fight for."
34772,"I feel a reason to get up in the mornings, to engage with the world and look forward to furthering my education."
34773,"I am staying active, eating well and am making friends."
34774,"**On meds:** I tapered off of my medication and have been dealing with it alright so far, but have certainly noticed how my moods are more unpredictable (a lot of tearing up especially!)."
34775,"I have had to really tune in to what I am feeling and thinking at all times, as I have not been relying on medication to dull the anxiety for me."
34776,"I have to note that **despite getting off of my SSRI, I have experienced fewer panic attacks per month than when I was on it."
34777,"** I attribute this to really trying to ""take care"" of everything rather than ignore it or push it away, be it bills, school, relationships, negative thoughts, etc."
34778,It has been a bittersweet benefit of not feeling comfortably numbed.
34779,"I ask this question because I really want, above anything in the world, to be able to not only deal with panic (as was the case in the past solely through symptom management) but to really THRIVE despite a history of experiencing multiple panic attacks every single day."
34780,Was this possible for you?
34781,"If so, how did you or someone you know do it?"
34782,What tipped the scales for you?
34783,Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
34784,"I am extremely curious as to whether or not it is possible, through some form of therapy or mindset or what have you, to accomplish this goal and am optimistic for further progress."
34785,Best wishes and thanks.
34786,"I've struggled with anxiety on and off, most of my life, although it's only been about six months or so since I've been taking medication/getting treatment."
34787,"Though I had some minor setbacks with my anxiety over the years, my medication (Celexa) kept my head above water."
34788,I don't use meds and I don't want to.
34789,"If I don't take my medicine before a job interview, my heart will be pounding super fast, I'll get cold sweats, I'll feel light headed because I can't seem to breathe and thoughts rush through my brain like a highway."
34790,So now I take my medicine whenever I know I'm going to be in a nervous or scared situation.
34791,All of this makes me afraid of getting more and more addicted to my medicine and not being able to do anything without them anymore.
34792,"Hey, guys."
34793,I decided to switch my medication for something more effective.
34794,I've been taking celexa for three months and my anxiety still looms over my daily life.
34795,Is anyone here taking medications for anxiety and has found them effective?
34796,I need all the advice!
34797,"Thanks, everyone!"
34798,I'm going to my psychiatrist in two weeks.
34799,I've had my up's and down's throughout high school and collage and I am on medication.
34800,I've never taken any meds in my life.
34801,"I understand the medicine doesn't truly work until after a few weeks, but these introductory side-effects are almost enough to make me stop already."
34802,Anyways should I try using it again tomorrow with no anxiety meds or just stop all together?
34803,I'm not a very good person about medication and pills and often times I give myself an anxiety attack after taking any.
34804,"In that time I have become very suicidal, I have checked myself into a hospital, I have spent sometime in a day / in-patient program, and I have seen my therapist and gotten medication."
34805,I might call my primary care doctor and see if they can prescribe some more or a different medication.
34806,My brother is on several meds for severe anxiety disorder and my father started suffering from anxiety at right around the same age as I am (late 30's).
34807,"I have previously been opposed to medication, I guess I felt like I was strong enough to sort it out through other means, but I do not want to go to a talk therapist again."
34808,"Do you think a doctor would be opposed to this ""gimme the meds"" attitude?"
34809,"I didn't use the meds tag because I'm not really looking for advice on what med to use, I'll leave that up to the doc for now."
34810,"I'm really interested in seeing a doctor though about getting a formal diagnosis and seeking further treatment (I want to try medication, though I guess I'm still open minded about therapy... maybe)."
34811,"I'd rather try medication for a bit now, as I had a bit of a bad experience with therapy."
34812,Trying to imagine myself much more in control and anxiety conscious in the future without the meds was insanely difficult to comprehend a year ago.
34813,"But at the same time, my brother and mother are both on medication for anxiety related disorders so maybe there's a family history there as well."
34814,I've been off my medication for a while.
34815,I chose to stop taking it because it made me feel empty and joyless.
34816,"But now I have another problems, adding to my anxiety coming back and not being able to sleep, I'm angry and unhappy."
34817,*Everything* pisses me off and I struggle with motivation and mostly everything seems pointless.
34818,So... wtf do I do?
34819,Go back to my medication where I'm a more functional human that lacks any real joy and feels like a hollow shell?
34820,"or Stay off my medications, find a little joy here and there, be irritable, and deal with sleepless nights?"
34821,I can't tell which is better...or worse.
34822,I want to see if I'm a good candidate for medication or possibly get a referral to a psychiatrist.
34823,"I was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago and although medication and therapy helped a little bit, I still found myself struggling A LOT."
34824,"It made me think of a friend from high school who took medication for anxiety, and then I got really suspicious and even more worried."
34825,"To get through college I was on a heavy medication, which I dropped once I graduated."
34826,It's causing things to spiral out of control for me but in my opinion going back on that particular medication is not an option.
34827,"Hi all,

I haven't posted in this sub before and I am on my iPod, so I am sorry if I accidentally don't follow rules or proper formatting."
34828,I just really need some advice / comfort.
34829,I'm seriously struggling with my anxiety today.
34830,I went to my state's fair today.
34831,This was the first time I'd been in a massive crowd in quite some time.
34832,I thought my social anxiety issues had improved...but apparently only in certain situations.
34833,"I was in the vendors area, so people everywhere."
34834,"Between all the people milling around and all the others trying to get my attention to buy something, it was a complete nightmare for me."
34835,I couldn't get to the other side of the arena fast enough.
34836,It...was pretty brutal.
34837,"I had recovered from that, I thought, but here is where we get into the real meat of my post."
34838,I have made plans with my friend for her to cut my hair tomorrow.
34839,"Nothing unusual about this, except I have requested a different style than usual."
34840,I have finally decided to go through with shaving my head.
34841,"I'm a female, so that makes it kinda odd, but I mean it is already half-shaved anyway (yes, I currently have THAT hairstyle) so it just seemed like a natural progression."
34842,I've been super psyched about this...until very recently.
34843,My mum has expressed disappointment in my choice of hairstyle.
34844,She doesn't understand why any girl would want to do such a thing.
34845,"""But girls just don't do that!"
34846,"Girls have hair!"""
34847,"(Please don't envision my mum as a bad person, she's the best mum ever and her ideas mostly relate to her religious upbringing.)"
34848,"I am now a super anxious mess, practically crying, over this haircut tomorrow."
34849,I am that much of a people-pleaser.
34850,Especially when it comes to my mum.
34851,I just can't stand her being unhappy with anything relating to me.
34852,"I mean, it's easy enough to avoid, right?"
34853,Just don't get the haircut.
34854,But.
34855,I've been wanting to do it for years and now is finally my chance.
34856,Would my mum kick me out over it??
34857,Of course not!
34858,I came here because my friends aren't available (it's after 1AM) and there's no one else I can contact.
34859,I've been in counseling for depression / anxiety for 10 years and I am on a couple medications.
34860,"Tl;dr: super super anxious today, anxiety and people-pleasing habits taking joy out of daily life, need some support or whatnot."
34861,"I have had periods of more calm, I was given exercises by a pelvic floor physio, psychological help, some bladder relaxing medicine (which only works for a very short period and does bring some relief)."
34862,I've been taking my anxiety meds more than usual and masturbating more than usual to try to distract my mind.
34863,"* My parents (who I live with, and who would be driving me to/from my appointments) are on this huge ""natural cures are superior to Western medicine"" kick right now, and I'm afraid they'll disapprove of me seeing my gastroenterologist."
34864,Is medication the answer?
34865,"First, I'm not one to talk about this sort of thing usually."
34866,"I've discussed it with a few friends, but never really shown just how bad it is."
34867,I tend to cover everything I say with sarcasm and humor so it's tough to take things I say totally seriously I'm guessing.
34868,I tend to type a lot so bear with me on this wall of text.
34869,I've had anxiety and depression since the beginning of high school.
34870,"I've tried several medications over the past six or so years, but nothing has really had any effect from what I saw."
34871,"I'm on a couple things now which may actually be helping, but I honestly can't tell the difference between the medicine and life experiences right now."
34872,"I was finally able to get a job a few months back, started making money, and started actually doing things."
34873,"I used to be terrified of even going through a drive through, but now I feel like I can manage most situations along those lines fairly well."
34874,Maybe the medicine helped or maybe the change in lifestyle helped.
34875,I can't tell.
34876,"Anyways, a few weeks into working and I've got an acquaintance or two I speak with there."
34877,"I usually work overnights, but sometimes I have to cover a day shift here and there."
34878,Having to occasionally deal with customers has helped out a lot as well I believe.
34879,"One day, I met this girl who works there while covering four or five day shifts in a row."
34880,"She introduced herself first, we briefly spoke about when I had started and all, then that was it."
34881,The next few days were spent with me glancing at her every chance I got and trying to figure out how to talk to her.
34882,"Eventually, somehow, I managed to actually have a discussion with her."
34883,"It was brief, but it led to a bit more talking whenever we passed each other."
34884,"I was still impossibly uncomfortable though and she's absolutely gorgeous so that didn't help at all, , but it was nice to actually speak with her when I did."
34885,"Eventually the last day shift I was covering came up and I mentioned it to her, sorta teasing that it was nice knowing her and we'll never see each other again once I return to the night shift."
34886,"As her shift ended that night she came up to me, handed me a note with her full name on it, and told me to look her up on Facebook."
34887,I said I certainly would and spent the rest of my shift smiling like an idiot.
34888,"The next day I add her, she accepts, and it hits me: am I supposed to message her?"
34889,Was that implied by her giving me her name?
34890,"I assumed yes, but I spent the next couple days trying to figure out if I should or not."
34891,"A friend finally said that I was obviously supposed to message her, so I did."
34892,She replied later and even said she was glad I messaged!
34893,I figure that's a good sign.
34894,"We've spoken off and on for about a week now, nothing all that deep or anything."
34895,"The other night when I got to work, I noticed she had messaged me again."
34896,"She was asking if I worked that night, to which I said yes."
34897,"She then said that she was going to see if I wanted to hang out with her and her friend at her place, but since I was working we could maybe do it sometime in the future."
34898,"Now that's obviously a good sign, right?"
34899,I spent that night thinking and occasionally smiling like an idiot again.
34900,"The next day when I woke up, the anxiety hit me finally."
34901,"I've never hung out with someone I didn't know that well, especially not at **their** place with **their** friend."
34902,"I mean we didn't even have plans to do anything at this point, but I felt like throwing up and I could feel myself shaking somewhat."
34903,"I don't get full blown panic attacks thankfully, but this was a lot worse than my usual anxiety."
34904,"I can barely speak to her at work, what's it gonna be like outside of work?"
34905,I don't know how to do small talk and I can't keep a conversation flowing unless I know the person well enough.
34906,"Then, the what-ifs poured in."
34907,What if she **is** interested in me to some extent?
34908,"I haven't dated anyone since 9th grade because of anxiety (I did have opportunities to, but the same anxiety always stopped me) and I honestly have no clue what to do if it happens."
34909,What if she doesn't understand my anxiety?
34910,What if she doesn't understand why certain things and situations make me uncomfortable?
34911,Am I even her type?
34912,I haven't really been that close to anyone since my first girlfriend and I feel like I've almost lost the ability to be close to someone like that.
34913,Then it was what would happen to my routine.
34914,"My routine makes me comfortable, but this would change everything."
34915,I feel like it would be so unfair to her to have to deal with any of this.
34916,"I mean I'm not even sure she is interested that way and I'd be perfectly happy just being friends with her, but all these thoughts I can't control just messes with me so much that it makes me want to stop completely sometimes."
34917,"Right now, I'm trying to come up with an alternative plan to hang out with her."
34918,"Since she invited me to hang with her and her friend, I figure I could invite her to something we me and a friend who makes me comfortable."
34919,I'd tell her she can bring a friend along if she wants to as well.
34920,"Being able to talk with my friend will make talking to her immensely easier and doing so in some kind of public activity would take off a lot of the pressure I feel, but I'm still terribly anxious."
34921,I know these thoughts I have are dumb and are just that negative voice in my head that I can't block out.
34922,I know that everyone is a bit nervous when doing things like this.
34923,"I know I'm thinking 20 steps ahead when I haven't even taken the first, but this is just how my brain seems to work."
34924,"I want to get to know this girl desperately, but at the same time that idea terrifies me."
34925,"In the end, I realize that there aren't any real negatives here."
34926,"I may get a friend, I may get a girlfriend if I'm lucky."
34927,Yet the anxiety makes it feel like none of it is worth it.
34928,I don't really know what I'm asking for help here on.
34929,Just anything anyone wants to say about this is appreciated.
34930,"A way to calm myself, a way to get past the fear, or just a ""not-date"" date idea that might make things easier."
34931,Anything is appreciated.
34932,"Sorry for the wall of text, but thanks for reading if you did!"
34933,The only thing that helps is taking a large(r) does of meds.
34934,"I am living with less anxiety, depression, and self hate because of medication."
34935,"However, the worst way this manifests is whenever I have to take medicine of any kind, except for maybe advil."
34936,"She's on new meds for anxiety (which take weeks to kick in, she’s been on them for a few days), and we give those to her about an hour before bed."
34937,"""I feel like a burden""

""I hear voices in my head""

""I think about hurting myself and here's how I'd do it""

 	""OK, you put the sharp things away, here's another way I'd do it""

		“You hid the medication?"
34938,"Her meds were adjusted and she was sent home, but tonight (4-5 days after inpatient) said that she thought she needed to go back inside for more ""work""."
34939,I've just passed a week on the medication and have been smoking weed all throughout and haven't noticed anything yet.
34940,"I didn't tell anyone about my anxiety until around the time I left school and since then i've tried medication and therapy, neither of which have made any difference."
34941,"Not so much in how I subjectively feel - honestly, the Effexor makes me feel very jittery and unfocused thus far - but my IBS has basically resolved itself since starting the meds, which suggests that something's working!"
34942,"Anyone else had similar effects on these meds, and if so, did they resolve as you adjusted to the meds?"
34943,"And now, a year later, I am on meds, which help me so much, but I am already getting a ton of anxiety from thinking about what this year is going to be like."
34944,"I've got serious inattentive ADD issues, I've tried focus exercises but I'm afraid the medication will be necessary to at least focus so I can get through the semester."
34945,"TL;DR Points:

* Husband is dealing with anxiety/depression 
* Current meds: Viibryd, Adderall, &amp; Lorazepam 
* On intermittently leave (FMLA) from work but hasn’t been back in almost a full month due to him not being able to deal with negative co-workers (I think it may be something more but he doesn’t want to talk about it) *Our funds are running dry 
* Can't afford a therapist 
* What else can I do to remain supportive and help him go back to work/make a new move job-wise?"
34946,He's back on his meds and although he claims they are helping with everything (I do see a noticeable difference as well) he still won't go back to work.
34947,"Personally, I feel like my anxiety could be controlled with medication and the more I read about it, the more I feel like that's the right answer."
34948,Anxiety runs in my family and I've seen medication work wonders for family members.
34949,"Yes, I was diagnosed by a professional, and I have been seeing a variety of different therapists over the course of 10 years, taking medication, etc."
34950,"I've been on medication for a while, upping my dose whenever I feel like it isn't working correctly, and trying to incorporate grounding techniques or techniques to distract myself."
34951,Recently I was given new medication Oxazepam 15MG (For Serax).
34952,Yet I don't want to take medication at the same time.
34953,So should I take the medication or should I try to tough it out?
34954,"I feel way better with it, but I don't want to be on medication at the same time..."
34955,I haven't seen any doctors yet and I would like to try with some natural automedication without side effects now.
34956,"I have been feeling pretty ""on the go"" ever since I started taking abilify-- I don't know if this is incidental or the actual medication."
34957,Some quick background; I live in a house that is more or less an anxiety fueled hellscape.
34958,Everyone in this house has some form of anxiety.
34959,"I'm on prozac for social anixety, one of my roommates is taking like 4 different medications for anxiety, ocd, a sleeping disorder, and panic attacks, and the other two have never been to therapy or anything before but they clearly have a great deal of anxiety."
34960,One of my roommates is such a fucking pussy when it comes to dealing with shit that it drives me fucking insane.
34961,He'll do anything to avoid getting in a conflict with someone to the point where he now hates himself.
34962,The other two roommates are incredibly anal.
34963,This causes a metric fuckton of problems for me as I am the furthest away from anal one can possible be (there was a paper on my old dorm room floor that was stuck there from dried up milk which I spilled and never bothered to clean until 6 months later).
34964,I have to do so fucking much to make sure that they don't get anxiety themselves that it's driving me up the fucking wall.
34965,"I love to cook, and every time I make something I have to make super fucking sure that every speck was cleaned from the kitchen."
34966,I've been yelled at for wiping soap off of a pan with a towel before.
34967,IT WAS FUCKING CLEAN.
34968,WHY THE FUCK WOULD I HAVE TO RINSE IT BEFORE I WIPE IT OFF.
34969,THEY'RE JUST FUCKING BUBBLES.
34970,JESUS.
34971,The anal roommate who has OCD is such a fucking selfish bitch because I do so fucking much for her and she still finds reasons to complain about fucking everything.
34972,"I picked her up from class today, basically the only thing she says to me the entire ride home is how shitty of a driver I am (which is pretty shitty, admittedly, but fuck)."
34973,"After coming home from thanksgiving break, she was asleep on the couch so I gave her her 45 minutes (she doesn't allow herself anymore, which means she makes one of us monitor her and wake her up) then when I tried to engage her in conversation the first thing she says to me is I DON'T WANT TO BE INTERVIEWED RIGHT NOW."
34974,"Every time something like this happens (multiple times a day) my social anxiety kicks in and I assume that she hates me and doesn't give a shit about me and that I do so fucking much to make sure her needs are met and she doesn't feel anxious (the way I see it, she's way more fucked up than me so I should do everything I can to lower the collective anxiety level of the house, it's easier for me to change than her) but she doesn't do fucking anything for me."
34975,The other anal roommate is the biggest fucking dad on the planet.
34976,He's fucking 20 years old and he's so fucking concerned about every possible little thing going wrong and I can't fucking take it anymore.
34977,"The OCD roommate's grandpa is a real estate lawyer so he went through our new lease (apparently I plan on living here another year, XD) and said all these things wrong with it."
34978,One was that the landlord has to specify IN WRITING a time and place to pick up the rent.
34979,The Landlord texts somebody at the first of the month and just says coming by to pick up rent today so we leave it in the mailbox but Dad kept talking about how he never specified it in writing so what happens if one day he sends us a letter saying we have to send the rent to Des Moines?
34980,Then we're fucked!
34981,WHEN THE FUCK IS THAT EVER GOING TO HAPPEN?
34982,WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU EVEN THINK OF THAT?
34983,HE'S BEEN GETTING RENT FROM US FOR 6 MONTHS NOW.
34984,I THINK WE'VE FIGURED OUT HOW TO GIVE HIM RENT.
34985,FUCK.
34986,He fucking tells everyone what to do all the goddamn time but literally doesn't do anything himself.
34987,"He barely ever cleans, he doesn't share any of his shit (same with OCD girl) and he fucking treats OCD girl like a child, making sure she does her homework and shit which just makes her feel worse about herself and helps no one but himself."
34988,I can't leave this house.
34989,"I have no other friends besides these ones, who I don't even know if I consider friends anymore."
34990,I can't move because I'm 20 credits away from graduating college and transferring would be stupid.
34991,I can't live by myself because if I did I would never ever leave my apartment and it would be so fucking lonely that I'd probably kill myself.
34992,I can't talk to any of my roommates about this shit because whenever I bring it up they get defensive and angry and anxious and depressed and it doesn't accomplish anything.
34993,"I used to be able to talk about it with OCD girl but because it had to do a lot with how her anxiety gave me anxiety, she was unable to emotionally handle it and I had to stop talking to her about it."
34994,"There is nothing I can do except adjust myself, and that is fucking hard as shit because I feel like I've done all I can at this point to make these fuckers happy and now my only other option is for them to change, and I don't see that ever happening any time soon."
34995,"I told OCD girl to be more patient with me today, and her response was to sit in her room the whole night, something she only does when she is really depressed and doesn't want to be around anyone."
34996,I can't talk to the big pussy about it because he'll just try and change the subject and avoid talking about it.
34997,I can't talk to dad about it because he'll just get defensive and angry and it won't accomplish anything.
34998,I talked to my therapist about all of this and he said that I can't let the anxiety of everyone else effect me so much but how the fuck am I supposed to do that?
34999,Every move I make I am constantly reminded of the anxiety of everyone else.
35000,"I know a lot of it is irrational, but I just can't fucking take it anymore and there's got to be another way."
35001,FUCK.
35002,FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK.
35003,"It's not like things are newly becoming unbearably overwhelming, but I don't think I can handle much more."
35004,"Since being diagnosed with Bipolar, ADD, and GAD, I have been a human experiment for any doctor that has tried to help me."
35005,"I have been on so many medications this past year, it makes my head spin."
35006,But my problem with having a mental illness is not being able to handle *anything* everyone else can.
35007,On the outside I involuntarily claim I am fine but inside my head wants to fucking explode!
35008,And I have coping skills (fuck that term) but they only work to an extent.
35009,But I just need some advice.
35010,How do you maintain relationships?
35011,"I hope that isn't too vague, I just would like to be able to see my family more often or try harder I just don't know how."
35012,"Not only do I not know how to handle my mental illness yet, but I don't even know how to cope with doing my school work or my grandmother dying."
35013,I also take on everyone's problems and try to fix them and make them better but then it feels like a burden and I want to give up.
35014,"So how am I going to handle a job and college in the fall in a large, bustling city?"
35015,and pay rent?
35016,Eating?
35017,What if I have a mental breakdown and I have no where to go?
35018,I can't just stop college and quit my job to go to a hospital for 8 days.
35019,Well that concludes my first post to you all.
35020,I don't expect the secret of life and coping.
35021,"I just need some words of wisdom, if you will."
35022,Thank you.
35023,"Following a major depressive episode earlier this year, I pulled myself out of that dark place with the help of meds, lifestyle changes, and a good support group."
35024,I hope someone can help me with this...I do have pretty bad anxiety.
35025,I've been in therapy for over a year.
35026,"It's mostly connected with my job, but there are other things that make me feel anxious in my life."
35027,Sometimes it almost feels like my throat is closing up - like an invisible tiny hand is squeezing my throat.
35028,"I can still breathe just fine, but if I try to speak or if anything touches my neck I start choking and coughing."
35029,"I haven't thrown up from it yet, but I've come close."
35030,"Usually the feeling goes away in a few minutes, especially if I just let it happen."
35031,"Slowly sipping water sometime helps, but usually I just have to have my choking fit and let it go."
35032,I do not do this in front of people.
35033,I'm ashamed by it because nobody I know has ever had it happen.
35034,I don't know if it's a panic attack because I've had those and it's different.
35035,There's no heavy breathing or fast heart rate.
35036,These don't even usually feel like they're triggered by anything...they just happen out off the blue sometimes.
35037,Has anyone had anything like this?
35038,Do you know if it's anxiety-related?
35039,"If so, are there any medications I can take to make them stop?"
35040,"I've been dealing with them for years but they never really happened enough for me to bother with a doctor or anything, but they're starting to get worse, I think, especially as I hate my job more and more."
35041,Thank you...this sub has really helped me a lot.
35042,"The days are ok but the nights, without the meds are real bad."
35043,I have been on medication which has been upped recently (Lamotrigine 275 mg and 60 mg Cymbalta).
35044,I [22F] started taking prozac for the first time about 4 years ago.
35045,My anxiety was impacting my life and leading me into a depression spiral.
35046,I took it for 18 months.
35047,At that point I felt it was time to stop taking it.
35048,"I know that at least in part this was due to my parents constantly asking me if ""I really needed it."""
35049,So I stopped taking it.
35050,About 6-8 months later ther anxiety was back and seemed worse than ever.
35051,So back to the prozac I went.
35052,I took it again for about 18 months and then the cycle continued.
35053,"After 18 months and being asked if ""i really needed it"" and actually feeling better I stopped taking it again."
35054,Here we are 8 months later and I finally went to see a psychiatrist and she suggested I go back on it again since my anxiety has gotten out of control again.
35055,"Let me be clear, I have no problem with prozac or any other similar medications and I have never had any negative side effects."
35056,"I just worry that I will be relying on Prozac to keep me ""sane"" my whole life."
35057,I know I shouldn't feel like this is a failure on my part.
35058,"I take a thyroid pill every day and will continue doing so for my entire life and I have no problem with that (well, that kind of bothers me too, but I don't really have an option on that one), but the idea of taking prozac indefinitely really bums me out."
35059,"My anxiety and depression are just as genetic as my hypothyroidism, so I know I shouldn't feel differently about them, but I do."
35060,I guess I was just wondering if any of you have the same fears/reservations.
35061,Tl;dr going back on Prozac for the third round and am worried I will be taking it forever.
35062,"Don't know if I should be upset about this, or if I should just accept it as a fact of life."
35063,I often wonder if prescription medication would help me manage my high anxiety situations.
35064,"would think of me for turning to medication to deal with anxiety, particularly because I am typically the calmer one in our relationship."
35065,"I can't sleep without sleeping medication and have lost over 10 kg, If my new psych doesn't know what it is, I feel that I'm only going to get worse."
35066,I don't know much about anxiety and anxiety breakdowns but I know she a) takes meds and b) went to a therapist.
35067,I am currently seeing 2 specialists in the psychiatric branch of medicine in parallel with my regular physician and a support group.
35068,"I powered through the last two days, and as soon as I took the medication again I was back kicking."
35069,"Crazy how that works... Nauzene, cold medicine, fish oil, and lots of soup really helped me get along."
35070,Hi I'm new here.
35071,I have GAD and OCD.
35072,I'm extremely high strung and have intrusive thoughts.
35073,I'm always in a hurry and I have no patience.
35074,Everything is go go go for me.
35075,The tiniest inconvenience burrows itself deep under my skin and I get angry over stupid stuff.
35076,I'm unable to relax and enjoy things.
35077,"For example, I always skip cutscenes in video games so I can get right to the gameplay, I only skim when I read so that I get right to the point, and I get discouraged with my music when I don't improve quickly enough."
35078,"My girlfriend draws out her stories when she talks to me, so I end up zoning out before I get impatient with her."
35079,This is really ruining my life.
35080,My mom is exactly like me.
35081,"I feel that it stems from a fear of lack of control so I try to control everything and when I can't, it bothers me."
35082,"I'm always telling myself ""you can't control other people."
35083,"Only yourself""."
35084,"I was thinking of trying L-Theanine, but I'm on other medications, like antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers."
35085,I'm not sure how it would interact with those drugs.
35086,"I've also been trying meditation, but intrusive thoughts make it very difficult."
35087,The only thing that relaxes me is alcohol and I do not want to rely on that.
35088,"Anyway, thanks for reading."
35089,"If you have any advice, I'm open to suggestions."
35090,Recently it has been getting quite severe so i decided to try meds.
35091,"My SO has been on medication for anxiety for a long time, but recently has been experiencing a possible side effect of lowered libido."
35092,He suggested medication and a counselor.
35093,"I told him I wasn't ready for meds yet, and he was comfortable with that but still strongly encouraged a therapist."
35094,"I've been on medication for about a month now for social anxiety and while it's helped an immense amount, I'm not to the point where I'm functioning like a ""normal"" person."
35095,I have just started to take medication but still I have these out bursts almost daily now.
35096,"Recently, despite the medication the panic attacks and anxiety is coming back."
35097,I'm seeing my psychiatrist this week to see if I should adjust meds.
35098,"I have tried many ways to get my anxiety under control, none which have had any success and believe I've come to the point where I have to resort to medication, but I don't know if I can afford expensive prescriptions."
35099,So I had a panic attack three weeks ago.
35100,First one I had in three months.
35101,"Before that, I wasn't experiencing any anxiety symptoms, and honestly was the happiest I've ever been."
35102,Anxiety was a thing in the past for me!
35103,"Since that attack, however, I've constantly felt sick."
35104,"I know it takes a lot out of you and can drain you, but I think the problem has compounded because that initial feeling of being drained caused more anxiety and it has turned into a vicious cycle."
35105,"I've been to four doctor appointments, had every blood test come back fine."
35106,"I was late to my first therapy session yesterday, so I only just sat and talked with the guy and greeted him."
35107,"I live with my grandmother, and my attack happened at her house."
35108,"I rode it out a week over there and tried to deal with things internally, but they kept getting worse."
35109,"I went through a few cycles of heightened anxiety (usually when trying to go to sleep), bad dreams and waking up constantly...honestly, it's like I'm even dreaming about anxiety, so my mind is never relaxing."
35110,"When I wake up I feel that anxious feeling...like you get before the first day of school, or before graduation, or before a big sporting event, you know?"
35111,"After being awake for a few minutes though, I realize how drained my body feels."
35112,Like I've run a marathon.
35113,"Weird thing is, I went to my parents and spent a week with them."
35114,"I had some freakouts and cried a few times over this, and honestly after some rationalizing with them, a better sleep schedule, better eating habits, etc., I started falling asleep wonderfully the past few nights."
35115,"But, last night I went back to my room at my grandmothers, read a chapter of David Burns' book on anxiety and panic attacks (which seemed to feel great), and then tried to sleep."
35116,"I immediately began to feel this overwhelming sense of peril, and drifting into sleep was uncomfortable to me."
35117,"I've woken up with that same drained feeling, with my heart beating and some weird head pressure."
35118,"Again, I've beaten anxiety before, but this particular battle has been tough for me to grasp."
35119,"I really hate how my state of mind is contributing to exhaustion, and it's pretty scary."
35120,"I've been prescribed three different medications, but don't want to take any of them."
35121,"I've never had good experiences with meds, and since I've overcome anxiety before I feel confident I can do it again."
35122,This just really sucks and is kind of scary.
35123,I want to feel like myself again.
35124,"It took a couple of weeks for the doctors to give me the correct medication but I was also offered citalopram, but skeptical about the effects I rejected it and took temazepam instead to help me sleep."
35125,I stopped the medication but felt well enough and did all my exams.
35126,I feel my life isn't that bad and that I shouldn't feel like I do and medicine will only give me dependancies on medication to make me feel happy.
35127,"I felt pathetic about crawling to the doctor for help, like I should be able to come out of this myself but with the constant background feeling of nervousness and the fact that this problem never seems to fully go away so I felt I had no option but to turn to medicine."
35128,"I need help now, I have a psychologist appointment next Wednesday, but I need to get back on medication quickly."
35129,I have GAD and panic disorder and am on meds for those.
35130,"I am going on a bit but my main concern about anxiety therapy or medication is that I can't see it making the issues that I do stress about going away, they won't get resolved unless i act on them and as long as they are there I will always fret on them."
35131,I'm sad about the past and all I've missed out on.
35132,I feel guilty for treating people badly.
35133,I feel anxious and scared to leave my comfort zone.
35134,I feel terrified that this will continue indefinitely or get worse.
35135,EDIT:  Thank you so much everyone for replying.
35136,I didn't expect such a response.
35137,I feel the need to explain what brought me to the thoughts above.
35138,"I have agoraphobia and panic disorder, and was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2."
35139,"I counted it up today and realized that I had my first symptoms over 30 years ago, and that in the pat 10 years it's gotten worse, very quickly."
35140,"I've been on many, many medications and am on 3 right now."
35141,"Nothing seems to have helped as far as medications go, so I am trying to find a Skype psychologist."
35142,I think I need more than just popping pills.
35143,I was once a musician and performed before many people.
35144,Now I'm nowhere near that.
35145,But it's people like you all that remind me that it could be possible to get back to that place.
35146,So THANK YOU!
35147,Am I expecting too much from meds?
35148,"Last night he made a joke about my panic attacks, basically in a mocking tone talking about how I can't control myself when I start hitting my legs, scratching my face, hitting an object, etc."
35149,I got REALLY upset because I CAN'T control it!
35150,And he said I must be some 'special snowflake' because HE knows people who CAN control it.
35151,He understands to some extent the severity of my anxiety.
35152,The medications I've suffered through and the therapists that have quit on me.
35153,So I was shocked that he would make this joke and then argue with me when I said it wasn't okay.
35154,He EVENTUALLY apologized for not taking into account how sensitive I am and being insensitive.
35155,Usually he's not bad at all and this is a really off thing.
35156,He really just doesn't understand!
35157,And I don't think he'll even know where to start when researching anxiety so I was hoping for some articles/videos/etc.
35158,"If it helps, I'm 17, female, also depressed, bipolar, OCD, and PTSD."
35159,Don't know how much that changes things.
35160,EDIT: I showed him the FAQ.
35161,"When I first started meds, my mind had felt so clear and the world hadn't felt quite so scary."
35162,"I'm on meds and in therapy, but my parents antagonize me for not trying hard enough to make my anxiety go away."
35163,I went to a psych for a one stop shop of someone to talk to and for medicine if needed.
35164,"I've had anxiety for years now and no matter what I try, I just can't combat it."
35165,"I remove myself from situations long enough to cool down, I do breathing exercises, I try to reason with myself so I can attempt to logically see how irrational I'm being, I'm currently going to counseling sessions for a little over a year now and honestly, nothing has improved."
35166,"In fact, my anxiety has gotten worse and my day to day routine is becoming too much for me to handle on my own."
35167,2+ panic attacks a week is a sharp increase from 2 a year.
35168,I'm getting desperate.
35169,I at first wanted to conquer this without the use of medicines but it's looking overwhelming now.
35170,"I figure that maybe if I had the help of prescription drugs, I could possibly ween off them later and have my anxiety completely under control."
35171,It's a hope of mine.
35172,"Anyway, I know nothing of anxiety medications."
35173,Absolutely nothing.
35174,"I'm going to start researching before my next appointment and well, I kinda wanted some general thoughts from this supportive community on what is it that you take and has it been helpful for you?"
35175,"I know the effects will be different from person to person, I would just like some kind of stories or thoughts or advice to help make me not so nervous about bringing this up next session."
35176,"So I met with a psychiatrist and we agreed that I would go all out on my medication the first few weeks (I was on 40mg citalopram, which was raised to 60, and I would take 0.5mg xanax every day)."
35177,"About 7 years ago I had some seriously bad things happen in my life, and that's when I started taking medication."
35178,"I have stopped taking my meds, because they had developed a lovely side effect of making me sleep 12 hours a day and I couldn't do that."
35179,"The meds helped, but that time wasn't very joyfull, because those pills made me  dull and emotionless."
35180,And the meds helped to keep overall calmness.
35181,"The progress was signifficant, and while the anxiety after quitting meds increased alot, for the very first time i was starting to have a different view of life, and i started to react differently to my anxiety."
35182,[I posted this in /r/dp_dr but I thought you guys would appreciate it here too!]
35183,"Hey guys,

So a little while ago, I started college, and the radical shift in environment caused my anxiety to explode out of proportions."
35184,I was a wreck.
35185,"Now, before this point, I was always the nerdy, weird kid in my school."
35186,"I was shy, weak, and did not have many friends, but I loved the friends I did have."
35187,"When I went to college, I was separated from them, and my whole life spiralled out of control."
35188,"I was alone and had to in a matter of months, decide on what career path I wanted to follow."
35189,"I ended up taking on Graphic Design as my career, but that was only in the beginning."
35190,"After the first few weeks, I began to realize how alone I really was, and I began to observe."
35191,And I mean OBSERVE.
35192,"When I did, I began to not only look at the people around me (who were cheerful and happy), but also how I was always the odd one out."
35193,This terrified me.
35194,"After a while, I did find a friend group, but at this point, I began having the classic symptoms of DR (you all know what I'm talking about)."
35195,"I was freaking out, was I going insane?"
35196,The thought of that only fed my DR and it only got worse.
35197,"When on public transport, my mind was constantly occupied by my own thoughts of insanity, I was slowly separating from society, from reality....

At this point, I began doing what my anxiety-powered brain usually does: tries to find a solution!"
35198,"I read books upon books, webpages upon webpages."
35199,"I watched YouTube videos of people who have recovered, and often felt like I was the only one who will be stuck with it."
35200,I began to panic.
35201,"I went to my doctor, but he said it's something that happens to many people at my age and that medication could help, but he did not suggest it (THANK GOD)."
35202,I left empty-handed and often heard myself cursing under my breath.
35203,Why me?
35204,"I even turned to religion (I'm pretty much atheist, I've never understood religion)."
35205,"I prayed and prayed, and nothing happened."
35206,After that?
35207,"More research, of course!"
35208,"But, as time progressed, everything only got worse...

Then, at the beginning of my third semester of college, I began to observe the outside world again, and I realized that I was the only one thinking."
35209,Everyone else was talking.
35210,They did not worry about everything.
35211,"They did not overthink, overcomplicate, they had no anxiety."
35212,They just lived carelessly.
35213,"I tried just that, and slowly, it worked."
35214,I began to think less.
35215,"Instead of worrying over every situation, I just thought, ""It can't be that bad,"" or, ""it'll get better."""
35216,"And better, it got."
35217,I lived life a little bit carelessly.
35218,"I began to think ""whatever"" whenever I came to a difficult situation."
35219,"I put my mental attention into things that mattered (in my case, design)."
35220,"This helped tremendously, because I began to have fun, which was abstract for most of my college life."
35221,"When I did things I enjoyed, and lived life a little carelessly, I fixed my DR.

Now, by carelessly, I do not mean I did not care about anything and walked around like a lazy zombie."
35222,NOPE.
35223,"Instead, I just tried to go easy on myself."
35224,"I tried to laugh at difficult situations, as I knew that everytime something went wrong, I always made it worse by stressing over it."
35225,"Now, I still do have it on some occasions (like right after I get out of a movie theatre, which I have no idea why I do), and I still have it a little in public, but it's 90% gone."
35226,I took no medications at all.
35227,I hope this helps you guys recover.
35228,"There is a solution, and it's to stop looking for solutions!"
35229,A word of advice: Stress is only caused by being angry at the way things are.
35230,"If you stop doing that and just LIVE and do your best and have fun, it all goes away!"
35231,"TL;DR: Live life a little carelessly (say, ""whatever,"" when it tough situations)."
35232,Stop worrying over the small things.
35233,Put your attention into things that matter.
35234,"Find a hobby you love to do, and get good at it."
35235,Stop looking for solutions.
35236,It does get better!
35237,"Today I am physically sick, shakey, hot and cold, and almost passed out once or twice (granted I haven't eaten in 2 days), and just want to make it through this crap so these meds can kick in and I can start healing and making my life better."
35238,"My anxiety disorder has taken a turn for the worst and I cant afford meds or therapy, and the only anxiety books I have found have been too much I need simple quick and natural ways to help while experiencing a panic attack."
35239,At one point she suggested I see a medical doctor for a prescription for meds.
35240,I feel like it may very well be time for me to seek medication if a phone call can send me into such a state.
35241,The truth is I really don't want to take meds.
35242,I have friends who are trying to find the right medication or combo and sometimes they actually feel worse.
35243,I would love to hear about some other people's experience with starting medication for their anxiety and if anyone else struggles with the phone causing them extreme anxiety.
35244,My daughter has severely high anxiety imo along with ADHD and the meds she just recently switched to are making it worse.
35245,Currently I'm treating my bad attacks with Ativan because I prefer to not be on a daily medication if I can avoid it.
35246,"I have never been on medication, and I do not have the desire to start medication."
35247,I would just like to know if anyone else has seen improvements with anxiety without medication using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
35248,"I have a lot of faith in myself because I have managed my anxiety pretty well without the help of therapy or medication, but right now, since I am away from home, I could use a little help."
35249,"It l was a crazy year I went through till medication finally evened out my anxiety to make me feel normal again with my memories, but I feel I need answers as to how this happened."
35250,"He then told me they are permanent and there is nothing I or he can do.he then starts telling me because I'm worried about stretch marks, he wants me to take medication because I used to be on medication for anxiety."
35251,"However, I went on and off anxiety medicine with my doctor up in school we both decided I was better not taking it."
35252,But the guy kept telling me I was way too anxious about stretch marks and kept lecturing me to take medication.
35253,He starts telling me because of the way I answered his question (I said one arm was more flexible than the other) he wants me on medication for anxiety.
35254,he kept hounding me that I need to go on meds but wouldn't talk to me about the stretch marks!
35255,Maybe I'm a little insecure due to stretch marks but I don't see how that makes me need immediate medication.
35256,Which I found really rude because I WENT IN to the doctor's office for help and we both decided medicine wasn't the right decision.
35257,I felt really bullied by this guy and I think it is extremely unfair to say because I answered certain questions a certain way I need medication.
35258,I asked him on what medical basis could he tell me I need medication and he said it's because I worry about stretch marks and if I am not worrying about stretch marks I'll worry about something else.
35259,Should I go on meds or was this doctor an asshole?
35260,"I'm an adult, I have a career, I got myself off meds."
35261,Has anyone had any success overcoming these sort of symptoms without medication?
35262,"The meds helped my depression and agoraphobia, but I couldn't handle the anxiety well other than with small doses of xanax to curb the panic attacks."
35263,"I'm on new meds to help with the anxiety, but they aren't doing a ton."
35264,I've been struggling with depression and anxiety most of my life.
35265,"I had a bit of a rough start from grades 1-10 wherein I was bullied, assaulted, and ostracized a lot."
35266,I had a psych admission when I was 15 for an inability to cope and suicidal ideation.
35267,"I never stuck with the medications because I was a dumb teenager who felt they changed me into someone I didn't like (namely a bubbly, airheaded, person)."
35268,I've struggled on/off since I moved out of my parent's house in 2006 but I was doing ok while I was living on my own.
35269,"I was happy, for the first time in a long while."
35270,"I had no friends (didn't have any in high school either), and almost no social life outside of working evening shifts, but I was happy."
35271,"I'd go on day trips by myself, explore the new city I moved to, etc."
35272,"I mean, I was still anxious and depressed sometimes; I'd get in a rut wondering what the heck I'd done with my life; feeling like everyone I ever knew had surpassed me and was doing so much better and there was me, sitting stagnant, but I was able to come out of that rut fairly easy."
35273,"Then, my job was outsourced and I moved home in early 2012."
35274,"Ever since then, being in my mid-late twenties, living at home with parents who have their own issues (co-dependency, father with anger issues, mother with control issues and depression and anxiety), my anxiety has grown to the point that I gained 25 pounds in the past year, I went from being able to get up at 10 a.m. to do things to not being able to pull myself out of bed until 1:30 or 2 p.m. to get ready for work by 4 p.m., from taking my dog for a walk every day to being unable to remember WHEN I last took her for a walk, finding myself being more bitchy, sarcastic, and actually finding a perverse pleasure in being almost like a bully to my parents when they exasperate me - which of course makes them feel bad which then makes me feel bad."
35275,I also have a harder time getting out of that rut when I see someone I used to go to school with doing so well.
35276,"The negative thoughts come in about how I haven't done this or that, or why couldn't i be like so-and-so and do that?"
35277,and so-and-so just had a baby and yea I don't ever want kids but at least that'd be something productive!
35278,"etc, etc."
35279,"I talked to my family doctor and she put me on citalopram, but it was giving me body jolts and shocks."
35280,"I stopped taking it, things got worse in September and October."
35281,I told her I wanted to see a specialist.
35282,I had my first meeting with a psychiatrist today and I was really nervous going in.
35283,"I don't agree with some of the stuff she said (I don't believe my parents are really ""toxic"" so much as they can be trying and frustrating) but I just feel so relieved to talk to her..to get my frustrations off my chest without her being like my family doctor and telling me ""don't stress about stuff you can't change."""
35284,"I know I can't change my living arrangements right now, financially it's just not possible, but give me some coping skills to work with what I do have!"
35285,The psychiatrist basically pinpointed a big thing for me: I isolate myself.
35286,"Because of being picked on and harassed for 10 years in school, I have a hard time trusting people and connecting with people."
35287,That was a huge thing for someone to say to me.
35288,"I mean, I kind of felt it myself, but..for her to hone right in and say it and then follow it up with ""the way you experienced those formative years..it's no wonder you're having difficulties."
35289,"I know it's hard, but don't beat yourself up over it - we'll help you."""
35290,"I'm going to take her recommendations to heart: get out of the house more and get involved in a group somehow, get more exercise (since I desperately need it and I know, even though I am overweight/obese, I feel better after I exercise) in the form of swimming 3 times a week while my sister has afternoon classes at the University, take my dog for a walk at least twice a week, take the medication she prescribed me, and not weigh myself every day since weight fluctuations have been bringing on the anxiety and the negative thoughts in my head."
35291,"After almost 2 hours, as I was leaving, she gave me a hug."
35292,"I was so nervous going to see her, but I feel so...relieved I did and so..hopeful that I can overcome this, that I can get a handle on it."
35293,It's a very wonderful feeling.
35294,"Sorry, long post, don't have anyone else to really share this with."
35295,"I told my mom (who bugged me about what doctor I was seeing when I got back) about what she said about getting involved with a group and getting out of the house, and her response was to scoff and say ""I can't see you doing that."
35296,"I think you're just fine the way you are."""
35297,"Ah well, baby steps."
35298,"Alright so, to keep it short: I was on a medication for about 2 1/2 years, and recently decided to get weened off."
35299,"After fighting it for so long, fighting the stigma and what people would think of me being on the medication, thinking about how all of my friends aren't on any psych meds, I called my psychiatrist today and finally got a prescription."
35300,"Prior to getting off of the medication, my anxiety was relatively at the range of acceptable, and I would do well around others, amazingly actually."
35301,"For some reason, I'm having such a hard time shaking the fact that so many ""normal"" people I know aren't on meds, even my two brothers, who've had little trouble with social anxiety, or anxiety in general."
35302,"(It also probably stems from my two old roommates, both of which talked mad shit about the third for being on medication."
35303,Only problem with that is that I hate the way medicine makes me feel.)
35304,"My mom is an anxiety medicine addict who was recently cut off so she's no use to me and my dad's a narcissist, so naturally, my problems don't exist and are only in my head."
35305,"My psychiatrist said it's very common that people are able to successfully retire from these meds, so I do have good hopes of being able to live a normal and SSRI free life some point."
35306,"ANYWAY, I'm going to take some medication to help me sleep (gravol, probably, an anti-nauseate), but I just want to fix this bloody thing now."
35307,She has meds and they work perfectly but ironically she has anxiety about over-medicating.
35308,"My psychiatrist is amazing, I've been seeing him for 2+ years and he is *very* well respected, and at this point and with my panic attacks that end in me fainting, he trusts me with my meds and shit."
35309,"I've been stockpiling what extra meds I can, but it isn't going to be enough."
35310,"He did mention that, if we have to, we can have a family member airmail additional meds to me (not sure if legal, even if it's all under my name and valid US prescription etc."
35311,I have no idea what I'm going to do If I run out of my meds.
35312,My anxiety's gotten to the point where my 'normal' meds don't really do the trick anymore and it's terrifying me.
35313,The meds I got that were supposed to help me (truxal) are heavily fucking with me.
35314,"I want to help him find his solution, but I don't want to just throw prescription medicine at him and give him labels so he can feel like an outcast.I love my brother so much and I guess what I'm finally trying to say here is : has anyone heard of anybody going through this or have gone through this themselves."
35315,"((This metaphor would like to remind you that if during the time you are getting to a therapeutic level on medication you have thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself/others, or your symptoms get worse..."
35316,Transitioning meds sucks.
35317,On a more helpful note: what has helped you during medication transitions?
35318,"Background: been diagnosed with depression/anxiety since I was 12, medications starting 18, dropped out of college (United States) at 22 due to psychological burden, and back in school (part-time, part-time work) in my late 20's now."
35319,"I'm an above-average student: I average at an A- to B+ on homework and discussions, but I'm a ***goddamned anxious wreck*** when taking tests, and it usually ruins my grade for the course."
35320,"I understand anxiety and depression are considered Learning Disabilities, but I've always shied away from enrolling as LD because I'm honestly not certain whether future employers - or prospective graduate schools - might see that on my record and look down upon it."
35321,"So, does anyone have any insights?"
35322,"Any experience, current and/or former?"
35323,What exactly could/do Universities do for the LD in terms of test-taking?
35324,"I brushed it off, but knew I wanted to talk to my doctor about my recent anxiety since I had only been taken off medication a little less than a year."
35325,Should I get medication?
35326,I take 90mg of Cymbalta every day.
35327,"Today was Canada day, so tomorrow is a holiday."
35328,I forgot to include this when I evaluated how much I had left.
35329,I have one 90 mg dose left.. and I work tomorrow.
35330,"I'm skipping it tonight, taking it tomorrow night."
35331,I won't be able to re-fill my prescription until Tuesday at around 6 PM MST.
35332,"I've only missed a days dose in a couple years, and it somewhat messed me up."
35333,Don't be like me.
35334,"Stock up on your meds, if you take them."
35335,"This was easily avoided, and although it won't be TOO bad, but I should be on top of this."
35336,You should too!
35337,":)

Please take a moment to think/see what you have left."
35338,* Ps.
35339,Now would also be a good time to check ALL of your medications to remove anything which has expired.
35340,"Bag them up and bring them to a pharmacy to destroy, don't toss it out!"
35341,Thanks everyone.
35342,:)
35343,I'm go to the doctor today to make sure there's nothing wrong but I'm probably going to get some sort of medication.
35344,"I'm 16, what medication would I probably get?"
35345,Should I get medication or see a therapist?
35346,Being given a low dose of a medication has cleared my mind considerably.
35347,"While I was able to focus on many things on my mind all the time before taking meds, I can't exactly say I can particularly ""focus."""
35348,"(I do have ADD that I am currently not taking any meds for, maybe thats why)."
35349,"For background, yes, I've taken meds, seen doctors, tried everything."
35350,I've consulted a doctor regarding the scalp condition but I refuse to take medication for the anxiety itself.
35351,"I went on medication and when I felt I was doing OK, I came off it and it got even worse, then from what I assume was the last of the SSRI leaving my system, depression set it."
35352,I'm not on any meds and don't see a therapist.
35353,There is a long history of anxiety that runs through both sides of my family.
35354,I was diagnosed and started medication around 19.
35355,I have tried several medications and am currently on Celexa.
35356,"While it works fine to stop any small attacks, here lately they have been getting worse and worse."
35357,"I had to call in to work on Friday because I had a ""big"" attack Thursday night that carried over into Friday."
35358,"( small clarification here: when I say ""big"", I mean it turned me into a large sobbing ball incapable of leaving my apartment)."
35359,"I know that most of the time my emotions trigger my attacks, however with this one and the previous ""big"" one, I was unable to identify what exactly triggered them."
35360,Its basically getting to the point now where I am becoming so depressed and anxious that I no longer want to leave my apartment at all.
35361,I just don't know where to go from here.....
35362,I started medication last Tuesday and my psychiatrist said to take 5 mg (split the pill) for a week.
35363,"To be honest, I've never felt comfortable about medication, so I told her that I wouldn't want to do meds."
35364,And it would be much appreciated if you gave me some insight into other meds.
35365,"2) Hence, medication without therapy will not provide help in every case, because pills will not change your character, they will not give you the tool for controlling your emotions."
35366,I did not use any medicine.
35367,"If you are interested in methods which helped me to get rid of these diseases please read my article, how to get rid of panic attacks without medication."
35368,"http://nperov.com/health/how-to-get-rid-panic-attacks-without-medication/

Did my advice help somebody to get rid of panic attacks?"
35369,"It's kinda stupid, and while I don't think it's something that needs medicine for, since I don't usually dwell on it and these thoughts are actually quite rare, they're still annoying when I just want to talk to some friends!"
35370,"I know it's possible, but it started alot after then the meds started with their treatment."
35371,"Anxiety had been an issue of mine for a while, but its been worse and more prominent these last couple of weeks (which I'm sure has a lot to do with classes and everything starting up again)."
35372,I constantly overanalyze everything that I say to people during the day.
35373,"I try not to, but I always come home and everything that I said and did that day plays in my head over and over."
35374,It makes me get headaches and puts that sinking pit feeling in my stomach.
35375,It's just never ending anymore and I just want it to stop.
35376,"I don't know where to go fro here, though."
35377,Should I look at trying to get a prescription for anti-anxiety medications or what?
35378,I wouldn't even know where to go or what to say.
35379,"I'm also at college out of state, so going to my regular doctor isn't an option (plus this just isn't something I want to discuss with my mom for a multitude of reasons)."
35380,Thanks in advance ya'll!
35381,"I've tried medicine, therapy, nutrition, chiropractic care, journaling...."
35382,I've never really felt brain zaps before but I do know they can be common with SSRIs and anxiety medication.
35383,"The last few months I've been working on meds, upping dosages, and weaning off."
35384,is it the meds?
35385,"I went to the local student health center for sleep medication (doxepin), and it worked for maybe two weeks then it stopped."
35386,"I wanted Welbutrin,  but he suggested Strattera since it worked in a different manner, as in it isn't a stimulant like other meds."
35387,"I am so afraid to start meds, though."
35388,I love studying medicine but get so uptight when it comes to facing clinical examinations.
35389,I'm tempted to see a doctor about it again because I feel like I can't face going back to medicine.
35390,"I see a therapist and she is talking about putting me on medication, we didn't talk the specifics but I mentioned it to my parents who are extremely anti medication and think I just need to find a way to ""deal with it"" like ""normal people"" do."
35391,I think it will really help me if I get put on a medication because my anxiety gets me to the point where I get so physically ill and i'm extremely uncomfortable in even small situations.
35392,"So like.. for the average person, meds work fine."
35393,I don't think I need to go to the ER but I am wondering if anyone else is really sensitive to meds and if I fucked up big time
35394,I saw my psychologist today and couldn't admit to the paranoia I have harbored since that recent incident where R/fatpeoplehate (FPH) was closed &amp; the front page was saturated with people actively hating &amp; mocking fat people.
35395,It seems so silly but i can't get it out of my mind.
35396,"I have always been fat as I have been depressed most of my life &amp; the combination of weight-gaining antidepressant medications, emotional eating &amp; bullying has made my weight a continual challenge &amp; constantly impedes my sense of self worth."
35397,I knew some people didn't much respect fat people or liked to mock them; but I didn't think so many adults did &amp; that there was so much hatred.
35398,"I Feel Continually paranoid in public of people taking my photograph to mock me on the Internet, or this dirty look a stranger gave me is about my weight &amp; how I'm a burden on the tax system &amp; should go die."
35399,Just now the cashier at the bottle shop brought up all my anxieties &amp; rage I had an argument with my BF because I couldn't get her out of my mind &amp; How's she's probably a subscriber of FPH &amp; sees me as subhuman or something.
35400,"I felt so angry from carrying all this on my shoulders for the last few weeks &amp; feeling so over it i wanted to get her fired &amp; punch her on the face, etc."
35401,I just don't know what to do.
35402,I want to die.
35403,No medication.
35404,"If that means having a little back up from some meds, so be it."
35405,He initially refused to give me some meds because he is very much aware of the implications.
35406,"So now I'm divided, it kind of helped me yesterday night but now I'm really panicky and fearful about possible sudden death because of sleep medicine."
35407,The doctor prescribed my anti-anxiety meds and had me schedule an apt.
35408,I never took the meds because I was scared to take them and I canceled my apt with the psychiatrist.
35409,"I went in and out a couple of hospital holds, but all they did was give me medicine, and nothing helped."
35410,"I've been on several different meds before and they've helped, but since getting pregnant two years ago I've not been on anything and been able to cope."
35411,Anything to avoid while on the medication?
35412,I'm planning on continuing therapy while on the medication and am hoping it will take the edge off of the obsessive thoughts so I can implement what I've learned cognitively into everyday function.
35413,Any other info about the medication you feel is important would also be greatly appreciated
35414,"And then, I forgot to take my SSRI medication yesterady."
35415,Thankfully I have this medication.
35416,I may believe the medication has lost its effectiveness because I forgot to take it on time.
35417,"*Note: My Depression is now well controlled with medication, and no longer interferes with my daily life, though I still have the occasional ""bad day."""
35418,"I'm on medicine that helps me, but I don't want to be."
35419,"I've been struggling with GAD and agoraphobia for as long as I can remember, and when I started seeing my family doctor and getting medicated I thought that my life would get so much better."
35420,"Instead, my anxiety is now surrounding thoughts and decisions about the medications."
35421,"I'm typing this because I want a second opinion, sometimes I think it would be better if I just dealt with my slew of problems without the medicine."
35422,I just don't know anymore.
35423,It all started when I got on Paxil last year.
35424,"It helped me significantly with my anxiety, but I gained almost 20 pounds from the medication that I still can't get off with proper diet and exercise."
35425,I am miserable and this weight gain made it completely not worth it for me.
35426,(I have body image issues because I was already overweight by 20 pounds).
35427,I went back to my doctor and told him my concerns and went off of it.
35428,He agreed that SSRI's can cause metabolism issues and weight gain.
35429,The withdrawal was horrible and I wanted nothing else to do with SSRI's.
35430,"I then tried Wellbutrin which is great for weight neutrality but it made me very angry, and I don't remember ever feeling so disappointed that something didn't work."
35431,I continued to try to stress to my doctor that SSRI's were something I DID NOT WANT for many reasons.
35432,He referred me to a psychiatrist which I had to make a long trip to go see (that scared me to death in itself).
35433,She pretty much pushed Prozac down my throat and I reluctantly tried.
35434,Prozac made me have dreams every night where I was murdering people and I had violent thoughts constantly.
35435,"I finally convincer her of benzos for a short-lived amount of time and I'm currently on Klonopin which works great for me, and if that was the end of all of my problems I would be great."
35436,"I didn't want benzos for the ""high"" (I never get that feeling anyways), but for the lesser side effects/weight/ect."
35437,"Of course, my family doctor and psychiatrist say that Klonopin is too addictive and says that they won't be refilling my prescription."
35438,"Despite my wishes, he wrote me a prescription two weeks ago for Lexapro, which is known for weight gain, brain zaps, pretty much everything I had with Paxil all over again and I'm refusing to take it."
35439,"Gaining more weight on top of the weight I already gained would literally kill me, mostly because my body image is what causes me the most anxiety."
35440,These thoughts about having to take another medicine like this has my anxiety through the roof 24/7.
35441,"I don't know if I should give up on medication and deal with my constant thoughts and panic by myself, or get fat like my doctors apparently want me to."
35442,I feel like there are no other options left for me and I'm fed up.
35443,What should I do?
35444,"Then I thought the medicine was on automatic refill at my pharmacy and I ended up missing a few days, and suffered some of the worst panic attacks I had ever experienced."
35445,"The doctor said these side effects are normal, especially when first starting the medication."
35446,"When the medication finally starts working, will I have an easier time calming myself?"
35447,"Been misdiagnosed a few times, tried all kinds of meds ect ect
Several years ago I developed agoraphobia and was helped through it by a very good/kind psychologist, she then diagnosed me with PTSD."
35448,I have not been seeing a doctor for the last 5 or so years and on no medication.
35449,So I am just starting to attempt to stop taking prozac to see how I feel without meds and because eventually I would like to have kids.
35450,I'm just feeling really hopeless that I will have to be on meds forever.
35451,"I'm starting to lean towards taking medication to help it but know it is not always easy to start an anti-depression or anti-anxiety medication or find the right one for said person,and quite nervous to start trying them out... any advice or encouraging words to help?"
35452,"So basically I have agoraphobia, and I'm looking at different types of medication (I've been stuck home for a month, had to quit my job)."
35453,"I have a therapist that I have been seeing who is close to my home, but she isn't a doctor and cannot prescribe medication."
35454,"it actually made it slightly worse so I went to bed and had a dream about a girl I liked who was a boyfriend and who I've had at least one dream about every month for about two years (I'm not sure why since I'm too fucking anxious to date anyone anyways) then I woke up and felt terrible and then far worse when I realized I have school tomorrow so I rolled out of bed and had another realization that it was later than I thought and I still hadn't taken my medicine (passionflower extract) so I started panicking (as you may have guessed) and frantically looking for the bottle and by the time I found it and took it it was WAY later then usual so now I'm sitting here feeling tremendously shitty, inadequate, depressed, and fearful of the panicked state that I'm about to have to endure."
35455,"In a good relationship now, getting married this summer, but my anxiety reached a point last year where I had to quit uni, get on meds and start seeing a counsellor."
35456,"The meds helped some, now I don't feel crushingly depressed (never been suicidal, just felt like my brain was trying to suffocate me), but still can't face leaving my house."
35457,"But, all today I have been feeling very, very anxious, more than I have since I started the meds."
35458,Just aftermath of the panic attack or is it a sign I might need to try a higher dose of meds/a different medication?
35459,This is the first time I have ever been on medication so I am not really sure what I should perceive this as.
35460,I stopped taking the meds by my sophmore year.
35461,Please please forgive me in advance if this is a tired-out topic on this sub.
35462,I'm new and have only been poking around on past threads for a bit.
35463,I am a 22 year old woman with no idea what to do with my life.
35464,"This is not the typical ""Do I want to be a film major?"
35465,"Or maybe go to law school?"""
35466,"dilemma, I honestly enjoy almost nothing in life."
35467,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, from medications to hospital stays."
35468,I remember being in middle school thinking how completely screwed I was going to be when I became an adult and needed to support myself.
35469,I've never had any ambitions or dreams.
35470,"I currently work full time in a video game store, but its not enough to support myself."
35471,I live at home with my mom because of that.
35472,"How is a person with no likes or wants, who is terrified to leave the house each day, and has little hope supposed to find a career?"
35473,"I wish someone would just tell me ""you need to go in to the field of XYZ, you have no choice"" so I would at least have some sort of plan."
35474,"There is nothing I can think of that I am even capable of doing with or without training, let alone want to do with my life."
35475,"At times I wish I could be hospitalized for the rest of my life, so I would have food and a roof over my head but I wouldn't have to go out into the world."
35476,"I'm worried that my story is going to end in suicide, simply because I will not be able to support myself once my mom is gone."
35477,What do I do?
35478,Is there any career out there for me?
35479,How can get myself to find passion about anything?
35480,I would settle for liking something just enough so I don't want to step in front of a bus every morning before work.
35481,"I don't ever expect happiness, but I'd like to be content one day."
35482,I recently decided to go off my meds after being on SSRIs for a solid 12 years.
35483,I started withdrawing from meds in June and have been completely med-free for about 6 weeks.
35484,I remember feeling this way as a child which was why I was put on medication in the first place (I couldn't get through a day at school etc).
35485,I am considering going back on meds because while I am functional...I am not happy.
35486,"I've had issues with anxiety for about 12 years now, and for a while now I've had success in preventing and using methods to diminish how hard the attacks are; to the point I was able to wean off of my (latest) anxiety medication."
35487,"I am thinking that I might need to go on medication, since therapy alone isn't helping."
35488,And I don't know anything about anxiety medication.
35489,"I'm going to be scheduling a doctor appointment soon, and I honestly do think medication would benefit me."
35490,I know I should be on some sort of meds but I hate that thought.
35491,I hate taking all this medication bc I takes feel out of it and weird all the time.
35492,Am i just having a rough couple of days or has my medication stopped working?
35493,"As a child I have been drug up and down stairs, beat beyond recognition, had my stomach pumped because the only food within reach was in the medicine cabinet, watched my mom black out and try to hurt herself, and have been in protective services numerous times."
35494,"I thought I could deal with It on my own (which I did for a bit) but with college and other stress factors, I am starting to consider medication."
35495,"I never did well in school, I barely scraped by in highschool and after almost failing my first semester in college, I was assaulted on campus and used that as an excuse to stop going and I failed the next three."
35496,"I had to come home and went to community college, but I failed there too."
35497,"I'm scared to tell my parents, I already have a sister on disability for her mental problems and they're still half supporting her."
35498,"I'm supposed to be the normal one, I'm supposed to be smart, I'm supposed to be able to support myself."
35499,I get sick to my stomach as soon as I'm presented with learning material.
35500,I don't know how to ask for help.
35501,"Beyond learning, I can't seem to follow through with anything in life because thinking about taking any steps forward makes me sick to my stomach, I start panicking and hyperventilate."
35502,"I've been pretending to go to class for over a year, but instead I just sit in my car and have breakdowns."
35503,"I told my parents I'd pay for my community college classes, and the ones I failed out of I am still in debt for because I barely make enough to make payments at my job."
35504,"I want to go back, but I can't afford it yet and I'm scared I'll fail out again."
35505,"I don't think I can get a loan, my credit is probably already horrible."
35506,"I don't know how to tell my parents what's going on, I don't want them to treat me like they treated my sister, she went insane when they put her on anti-depressants."
35507,"I spent most of my youth with a padlock on my bedroom door because she would steal from me and sometimes she got violent (She never hurt me, but did dislocate my mother's jaw, and they fist fought."
35508,"I always held my mother after these fights and promised not to dissapoint her)

I have no friends."
35509,I go to a therapist sometimes for the assault situation but I don't like going because being there just reminds me of what happened.
35510,"I want to find proper help, but I can't afford it, and I'm scared of medications."
35511,"I'm scared to ask my parents, I don't think they can go through this again."
35512,They've said so before.
35513,"I'm hysterical as I write this, I apologize."
35514,"I have been going to therapy, and it is somewhat helpful, however we have been discussing maybe taking medicine."
35515,"I do not want to just jump to medicine, however, I am not sure what to do."
35516,"I also cannot get medicine without going though a psychiatrist, and all my counselor can do is refer me."
35517,"I do not have great insurance coverage, and I wonder if anxiety medicine is really worth all these steps to get because past the stressful situations I feel somewhat ok."
35518,I guess I just want some help and insight on anxiety medicine.
35519,"He was treated for depression (various types of medication, therapy with a lady he really liked) long before I knew him, eventually came off of medication to try to manage it on his own, and since then has done really well."
35520,"By that, I mean has been seeing someone to prescribe ADD medication, and just recently mentioned to her that he was feeling some increased anxiety and was interested in changing up his ADD medication, which they did."
35521,"He's also afraid that if he opens up too much, she'll want to take him off of the ADD medicine, and then he'll struggle more in school."
35522,I really don't want meds.
35523,"I don't really want to go on any medication, because accepting it and realizing that I can get through this has saved my ass so much and brought me a lot of new perspective and has rid me of some of my previous symptoms of anxiety."
35524,"**Negatives:**


* Difficulty with sleep (still working on it, but I take my medication in the evening)."
35525,"* Stomach Aches (small)

* Occasional surges of Anxiety/Panic, but I figure this is just my body adjusting through the meds."
35526,"That being said, I know getting on medication can be anxiety inducing and nerve racking, but it's worth a try, especially if your doctor is confident in its ability to help you."
35527,Does medication help at all with not having so many intrusive thoughts?
35528,"I have depression and anxiety, however I'm a bit nervous about taking medication and I wanted to know if Elavil helps or if anyone had bad/good side effects and results."
35529,"I've always thought I could figure this all out myself and didn't need meds, but I've recently started thinking it doesn't hurt to try."
35530,"My SO's mother whom is a head nurse specifically asked a clinical doctor to prescribe me this medication, and to my fortune has become the only medication that has actually worked for me and not against me (been taking it for a year)."
35531,"I'm 25, female, and currently not on any medication."
35532,"I've never been on medication for it &amp; I may have Herpes as a result of the abuse but haven't shown ""symptoms"" for about 2 years."
35533,So I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a little while now and as my anxiety worsens I figured it was time for a post.
35534,My main thing is I am too anxious to go see someone right at this point.
35535,Before I go in I want to read up on different medications so I know what to try and what not to try.
35536,I don't want any crazy side effects or to turn into a 'robot' so to speak.
35537,Are there any that are more recommended than others or certain meds I should steer clear of?
35538,I'd also just like to talk to others dealing with it.
35539,Some background info on me I'm 24 male and a veteran from the US.
35540,( I'm not sure me being deployed has anything to do with it or not).
35541,I'm sure I'll have more questions but as of right now I just really need help.
35542,"Went to therapy, was on meds, etc."
35543,"I have been on medication before, and it never really seemed to help."
35544,"Psychologists haven't helped, medication hasn't helped, and now I'm lost and don't know how to fix this."
35545,"I forgot to refill my last prescription before it expired (how I managed to forget is beyond me, since running out of meds is one of my worst fears, see: addictive behavior 101) and I won't be able to see my doc until Tuesday at the very least, so I'm on my own until then."
35546,I'm a 20 year old girl and have been on antidepressants/anxi anxiety medication for around 5 years.
35547,I took my second dose of my medication and I feel better now.
35548,"When I was 12, I was put on a medication for my acid reflux and I was actually allergic to it."
35549,"I've never had any sort of anxiety medication before, I've just been dealing with this each day as it happens."
35550,"She suffers from some health problems herself, which are real, organ things which is bad but she copes with medicines."
35551,I suffer from sometimes crippling generalised anxiety.
35552,"When I do have a bad day or worry about something, I get the classic annoying response 'theres nothing to worry about'."
35553,"Today she's been saying 'it's really bad you need to get help' (I have.. seen the Dr so many times, had months of fruitless counselling, on the NHS waiting list for psychiatric referrals)."
35554,"Saying I never gave counselling a chance, I haven't tried everything."
35555,"All I needed to be fine was for her to tell me she was on the other end of the phone, she'll see me soon, something caring."
35556,All I got was very defensive when I tried to talk to her about it.
35557,"I asked if she thought my stuff paled in comparison to what she got which is why she just shrugs it off, she said she didn't know."
35558,I love her to bits but how can I get through to her the best way to help out?
35559,"19/20 years old if that helps, been together just under a year."
35560,"I was a sobbing mess the whole time and I'm sure that the cops thought I was trying to get out of something, and they wouldn't give me my anxiety medication to calm down."
35561,"I saw psychologists and psychiatrist, I got on medication."
35562,The rest of my family is on medication and I've always prided myself on not needing to take any meds every day (other than birth control) but I've slowly realized that i need help and it all kind of came to a head in the past couple days.
35563,I really have not wanted to go on meds but I think I need to.
35564,Has anyone else been adamant about not being on an SSRI/other anxiety medicine and changed their minds?
35565,Ironically going on meds for anxiety is making my anxiety worse.
35566,Alright so here is the deal friends.
35567,I've been on some anti-anxiety medications for a few years.
35568,A few months ago I had been feeling pretty good.
35569,"I was at the point where I was just kind of tired of taking meds every morning, and thought that I could get it over with by cutting it off cold turkey, and getting over the side effects."
35570,"I mean, they couldn't be that bad right?"
35571,"Just a day or so of feeling a little bad, then it would pass."
35572,Totally doable right?
35573,Nope.
35574,That was probably one of the worst decisions I had ever made in my life.
35575,"For about a week I was constantly dizzy, had nausea, diarrhea, head was constantly spinning and had motion sickness."
35576,Any time I stood up I thought I was going to fall down and throw up.
35577,Extreme paranoia set in which made everything worse.
35578,I was an absolute trainwreck of a human being.
35579,A blob on the floor too afraid to move or do anything.
35580,"After about 2 weeks and feeling like the pain would never end, I caved and went back to taking my meds."
35581,"Eventually I ended up going back to my doctor and now we are in the process of having me weaned off of them instead, which is a much more pleasant experience."
35582,So just a heads up people.
35583,"If your taking anxiety meds, for the love of god don't quit them cold turkey"
35584,"I take medicine for depression, yet I don’t feel a difference anymore."
35585,I make excuses not to change it because I am scared of the process of finding a new medicine or that I won’t find anything that works and will be aware of my helplessness.
35586,"My own dad told me that instead of taking medication for my depression, I should pray and God would take care of it."
35587,Also i should note that i usually don't have panic flair ups unless i'm stressed and i'm also on medication to help control it.
35588,Also I have been having some stomach discomfort after a take the medication.
35589,I changed meds a couple times and I am still on Lexapro even though I do not feel like it helps me as much as it should.
35590,I love to write.
35591,Particularly screenplays.
35592,It's a hobby that I enjoy in my spare time that allowed me to express myself creatively in a form I'm passionate about (film).
35593,"I suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Depression."
35594,"I'm currently on medications that are working fantastic, and am in cognitive behavioural therapy."
35595,My problem: I can't write.
35596,It's not writer's block...
35597,I just start to become anxious about writing any of the ideas that come to mind.
35598,"I tend to write about topics that are very personal to me, usually heavily influenced by my own experiences."
35599,"Does anyone else have this problem while journaling, writing, blogging, etc?"
35600,It's completely new to me.
35601,I just can't quite write out what I want to write out because I get so anxious about the topic or idea.
35602,"And yeah, meds and therapy are already in the picture."
35603,"Now to get to my full on rant


I started medication months ago."
35604,"Coincidentally, my medication should start taking effect in the next few weeks."
35605,Is she not available just so I don't have anxiety around her and can actually be myself once my medication kicks in and we go on dates?
35606,I'm starting to get adjusted to the medicine and I'm also sleeping better.
35607,I'm worried I will become dependent on my anxiety medicine.
35608,"But for the last 2 weeks I was a without meds and I was absolutely miserable train wreck having panic/anxiety attacks daily .I need this medicine to function at work properly (call center job) and function in life

Im just worried I will be dependent on it forever."
35609,Is it bad to need medicine?
35610,"What I'm asking is, is it OK to need medicine."
35611,"I'm new to taking medicine :/

I was also prescribed the generic of Prozac (Fluoxotine) 20 mg to take once a day, I assume that means in the morning...

Not sure it matters, but I'm taking Clonazepam temporarily."
35612,All I can do is just rant online because counseling didn't help and it's too late to get medication and have it work properly in time and I just.
35613,"Therapy hasn't ever helped, and I don't want to rely on a medicine, homeopathic or not."
35614,I have zero tolerance to this medication so I'm confused.
35615,She recommended over the counter sleeping medicine and scheduled other appointment for the first Saturday in March.
35616,"I don't know if it is due to the medication, or just due to the fact that I haven't been seeing my friends, but I have felt a bit depressed lately, which is an emotion I haven't felt since my mid teenage years."
35617,"I can understand being upset about things that were big fuck ups, but I obsess over small things like: words I wish I had said differently, or papers that I wrote late yet still turned in on time, and even really dumb things like accidentally bumping into someone in the hallway...

Not in therapy or on meds currently because of insurance issues, so I feel kind of alone in this."
35618,I was able to get help from programs to get my medication at reduced cost.
35619,Therapy along with medication has been a huge help for me.
35620,I really don't want to take meds for this because I'm a nationally competitive athlete and do not wish to have any meds influence my performance in any way.
35621,I started taking medication that doesn't help only a tiny bit but not enough.
35622,My doctor suggested that I could experiment with stopping the Paxil as I'm on another medication (Wellbutrin) that may be well enough  for handling the anxiety.
35623,He's been taking this dose of this medication for about 3 months now but has been on Citalopram for over a year.
35624,"Whenever we suggest changing the medication the doctor simply says to up the dose and my partner has to go along with it because we have NO clue whatsoever about what to ask for; saying ""this isn't working it think it might be time to try a new medication"" just isn't working and so i thought it best that at the next appointment we go in there prepared with the names of a few types of anxiety meds."
35625,I think i'm digressing a little bit here but the point of my post was to see if anybody could suggest the names of medication they've taken or take for anxiety that has worked for them.
35626,I understand that every medication works differently with each individual and we will bear that in mind when discussing with the doctor but we really need a starting point.
35627,"I've experimented with al sorts of supplements, have gone to therapy and even tried medication (currently on zoloft)."
35628,"But now with all my meds done, I'm back to my anxious self."
35629,"My boyfriend also expressed that he'd like to learn how to help me, maybe even talk to my therapist (who I see about once a month for social anxiety and bipolar disorder, as well as a psychiatrist who prescribes me meds)."
35630,"Only left the house four times (baring the occasional walk) in the past 5 months, which were only because I had to (saw doctor to get another medication script, saw my mum in hospital after her cancer surgery, managed to go to one of my psych appointments, and went to centrelink so I could finally get my measly $75 a fortnight)."
35631,I was just prescribed Ativan/lorazepam by my doctor as a temporary medication to take as needed (when I'm feeling really anxious) until I can get an appointment with a therapist and psychiatrist.
35632,"i take medication + go to therapy, but i find that i'm actually quite in love with a lot of aspects of my anxiety."
35633,Anyone else drank on meds related to anxiety/depressiona and what are your experiences?
35634,"I've been working with a therapist and while I've made great progress with coping skills, I can't help but think I'll never be in control unless I go back to medication."
35635,"It's not bad really..I was having anxiety because of work last week, but I went to the doc and got bloodwork done (for thyroid) and some meds for my anxiety again."
35636,I've been managing to function better lately because of some new meds but I'm having a hard time with this.
35637,I've been heavily pushing towards trying a new medication since I feel Zoloft just isn't the one for me.
35638,"However, with them both being SSRIs, I wonder if it has the chance to affect me a ton better than Zoloft, or if I should try another classification of meds next (ex SNRIs)."
35639,"For those of you who have had a ton of success breaking free from social anxiety, what meds helped contribute?"
35640,Haven't been able to fall asleep without medication for a month now.
35641,"The first few days I felt very strange, disconnected, but kept with the meds and then my days started to become more focused and I was not sweating the small things so much, my enery skyrocketed during the day and at work I feel great."
35642,"The meds I have tried were Lexapro and Zoloft, neither of which I took for the recommended time because I do not believe they work."
35643,"In my opinion, and not to offend anyone who uses/relies on them for help, I don't believe meds are any good."
35644,Like I've not had anxiety in about a month or two and was considering coming off the meds.
35645,"I don't know what to do I feel so sad, how can my medication go from working wonders to me feeling like this."
35646,Back and forth in my mind I often banter about whether or not I have severe enough anxiety that I would benefit from anxiety medicine.
35647,Too often I feel that doctors slap a label on people and feed them medicine without really checking to see if the person actually does have a disorder.
35648,Could it be true that maybe my anxiety could be defeated without medicine and that taking meds could be a cop out?
35649,"When I am with friends who have anxiety and I refuse to take medication, I refuse, I think it is like giving up - well, friends who do scream and say I do't really have it then."
35650,I told my mom about it who also suffers from anxiety(she is on medication for it) and she said it could just part of me being a teenager.
35651,"She says she doesn't think it is a brain tumor and prescribed me acne medication (ever since this anxiety disorder developed, I have also developed acne on my neck and back :/)."
35652,Fast forward to monday and now I am on a Beta Blocker to combat both the anxiety and blood pressure as well as some anti anxiety medicine.
35653,Is this normal for starting meds?
35654,I've had anxiety and depression for years now and have tried various medications with little success.
35655,"Anyway, I'll be skyping with a family friend whom I haven't to for years tomorrow."
35656,"Pretty much anything phone/talk/social related gets me super anxious, especially when it comes to a topic like ""catching up"" when all I've really been doing for the past few years is trying to go to college, then taking a bunch of time off after 1 semester because I can't handle the anxiety and stress which eventually causes me to break down into a very serious depression."
35657,Rinse and repeat.
35658,"Now I'm on one of my ""off"" times and considering switching to a community college in the future."
35659,"I'm seeing a therapist and psychiatrist regularly, but yeah, not really sure what I'm doing with my life or if I'll be able to do anything with my life."
35660,I've been basically avoiding the question or lying and changing the subject whenever I talk to relatives about my... life.
35661,"How do those of you who are taking time off from ""life"" tread the subject?"
35662,Any tips?
35663,When and to whom do you guys open up?
35664,Thanks!
35665,"As some background, I’m 21/F, engaged to my best friend of eight years (21/M) and we’ve been living in an apartment together since April, and got our first dog together a month ago."
35666,I’ve had a range of mental health problems that have skyrocketed the past few years.
35667,"I haven’t been able to afford professional help and therefore have never seen anyone, have no official diagnosis, and have never been treated or taken any medication."
35668,I’ve had trouble sleeping my whole life and I’ve always had anxiety as it runs in my family.
35669,A particular issue that’s gotten worse is me waking up and having anxiety attacks.
35670,My fiance’ got me some Melatonin to help me sleep that I’ve taken the last few nights.
35671,"It helps me be sleepy but I still wake up between 3 and 5 every morning and cannot fall back asleep, and I have tremendous anxiety, I will feel nauseous, unable to hold still/jittery/restless, high heart rate, can’t feel relaxed or distracted (even throughout the day I still feel the painful bodily pressure of anxiety and can’t distract myself or feel relaxed for more than a minute), tossing and turning, feeling distressed, guilty, feeling worthless, unable to function well, crying a lot, I vomited from it yesterday morning, have had diarrhea multiple times from it and will get tension in my back, shoulders and legs, and my hands will be shaking."
35672,A big part of it is this ‘job’ I’ve had for around two months.
35673,"It was a work from home job that paid fairly well and was pretty easy but it always gave me a lot of anxiety probably because I have to call people which just thinking about can scare me, and I’ve never been very good with people in general."
35674,The guy I work for is very inconsistent in a lot of things.
35675,"A month ago I went out of town for a few days and when I came back I couldn’t work because the phone app we use wouldn’t let me log in, and I couldn’t work."
35676,He never responded to me in regards to the issue so I haven’t even really worked except for a couple days ago.
35677,It seemed like he had fixed things earlier than this but did not tell me.
35678,There’s also been a random change in how hours and scheduling work which I had no idea about until I had made a mistake so it’s not even clear or consistent on when I can and can’t work and something is always broken.
35679,This job hasn’t even brought in any money really in a month and I don’t wish to do it anymore.
35680,My fiance’ got a great new job recently where he’s helping a small company set up their office in our area before he starts working for them and he’s making a salary for the first time.
35681,He’s feeling pretty good and confident and says that he makes enough for both of us.
35682,"He’s suggested I keep this job just to help me have more money, but I’m never paid when I’m supposed to be anyway."
35683,I’ve been able to have a lot of talks with my fiance’ about this which I’m very thankful for.
35684,He’s made me see again that I have options and that I should reach out for things that I want.
35685,"As a result, I called a woman in my area who goes around teaching art to preschool age children."
35686,I’d messaged her on Facebook over a year ago and she never responded to me until this last April and was interested in meeting with me at the time.
35687,I liked my job at the time (before the from home job I worked at a dog resort for 6 months.
35688,"I’m good at working with dogs in multiple ways but I started having nervous breakdowns there and crying a lot there and was having to take cabs to or from there since I’ve never had a car, I liked the job but something art related is what I want to pursue and be passionate about.)"
35689,"so I didn’t say anything to her, but she was glad I called yesterday and said she was thinking she needed some help and was maybe trying to expand the schools she went to, and I am meeting with her tomorrow to talk about it more."
35690,"I really want it to work out, me not having a car may cause an issue but I wanna work through anything I can to help her and be doing something that I think can feel fulfilling to me and be relevant to what I want to do in the future."
35691,Sorry if this seems messy but I want to provide as many details as I can because there’s a lot going on.
35692,"My anxiety has been horrendous this week; I was supposed to work this morning but my fiance’ said that if the job is having this effect on me, I should just quit."
35693,And I want to…but I feel bad with the idea of him being the only one making money (however the from home job wasn’t bringing in money like I’d hoped anyway…and in any dire situation I can always return to the dog resort job).
35694,He’s told me many times that I don’t need to worry either way.
35695,"I have a hard time accepting that because of my feelings, but I also really want to do something good like this art teacher apprenticeship that would be really good for me."
35696,"I’ve fallen into a cycle where I get a menial job that makes me unhappy and I start to have breakdowns, cry, self harm, things of that sort, quit, and want to do more for myself, then get another job in the meantime that has the same issue, and I don’t want that anymore."
35697,I’ve just wanted to spend today seeking care and seeing what opportunities I can have as an aspiring artist/art student at this time.
35698,I called a hotline this morning and explained a lot of things to the guy for about 30 minutes and he barely spoke to me then said he had to wrap up the call.
35699,"…I felt helpless after that, I freaked out and I was so upset because I hadn’t gotten any help."
35700,"I started crying and felt I could’ve spiraled into darkness (…the best description of this is that I can have periods where I have outbursts, cry immensely, feel panicky, feel like I’m trapped in a dark box in a pitch-black room, and can be aggressive or destructive, because of this I deal with more than anxiety and attacks, but I’ll also have euphoric periods followed by a horrible crash, general depression, not wanting to do anything I enjoy, no appetite, suicidal desires, etc."
35701,"), but I called another hotline and was able to talk to them for about an hour and had much better results."
35702,The lady I talked to highly suggested I see someone as has everyone else I’ve talked to.
35703,She said it seems like I have no true coping mechanism and that my triggers are not well known to me which makes sense I guess.
35704,I talked about my cycle with jobs and my mental illnesses effecting it all.
35705,"She made it seem like finding something in my field would help and if I like working dogs, I could just volunteer and that may help me also rather than the things about the dog resort job that made it hard on me."
35706,She worries about this art teacher situation and suggested I be able to talk to someone as I’m going through it or as I’m trying to be progressive in general I suppose.
35707,"She said it sounds like I want something to change for myself and the anxiety isn’t letting me, but care would allow me to maybe get there and I can talk to someone about things like family issues (not a very good relationship with my parents, they favor my siblings and brushed it off when I tried opening up to them about all this and even mentioning my suicidal thoughts or the self harm I’ve done and my dad was always a huge source of anxiety for me growing up), and just be observed and go from there."
35708,I really want professional help.
35709,"I want to know exactly what’s going on with me and I want to fix it, or do what I can to maintain it."
35710,"I went to a Depression Bipolar Support Alliance meeting once with my fiance’ and didn’t really like it…It was kinda scary which I can understand but everyone there was talking about their therapists and their medications and I felt like I didn’t belong or that they wouldn’t accept me if I didn’t have those things…
I’ve been having a very hard time with these things."
35711,I feel so dysfunctional and I wonder if other people are as or feel as broken as me.
35712,"I’m sure they do and I’m sure there’s those who have it worse, but that’s just the feeling."
35713,"I’d love any input or advice or support I can get if I can… I’ve spent so much time alone, feeling like I’m in the dark, losing control and then having nothing to do after but apologize and want to die for how I was, and these anxiety attacks are really getting to me."
35714,I don’t want to do jobs that waste my time anymore.
35715,I understand those things can be inevitable but I just need to move forward with my life and want to accomplish something great soon even if it just means I get to do this art teacher apprenticeship sort of thing.
35716,I want to be happy and do things that really matter to my life.
35717,"I only ask for kind and respectful and serious comments, please."
35718,Sorry for a long and messy post.
35719,"Thank you very, very much for your time."
35720,I really appreciate it.
35721,"I was just wondering if you guys thought I should talk to my doctor about changing my Zoloft to a different medication or changing my dose, or if you think this is a problem that doesn't really have to do with the medication."
35722,Is this the best I can expect from the medicine?
35723,After a bad panic attack I got a prescription for .5 xanax.
35724,I've read horror stories of xanax addition so I would only take them during emergencies or break one in half to help me sleep.
35725,I would make a point of not taking them more than two days in a row.
35726,But then a week ago I decided that I would finally try the zoloft that was prescribed to me.
35727,I reacted badly to it either psychosomaticly or genuinely but I took xanax multiple times a day for a week to deal with the insomnia and incipient panic attacks and was taking it a bit more often the week before that.
35728,I stopped taking the zoloft after two days because I woke up panicing and having weird night sweats.
35729,Plus I thought I may have detected a bit of slight mania (but that could have been just me being psychosomatic about psychological conditions).
35730,Ive decided Im going to stop taking all anxiety medications and deal with this through cognitive behavioral therapy but Ive been feeling like SHIT that last few days.
35731,Deep feelings of depression in my chest and lots of constant anxiety even to the point of shaking.
35732,"I was wondering ""Is this just anxiety because I was so stressed about taking zoloft or am I having withdrawls from the week and a half of heavy xanax use?"""
35733,"I decided to research on anxiety and drug forums and saw alot of posts of the nature ""I took xanax for two weeks and now Im having withdrawls that gave lasted over a month"" type posts."
35734,This ironically has sent my anxiety and depression to an all time high.
35735,I felt so defeated and crushed when I finally gave in last night and took .5 xanax to fall asleep early in the morning.
35736,My quandary is that if Im just having normal anxiety my past experience is that taking xanax helps me get back to normal functional state *much* quicker than otherwise.
35737,But what if the anxiety is FROM some slight xanax withdrawal itself?
35738,I feel like its a catch 22.
35739,Can anyone help give me a reality check here?
35740,"im not on any medication, back 10 years ago when this was a big issue I was on celexa/wellbutrin, but I would like to think that at this point in my life I should be able to take charge myself and control everything"
35741,"I chose not to go on medication, and take a more holistic path."
35742,"I am taking my meds like I'm supposed to, as prescribed."
35743,Who should I specifically talk to and what type of medication is most likely going to be prescribed to me?
35744,"I have taken medication in the past with success, but never refilled my prescription when it ended due to fear of looking like a drug addict."
35745,"I have bad anxiety, spent time on and off of meds, and have battled with alcohol and drugs."
35746,I've been eating benadryl like crazy and decongestants/cough medicine for my throat and it doesn't seem like it helps.
35747,"Then I wake up about 2-4 hours later with all those symptoms, get up, take more allergy meds, etc, and try to fall back asleep eventually if I can."
35748,"I'm currently on anti anxiety meds that slow me right down, but they don't help me get to sleep."
35749,"And no, I don't work for them or any other industry even remotely related to medicine/drugs/whatever, I just haven't tried any other place -- haven't needed to cuz the stuff works (for me)."
35750,I have never been on anxiety medication.
35751,I have been seeing a psychotherapist for changing around ADD/ADHD meds (the one that prescribes and diagnosis?
35752,"I ended up going to therapy (which did help with my recovery, please do seek professional help if you feel similarly), I turned down the medicine for personal reasons."
35753,I currently live without medication or therapy and neither are very financially accessible for me.
35754,I saw my doctor and got a referral to see someone about medication.
35755,I started feeling more negative side effects of the meds and stopped right away and saw my doctor about it.
35756,"I have anxiety, it used to be crippling to say the least but im slowly getting better on my own (no meds or therapist) but one thing I cant seem to shake is my breathing issues (hyperventilating)."
35757,"I was going to seek out some anxiety medication but I think my problem is deeper than that, I believe I may also have depression.."
35758,But i only realized this after a friend suggested I look into ADD meds before liking into finishing my AA and I actually took a good look at myself and my behavior.
35759,"This all started a month ago, and the meds are helping, some."
35760,"He's on strong meds, but still isn't quite 100%."
35761,I think it might've had something to do with the medication.
35762,For the past couple of weeks whenever I try to sleep I feel intensely anxious.
35763,"When I was younger, I used to get what I call a head rush when I would lay down to go to bed."
35764,I can only describe this as my thoughts switching very rapidly between static TV channels.
35765,Nothing was clear or comprehendible and it was a very uncomfortable situation.
35766,"I combatted these head rushes by falling asleep to music, which worked pretty well."
35767,"Lately I experience a racing heart, nausea to the point of dry heaving, perspiration, increased breathing, and difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep."
35768,"Every once in a while I get a head rush, but it isn't nearly as often as when I was younger."
35769,"I tried listening to music when I lay down, but it didn't help my anxious feelings."
35770,"For some reason I feel like the anxiety and head rushes have something to do with each other, but I don't know."
35771,I have never experienced anxiety on a regular basis like this before and sometimes I feel that thinking about not being able to fall asleep is part of what triggers the anxiety in the first place.
35772,"Because of this I end up staying up very late, which sometimes isn't a big deal but other times when I have to work the next day makes things difficult."
35773,I think my sleeping arrangements also have a hand in the anxiety.
35774,Right now I am staying with my parents and I do not have a room of my own so I sleep on the couch in the living room.
35775,"I have been living this way for about 9 months and the anxiety is a pretty recent thing, but even when I try to sleep at a friends house I still feel anxious."
35776,"Has anyone else experienced anything like this, or does anyone have anything that I can try to do to help me sleep better?"
35777,If more information is needed I will be glad to answer any questions that can help sort this out.
35778,Edit: I'm a 23 year old male that is not currently on medications of any kind.
35779,dont have any meds.
35780,Until this new dosage of meds kick in can y'all give me words of encouragement to help me realize that they don't care at all about what I'm doing and to help me not give a fuck?
35781,"All I want to do is just go with him to a park and just take deep breaths, after I've taken my allergy medication of course."
35782,"The T4-only medication (Eltroxin) was working great for me, until February when I was overmedicated."
35783,"and I just wanted to holler, ""WELL YEAH, because I was overmedicated on thyroid medication goddamnit!"""
35784,"I originally posted this in TwoX on a rants/raves thread, but it was so specifically relevant to this sub that I wanted to share."
35785,"Rants: My body feels like that of a 70 year old, and I'm 23."
35786,"My muscles and joints are constantly in throbbing pain (I have a desk job, so it isn't soreness from exercise, but constant tension from anxiety), I have a bum hip that decides to pop out of its socket and pinch some nerves once or twice a year that sometimes requires the use of a cane, and one or two asshats sarcastically quip that I'm pretending to be Dr. House when that happens."
35787,"Combine this with social phobia, and a dislocation means I won't leave my home for weeks."
35788,"The medical part of it is manageable --- it rarely happens, I can manage the pain when it does, and you'd never know it was a problem unless you saw me in the thick of it."
35789,"I just hate the condescending shit I get from people who think I'm trying to be ""random"" or ""edgy""."
35790,Raves: I went and saw a psychiatrist yesterday evening for a psych eval and meds.
35791,"I got some emergency Valium for short-term use until we solidify a long-term treatment plan, an anti-depressant, plus a blood-pressure medication that is used off label for treating nightmares in PTSD patients."
35792,I finally have hope.
35793,"Diazepam (Valium) is also a skeletal muscle relaxant, so for the first time in the last year I can walk up the stairs without tearing up from the pain and my GI tract already feels better because I'm not flooding it with OTC pain meds."
35794,I slept through the night in peace for once.
35795,I feel rested.
35796,"He was also an excellent physician who was diligent and thorough in his evaluation while respecting the knowledge I'd already accumulated through my past medical history, really considered my input, and never once talked down to me."
35797,"He even sat down with me to make a list of possible medications that we can try in the future, and mapped out the best schedule for trying them in succession to ensure that he can justify coverage of the more expensive ones to my insurance company."
35798,He also helped me set an appointment TOMORROW with a therapist.
35799,"Dr. B, you're a fucking hero."
35800,Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
35801,"I'm not taking meds though, and never have done, so I was just wondering if maybe along with meds I might get the most help?"
35802,I can't afford therapy or medication.
35803,"Hi all, for a few months now I've been taking Venlafaxine (75mg), but I forgot to take my dose this morning and won't be able to take it until tomorrow afternoon at the earliest, meaning I'll have gone 48 hours without any medication."
35804,I can't believe it.
35805,I must have done something wrong or I am the worst at filling out those tests..  what I did was that I took my meds before bedtime(100mg nortriptyline) and then 4 hours later in the middle of the night I couldn't sleep and my heart was pumping so hard because of the meds so I couldn't sleep so I filled out the test which I had postponed for a couple of weeks.
35806,Now I've switched medications for migraine prophylaxis to topamax  and I'm not supposed to be using nortriptyline anymore so nowadays it feels like I'm being in flight-or-fight mode all day and night and I have pretty bad insomnia.
35807,Feels like I'm being attacked by a lion constantly.
35808,"Can't watch tv, can't relax,can't concentrate, can't wind down for sleep and it kinda feels like I'm going insane really with all this adrenaline in my bloodstream

The psychologist I was referred to by my doctor didn't even take notice or care when I said to him that I had been using nortriptyline for over 6 months before the diagnosis."
35809,It is my understanding that he looks at problems and discusses with a psychiatrist for meds or do I just speak with my doctor or psychiatrist for meds?
35810,Also I'm just 17
35811,"I am finally on the right combo of meds, I have an amazing fiance, our own house and I haven't had a panic attack in 3 years."
35812,Should I just go for medication?
35813,"I've gone to about 6 or so sessions with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and today my therapist suggested I explore meds to help ""take the edge off""."
35814,She wants to continue seeing me and helping me with my anxiety but feels the meds will help with the process as I've become a shell of my former self.
35815,Up to this point I've been against medication because I've had a negative connotation with them.
35816,I am afraid of relying on meds for the rest of my life.
35817,If you think I should stand by my belief of not taking meds.
35818,And if CBT should be enough without meds.
35819,Is the numbness from the depression or the medication?
35820,Obviously my stability is the most important thing to get through this all and I don't want to quit the meds because they're helping so much but since i'm not me I worry about beginning a relationship with someone since I feel as if I can't really connect with anyone at the time.
35821,I really need to keep this job so that I can support myself and have health insurance for my medication.
35822,The attacks stopped eventually with medication but I remained constantly aware of my heartbeat and jumped at every little abnormalilty.
35823,"After a while the only emotion I was left with was sadness, emptyness, as if the medication had drained it all away."
35824,"But with my medication making me feel ever more empty and unmotivated, I dropped out and returned home."
35825,At this point I stopped the anxiety medication because I couldn't take the lack of motivation anymore.
35826,I'm scared to go on anxiety meds because a few family members have and they caused more problems than solutions.
35827,"I should also note that my dad has panic attacks from time to time (he is on medication for it), and anxiety does run in my family....."
35828,So apparently my anti-anxiety medication (Buspirone) causes me to have nervous tremors.
35829,"After 20 years of having the same symptoms brought on by anxiety, is it time to talk to a doctor about anti-anxiety meds?"
35830,"I told her everything about what I've been feeling and thinking, and she told me that I should start medication and therapy as soon as possible."
35831,I start my medication tomorrow and I cannot be more excited about that.
35832,"Before meds, we were having sex 4-5 nights a week."
35833,"Over the five years that I took that medication, I was able to work myself up to about 3 times a month with lots of planning and psyching myself up for it."
35834,I decided that I would try to be without meds to see if I could renew our sex life and live using only the coping mechanisms I've learned through years of trial and error.
35835,"Having taken other meds in the past that didn't work, I'm afraid to try and end up feeling worse."
35836,"I'm currently under medication and I've had anxiety for 7 years now, I think."
35837,Went to the doc today because I haven't been able to focus/concentrate and have had racing thoughts for some time now with trouble organization/controlling them.
35838,I figured ADHD.
35839,"Did everything before medication to help solve the problem: change in diet, exercise, sleep patter, meditation, to-do lists, etc."
35840,Nothing helped.
35841,"There is always just a mental block, no motivation, and procrastination."
35842,Doc says it's anxiety and prescribes me with .25mg Xanax twice daily and 10mg Paroxetine once daily.
35843,I do my own research and it seems these medications will do the opposite affect of what I was hoping for.
35844,So question: Anyone on Xanax/Paroxetine also see increases in focus/concentration and more motivation to get things done?
35845,"I've been consistently dizzy, but that may be from the medication I'm taking."
35846,My heart races when I hear a phone ring.
35847,"Twofold, when my own phone rings."
35848,"Threefold, when the number is not registered in my phone."
35849,"Fivefold, when the caller does not reply when I message them who they are."
35850,I always feel that something evil is on the other end of the line.
35851,"I don't feel this way with text messages, only calls."
35852,Has anyone felt this way?
35853,"Can somebody suggest a cure, or at least a way to lessen the effects of the attack?"
35854,"To comply with the rules with this sub, I'm mid-20's, male, Filipino, taking no medications except vitamins, family insurance coverage."
35855,Thank you!
35856,Or is it advisable to skip the meds that day?
35857,"I moved to Europe a few years ago, originally from the US."
35858,My entire family is there so I fly back and forth a few times a year.
35859,Tomorrow I am flying in for my sister's wedding.
35860,"I have always been afraid of flying, afraid of everything that potentially puts my life at risk, actually."
35861,The last few times I flew were ok and I didn't panic.
35862,However this time I am also leaving behind my partner and I feel like I will without a doubt never see him again because my plane will crash.
35863,"I know that logically the chances are s on miniscule, but I cannot help it."
35864,"I have tried anti anxiety medicine in the past and it never worked well with me, as I also have a fear of medications actually being poison (my brain is a dark place)."
35865,"I am gettkng violently sick, want nothing more than to cancel my trip and never leave my country again."
35866,I just really need some words of encouragement and to know that I'm not crazy.
35867,"I've been slowly coming out of it, without meds, and hopefully a good experience with this minor surgery will serve as another positive reenforcement that anxiety is easy to battle."
35868,What is your opinion on this medication?
35869,Did you find better luck with a different medication?
35870,Side note: I'm learning other coping methods and I intend to use the medication only for breakthrough symptoms.
35871,"She gave me some physical excercises, encouraged me to do more sports, and seems reluctant to prescribe any meds."
35872,I have recently realized that although I do not take all of the klonopin or the propanalol I am prescribed (two .5 mg klonopin/day of which I take approximately one and two 10 mg propanalol/day which I take approximately every other day) I am still taking more medication than I would like... especially when it started out as 'emergencies only' in my mind.
35873,My ADD meds seem to not work when im in this state/mood as they only make me evern more tired and lethargic.
35874,"I can't do anything without medication, now, and I'm still incredibly limited."
35875,"In fact, I have to take at least twice the amount of any anti-anxiety medication to see any kind of effect, most likely due to a very rapid metabolism."
35876,"I've tried various different meds, CBT exercises, relaxation methods, etc."
35877,I dont have any meds.
35878,I'm F(20) and am currently not taking any medication.
35879,Today I had an experience that showed me that I wasn't okay and perhaps I was wrong to go off my medication.
35880,"Diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and anxiety almost 4 years ago, different cocktails of meds, 2 attempts resulting in hospital stays."
35881,"Get home and think ""shit gotta go fill my meds""."
35882,"Out of meds, out of green."
35883,I've had anxiety my whole life.
35884,"No traumatic event caused it, just the way I am I suppose."
35885,I could manage it up until about my senior year of high school and then it started getting gradually worse.
35886,I'm 20 now and am basically paralyzed by it which has caused me to develop agoraphobia/panic disorder over these last few years.
35887,I take Xanax occasionally and it does help but it isn't a permanent solution and is too addictive.
35888,I tried Lexapro for about one week before quitting because the side effects basically heightened all the shitty feelings I normally feel.
35889,I know you were supposed to wait at least 1 - 2 months to see results but I didn't want to wait that long just to find out it didn't work.
35890,I guess my mindset has changed because at this point I feel like it's my only option.
35891,All my methods I try on my own don't help and I don't get better and I've lost most of my friends because of it.
35892,"I'm considering either getting on Cymbalta (SRNI), Paxil(SSRI), or Buspar(no clue)."
35893,If anyone could offer some insight on the medications that have helped their agoraphobia/panic disorder I would definitely appreciate it.
35894,Thank you!
35895,TL;DR - Good medication for agoraphobia/panic disorder?
35896,"I've been seeing a therapist every week for these past few years and, unable to truly cope with it with many other resources I've exhausted, we both decided it's best if I go back to something I wasn't very keen on going back to, which is medication."
35897,"I'm a server at a busy restaurant and being ""weird"" because of my medication increase is a pretty big fear of mine."
35898,"In detox I was given 10MG Diazapam to help me sleep and relieve the anxiety and it worked great, but they control meds severely in detox."
35899,"I was only open to trying it because it's the only thing she offered me that isn't an SSRI, but I've already lost all interest I had in using this medicine."
35900,I need medication.
35901,Also I've read how hard it is to quit this particular medicine once you start and that the sexual dysfunction typically does not improve over time?
35902,I went to my GP who didnt think I needed medication but suggested CBT which I start on the 25th of this month.
35903,I am not on any medication because I don't wanna become dependent on a chemical.
35904,The title pretty much says it all.
35905,"I'm on 40 mg/day of Celexa and while it really helps my Major Depression, it seems to do nothing for my anxiety."
35906,"My question is basically, are there medications specifically tailored for anxiety as opposed to being a combined anti-anxiety anti-depressant that could potentially help me?"
35907,"(I can masturbate ok with porn, so I assume this is psychological)

* Doctor diagnosed me with depression, however I feel I was giving her the answers she wanted to hear to diagnose me with this as I really wanted to try the medication."
35908,My grandfather is totally against medicines.
35909,"My mom takes medicine, so when I started taking medicine, he got angry."
35910,He says exercise is the way to overcome anxiety.
35911,He says the psychiatry business is fake and they just want money from you.
35912,He also says all they do is get you addicted to pills so you have to buy more.
35913,"He used to shame me because I took medicine, so reluctantly I got off of it (celexa)."
35914,It was very difficult for me.
35915,Has anyone else had this experience?
35916,"Aside from the weight gain, I LOVE this medication."
35917,3 years ago I was put on effexor after a long period of medication trial and error.
35918,I went off of it because I wanted to quit taking medication.
35919,Now that I have been off of meds for several years my doctor has prescribed me Effexor again.
35920,"The last time I took this medication it didn't cause me to gain weight, but I have heard of people taking the same med again after time passes and gaining weight when they didn't before."
35921,"I'm taking Ativan and would like to get off it so, I'm wondering if it works well enough to not take meds anymore."
35922,"For those who have tried it or currently use it, would you recommend it while still taking meds?"
35923,I'm not on medication because I want to beat this naturally and I can't afford a doctor.
35924,I have GERD and the reflux is horrible but usually okay with the meds.
35925,I want to ignore it and hope he doesn't text me again until I get meds and feel like my old self.
35926,Usually my medicine helps me more quickly than that but I think it was only partially responsible.
35927,I've been on anti-depression meds before and I didn't like them because they made me feel extremely jittery and it kept me from sleeping.
35928,"Last year I went to a psychologist to see if I should get some kind of medication, but he said that I wasn't a clear case and that maybe I didn't need any meds but maybe they would help and that he would prescribe them if I wanted that."
35929,"Now every time I cry, I wonder what if I would have gotten the meds?"
35930,He would love to go to a doctor and try to get some sort of medication or something help him but we are very very tight on money.
35931,**warning:** This may be long.
35932,"Right this very second, I have anxiety."
35933,"I haven't slept in over 24 hours because I don't like to sleep (weird, I know)."
35934,I'm nervous and kinda scared but I *really* want to leave my house and run some errands but I know there's a possibility it will trigger a panic attack.
35935,That's my trigger: Driving.
35936,"**I lied, it's actually stress."
35937,Then driving.
35938,"Ok, I'm trying to figure out how to shorten this."
35939,I had my first panic attack when I was 16.
35940,"It was late at night, my friend was driving us on the freeway."
35941,"I didn't even start to feel anxious, it was just, BOOM!"
35942,"""Pull over, pull over!"
35943,"I feel weird, I don't know what's going on."
35944,"Oh my god, I'm freaking out, I don't know what's wrong with me!!!"
35945,"I'm so scared right now"" I knew right then and there that I was in the process of dying, this is what it's like to die, omg, I'm only 16, I don't wanna die yet."
35946,"Of course, you know I wasn't actually dying."
35947,"But that's what they feel like, **to me**."
35948,"Let me say real quick: everyone has their own feelings of anxiety, what happens to them when they have a panic attack, triggers, etc."
35949,I'm only speaking for myself (mostly).
35950,I am also diagnosed with other mental disorders but it's not the time or the place.
35951,"So, for the next 6-7 years I'm living with it, I'm adjusting to it but most of all: I excepted (finally) that this is real, and I have it and it is something that I will deal and struggle with for the rest of my life."
35952,"Of course, I know there are many, many worse hands that I could have been dealt."
35953,I see a couple different therapists and psychiatrists throughout the years.
35954,I tried sooooooo many different medications and combinations.
35955,I was a walking trial and error for all these drug companies.
35956,Finally!
35957,My psychiatrist and I find a really good combination of meds.
35958,I have been on these for 8?
35959,"years now, every night before bedtime."
35960,"They're not cure all but they help, a lot."
35961,I was in some really good therapy too.
35962,I'm not exactly sure where I'm going with this.
35963,"I guess I just want whoever reads this to know that I have been there, I am here right now!"
35964,I have had life altering panic attacks.
35965,Literally one panic attack fucked up my life real bad for awhile.
35966,I know that feeling all too well.
35967,"I, myself, get shaky, especially my legs and arms."
35968,"My palms sweat, my breath gets short then your mind is going into ""Fight or Flight"" mode, everything is so surreal and you feel like you're gonna die or combust."
35969,"Things have been really good, as good as anxiety disorder can get :/ Up until about 4 months ago, I hadn't had a panic attack in like, 2 years."
35970,I had been having very little anxiety too.
35971,"I knew I wasn't out of the woods forever but I thought age or time or I don't know what, had changed the chemicals in my brain?"
35972,or just had simply made it dormant!
35973,"**wrong**

Then this happened:

* My daughter turned 5
* I got fired from my job
* I was in and out of a unhealthy, stressful relationship

*Slowly*... like a thief in the night, it crept up on me and stole what I had worked so hard for, for so damn long."
35974,"I'm not as bad as I was but I'm worse then I was a few months ago, a year ago, 2 years ago."
35975,I am **so** stressed out right now.
35976,Like I am at my god damn wit's end due to personal stuff I don't want to get into.
35977,"To fix this, I am isolating myself from as many people as possible (they don't care anyway, trust me) and just *calm down*..."
35978,I'm not gonna get mad/annoyed/sad/yell/stress/worry.
35979,I'm gonna just chill out for awhile until I get back onto *MY* level.
35980,I left out *a lot* or I would be here for a really long time and it would be the biggest wall of text.
35981,I hope this helped someone?
35982,"even^a^little^bit If you have any questions let me know, honestly, I think I've been through almost all of it."
35983,Thanks!
35984,and feel better.
35985,"Option 1: Stay in school, and take medication (SSRI) or Option 2: Drop out of school and figure out my life and what's causing my anxiety."
35986,"I knew however, that unless I planned on taking these meds for the rest of my life (which I didn't) that this was only a temporary fix."
35987,"SO after 2 months, I decided that I was feeling ok enough to get off the meds and continue on my own."
35988,The meds gave me the freedom to work on my thoughts.
35989,"If anyone has questions about my therapy, medication ( i was scared shitless to start a SSRI), meditation or anything else."
35990,But do I want to take medication?
35991,"I go to the gym 5-7 days a week, making good money working a job I actually like, bought a nice new car, have been on a good amount of dates with women and even got sexual with some, came to terms with being bisexual, have been with a couple of guys sexually, I recently started making some money with my hobby, updated my wardrobe, kicked my depression, and have even started medication for anxiety."
35992,I really hate this thinking about meds.
35993,The anxiety which made me start taking medication in the first place seems pretty mild compared to what I'm feeling right now.
35994,"Tomorrow, I begin taking Zoloft for my panic disorder with agoraphobia."
35995,I just began reading up on SSRIs and what I've read is actually mildly frightening.
35996,* Medical science doesn't really KNOW how they work.
35997,"Researchers know that they are effective treatments and have theories on why, but there is no concrete proof."
35998,* When does it end?
35999,I don't want to take these things for the rest of my life.
36000,It seems that many people on here have been taking SSRIs for years.
36001,Too long in my opinion.
36002,What is the average treatment length?
36003,* Some people report permanent side-effects from SSRIs.
36004,How sure are you that these medications aren't simply chemical lobotomies?
36005,I'm unwilling to lose my sense of joy and pleasure simply to avoid the negative thoughts in my mind.
36006,I have a friend that started an SSRI for depression a few months ago and he seems a little... dull.
36007,His personality definitely doesn't shine as brightly as it used to.
36008,I miss the old him.
36009,Are SSRIs chemical lobotomies or an effective treatment?
36010,Should I even start down this path or should I throw the pills away?
36011,"First a bit of background information: I'm 25, female, GAD, no medication history, seeing a psychologist for two or so months."
36012,I have been off my medication for awhile now since my doctor is in Pennsylvania.
36013,"Even after I took my medication, I was on pins and needles."
36014,"This is my first actual post, so go easy on me if the format isn't right."
36015,"I'm 22, female, have GAD/panic disorder."
36016,"I am currently on Ativan only ""as needed,"" which has so far not been more than once a day, usually every other day."
36017,"I am very cautious about medication, so I try to take it only at night when I really need to get to sleep and push through everything else on my own."
36018,"I have been on Xanax previously on and off for many years, and Zoloft, Lexapro, Prozac, and most recently, Celexa."
36019,"I have since stopped all daily medications, because they think I might've had a reaction or something."
36020,"As far as triggers go, it's panic disorder, so it just kind of pops up out of the blue."
36021,"Certain things make anxiety worse, eating ""unsafe foods"" comes to mind as well as crowd-heavy situations or any place where I feel trapped, i.e."
36022,a movie theater or something.
36023,"I'm in the US, and I have insurance."
36024,"I see a psychologist weekly, a PA occasionally that prescribes my medication, and my GP as needed."
36025,"Okay, now that's out of the way."
36026,"I am 5'9"" and about 105 lbs."
36027,"Three weeks ago, I was around 10 pounds heavier."
36028,"I got pretty sick with a virus (probably) and my anxiety skyrocketed, meaning I didn't eat any solids for about 4 days and just recently started reintroducing foods."
36029,"I got pretty sick for awhile, meaning every time I'd eat I'd get serious heartburn, or it'd, uh, go right through me."
36030,"You get the picture... anyhow, been eating foods with little to no GI problems for a few days now."
36031,"This was all recommended by my GP, who expressed a lot of concern over my weight loss and weight in general."
36032,"I was already on the low end as far as that goes, and after my little episode, I was pushed into a dangerous range."
36033,My question is this... anyone have any experience with anxiety at higher/lower weights?
36034,"I feel like if I put on some weight, I will hopefully see a decrease in anxiety."
36035,"It isn't uncommon for me to go 24+ hours without eating anything, although I do drink water, tea, Gatorade, that type of thing."
36036,"I've noticed that having low blood sugar either makes my anxiety worse or it mimics the symptoms, shaking, clammy hands, unsteady on my feet, dizzy ""going to pass out immediately unless I sit down"" feelings, etc."
36037,"I have disordered eating, which is a separate issue as far as I'm concerned, but I am trying to find positives to eating more/gaining weight."
36038,"My doctor would like to see me in the 130 lb range, but I've never reached that before."
36039,"This post is all sorts of rambly and nonsensical, but I'm just having a lot of trouble."
36040,"I know it's good for me, but I just want to think it'll make a difference with my anxiety, otherwise frankly, it doesn't feel ""worth it."""
36041,For the past couple days since the surgery I've been staggering my meds (taking 0.5 mg Klonopin and 20mg Celexa at 5am and Lortab at 8am) but today I took them all together.
36042,Then stupid me looked up the drug interactions between my meds and Lortab and now I'm freaking out.
36043,I keep trying to tell myself if there were any danger my surgeon wouldn't have prescribed Lortab or told me to keep taking my meds but of course my inner voice is not helping.
36044,Anyone had any experience with hydrocodone and anxiety meds?
36045,I tried medicine.
36046,"I’m functioning much better now with medication, but over a year later this experience haunts me."
36047,"I’m finishing up college and getting ready to go to grad school now, and in general my meds are balanced enough that I can function and be outwardly “happy,” but I don’t feel like I will ever be able to get over this."
36048,"Things may be a bit over the place, for that I apologize

I stop taking a low dose of medication thinking that I don't need them while talking to my psychiatrist (it also felt awkward when i have to discuss to the psychiatrist or student helper about it every time I see the psychiatrist for other reasons.)"
36049,"-----------------------

I'm contemplating going to see if I can schedule an appointment again....  the medication I had made me sleepy most of the day, which is one of the reasons why I don't want to take it (besides me thinking I don't need it.)"
36050,(Very inexperienced regarding anxiety medication so forgive me if that sounds ignorant).
36051,"My parents also don't believe in taking meds, so they wouldn't allow me to take any prescriptions."
36052,"Excruciating headaches, insane joint pains/aches for which I have to sneak pain meds."
36053,I ended up praying to whatever higher being was listening to me because I need this medication to work.
36054,"I'll try to keep this short, I have been on vyvance (amphetamine) medication since I was 16, I am now 24."
36055,Its pretty common for individuals with anxiety/depression or any mental health problem to have very strange reactions under pain medication.
36056,However the combo with the pain meds and everything else going on had me freaking out a lot over the sensation and I screamed at a nurse that my arms were coming out of socket.
36057,"She then preceded to ask me if I have a history of anxiety attacks (i leave that bit out of my records when i can, i know its not good but i don't like judgmental looks) I confessed that I did and then they added an anxiety medication to my list, that was then given with the pain meds."
36058,Will any pharmacy be open today or will I just have to deal with not having my meds until tomorrow?
36059,"I have pretty severe depression, but am not taking medication for it at the moment."
36060,**Edit: I've never taken medication for it but have been diagnosed with GAD.
36061,I knew she had some anxiety issues and took some sort of meds for it but I guess I hadn't really considered it that big of a deal.
36062,I was on meds for 6 months with no CBT or any other counselling.
36063,I am in counseling and also doing medication management with a psychiatrist.
36064,"This means, when my prescription for my anxiety meds runs out, I am pretty much screwed."
36065,"Did you get referred to another doctor or a psych, did you just talk, did you opt for meds straight up - can you even do that?"
36066,"I have panic attacks from time to time, but for the most part, I am able to handle them without medication (have not had medication for about 6.5 years)."
36067,After showering I went and took my daily medicine .25 of Xanax (I take it 3 times a day) 75 mg of Zoloft and 36 mg of Concerta.
36068,She has meds that relax her but she can start to feel 'out of control' and it can make everything worse.
36069,"I had a month's supply of meds when I got here, and tried to make an appointment right away to get established."
36070,I got my meds again and started improving.
36071,"Then the doctor can help me figure out what to do- whether to change meds, take more time off work/school, or move back home."
36072,I have spent the past three years of my life dealing with anxiety and panic attacks related to my health.
36073,My mother died six years ago of a completely random heart disorder she didn't even know she had.
36074,She went to sleep and passed away.
36075,She was in her early 40s.
36076,"That has, obviously created some anxiety in my life."
36077,"Three years ago I went into [Atrial Fibrillation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation), at 23 this is a VERY random thing to happen."
36078,Almost unheard of.
36079,I was sent home on beta blockers and told to go to doctors.
36080,I did.
36081,"They all shrugged and said ""It may or may not happen again""."
36082,Awesome.
36083,"I have spent the last three years convinced I was back in afib, and rushing to the ER (because it can be very dangerous) and haha jk you're just having a panic attack, here are some anxiety drugs."
36084,I've been on and off medications since then and had gone almost an entire year without a single panic attack.
36085,Then three weeks ago I woke up with my heart going nuts.
36086,I spent two hours trying to relax and could not get my heart rate down.
36087,"We finally went to the ER, much to the dismay of boyfriend of seven years who said I would be fine and it wasn't anything."
36088,Low and behold: I was in Afib again and my heart rate got as high as 197.
36089,This was first time I'd gone back into Afib since the first episode.
36090,I spent two days in the hospital (I converted about six hours after being in there).
36091,"After running a boat load of tests, they again shrugged and said ""that's weird."""
36092,It's not something they can pinpoint with a diagnosis.
36093,"It's simply a ""That's weird."
36094,"Have some beta blockers, it may or may not happen again."""
36095,Since then I've been a mess.
36096,I thought I had finally beat my anxiety about my heart once and for all.
36097,"Now I am back to my old habits of feeling my heart rate, laying in bed for hours trying to figure out if the fact I just skipped a beat means my heart rate is off again."
36098,I have been to the ER so many times in the past three years because of this.
36099,No doctors have been able to tell me what is wrong and I can't tell you how many times I've had to sit myself down and not go to the ER because I thought I was dying again.
36100,I am in therapy and I thought I was getting somewhere.
36101,I *was* getting somewhere.
36102,Now I'm falling back down the rabbit hole and I don't know what to do.
36103,"Every chest pain, every twinge, every beat skipped, sends me into full on terror."
36104,I try to hide it and carry on with my life but I cant help but freak every time it happens on the inside.
36105,Trying to figure out when it's real and when it's not has become a burden I loathe entirely.
36106,"Medical issues, especially heart ones, can be so dangerous."
36107,"But I've gone to the doctor so many time, I can only hear ""that's weird"" so many times."
36108,"Hell, I work with doctors and nurses and all of them, when they hear about it say, ""that's so weird."""
36109,"Today at work, I had some pretty sharp chest pains."
36110,"I then instantly message people, co worker, boyfriend, best friend and tell them that ""Hey I'm having have chest pains"" but in a funny way that way they don't get frustrated with me."
36111,"I have ""Cried wolf"" so many times, I know it wears everyone down thin."
36112,I just don't know what to do with myself anymore.
36113,"TL;DR: Heart beats abnormally every so often, which causes anxiety."
36114,Stuck in a perpetual cycle of 'Is it real?
36115,Is it anxiety?'
36116,Any tips on how to get through this and live a fairly normal life without medication?
36117,I was busy the two weeks and hadn't been taking my medication regularly plus I had a few drinks negating the affects of the medicine but having the dog around I felt really helped.
36118,Hello.
36119,I just made this account to get some help...
36120,I have suffered from anxiety and (self-diagnosed) panic attacks for a long time.
36121,"I would like to try medications, to see if they help, but I don't have a psychiatrist...my question is this:
Is it ok to make an appointment with a family doctor and just ask for a prescription without seeming like I just want drugs?"
36122,I've never done drugs.
36123,"I've been considering just making a regular doctor's appointment and asking for medicine, but I don't want to seem like I'm just trying to get drugs to sell or something."
36124,"I could just buy some Ativan or Xanax from a stranger, but I want to go about this the right way."
36125,Have any of you just requested a prescription from a regular MD?
36126,Has it gone well?
36127,I have a great fear of trying to get medicine ever since my friend showed me John Mulaney's bit about trying to get a prescription.
36128,Thanks for everything.
36129,"EDIT:

Thank you, everyone."
36130,I feel a lot better about making an appointment with my doctor and just asking and being honest.
36131,"I had meds prescribed to me before but they were just for sleep, which is super hard for me."
36132,I've always struggled with depression but I am not on any medication for it.
36133,"As far as meds and therapy go, I hate having to be dependant on medication, and the therapy I have tried in the past didn't work, because all I could think of was, ""this person doesn't care about me, she's just getting paid for this"", so it didn't really help."
36134,"I mean, if meds are the answer, then maybe I need to lighten up about that, but really, I'm just sharing my story here to see what you guys think."
36135,It's been ruining my life for a long time and whatever has been holding me back from getting proper help has gone away and I really want to try the medication route.
36136,We were going to try starting out some medication when I got back from winter break but I didn't go back to the school and instead moved back to my home state.
36137,"What's most important - in this ""hard period"" medicine wasn't helping me - I can say it confidently because I've tried plenty of different doctors/pills/therapies/etc."
36138,"I know there are hundreds of types,but I was just curious if there was a really common medication that some or most of r/anxiety takes."
36139,I know that some of you are adamant against medication.
36140,I'm not on medication or anything (but I'm looking into it.)
36141,"Obviously, my anxiety wants to point me to a heart condition but my logical side tells me that I never once had these palpitations prior to my anxiety/medication after years of playing organized basketball."
36142,When I get really anxious I will lie.
36143,For no reason.
36144,I will start saying things that make no sense really.
36145,I went to the ER the other night for high BP that turned out to be anxiety.
36146,The doctors and nurses were treating me horribly so I of course became anxious.
36147,When they'd ask me questions I would lie.
36148,For example I told them I hadn't been taking some of my medications when I had.
36149,My reasoning at the time was if I tell them this maybe they'll go away and let me leave.
36150,How do I stop this??
36151,?
36152,"I’ve done medication, meditation, reiki, healthy eating, not-so-healthy eating, journaling, hundreds of dollars on self-help books, and drawing my feelings."
36153,"I’ve found medication, over the years, to useful."
36154,"I'm usually not one to take medication but at that point, I would have done anything to feel normal again."
36155,"Now my problem is that my meds make me feel like I'm not here, that I'm not myself anymore."
36156,"Now, my being the stupid person I am I decided that I was tired of feeling like that so I didn't take my meds for a couple of days, and again the freak out happened."
36157,**Tl;dr: 17 year old with Anxiety and Depression decided to stop taking meds and then had a freak out.
36158,I've been dealing with pretty bad anxiety and panic attacks for about 2 years now.
36159,"when they first started i suspected they were caused by one of my daily medications (ie birth control/ allergy meds) things that COULD cause increases in anxiety, but probably not if you had already been taking them for years."
36160,"I didn't take them for about 2 weeks and my symptoms did not subside, so i ruled them out as the cause."
36161,"I then saw a doctor who was very unkind, and quite rude to me about how i was feeling."
36162,She sent me off with a script for paxil 3 days before christmas.
36163,Paxil was pretty awful for me.
36164,"I was told to take it at bed time, and within 1 hour of a 10 mg dose i was having and muscle spasms and thought someone was outside my door waiting to hurt me."
36165,"I tried calling the doctor, but no one was available in the office."
36166,"In hind sight i should have gone to the emergency room, but wasn't sure how they would be able to help me and felt really embarrassed."
36167,"Since this incident, i've had a really hard time taking medication of any kind."
36168,Even taking an antacid causes me great anxiety until i've been symptom free for over an hour.
36169,"I work in a very active environment, with a lot of people."
36170,People around me already have coughs so i'm worried about the impending cold and flu season.
36171,I have used cold medication while having anxiety but a recent bad reaction had put me off another brand.
36172,Nyqil keeps me awake or gives me nightmares.
36173,"I used Dylsom for awhile with no issue, but last time i used it i was jumpy and jittery and got no rest."
36174,Does anyone else have this problem?
36175,Or have suggesting for of cold meds they use.
36176,I have a therapist and psychiatrist and am on some meds but now I'm getting afraid of what the meds are doing to my brain and body.
36177,I currently go to therapy but am not on any medication.
36178,I won't have a therapist at school but I have the university clinic open to me for meds.
36179,"I've never taken medication for anxiety (it's been an issue like this for a couple of years, but had phobias and stuff since I was little), the idea of becoming reliant on them scares me."
36180,"Six months ago I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over and had my wife take me to the ER."
36181,Felt like I was having a heart attack and like I was going to pass out.
36182,"They ran a blood test, urine test and EKG - everything came back normal."
36183,Since then I have basically been living in fear of the next attack.
36184,"Headaches are a daily occurrence, stomach seems to always be upset and I always feel tense."
36185,I have a prescription for Xanax which I only use when I feel like I am dying and I take 20mg of Buspar daily.
36186,The Buspar seems to take the edge off but the anxiety is always right beneath the surface.
36187,"Even though I have been checked out by several doctors, and everything is normal, I still feel like there is something wrong - haven't had a scan of my brain, but I have come close to asking my doctor."
36188,I know this is my anxiety but sometimes it seems impossible to shake the feeling that I am dying.
36189,"Even talking about my anxiety causes physical pain - I will get a headache, feel like I am going to pass out, and my entire body sort of tingles."
36190,Can anyone share their stories or relate to my experience?
36191,Any books that have helped?
36192,Any medications that have helped?
36193,Definitely in need of reassurance that I can learn to cope with this - have always been anxious/nervous type but never have had it affect me this physically.
36194,"Caught me by surprise after my 27th birthday, not a very nice present."
36195,"The person who diagnosed me was a psychiatrist, and it took kind of a long time, though trial and error, to choose the right medication for me (venlafaxine)."
36196,"my  symptoms have gotten much better and I want to begin to go off the medication, but my medical doctor wants me to wait another year or two - he says that lots of people go off their meds and them come back three months later when their symptoms come back and they need to go back on the medicaiton."
36197,"But if I change meds now, it's gonna take a long time to go through the process of finding the right one again, no?"
36198,And it takes months and months to get an appointment with the psychiatrist I saw originally - or is my normal medical doctor qualified to help me find a different medication?
36199,Has anyone else had these experiences with Venlafaxine or other meds?
36200,How do i know if I can be ok with medication?
36201,"Currently in therapy, just made an appointment to talk with a psychiatrist about medication (which is a whole different beast) but have been struggling the past few months with pain issues."
36202,"I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder among other things, and nothing appeared to work, except benzos but they tend to put me right to sleep."
36203,"Over years I've done literally _all_ SSRIs, and got nothing but sexual side effects, not even any relief from MDD."
36204,I started doing [Stronglifts 5x5](http://www.stronglifts.com) a couple months ago and it's helped a lot.
36205,"It improved my confidence dramatically, but I was still feeling edgy for no reason."
36206,"I tried inositol, 18g a day."
36207,"Seems to help a tiny bit, but nothing to write home about."
36208,"To say that I'm not a big fan of alt medicines would be an understatement, but since that shit is ruining my life, I'm exploring everything I can."
36209,A few days ago I received my order of [Ashwagandah](http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B000Q40GMC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).
36210,I'm taking 2 pill in the morning.
36211,Now I don't know if it's a coincidence but ... wow.
36212,"I'm here at work this monday morning, and just learned something rather trivial but that would usually have made me worry senseless ... and I'm just realizing I don't give a fuck, as it should be."
36213,"Again, I don't know if it's a coincidence, I don't know if it's going to last, but so far this is looking good."
36214,Just posting this so that others can give it a try if it can help them.
36215,I've never taken any sort of drug before besides pain meds.
36216,i've struggled with anxiety for a very long time and take medication currently.
36217,"PS was on medication previously, stopped due to terrible side effects and money."
36218,I also have ADHD which I am taking medication for.
36219,"My doc increased my meds since I'd been on Zoloft for 5 years and prescribed me 25mg  Xanax for emergencies and whatnot, I never even took a xanax."
36220,"Now I have anxiety medication to knock me out if I need it because my panic attacks cause my heart rate to speed up over 200 bpm, which isn't particularly healthy."
36221,I don't want meds or therapy.
36222,I never took any of the meds prescribed to me because I have a strict no-antidepressant way of life.
36223,"I HATE taking pills or medication, and I've read that SSRI's can fuck you up pretty badly, so that plays right into my hypochondria."
36224,They did a blood test which was normal except for my thyroids which I take medication for now.
36225,My biggest phobia is throwing up - and right now I fear I will from the medication reduction or from being sick.
36226,"Often I'll be feeling this type of anxiety and want to take medication, then I'll think, do I want to medicate away my excitement?"
36227,I used to take medication for anxiety.
36228,I have gotten meds (ssri and beta blockers) with my standard insurance but I really want therapy so that I use my time on the meds to build up better habits.
36229,"Some of my direct and extended family members also experience it, but as far my direct family goes, only my dad and I have been severe enough to have been diagnosed, prescribed meds, and sent to therapy."
36230,"(I'm very susceptible to any type of medication, and the effects always last a long time on me)."
36231,"What's available to me, medicine wise?"
36232,"I'm a bit afraid of using medication as a crux, but by god, the difference was like night and day."
36233,"I have been diagnosed with GAD, and tried talk therapy and multiple rounds of various meds, but I did not find either approach helpful (actually I found both seemed to make the anxiety worse, and not in a worse-before-better progress sort of way- just worse)."
36234,"None of the meds I've tried except sedatives/hypnotics that work immediately have any positive impact, and I'm not willing to use sedatives or hypnotics nightly (plus, I know they would lose effectiveness if I used them this way, and I'd rather reserve the option for nights I MUST sleep well)."
36235,"Now it's been rather calm, since I take a kind of herbal medicine that is supposed to help me sleep."
36236,Has anyone started having panic attacks after starting a medication?
36237,"Apologies if this does not fit the general post format here, as this is my first post in this forum."
36238,[**possible trigger warning for violence and death for this paragraph**] I have suffered from anxiety (maybe PTSD as well?)
36239,beginning in my early childhood.
36240,"I was in a pretty serious car accident, and saw one man's face ripped from his head, and another torn in half by his broken windshield."
36241,"The images have stayed with me, and beginning in my early childhood, I suffered from nightly panic attacks."
36242,"The fear of death and non-existence are what haunt me, to be exact."
36243,These fears send chills down my spine simply writing out the words.
36244,"It took me many years to realize that an individual who made fun of these crippling fears was not a friend, and that sending me into panic attacks on purpose was wrong, because almost everyone did it."
36245,"I have had therapy on and off, medications (that work) on and off (I'm hoping to go renew my prescription soon)."
36246,It took me around twenty years to realize that my life and how terrifying it is is not normal.
36247,"I now have a wonderful partner who will wake up and calm me down as soon as she hears my hyperventilating, and this is a sort of nice bandaid that I would not trade for the world."
36248,She loses hours upon hours of sleep because of me.
36249,"Unfortunately, the attacks persist, occasionally even if I am on my medication (usually if I do not exercise and self-medicate in addition to the prescription)."
36250,I've come here really to see if anyone has anything similar.
36251,I'm not looking for advice or coping as I've become fairly well-versed in the most popular self-medications and self-help.
36252,I'm just wondering if anyone else has these awful panic attacks nightly that prevent them from sleeping and leave them with a crippling feeling of doom.
36253,I've never met anyone else who spends their night screaming and sweating and enduring panic attacks.
36254,I feel somewhat alone in the severity of my illness.
36255,"I have known many survivors who suffer from frequent attacks as well, but are triggered by different things."
36256,I have never met anyone else who can't sleep and who is afraid to be alive.
36257,I guess I would just like to know if I'm not the only one.
36258,"I'm currently on no prescribed medication, I don't do much other than listen to music and game so I don't get out all that often (my most recent major incident was on the way home from the latest Batman movie a couple of days ago)."
36259,I finally took the next step of treatment and decided to get some medication to beat this disease.
36260,"I wish I still had my emergency meds, but I haven't been to the doctor in a very long time."
36261,"Considering I sucked at my last two jobs, I don't know why the hell I thought managing people's medicine was a good idea."
36262,I used to go to Therapy with a Psychologist and he told me that in the state I was it was better for me to go to a psychiatrist to judge if I needed meds.
36263,"I have been to doctors since high school, seen therapists and have been on many different types of medication for depression, ADHD and Anxiety."
36264,"I'm pretty sure I have Anxiety as it most accurately describes what I go through on a daily basis but ADHD medication seems to work the best for me, let me explain..."
36265,Some background info on meds: I currently take 50mg Amytriptyline at night and 3 x 40mg Propranalol throughout the day.
36266,I disagree with medication because it just numbs the problem it doesn't solve it but i'm seriously considering it.
36267,"I have thought about getting on medication for awhile but I just wasnt sure what they could possibly prescribe, when Im having my panic attacks they weaken me and leave me feeling like I just got done running a marathon when in reality, all I did was go to Wal-Mart."
36268,So what have you guys done to make things easier or what medication have you been on that actually worked?
36269,"Ok, so I think I've reached the point where I'm seriously considering taking medication."
36270,Right now I feel like I might have to start taking medication though.
36271,"I don't take things like medication lightly so yeah, I'd appreciate your opinion."
36272,- Do you reckon I should try medication?
36273,- What if all my fears are legitimate and things get worse while I'm on medication?
36274,- Do you reckon my psychologist would stop seeing me/stop caring about me if I took medication and perhaps felt a little better?
36275,"- I'm aware medication works differently for everyone but does it normally make things a lot better or ""just"" bearable?"
36276,"- Can medication help with the feeling of being completely and utterly overwhelmed by stress, anxiety and life in general?"
36277,"- Can medication help my cognitive functions (memory, ability to focus etc) get back to normal?"
36278,- Will I experience any difference straight away or does it always take weeks for the medication to kick in?
36279,"There are three things I'm really afraid of when it comes to medication:

1."
36280,That my therapist and people working within the field of psychology will stop trying to get to the root of my problems if I start taking medication (I know this might sound weird but I sort of like the attention I get from psychologist because I've *never* had anyone try to understand the way I think before.
36281,"EDIT: Oh and I should probably add that I also find it very difficult to accept the fact that I might have to take medication to be able to function ""normally""."
36282,I went to my primary care doctor 2 weeks later and he gave me some anti-inflammatory medicine.
36283,They gave me some medicine for that.
36284,"Longtime lurker on this sub, i believe i posted here once before but i can't remember for sure."
36285,I've always had very bad anxiety with lots of triggers.
36286,"Here are a very few examples, the most significant ones, i guess:

**Talking on the phone to anyone:** except for certain family members, boyfriend(mike, because he's going to pop up alot in this post), and about 3 of my friends

**-Being around any strangers without mike close by."
36287,"**

**-Driving anywhere but dead neighborhood roads:** i can't bring myself to 50 on the highway sometimes, the speed limit ranges from 55-65 on the highways i need frequently."
36288,I'm always worried about getting into a wreck.
36289,**-*Everyone* else's driving:** Mike and i were in an accident in a very tricky area just under a year ago.
36290,"Ever since then, i can't sit calmly or quietly (i.e."
36291,"not being a complete backseat driver and aggressively informing the driver of every stop sign, yield sign, traffic light, pedestrian, every move of every other driver on the road, potholes, telling them when they're going too fast-which is usually when they are going at or under the speed limit- and anything else you wouldn't want to constantly hear while you were driving, that's what i do.)"
36292,I'm always squeezing my eyes shut every few seconds.
36293,"I'm always slamming on my imaginary break, tightening my seatbelt, moving my seat forward so the seatbelt will be more restricting and then leaning back in my seat, hugging my knees to protect myself if we get into an accident."
36294,"I always tell mike to please go at least 5 miles under the speed limit, and if the weather is bad, 10."
36295,"When he's driving, he has one hand on the wheel and holds my hand with the other."
36296,I'm constantly asking him if he needs his hand back (i personally have some difficulty driving with one hand).
36297,Here's the big one.
36298,I'm always afraid somebody is going to die.
36299,This is the hardest part for me to write.
36300,"My cousin, who i was close to, was killed in a stupid wreck two years ago on february 4th."
36301,"I always knew death could be sudden, as everyone does, but never worried about it until that happened."
36302,"It made me superstitious, i think."
36303,I feel like situations when people die are always ironic.
36304,(Is that the word i want to use there?)
36305,"Like the fact that my cousin and i had not seen each other in a long while, and then we finally met up and spent a wonderful 4 hours talking a few weeks before he died."
36306,"The easiest way i can think to describe what i mean, at the risk of sounding insensitive, is that it's a ""go figure"" kind of situation."
36307,"Ever since then, i'm always looking for little signs in everything."
36308,"I know this part probably sounds silly but i'm trusting you not to laugh, r/anxiety, because i know you don't judge."
36309,"Once i was leaving mike's house and listening to my music, and the first line of lyrics i heard when i got in the car were ""if i had known this would be the last time we'd be alone, i know the words i chose would not have been the one i spoke."""
36310,"I cried all the way home because of that, then proceeded to tell him not to go anywhere the next day because i had a bad feeling."
36311,I don't like talking about death because i feel like that's when it happens.
36312,I don't like joking about something bad happening to somebody because then it happens.
36313,"I have never told anybody all this because then it's out there, it's relevant, it's been talked about and thought about and then somebody dies or something really bad happens because i decided to bring it up, and then i'd be thinking, ""what are the odds, when we were just recently talking about dying?""."
36314,I hope i'm making sense so far.
36315,I'm already kicking myself for writing this because it's just as bad typing it as it is to say it to anyone else.
36316,"So whichever redditors are reading this, you'll be the first to know it."
36317,I haven't been able to bring up to anyone my fear of the subject of death.
36318,I'm making myself upset so i'm done now.
36319,The worst parts of my anxiety are really anything car-related and the death bit..
36320,"The *only* things i've found so far that work to stop or at least somewhat subdue my attacks(depending on the severity) have been mike, and pot."
36321,I never wanted to be on medications but lately i have been seriously considering talking to a doctor about my anxiety.
36322,"I've had quite enough stomach churning, vomiting, quite literally worrying myself sick, palm sweating, severe stress headaches, dry mouth, throat closing, heart pounding fun to last me several lifetimes."
36323,"I understand that alot of subscribers here go to therapists or psychiatrists, or what ever the proper term may be."
36324,I'd like to say that i do not want that.
36325,"I do not want to go and have weekly, monthly, or anything-ly  sessions talking to somebody about this."
36326,I just want it to be stopped.
36327,I am going to make a doctor appointment.
36328,"Now that i've given you a novel's worth of background information, what i want to know from you, r/anxiety, is what should i expect?"
36329,"What will my doctor ask me, what will she tell me?"
36330,What sort of answers should i have prepared for her?
36331,Is there a chance she can't give me anything for my anxiety?
36332,"I hear so much about people lying to their doctors about anxiety to get drugs that i worry (who saw that coming, right?)"
36333,that maybe they made it more difficult to get anxiety medications.
36334,Or that they upped the suitable level of severity that qualifies people for prescriptions and that mine won't be good enough.
36335,Thank you for reading.
36336,"Edit: punctuation, wording"
36337,"I am currently not on any medication, never have and 25yo male."
36338,"Is there some sort of medication, or therapy?"
36339,"I'm concerned about dealing with a new medication with the stresses of class, losing friends or a boyfriend from side effects and personality changes..?"
36340,"medication, sleep, exercise, diet, toxic substances)."
36341,I'm actually feeling somewhat decent and the medication is helping but my problem lies with Clonazepam.
36342,Not on meds (yet) besides the inhaler I occasionally use.
36343,"I'm no stranger to anxiety; I'm on meds that work most of the time and I have a therapist who is fantastic, but I'm not doing too well at the moment and I know the exact reason why."
36344,"I do have a history of depression and anxiety, but I've been on medication for years and I'm totally fine."
36345,I'm not currently on any medication or have anything to take to calm me down.
36346,Making a throwaway as there are some things I haven't told people around me only because it seems quite personal.
36347,"Anyway for the past couple months I have had very bad anxiety, and now deciding I need to do something about it."
36348,"There have been some issues my parents, such as my dad writing and saying they are only together for me and just want me to be succesful."
36349,He was saying basically I had fucked up and will continue to do so because I had experimented with drugs a bit at that time.
36350,I feel like I need to take every oppourtunity that I have to do so such as going to college two years early.
36351,There have been huge amounts of stress because when I had found just the notes from  my dad after they had kinda just been really far away (note: this is about a year ago) I had my first anxiety attack with physical effects on myself didnt think much of it was super emotional for a while.
36352,"Talked to my dad about it eventually and said he would try to patch things up between them, at this point I had thought he would do so and try to fix the relationship."
36353,He never got back to me about doing so I went to ask him about it and nearly blew it off as it was super little as it may be who knows.
36354,He said he dont mean it when he wrote it but he made no effort showing he didnt.
36355,"Basically I have started to have more and more panic attacks about many things, the stress of my school, my parents, and bad thoughts that are constantly in my mind such as death."
36356,Ever since I was little I would sit and think about death and the after life and would scare myself this went away for about 5-7 years until recently when I would feel like diein whilst in a panic attack.
36357,only until last night over facebook did I actually tell someone and not until then did I realize how good it was to get it off my chest.
36358,I was in a panic attack for about 2 hours and my friend was here keeping me warm and drinking water.
36359,While I talked to my friend who is having issues with his parents currently and did suffer from anxiety but has gotten over a lot of it.
36360,"I was talking to my mom and she offered me to go a therapist and talk and I figured this was good, only my mom doesnt really know about my dad not wanting to be together but only for me."
36361,Maybe I just shouldnt get involved.
36362,But is there away I could go see a therapist without my parents consent I suppose if I have a way to pay?
36363,"I am also on no medications for it and my parents would rather me not take any so kind of out of the question, or after talking with my therapist would she be the best to call it."
36364,"I have so much time to think of thinks I dont want to and so many possible outcomes, as I dont really have many hobbies I enjoy, I mean I go run sometimes but thats about it."
36365,"Sorry for ranting, any help or advice on what should I do would be helpful."
36366,Thank you so much.
36367,Now I am living a shell of a life without medication.
36368,"It seems like my only option is back on medication but like I said, they don't settle with me."
36369,What if the only thing that is helping me is the medication?
36370,I don't care how afraid I am about telling someone or how I might forget to take my medication.
36371,"Current meds:  Klonopin, 3mg/day

Past meds:  Paxil (two rounds, 40mg and 60mg), Lexapro (20mg), Effexor (350mg)

Here's the problem."
36372,How many meds have you tried and in what classes before you found the combo that worked for you?
36373,I'm curious if eye twitching or muscle twitching in general is common for anyone else dealing with their anxiety/panic attacks or if anyone experienced anything similar to this in using Zoloft - especially while their body was still in the adjustment phase of the medication?
36374,What do you guys think I should do about my meds?
36375,These meds have ruined my life and nothing that I do seems to make any positive difference whatsoever.
36376,"Wondering if its worth easing off the meds, or is it simply the cost of not having bad anxiety episodes?"
36377,I am still accepting &amp; managing living my life with PTSD and though I have been better than ever (no meds/flashbacks/night terrors for almost a year and a half!
36378,"It is somewhat relieving in my mind to know I have backup plans with the meds and therapy, but my mind keeps telling me that I'll have to live like this forever."
36379,"I've had an anxiety/panic/depression disorder since I was about 15, i went to therapy for a little while, took medication for a bit and for the most part things have been okay I suppose."
36380,Made a throwaway to submit the following.
36381,"I have suffered from anxiety for a very long time, and, even though, I'm on medication, some days get really bad."
36382,I just want to try and feel whole again.
36383,Without going on more medications what can I do?
36384,My current example goes as follows.
36385,"While tending to a leaky roof (triggered round 1 of anxiety), I found a bat in our attic (trigger round 2 of anxiety)."
36386,"Roofer came and it was a relatively easy fix, so that was fine."
36387,Then I had a wildlife contractor come out to assess the bat situation.
36388,"Basically he said, that due to the amount of guano, it seemed to be a single, rogue, bat."
36389,"He was very forward with me and said that it would be $1800 in order to seal everything up and get rid of the bat, guano, etc."
36390,"He followed that up by saying, that if I paid that to him, he would feel guilty because it was, as he called it, a ""stupidly small problem."""
36391,"In other words, he didn't feel there was a chance of a colony, or anything like that."
36392,"In addition he, as the pro, said not to believe everything I read about rabies, disease, etc., because the actual %'s on those are miniscule."
36393,"Seems fine, right?"
36394,Nope.
36395,My stupid mind won't let it go.
36396,"EVEN THOUGH, a professional told me to my face not to worry, I can't help but search out all these stories on the internet, and I'm still terrified."
36397,"I can't afford $1800, and last night I didn't sleep a wink."
36398,"My wife, however, nodded her head at the pro, and is 100% fine with the situation, and is sleeping like a baby."
36399,"I'm at work, and still feel like I have the shakes, and my mind is telling me that A) It is absolutely certain the bat will get into the living quarters, B) It will bite me in my sleep, C) I will get rabies from it and die."
36400,"I don't know what else to do, since I don't want to be more medicated than what I am now, but I'm really starting to worry about my health (high blood pressure, heart problems), if I can't accept even an expert's opinions about something!"
36401,"What is so wrong with me that everyone else would be satisfied and move on, but I just can't?"
36402,"Sorry this is so long, but it does feel good to kind of get it out."
36403,"Between good meds, a good therapist, and a year of practice coping, it's coming together."
36404,[meds] Hello friends I had a question for anyone who has taken celexa before.
36405,I started on Zoloft less than a week ago.
36406,I've tried 8 or 9 other medications in the past and none have been a good fit.
36407,"My Doc seemed sure that this was a good idea (not as much of a ""numbed"" feeling, less chance of weight gain, less odds of the yawning issue) since day 1 I have felt really nauseated about 50% of the time."
36408,I called Monday to see if there was anything i could do about it and unfortunately my Dr is out of town for the week.
36409,"The other Dr in the practice (I've seen her 2 or 3 times in my life) offered a switch to lexapro and while I had them call it in, I'm not sure I want to switch to one that I've heard can be way worse."
36410,"I have a follow up appointment on the 20th and I'm having such anxiety (heh) about making the switch and regretting it (what if that side effect wont last much longer, etc)."
36411,"Does anyone have ideas on how to calm the nausea, or experience with it going away after a short time?"
36412,"Long time lurker, first time poster."
36413,Like many others here I have severe anxiety.
36414,One of my worst faults is that I listen and look to others to make my decisions for me.
36415,I often think to myself that people who don't have this must know better than myself.
36416,Logic and anxiety don't really go hand in hand.
36417,My latest mess up is that I've been looking at leaving my job be a stay at home wife.
36418,My husband and I have talked about it for years and it has finally become a reality.
36419,This is where the mess up comes into play.
36420,I have been planning on putting my two weeks in and I finally told a co-worker who I know I can trust.
36421,"She convinced me in asking to go half time.... Now, this is very unlikely at my job, or so I thought... My manager said it is most likely a possibility and now I'm mad at myself that I didn't just listen to myself and put in a notice....."
36422,I know how extremely lucky I am that this is even an option for me either way...
36423,Especially since this has never been an option to anyone in my family before.
36424,"I grew up very poor, helping raising my siblings..."
36425,I've never NOT worked since I was 14.
36426,I never had a choice not to.
36427,But now I'm mad at myself and having extreme anxiety right now.
36428,This isn't something my family nor my husbands family approves of since both of our immediate families have the mentality of thinking that a woman prefers to be in the workplace.
36429,I've been with my husband for nearly 10 years and know this is right for us and what we have talked about since we met.
36430,"But, once again, I often let my family and his family do the thinking for me."
36431,"Often thinking ""they know what they're talking about, I don't."""
36432,I don't know what to do to stop having panic attacks and calm down.
36433,"I'm on anxiety medications and have been to therapy, but when it comes to directing my own life, I take a backseat and let others do it for me."
36434,Does anyone else have the same bad habit?
36435,Have you been able to break out of it in any way?
36436,"I'm 19 year old female with a mix of ADHD and GAD, both for which I've been taking meds since 4th or 5th grade."
36437,So I had originally posted asking about peoples experiences on these medications and got some good feedback.
36438,"[This is the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1m5209/meds_i_am_about_to_start_effexor_and_xanax/) 

So this is my update."
36439,Its a little late but I wanted to be able to give a proper and accurate description of how I've been.
36440,Before starting I had some pretty severe depression and anxiety symptoms.
36441,"I had suicidal thoughts and tendencies, as well as a lack of motivation."
36442,So its been a few weeks now and I'm on 225 mg of the Effexor and it works really well.
36443,"I'm beginning to feel ""normal"" again."
36444,"I still have the occasional panic attack, but for the most part I am really happy with the results."
36445,I did have some severe side effects when going up to 225 that were scary.
36446,But they passed within a week!
36447,"I'd like to thank the people who asked for an update, it made me feel like someone really cared."
36448,just wondering if anyone can relate or share an experience where they have been stable on meds then get hit with extreme situational anxiety.
36449,Hiya.
36450,I'm 29/M and I've struggled a long time with really bad anxiety and depression.
36451,I can't stop thinking about traumatizing events.
36452,"""Traumatizing"" makes it sound like something horrible happened in my life, but that's not necessarily the case."
36453,"It's mostly me making a mountain out of a molehill times 1000, which is pretty much what anxiety is, after all."
36454,"The ""trauma"" is people who were mean to me, said something very hurtful, or wronged me in some way that was really stressful to deal with."
36455,"Instead of being able to forget about those jerks/bad times and being able to move on, I go to bed, and lay there constantly thinking about those moments/people."
36456,"It's even worse when waking up, I immediately have a rush of anxiety when waking up and again think about those horrible times in my life."
36457,"Then it leads to bad depression where I constantly think about the world is mostly filled with awful/ignorant people, most of them in positions of power, and how I don't understand the world or the people in it."
36458,"Not a good way to start each day, and that depression hangs over me all the time."
36459,"Even worse, I end up being mean toward the people around me whom I care about the most, people who are usually nothing but great to me."
36460,"I bring them down with me, just because I'm always sad and angry."
36461,BLUH.
36462,I hate living like this.
36463,"I don't know what do, it's been like this for so long."
36464,I've tried so many medications and I'm bad at therapy.
36465,I just can't stop obsessing over the worst things in life.
36466,I guess I should feel lucky but honestly it makes me think the medicine either isn't working or that I'm not actually sick and this is all a big mistake.
36467,"I don't want to take medication, mostly because I feel like I would be wasting peoples time, but also because i feel like it would change me too much."
36468,"Hey guys,
I have a question and need some general guidance."
36469,"24/Male, have anxiety, intrusive thoughts of a sexual nature and possibly ADD."
36470,"I'm seeing a psychologist and we've been discussing things, primarily my traumatic childhood."
36471,"Given that childhood, I was poked and prodded at my local hospital's child psych pavilion, tested for multiple things like ADD, ADHD and the like."
36472,Came back negative but had signs.
36473,"Fast forward 17 years later, I'm in engineering, have a 45 min attention span, easily distracted and am a dead ringer for ADD."
36474,I had wanted to get tested again because it seemed like a logical thing to do but is unfortunately expensive.
36475,"I had recently obtained some inheritance money so I decided to go for it despite my mother telling me otherwise (""You came back negative, how much does it cost, why are you wasting your money, you were tested"")."
36476,"So I started to fill out the questionnaires, and started to fill extremely shitty as well."
36477,"It's almost like ""rate how fucked up you are from a scale of 1-5""."
36478,I've been feeling helpless for a long time and this certainly did not help along with my psychologist telling me that a chunk of my anxiety is bottled anger from my childhood.
36479,"In the meantime, I got a referral to a psychiatrist from said psychologist and have been prescribed ADD medications: Strattera."
36480,"According to him, it supposedly can help with anxiety."
36481,I haven't felt any better on either front.
36482,Has anybody had luck with such medication?
36483,It also makes me question if I should treat my anxiety instead medication-wise.
36484,"Overall, I just feel even more broken, helpless and confused."
36485,I'm moody and even more anxious than I feel without meds at all.
36486,"I guess it's possible that  I just need to find the ""right"" meds and the ""right"" therapist, but I don't know how to do that when even just going to the post office or answering emails is almost as much as I can bear."
36487,I'm on the wrong meds and have the wrong therapist.
36488,Are there any good long-term medications for anxiety/panic attacks?
36489,When I had my first panic attack i told my doctor about it and he gave me Xanax.
36490,"Every time I feel anxiety or panic coming on i take one, but im starting to feel guilty because I know xanax is addicting and has serious withdrawal symptoms."
36491,I would like to get some names of some good long-term medications that you guys use and bring them up to my doctor.
36492,"Panic attacks are a fairly common and treatable condition, but panic attacks in children can be especially alarming."
36493,"They can also be more difficult to diagnose than panic attacks in adolescents and adults, since children aren’t always able to accurately describe the emotional components of a panic attack."
36494,What Are the Symptoms of Panic Attacks in Children?
36495,"Panic attacks in children involve the same symptoms as panic attacks in adults, which include:

•	Pounding or racing heartbeat
•	Intense feelings of fear
•	Fear of dying or losing control
•	Sense of unreality
•	Trembling and shaking
•	Sensations of shortness of breath
•	Dizziness or lightheadedness
•	Feelings of choking, being smothered, or tightness in throat

Because the symptoms are largely physical, a panic attack can easily be mistaken for a more severe medical emergency, such as a cardiac event."
36496,"Fortunately, panic attacks are not dangerous or life-threatening, even though they are highly unpleasant."
36497,What Causes Panic Attacks in Children?
36498,A panic attack is a heightened response to feelings of anxiety and fear.
36499,It is essentially a runaway fight-or-flight reaction that spirals out of control.
36500,"When a person is nervous or afraid, it engages the sympathetic system, causing changes in heart rate and alertness that have to do with the release of adrenaline."
36501,"When anxiety is intense and overwhelming, this can escalate into a panic attack."
36502,"Some people may be more prone to panic attacks, a tendency which usually runs in families."
36503,Panic attacks are usually symptomatic of an underlying anxiety disorder.
36504,"Children, like adults, can develop symptoms of anxiety."
36505,"Individuals with an anxiety disorder often feel nervous or fearful, and are likely to become excessively or irrationally worried about things in their life."
36506,•	Generalized Anxiety Disorder is the most common anxiety disorder.
36507,"•	Panic Disorder is characterized by frequent, recurrent panic attacks, and excessive anxiety about the possibility of having another panic attack."
36508,•	Social Anxiety Disorder involves excessive anxiety in response to social situations and fear of social embarrassment or rejection.
36509,"•	Specific phobias are characterized by anxiety in response to a particular fear, such as spiders, heights, or snakes."
36510,"Treating Panic Attacks in Children


Panic attacks in adults are often treated with medications such as SSRIs (Zoloft, Prozac) or benzodiazepines (Xanax); however, these medications are not generally recommended for the treatment of children."
36511,"Methods of treating anxiety disorders and panic attacks in children include:

•	Counseling or psychotherapy can help reveal the source of a child’s anxiety, as well as reassuring the child that panic attacks and anxious feelings are not his or her fault because they may suffer from guilt and self-blame."
36512,•	Cognitive-behavioral therapy teaches children skills for dealing with panic attacks and the anxiety that causes them.
36513,"This includes learning better strategies for dealing with situations that are likely to cause anxiety, which can help prevent panic attacks from occurring in the first place."
36514,It can also teach new ways of thinking about stressful or scary situations that can evoke anxiety.
36515,•	Parent guidance can help parents learn about their child’s anxiety and cope effectively with future panic attacks.
36516,"When a child is experiencing a panic attack, it is important for the parent or other accompanying adult to be calm and reassuring."
36517,A comforting presence can be extremely helpful during a panic attack.
36518,A parent can also help the child with relaxation and breathing techniques.
36519,"With the help of dedicated professionals and supportive caretakers, children can overcome anxiety and reduce the frequency and severity of panic attacks."
36520,"I’ve had counseling, I do self talk, I’ve tried everything but medicine."
36521,"I made a post on here earlier, but I have a small question: I'm going to see a psychiatrist soon, and I have a grocery list of meds I absolutely refuse to take."
36522,Can I recommend or request a specific medication?
36523,"I'm hoping CBT will help me alone, as it did before, but I'm looking at a medication now to quell the worst."
36524,It feels like torture and I want to give up.
36525,I've tried therapy and several medicines and I can't seem to beat it.
36526,She wants me to see a mental health counselor because she wants me to learn some coping skills before trying meds.
36527,I started having panic attacks early this year.
36528,I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy.
36529,Everybody's panic is different - mine manifested in being convinced I would die.
36530,If I was hot - I interpreted that as a risk of heat stroke.
36531,"I had an episode last 4-6 hours, ending in me laying naked on the bathroom floor, sopping wet from being in the shower, trying to find any way to cool down."
36532,I was covered in goosebumps and I forgot what being cold/hot felt like.
36533,I couldn't interpret it anymore.
36534,I thought surely I was going to have a stroke.
36535,"If I started to think about my breathing, I was afraid I wasn't breathing enough."
36536,I would start panicking.
36537,"It started with a numb feeling in my face, until I would get tremors that coursed through my body, thinking I was dying, that there was something wrong with me."
36538,"I would search for a pulse and if I couldn't find one (I've always had difficulty finding my pulse) I would think my heart stopped and any second, I was going to die."
36539,"If my heart was beating rapidly, I would think I was having a heart attack."
36540,So I accommodated my anxiety more than I should of.
36541,I couldn't stand direct sunlight anymore.
36542,"After my first public panic attack in the super market that lead me locked in a public bathroom, laying on the floor, I didn't want to leave the house anymore."
36543,"After enough attacks, I wished I would die during them, just so I wouldn't have to live in the constant fear of another attack anymore."
36544,Death would at least offer me a reprieve.
36545,I began seriously thinking about this - how could I live my life in such constant stress and fear?
36546,"However, through most of this, I never sought help."
36547,"I was told by my mother that I was ""more logical"" than that, to receive medication, and by others I loved that I should just ""deal with it"" on my own."
36548,Then I spoke to some people on forums who told me:  Just get the prescription.
36549,Just go to the doctor - get something to control it.
36550,The stigma on medication was very negative from others in my life.
36551,But I realized that because of this - I didn't need the strength to overcome the disease - I needed the strength to acknowledge that I needed help.
36552,"To break this habit, to stop suffering."
36553,"I went to the doctor who prescribed me a no-refill xanax prescription, 0.5 mg.  Not a daily dose."
36554,"She said take 1 if I have anxiety, 2 if I have a full-blown attack."
36555,I read online before taking any that you shouldn't take it if you have breathing problems.
36556,"Because I am as paranoid and as scared as ever, I had a pulmonary function test (breathing test)."
36557,"It didn't go too well (I fell short of the reference marks, but not too short, and I did react to one of the medications I inhaled, but not until the second-highest dose showing that I was sensitive, but likely didn't have severe asthma), but it didn't say that I had a severe problem either."
36558,"Still, my fear was strong."
36559,I didn't take any of the drugs.
36560,I had my 30 pills for a month.
36561,The strange thing is during this time - I didn't have an attack.
36562,Just the placebo effect of knowing I had a way to stop an attack IF NECESSARY made them not develop fully.
36563,"Sure, I still had episodes of me sitting around worrying, I still felt great dread at leaving the house too far, but none developed into the 5 hour crippling sense of fear and demise that lead to me being locked in my bedroom, avoiding those I loved."
36564,"I was able to go on an overnight trip, I feared being in the car a little less."
36565,It wasn't the solution - but it was made just a little bit more bearable.
36566,"I didn't want to get 'fucked up' on these pills, but it sure was nice knowing I had a way to lessen the fear - even if I didn't take them."
36567,"Then, the time had come to take one."
36568,It was last night.
36569,All weekend I was in a heightened state of anxiety.
36570,And last night it started culminating.
36571,"I was feeling very hot, which lead me to feel not like I was dying but like I was very ill, very off."
36572,I was acting very irritated.
36573,"I started to get afraid that I would have an attack again, which only made things worse."
36574,"My boyfriend, initially against the medication, suggested I take one pill."
36575,I did and the fear set in immediately.
36576,What if I'm allergic?
36577,What if I do have a breathing problem?
36578,What if I die from this?
36579,"I drank half a beer 24 hours ago, what if they mix poorly?"
36580,For twenty minutes I lie still and repeated a mantra to myself.
36581,Then it worked.
36582,"In twenty minutes, I did not feel high."
36583,I didn't feel 'fucked up.'
36584,I simply felt calm.
36585,"Not relaxed, not sleepy, just simply and utterly calm - I couldn't force myself into an attack."
36586,The idea that something was seriously wrong stopped being broadcast on my consciousness.
36587,"It went out not with a bang, but with a whimper."
36588,"I had been dealing with this monster for months before seeking help, and finally, for one time, I didn't have to lie in fear."
36589,I didn't have to coax myself into sleep just to avoid lying awake in panic.
36590,"I got to feel normal for a night, before drifting off to sleep."
36591,"I plan on enrolling in cognitive behavioral therapy once I can afford to, hopefully sometime during my next school semester - this is the optimal way of dealing with anxiety FOREVER."
36592,"In the meantime, I have a message for those suffering who have not sought help - please do."
36593,"Please do not suffer when there is something out there that can break the habit, that can offer you a sense of normalcy."
36594,"Do not abuse these drugs because if you do, their reward will be truly lost."
36595,But do not avoid them either due to stigma.
36596,"I get it, 'white-man lab-coat medicine bad' is what I've been told all my life."
36597,But there IS a reason that these drugs are on the market - it's because they work.
36598,"Now I feel even my state of anxiety will be lessened over time, since I have taken the pill and seen that I have no reason to fear it."
36599,"I hope at the end of my prescription, with no refills, I will have no reason to ever seek it out again."
36600,"But in the meantime, I feel truly healed."
36601,"Do not let the fear of prescription drugs prevent you from getting help like I did - start healing, and start healing today."
36602,"Long story short, I've been dealing with my anxiety for about 4 years now and I finally have it as under control as ever."
36603,Lexapro daily for about almost a year now and a very low dose of Klonopin when needed if I feel a panic attack coming on.
36604,"The problem now is that, like most people with anxiety and ADD, the two kind of go hand in hand."
36605,"Right now, my ADD is out of control."
36606,"I can't finish a complete thought, a complete sentence."
36607,I literally stop in the middle of my sentences and just space out and it's driving everyone crazy.
36608,Everyone around me has really been noticing it lately as well.
36609,I can't watch a full episode of a show even and I'm on my phone the whole time switching between apps just listening to the background noise.
36610,"If I put my phone away I'll just start focusing on something else, like how I'd rather watch another show or messing with my cats."
36611,"I'd like to talk to my doctor about it, but I'd also like to hear some feedback from people who have had similar experiences and how they dealt with it."
36612,I've taken ADD medicine in the past and had great results but stopped in favor of anxiety medicine (you really can't mix the two) and I have terrible insomnia issues with those medications as well.
36613,I'm always antsy and moving around.
36614,I'm just so frustrated.
36615,I keep trying so hard to get myself to focus but I can't and this spacing out is just the worst.
36616,Before my anxiety I was speaker of the year for the state of Texas and now I can't even finish a fucking sentence.
36617,I can't finish a book.
36618,Anyone else?
36619,"Suggestions, help?"
36620,Felt present and motivated on my medication.
36621,"I was doing good with my medication when I was feeling good, got stuff done, then when this happens I can't focus one bit."
36622,"I think I may want to see her either more often, or find a new psychiatrist who I can see more often if she can't, and I think I may need to go on medication for anxiety."
36623,Will medication help or should I maybe consider inpatient treatment?
36624,"Do any of you have routines that make sure you get your meds, or suggestions on how to remember them?"
36625,"I'm scared shitless of that though, because my mother had a growth on her thyroid and my step father had his removed and now has to be on medication."
36626,I had to have an upper endoscopy and wasn't allowed to take any of my medication.
36627,Now I ask her if she considered taking medication for it and she dismissed the idea.
36628,"I know it's her body and her own responsibility to choose to take meds, but i'm just worried about her mental well-being."
36629,For a while I was on Citalopram and one other medication that I can't recall the name of and neither ever ended up working (I'm terrified nothing's ever going to work).
36630,I've never had good experiences with meds and want to overcome this with CBT and my own will!)
36631,I'll be 28 in a few days and I've had anxiety all my life but the near crippling effects didn't start to interfere with my life until I was about 23 or 24.
36632,I have several instances of anxiety every day but I'm usually able to stomp them out before they turn serious.
36633,I probably have about one serious attack a month and maybe one or two smaller attacks every week.
36634,"Today, I had a smaller attack over something I consider really goofy."
36635,I've been extraordinarily lucky with my experiences because I was volunteering as a teacher for NAMI when the symptoms hit me the hardest.
36636,Since I was well versed on anxiety and cognitive behavioral therapy (which I taught to family members of those with mental illnesses) it wasn't hard to incorporate those positive practices in to my life.
36637,"With a little bit of mild medication to help take the edge off physical symptoms I couldn't control, I was on top of the situation only after a year."
36638,"The worst of it involved me hiding in a closet for days, having to quit my job and leave my position as the Vice President of that regions affiliate with NAMI, and crying hysterically  when I left the yard around our house."
36639,"I've had a steady job since then, went through promotions, worked for myself, committed myself to an amazing relationship that involved moving two states away from my friends and family, and I start college soon."
36640,"I've even taken a fear of flying and rocked it by going to England/Scotland for two weeks where I climbed, hiked, backpacked, etc."
36641,Things I would have never done before in my life!
36642,"Despite my successes and the 'control' I have, I'm still plagued with frustrating anxiety attacks."
36643,I've conquered so many fears and have dealt with personal issues one right another and have won them all but there's always another battle to face.
36644,It is overwhelming and tiring.
36645,I guess that's why I was looking to rant.
36646,It is agonizing that I've come so far and have done so well but I can't shake the attacks....
36647,I feel stuck with them and I'm afraid that probably is true.
36648,"Thankfully, I've also found a lot of comedy in my anxiety; humor being one of the best medicines I've found to cope with everything."
36649,"So today's fun adventure in anxiety all revolves around a honey flavored, twice dipped in batter corn dog."
36650,If I had known what type of terror that delicious bringer of disaster had in store for me I would have settled for the left over meatballs huddled up in the fridge instead.
36651,It was the best part of the corn dog that betrayed me too; the little crispy batter that hangs out on the stick after you've devoured everything.
36652,It was a tiny piece of that which got stuck in my throat for only a second.
36653,It didn't even hang out long enough for me to choke.
36654,"No, it merely tickled my esophagus in to just enough of a tizzy to bring on a coughing fit."
36655,I couldn't stop coughing either!
36656,"I tried drinking a bottle of water, spitting out everything I coughed up, and even tried brushing my teeth in hopes that the mint from the toothpaste would somehow magically defeat the onslaught of hacks and hooooork-hawrrrkks I was producing."
36657,I've had dental work done lately so my gums are sensitive little buggers at the moment and they didn't enjoy being violently brushed with the hasty consideration a cat would show to a pile of catnip.
36658,Gargle.
36659,Swish.
36660,Spit.
36661,BLOOD.
36662,There was blood in the sink.
36663,I started coughing more.
36664,I spit again and..... more blood.
36665,Calm and logical rationale would say that my gums were bleeding and it was no big deal and the coughing was annoying but would pass soon.
36666,Nope.
36667,I'm obviously dying.
36668,I can't convey in words how that process went play-by-play but it didn't take but a moment for the idea of death to evolve in to every symptom an anxiety attack can produce.
36669,"Now my hands were shaking, I was going in to a cold, tingly sweat, I couldn't breathe properly (though I actually could as I was talking to myself calmly the whole time), my stomach did cartwheels, and the adrenaline kicked in all Requiem for a Dream style with the sound effects and artistic symbolism."
36670,This is where the cognitive behavioral therapy comes in to save the day....or tried to at least.
36671,"For some reason, I could not realize sound logic and reason for being of logic or of reason at all."
36672,(Keep in mind that the blood I spit out was minimal and upon examining my gums I even found the spot that hadn't fully recovered from my procedure the other day.)
36673,"Me: ""I'm coughing cause I almost choked on a corn dog."""
36674,"Mind: ""You're coughing cause your lungs are filled with blood."
36675,"You are literally drowning in your own blood right now."""
36676,"Me: ""I'm numb and tingly because of the adrenaline rush and the blood flowing to my vital organs to protect me - this is a natural flight or fight response."""
36677,"Mind: ""How can it?"
36678,Your blood is almost gone cause you're coughing it all up.
36679,"Soon you'll bleed to death."""
36680,"Me: ""I'm AnonDoodily and everything will be ok."
36681,"I'm in my house where I'm safe and I know all the irrational things in my head are a direct result from pani-""

Mind: ""Are you sure that's who you are?"
36682,"Oh God, why are you just standing there monologuing like a vilian and not trying to save us?!"
36683,"Also, your brain is about to explode."
36684,"Also, that pain in your stomach?"
36685,Totally where you ripped something from all the coughing you did and now your stomach acid is leaking in to your blood steam.
36686,"Just sayin'."""
36687,I obviously couldn't trust my brain to chill out so I needed a sounding board.
36688,"I always calm down the quickest if I can spell everything out and come to calm and sane conclusions on my own and just having someone else go, ""Uh-huh."
36689,I understand.
36690,That sounds about right.
36691,"You're going to be fine,"" really seals the deal."
36692,"I immediately took my medication, sat down and focused on my breathing, and called a friend I trusted to help listen to my dilemma."
36693,About five minutes later I calmed down and even as I write this I'm growing sleepy and I'm sure a nap will be in order.
36694,It just amazes me how I can feel so empowered day in and day out and I'm tackling all these big goals in my life but somehow the crust on a corn dog stick can take an entire afternoon up and demolish my confidence temporarily.
36695,I know it'll be ok though and writing it all out was helpful too.
36696,Edit: Format issues.
36697,The meds are working.
36698,"I started medication, but it just doesn't help."
36699,It takes time on each medication to evaluate whether it's working properly or not.
36700,I'm not on any medication.
36701,"I've been seeing a therapist and I have an appointment to see a doctor about meds in a month which hopefully is going to help me cope, but the type of career I have been looking at that would be something I could be happier doing is working with animals in some capacity."
36702,"To be fair, the whole situation was a major undertaking considering a) I had never lived away from home longer than the month and a half I studied abroad and b) I took myself off of my medication before leaving because acquiring the medicine while abroad would have been a really messy process."
36703,"I've been up all night, can't get comfortable, and am nauseous."
36704,Is this normal/has anyone experienced this with these medications?
36705,"I tried taking my first dose of Celexa with dinner because my doctor didn't specify a time of day to take it, and I took the bupropion earlier in the day when I was having an attack."
36706,I didn't find it really helped.
36707,"But I have worked myself up into such a state, thinking that accepting medication is a ""failure"" (ridiculous I know) and that they will just make me sicker, that I worry I won't be able to make myself take the first one tomorrow morning."
36708,Tl;Dr - Scared of my new meds.
36709,I sometimes wonder if my anxiety meds make me apathetic to things I should feel something for.
36710,"I've been on and off various meds over the years, and am currently on Zoloft, Adderall, Klonopin, and Ambien, and seeing a psychotherapist."
36711,I've been off meds for a month or so.
36712,"Commercial about side effects of medicine, panic."
36713,she believes I need medication (which I am not against) This anxiety and panic is hard guys.
36714,"I'm not on any anxiety meds, though I do take kava tea on occasion."
36715,"My main issue is that she sees therapy and medication as personal failings, and doesn't acknowledge anxiety and depression as legitimate medical problems."
36716,My doctor recently switched my medication from citalopram to pristiq after some allergy issues and I feel quite well other than the whole body numbness I just developed.
36717,DR told me he had a very bad reaction to the meds.
36718,"The morning of this incident, I'd had plenty of sleep the night before, eaten breakfast, taken my meds and didn't feel any fear or anxiety prior."
36719,"He's on medication and has seen therapists, but he never had a handle over his anxiety."
36720,"I exercise, see a therapist, and do take meds."
36721,"Unfortunatley the medication I was on was not the right one for me and it wasn't until two years and a lot of issues (including a few panic attacks) later that I stopped taking my medication and tried a new medication that I actually feel in control and for the lack of a better word, normal."
36722,"But now that it's been a year on this new medication all I can think is, I was at times actually happier with anxiety than I am now."
36723,I'm a social security lawyer.
36724,"A lot of my clients are mentally ill, and anxiety is especially common among them."
36725,"I also have an anxiety disorder, and my doctor put me on klonopin."
36726,"It *does* something to you, to know that you take the same medications, at the same dosages, as people who are telling you their anxiety is so severe that they can't hold down any kind of job at all."
36727,It's just as bizarre when I win my klonopin cases as when I don't.
36728,"Recently, I had a case where the client tried to overdose on klonopin and tried to kill himself."
36729,"That fucking *does* something to you, okay?"
36730,And what does my doctor say?
36731,"""You can't OD on klonopin; you just can't."""
36732,And he ups my fucking dose.
36733,"When you're taking *more* meds than your clients, that does something to you too."
36734,In the past my doctors have recognised that i have anger problems and anxiety however no medication or therapy has been given.
36735,I've also seen a lot of over the counter medication to help with stress.
36736,"I've used weed for the past few years which was great but have built a tolerance toward it, no longer as effective, and its not the best thing to rely upon as a functional medication, affecting you cognitively."
36737,Is medication the right move or therapy?
36738,I'm just taking a minute to say that this finding balance between my thyroid condition &amp; medication for that..... fibromyalgia related symptoms ...... and depression &amp; anxiety medications ....it just seems to be a big damn trade off.
36739,"I'm exhausted from the low thyroid and whatever else,  when the thyroid meds ""work"" I have the side effects of anxiety surges and those are counter productive (my anxiety is crippling), then my depression is worsened,  then I feel awful and give in to a klonopin or half of one and I'm back to being sleepy."
36740,It's all bullshit!
36741,At least when I'm not on medication I know what to expect.
36742,"So my psychiatrist prescribed Celexa to me today, it'll be the first mental health medication I've taken since I was ~16 (I'm going to be 20 next month) and after reading up on the side effects, I have to say - I'm incredibly nervous."
36743,This is my first post and i apologize if it gets a bit too long but i really want to give you all the best information to be able to get the best advice.
36744,I'm 16 years old and i need some advice because recently i have been going through some really bad anxiety attacks.
36745,I started getting anxiety attacks a few years ago and visited a psychologist.
36746,I quickly overcame the anxiety and stopped going to the psychologist.
36747,The anxiety is now back and i feel it is much stronger.
36748,I now have a new psychologist and he wants to put me on medication.
36749,I really don't want medication because the side effects scare the crap out of me.
36750,"I am in the 11th grade and i go to a school that expects A LOT from their students, it is pretty stressful."
36751,During the first few weeks of my first semester my anxiety was pretty bad and i had to leave school because i was absent a lot from not wanting to deal with the stressful environment at school.
36752,I was home schooled for the remainder of the semester but would have to return to school for the second semester.
36753,During that time my anxiety had pretty much disappeared and i felt great.
36754,I finished the semester and  aced all of my classes.
36755,"During this time my family and i go on an annual trip to Mexico to visit relatives for 3 weeks, While i was in Mexico i had very little anxiety attacks, maybe one big anxiety attack."
36756,I came back home and was starting school again.
36757,The day before i had a HUGE anxiety attack.
36758,"I was feeling hot, breathing heavy, throwing up, and was just not able to relax."
36759,"I eventually fell asleep and the day at school went fine, there is never really to much work the first few days coming back from a break."
36760,I am at home now and i am freaking out over school tomorrow and my parents want me to take the medication my psychologist suggested.
36761,I have read online that every medication has tons of side effects and can even be addicting.
36762,I would love to know about any alternatives to those scary addicting medications.
36763,Any advice would be great.
36764,Thanks in advance.
36765,"I don't have insurance of any sort, I'm self-pay and currently in-between doctors since I refused to accept a woman who's 'uncomfortable' prescribing me anxiety medicine as my doctor."
36766,And Sunday I'm told that my 91 year old grandmother is fighting pneumonia.. since last week I've been drinking pretty heavily since I'm not on any meds at all.
36767,"I understand that there are a lot of changes that go on in the brain at the start of taking medication, but I just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this."
36768,"I was depressed, on rough medication that made me feel numb all the time, and was just really desensitized to all this stuff."
36769,"About two months ago I quit using anti-depressant SSRI, medication which I've been using on and off for about 3 years."
36770,Could really use some useful tips about coping with anxiety without medication.
36771,"I used to see a therapist during a period in which my depression was really bad, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but never given any medication."
36772,"In a perfect world, I'd take meds and be at least a bit more confident, but I don't know if that would help?"
36773,"**My questions are bolded at the bottom if you want to skip to them, the next few paragraphs are just some background on me."
36774,"**

So the other day I posted about problems with delayed ejaculation while taking Lexapro, and I just saw my doctor about it."
36775,He put me on Wellbutrin *along with* Lexapro to cancel out this effect.
36776,"However, the other concern I was having with Lexapro was the fact that the bottle has a warning saying not to drink while taking this medication."
36777,"I asked my doctor about this and said I wanted to switch to something I could have alcohol with, and he dismissed it saying all of these types of medications have that warning on the bottle, and to just be careful about drinking."
36778,I'm a college student.
36779,"I never even tried drinking until my second semester, but I wanted to become more social and live a little."
36780,"It turns out, I like to have a few drinks on the weekend when I'm at school."
36781,"It doesn't exactly turn me into a social butterfly, but it makes me more comfortable at parties, and I want to make more friends at school because I'm very shy and I'm really not great at meeting new people."
36782,"I'm a little guy, 5'6, and about 125 lbs, so I usually have around 5-7 drinks and get buzzed to tipsy."
36783,"I've been blackout drunk once and that scared the living shit out of me, and actually caused a **lot** of anxiety for me for a few months (before I started taking meds), but that let me know my limits, and ever since, I've been much more careful about pacing myself and cutting myself off when I've had enough."
36784,"I've only drank once this summer, but I was going to sleep over my friend's house tonight and get drunk."
36785,"However, I noticed that the Wellbutrin label has the same warning about alcohol as Lexapro."
36786,I didn't even consider that I shouldn't start a new medicine before a night of drinking until right after I swallowed the pill.
36787,"I'm definitely willing to miss one night of drinking, but I want to be able to drink a few times with my friends over the rest of the summer, and I definitely want to be able to drink at college."
36788,**I'm taking 10 mg of Lexapro and I just started 150 mg of Wellbutrin.
36789,Lexapro alone is supposed to amplify the effects of alcohol.
36790,"If I'm taking Wellbutrin along with that, will that amplify the effects even more?"
36791,"** 

Also, I'm not very comfortable with this doctor."
36792,"This has only been my second visit with him, but he seems very dismissive about my questions and concerns, which is why I'm turning to reddit for advice."
36793,"However, my mom said it's hard to book a psychiatrist, so I probably won't be able to find another for a few months, so I'm going to have to deal with him for now."
36794,"I have depression, and don't take meds."
36795,"I've never been on any kind of psychiatric medication before, so I'm not sure how I feel about this yet."
36796,I just can't anymore.
36797,I haven't gone to an actual class in nearly a month.
36798,"The anxiety I get from being in a building for an entire day around dumb people and teachers who ""try"" to make the situation better."
36799,Last semester I went for a month and then couldn't take it and failed for not going for 3 months.
36800,"Now all I do is sleep and eat pretty much, rarely have the energy to go outside to even walk a dog."
36801,"This is something my family has noticed, but yet we have failed to tell my father (who is of great expectations for me to graduate and go to college next year)."
36802,"I am in therapy, but what is the best way to tell him that I failed the previous year and may be forced to drop out this year if I can't find the correct solution to being in school."
36803,"Also, a current option is medications is anyone actually on them and advise using?"
36804,I've attempted to go on medication to get the anxiety under control to no avail.
36805,My friend has been dealing with anxiety and depression for some time and just a few months ago started medication.
36806,It's not as though she doens't still deal with any anxiety though and I fear for a time where she may build up a tolerance to her medication.
36807,How do you keep the ball rolling in a positive direction once medication has put you in the position to do so?
36808,"I don't think I've posted this here before... if I did, I apologize."
36809,I'm on 45mg of Fluoxetine and some other medications.
36810,A bit into the Prozac treatment I started  getting  muscle spasms.
36811,"Some days it happens  a decent amount, others it doesn't or I don't notice it."
36812,"For example, my foot or knee may spasm."
36813,"I've even had my abdominal  muscles spasm, but that's rare."
36814,Hand muscles spasm as well.
36815,"Not major spasms like my hand flies out to the side, but enough where it is annoying but people may not visually notice it."
36816,"I told my psychiatrist and he said it doesn't seem like an issue, and if the meds are working to stick  with  them."
36817,I'm going to see if maybe I can lower the Prozac dosage or something.
36818,Thoughts?
36819,"Psych appointments thus far have just been medicine pushing, which works but also causes me to forget most of the very memories I was trying to experience."
36820,I want to be able to lead a least a semi-normal life without needing to take medication for anything social.
36821,My medication is levelling out and I even spent some time after the funeral with the family and their friends at my brothers place.
36822,I have ativan for panic attacks and I've tried taking other meds but they make me too sick.
36823,"Yes, I am taking medication, and no, I'm not TOTALLY sure if it's working, but I'm talking to my doctor about it as soon as I can."
36824,Three weeks ago my doctor prescribed a new medication to hopefully help with the panic attacks.
36825,"Tonight I told my mom (who btw, directly witnessed the catastrophic, life-ruining panic attack) I started a new medication and that I was anxious about it."
36826,"I've tried lots of different meds (paxil, prozac, celexa, zoloft, and ativan for my really anxious days) I've been on 75 mg of Zoloft since December 2014 (previously on 100mg) I wanted to start tapering since I was worried about being on an SSRI since my husband and I want to start a family in the next year or two."
36827,"I'm going to try medication next, but I don't know which type I should use."
36828,What are your experiences with these types of medication?
36829,"It's too late to have medication prescribed to calm me, but what are some things I can do to have a good flight?"
36830,I'm constantly tired and was just attributing this to my anxiety meds.
36831,My anxiety meds have helped me be calm and Im able to go through the day without a problem but now Im wondering if I just have an overactive thyroid.
36832,"Well, maybe the truth will suffice: I could really use some support from people here for a few days, especially if anyone knows about K. 

My partner/roommate doesn't have exp w/meds, and anyway has her own probs right now (dad is very sick and days are probably numbered)."
36833,You would get lost in my medicine cabinet.
36834,"**

**What I would like to accomplish here is to get opinions on what is happening to me, my meds, coping mechanisms you may have developed, and just to hear from people who experiences the same symptoms that I do."
36835,"I have been seeing him for over five years, and while the meds I am do help, I am hoping there is something more I can do, because life at times is still pretty shitty."
36836,"Here are the meds I am in case it might be helpful: Wellbutrin XL, Lexapro, Lamictal, and Adderall."
36837,The medication had begun to do its work and I could definitely tell a difference.
36838,"My meds were eventually change from the Zoloft, which I didn’t feel was being as effective, to the meds I listed above."
36839,I was wondering if anyone has found any relief through OTC non-holistic medications?
36840,I no longer can afford my doctor and antianxiety meds and desperately need some relief.
36841,Any and all advice is very much appreciated!
36842,Thank you!
36843,"For as long as I can remember, I've been anxious."
36844,You would never know from meeting me though.
36845,I'm personable and charming and outgoing and friendly.
36846,"I'm fortunate enough to have been blessed with art skills, therefore I can get away with being the weird, nervous, arty girl."
36847,"I've worked my anxiety into my personality, and it works."
36848,"As far back as kindergarten, I was positive I would die if I walked into a classroom after the bell rang, and I would freak myself out so badly that my mom would let me stay home."
36849,"My heart skipped a beat whenever the doorbell rang, and I would hide in the bathroom and spy out the window until they left."
36850,"Forget about ringing other peoples doorbells, I literally didn't go to a friends house alone until I got a cellphone with texting capabilities so I could text them when I was outside."
36851,"I don't call anyone, I don't walk anywhere unless I can see the path I have to walk, I frequent the same places so I don't get stuck somewhere."
36852,"The funny thing is, I love change."
36853,"I love new places and new experiences, as long as I'm not alone."
36854,"Anytime I get asked out or someone wants to befriend me, I immediately get sick."
36855,"I don't have many friends, the ones I do have aren't aware of my anxiety."
36856,"My boyfriend is amazing and super supportive, and my dog is the only thing that can really calm me down."
36857,It probably doesn't help that I'm scared of any and all medications.
36858,My boyfriend had me try marijuana for the first time last week.
36859,"We smoked every day for the past week and a half, and I've found it doesn't help anything, it just makes me feel sick and my head hot."
36860,"I've tried talking to my family, but my parents, as great as they are, have their own lives and are unreceptive most of the time."
36861,"My panic attacks are always quiet and I'm alone so much that no one ever sees them, so it never got brought up while I was living with them."
36862,"My sister thinks I'm being dramatic and keeps telling me to just ""get over it"" and that I'm just asking for attention."
36863,I believed her for a long time.
36864,I figured I was just overreacting and that I need to get over it.
36865,"Up until today, I didn't know this was a real disorder."
36866,I just thought I was weird.
36867,I recently got hired at a restaurant.
36868,I'm completely capable of waiting tables without freaking out too badly.
36869,I hide it well.
36870,"I'll say something stupid, stumble, drop some silverware, and walk away from a table with my cheeks burning and a death wish in my head, but I can control it on my face."
36871,"When I get through a table without any triggers, I literally get emotional and have to hold back tears of joy."
36872,"It's hard, but I thought I could handle another waitressing job."
36873,"Yesterday, the thing that got me was the calendar app on my phone."
36874,"I set 3 or 4 alarms for each shift so that I show up on time, and the app displays my next shift whenever I check my phone."
36875,"I'm used to it, which is why this was strange."
36876,"Every time I looked at my phone, I had a panic attack."
36877,"Just the simple green box that said ""Server - 3:00"" set me off."
36878,"As I get closer and closer to 3, I feel worse and worse."
36879,That's when I found r/anxiety.
36880,"So now, I've been sitting here crying for the past hour, reading through all these posts, because I had no idea that what I'm feeling isn't normal, and that I can potentially do something about it."
36881,I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.
36882,I'm still deciding if I can go to work today.
36883,I've got 2 hours.
36884,"Right now, I'd rather just do a no call/no show, and sleep the rest of the day."
36885,"I texted my mom and told her I'm serious about seeing a doctor, because I can't let this affect my life anymore."
36886,I think 22 years is enough.
36887,"In the meantime, I'm glad I found you guys."
36888,"So, hi, I guess."
36889,He takes anxiety meds and doubles it up around travel time.
36890,"However, my anxiety is problematic enough that I would like to give the medication more of a chance to work."
36891,"(A cross-post for the sake of visibility/subject-matter relevant to both subreddits)

About 2 years ago I began attempting to treat my depression/anxiety."
36892,So far every medication has drawn no results.
36893,"These medications are (each one was taken 1.5+ months at max dosage):

* Effexor
* Zoloft
* Xanax
* Prozac
* Lexapro
* Cymbalta
* Buspar

**I don't even notice I'm taking the medication, I feel absolutely no different in any way."
36894,"**  By ""noticing nothing"" I'm not implying that I'm simply not noticing ""good effects,"" I literally mean I notice no difference - at no time during any of my 6 trials could I even tell I was taking the medication, it felt the exact same when I was taking the medication as when I wasn't (heck, I even quit some of the medications instantly when my trial was done rather than taper down as an attempt to really confirm my suspicion - I felt the exact same)."
36895,It's for this reason that I've long been wondering about the noticeable effects of medication.
36896,"Most of all, **would a non-depressed/anxious person notice anything if they were to take the medication?"
36897,**  Perhaps I'm not actually depressed/anxious and that explains why I notice nothing (?).
36898,"This would be highly unlikely given the prevalence of depression in my family and just self-reflection, but I don't want to look like a fool by ruling it out as a possibility."
36899,I don't want this to serve as a rant.
36900,Instead I'm genuinely curious if one without depression/anxiety would have any noticeable effects from medications.
36901,"`(Also before someone gets angry about the wording of the title I should note that I used ""normal"" for the sake of a succinct title, though I obviously understand its connotation - in this case I'm using it in place of ""a non-depressed/anxious person."
36902,""")`

EDIT: I saw my doctor today and they confirmed that a non-depressed/anxious person would in fact not notice anything, though this is in contradiction to what some people are saying in comments so I'm still unsure."
36903,"Update (6/27): Started taking Buspar, notice nothing (of course...)."
36904,"I'll likely be meeting with a psychologist soon, and possibly my doctor to discuss options/suggestions for medication."
36905,I had just started medication - I'd been on Citalopram for a week or so.
36906,"Since the past year, I've started to experience what I believe are anxiety attacks."
36907,"Everytime I get on the train, I feel as if everyone is looking at me; it makes me feel very uneasy and I start to sweat nonstop."
36908,I feel my body temperature rise and usually have to get off and wait for another train.
36909,"I've eliminated factors such as temperature, I'm not overweight and the sweating is terrible, often causing me to throw up."
36910,What medications can I take for this?
36911,"Like I said, I've only been on the meds for 10 days, but the change in mood is very apparent."
36912,"In fact, he upped the dosage on my meds."
36913,"I tried posting this in /r/fitness, but apparently a lot of them don't understand the problem with anxiety."
36914,"I'm male, almost 27, 255lbs."
36915,I don't have insurance and can't see a doctor about my problems because of the costs.
36916,Weight was always a pressure point for my anxiety.
36917,"There was a lot of issues with feeling like I wasn't living up to people's expectations of me, but weight was more of it than anything."
36918,"Sometimes I would see people looking at me and *just know* that they were thinking about how sweaty I was or wondering how anyone could let themselves get so out of shape, etc."
36919,6-7 years ago I was being treated for anxiety.
36920,"I went through Lexapro, Effexor and Paxil trying to deal with panic attacks that only seemed to become more frequent with every passing month."
36921,"My anxiety led to depression, withdrawal and eventually an attempted suicide."
36922,"I didn't want to die, but my medicines were pushing me in the wrong direction and I didn't have anything left to support me when I finally hit the breaking point."
36923,I'd pushed all the good things away.
36924,"I dropped out of college, moved back in with my parents and started working."
36925,"I was too busy to exercise, moving a lot less and I ballooned in size."
36926,By April of 2012 I was 320lbs and just on the edge of morbid obesity.
36927,The website I used to calculate that had a sidebar explaining that morbid obesity takes 10 years off your life expectancy.
36928,"Right off the top like that, 10 years were gone."
36929,"I had gotten better at handling my anxiety, but I knew I wasn't really strong enough to dive right in to weight loss."
36930,"Being outside, where people could watch my struggles, laugh at how hard it was for me to do something as simple as walking..."
36931,"I knew people really didn't think that way about me, or at least not the people who mattered, but it didn't stop my body from seizing up every time I imagined it."
36932,My solution was night-time excursions.
36933,"I felt guilty for being so weak that I had to hide from my neighbors, but it worked."
36934,"I started with walking, graduated to running and then slipped into cycling when my knees started to show some strain."
36935,It worked.
36936,I'm down 65lbs.
36937,I wear smaller clothing and I felt better.
36938,"Best of all, was knowing I'd overcome that initial anxiety."
36939,"It was a personal victory, you know?"
36940,"I didn't feel my knees turn to jelly when I bumped into a neighbor, I didn't feel like uncertainty and shame were going to steal my breath away when I looked at the grocery store clerk."
36941,"A better diet and exercise probably helped with those feelings, but more than anything it was the self-satisfaction of knowing I had deliberately faced up to something I was afraid of and turned it into a positive thing."
36942,"Then today, it all came crashing down."
36943,My neighbor stopped by to have a chat.
36944,"I don't get a lot of visitors and, at first, didn't even really recognize him."
36945,"I had a few twinges of terror when I pulled open the front door, but nothing disabling."
36946,"I smiled, shook his hand, and started a conversation."
36947,"Even looking back to five years ago, that's a huge success."
36948,Back then I would have ignored him until he stopped knocking.
36949,What he had to say...
36950,It just destroyed every bit of progress I've made so far.
36951,He wanted to apologize to me for something he'd done.
36952,"I was confused at first, because he seemed to mean me specifically and I didn't even know of him wronging my parents, let alone me."
36953,"He insisted it was me he needed to speak to, so I offered to hear him out."
36954,"As he started explaining, I actually had to prop myself up on the door so he wouldn't see my legs shaking."
36955,The jelly was back; that unexploded ball of quivering energy in my midsection that obliterated all rational thought.
36956,"My neighbor, it seems, had reported me to the police."
36957,"Someone had been scratching his car, leaving trails in the dust and what not."
36958,"In his effort to find out who and why, he'd set up security cameras and started watching out his windows at night."
36959,Guess what he saw?
36960,"Me, trying to get over my issues with my self-image."
36961,"Every night, he watched as I left my house in the dead of night and returned around an hour later."
36962,"He went to the Sheriff, gave them my name and even included some rumors he'd heard about me getting into trouble and getting kicked out of university."
36963,"Looking back, a million little details have started making sense."
36964,"When the Sheriff made his rounds asking about vandalism, I'd asked the neighbors to find out what was going on and every last one of them pretended to have no idea."
36965,"Other things have happened since, and it's clear to me that they all knew and blamed me without any evidence."
36966,I've gone from feeling anxious and knowing my fears were baseless to suddenly knowing that the shady glances and ignored waves were deliberate.
36967,My neighbors think I'm a thief and a vandal.
36968,"Worse, the thing I would have used to cope with this has been taken from me."
36969,If I try to go out for a walk tonight I know I'm going to feel like I've got a target on my back.
36970,"I can feel it right now, making me weak and shaky even though I know I'm *not* going to be able to deal with this tonight."
36971,"Every house and every window has a set of eyes behind it, just waiting to accuse me of being..."
36972,I don't even know all of what they've blamed on me.
36973,The neighbor made it crystal clear that there are in fact rumors about my attitude/criminal behavior.
36974,"For years, I've felt like a monster, failed evolution."
36975,I've done as much as I possibly can to remedy the way I feel and now I'm forced to confront the fact that the only people who know me believe it too.
36976,It got bad enough she got medication.
36977,I can't tell if the perceived numbness and weakness in my left arm is purely a symptom of anxiety or my body wasting away from the toxic neurologic effects of that medicine.
36978,"At first, the medicine seemed to working fine and all, but now I am having serious mood swings."
36979,I would like to know if this is a normal side-effect of the medicine or if it is something I need to see my therapist about.
36980,"I recently restarted my anxiety medication, previously I was on 20mg celexa a few years back."
36981,So all throughout high school and college almost all of my friends didn't have a clue that I had anxiety/depression issues and that I was taking medication for it.
36982,My parents were the ones to take me in to the ER and basically that led to word getting out that I was on medication and that I had bad anxiety and depression.
36983,I am taking some medication (Lansoprazole daily and Buscopan when necessary) but they rarely make a difference.
36984,"This mindset along with me already having social anxiety and a workload from school has made me just shut down from thinking about making the speech altogether and now that I have told my mom, she believes i should go to the doctor today and get prescribed anti anxiety medication so i can work on my speech today and give it tommorow."
36985,"I am going to be seeing a therapist or someone of the like soon, but my question is, should I take the medication or not?"
36986,"I don't know what other questions to ask before deciding to take the medication and feel like a wretch right now for even considering medication to ""fix me"", so I would be very grateful if someone could help me out."
36987,"I recently have decided to try to sleep ""naturally"" aka without the use of meds."
36988,What are some of the ways that you have managed your sleep without the use of medication?
36989,We're trying to get her hooked up with a therapist and new medication.
36990,"On Monday morning I couldnt take it anymore and decided to either kill myself for good or check myself into the mental ward, or at the very least get some meds to try and hopefully break the cycle for good."
36991,"But we dont think its in your best interest to give you any medication right now as we dont want it to interfere with your exposure therapy, and we think admitting you would be worse for you right now."""
36992,"I have decided to take a break from Exposure Therapy and Group Therapy for a month or two, find a different GP, get my meds sorted with a different Psychiatrist, and never go to the Mental Health Services if needing urgent assistance again."
36993,Will I be taking mental meds until I die?
36994,"I'm taking medication  for anxiety, but it's not really helping much."
36995,"Scared seeing a psychologist wont help, and getting medicine will make me dependent on it or it wont help at all."
36996,"Hi everyone,

I'm seeing my psychiatrist on Monday and am going to request starting some anxiety medication."
36997,I'm asking what medication do you use and how do you feel now that you're on it?
36998,"It all begins with a tingle, a random pin prick of unknown origin."
36999,"Then it sparks, traveling through your veins, every blood vessel feeling like an explosion."
37000,Muscles lock and forget their purpose.
37001,The air in your lungs isn’t enough as your chest tightens.
37002,Your heart is beating almost as fast as the breaths you’re trying to take.
37003,Your stomach threatens to betray you as the dizziness hits.
37004,It’s as if you’re taking part in the Earth’s rotation even though your feet are on solid ground.
37005,Reason and logic have flown away.
37006,"You don’t want to be here, you don’t want to be anywhere."
37007,"Your eyes dart, a blurry attempt to find a way out."
37008,After a false eternity your adrenal surge subsides and you’re left shaking with barely caught breath.
37009,Welcome to my world.
37010,We’ve all experienced some degree of anxiety; maybe you’ve noticed a wasp flying a bit too aggressively towards you or forgetting where you parked your car in a crowded lot.
37011,But what happens when you’re hit with those feelings for absolutely no reason?
37012,"Well, you might have an anxiety disorder, that’s certainly the case with me; I have the paperwork to prove it."
37013,"I’m a seasoned worrier, my fight or flight response is primed and ready to go at a moment’s notice, often without my input."
37014,"My experience in anxiety started with daily nausea in middle school, it progressed and evolved into different quirky symptoms for the next few years; sweating in winter, a foot that never stops tapping and more nausea."
37015,"Then the panic attacks started, first in response to relatively normal things, a speech in front of class or a job interview."
37016,But when they hit you in a store you’ve been into a hundred times before or while you’re driving home you realize something is off.
37017,So the various trips to the doctor’s office began.
37018,"I’ve been put on alprazolam, escitalopram, diazepam, buspirone, citalopram and hydroxyzine at one time or another with varying degrees of success."
37019,"Some do nothing at all, others made me sleep for eighteen hours straight and some don’t play well with others."
37020,"My head was a chemistry experiment for years, but I finally found the right medicines that weren’t a volatile mixture and was experiencing a nice degree of normalcy."
37021,"What they don’t tell you is that we humans as a species are a particularly adaptive bunch, so when they stopped working and the panic attacks returned I shouldn’t have been surprised."
37022,So my miracle cure wasn’t found in the bottom of a pill bottle.
37023,"Trying to take deep breaths and just relax while it’s happening is futile and exhausting, believe me, I’ve tried."
37024,It took longer than I’d like to admit to actually sit down and analyze it.
37025,You don’t ever get rid of most chronic disease; you manage it and learn to continue living life.
37026,"I’ve been graced with generalized anxiety disorder, which means it’s not just triggered by social interactions or a specific phobia."
37027,"So I’m just left with a general sense of worry, but sometimes you have to learn to play the hand you’re dealt."
37028,It doesn’t have to be all bad though.
37029,"Being worried means I’m more alert to my surroundings, I’d make an excellent meerkat."
37030,"I have no choice but to get lost in smallest details, if there’s a typo in this I’m going to be embarrassed."
37031,I have a constant residual drip of adrenaline which helps in concentration; I can read a book in no time and can type seventy words a minute without trying.
37032,In the middle of a panic attack I just want to go home so my shopping gets done really quickly.
37033,And my obsessive behavior insures that I’m never behind on bills or other health problems.
37034,"I’m currently only on one medication and it’s only for DEFCON 1 level emergencies, but being positive and finding the strengths in my weakness has been the best medicine I’ve tried."
37035,"It hasn’t been easy and sometimes it’s a day by day thing, but my anxiety is part of me."
37036,"Sure, it can be Hell, but it’s my hell, might as well make it cozy."
37037,Thanks for reading everyone.
37038,"I (F24) use to have bad social anxiety, but I slowly grew out of it due to therapy and medication."
37039,I am no longer in therapy nor on medication and I haven't been since around late 2011/early 2012.
37040,Now he gave me Pristiq a week ago and if this doesnt help then psychiatrist time ok that the back story of the medication.
37041,"She is on meds although I am not sure exactly what but she is generally ok, however she does have moments of anxiety."
37042,my meds make me feel like I need to be doing something with my hands and feet when I'm sitting down.
37043,"A little more info (probably some red flags here)

* dad of 1yr old

* recently quit smoking for like the 3rd time (few weeks ago)

* starting to exercise but it's been on and off

* job is a bit stressful not not like a fucking air traffic controller or whatever

* happy marriage, happy home

* do not drink or use any recreational drugs

* I do not take any regular medication, and am not really comfortable doing so, even for the anxiety."
37044,When I first started taking paxil (about a year ago) it was really easy to remember to take it first thing when I got up every morning because I wasn't feeling well and I didn't start feeling better until I had a consistent stream of the medication in my system.
37045,This ends up with me having erratic inconsistency on when I take my meds.
37046,"I'm going to try and shift taking my meds to around 11pm and see how that helps, but I was wondering if anyone else had any pointers."
37047,"Hey there,

I've been struggling through a two month-long anxious/depressive episode and after getting back into the psychologist's office during that time, he thought that it might be a good idea for me to see someone about meds."
37048,I am looking forward to seeing what good (if any) this medication will do for me.
37049,"I guess I'm just so scared of continuing to feel uncomfortable and sick (my anxiety makes my stomach sick and generally makes me sleepy and shaky) that, knowing these symptoms may continue even with the meds for a bit is freaking me out."
37050,Is this the kind of thing I should be seeking out medication for?
37051,Was wondering if anybody had any success stories of getting in good shape while on anxiety meds?
37052,"I feel like if I felt good about my body, it'd be easier for me to get off medication and control my anxiety."
37053,"I've heard being on meds slows down your metabolism, but haven't found anything definitive."
37054,Since then he's been on medication and is still working on finding a therapist that will will work with his insurance.
37055,Hello everybody.
37056,I am 19 and have suffered from social anxiety and minor depression for years now.
37057,My anxiety manifests itself more-so physically than mentally.
37058,"To a large extent I can suppress what I'm feeling mentally and can go about my day, attend classes, etc."
37059,(I'm a uni student).
37060,"What I can't do, however, is stop the physical symptoms that come with the anxiety."
37061,"When I am out and interacting with people, I am almost always sweating through my armpits, and sometimes even through my palms, back, and chest."
37062,"I also get heart palpitations, a quivery voice, trembling arms and legs, when I am under high-stress situations (i.e., giving a speech, meeting with a professor, that sort of thing)."
37063,"The extent to which I suffer from these symptoms varies from day to day, depending on how much I go out/interact with people (especially people with whom I am not entirely comfortable, like acquaintances from class)."
37064,"I have consulted psychologists, psychiatrists, and general doctors in trying to fix the problems I am experiencing."
37065,All have suggested that I take SSRIs.
37066,"I took their advice and started Celexa/Citalopram 10mg, and remained on it for a number of weeks (around 5 or 6 I believe)."
37067,"The medication helped with combating mental anxiety/depression, but considerably worsened my physical anxiety."
37068,"Even though the medication lowered my social inhibitions and made me more comfortable around other people, my sweating worsened."
37069,I had originally sought out medication in an attempt to *curb* the sweating.
37070,It also doesn't seem worthwhile to be taking an anti-depressant when I am trying to combat my anxiety.
37071,"Also, after doing research, it seems that **all** SSRIs have the side effect of increased sweating."
37072,"So after weighing all of this in my mind, I have decided that SSRIs are not worth it."
37073,(This decision was compounded by the terrible withdrawals that I experienced while coming off of Celexa).
37074,"**TL;DR**: what medications, other than SSRIs, alleviate the physical symptoms of anxiety, namely sweating?"
37075,"Can anyone who has tried Buspar, beta blockers, benzos, or other SSRIs, please share their experiences?"
37076,How did these medications affect you?
37077,Were they effective in reducing physical symptoms of anxiety?
37078,This will be my first time on medication for my anxiety.
37079,I weaned myself off of medication and was able to fight the anxiety and fears myself and eventually be okay.
37080,"I'm laying in bed right now, miserable because I live with a family I hate, I'm in pain from a canker sore (I get so many from stress and tired of hearing my family ask why), and I'm waiting for my sleep meds to kick in because I'm afraid to sleep."
37081,"I'm failing college thanks to this shit, If I take meds I'm unmotivated, if I don't I smoke more cigs then a 50s dad."
37082,"I figured this would be a good time to begin the meds, as any effects from marijuana would be minimized."
37083,I just started therapy again and will hopefully be on some meds soon.
37084,What if the medicine and therapy don't work?
37085,"I have to wait until Friday to see my therapist and psychiatrist again, but I only see them once a week I feel like I need to see them sooner and be put on meds asap because of school, I already missed two classes."
37086,Even the medication I took was just masking my situation temporarily.
37087,"I don't notice negative side effects of taking this, but there is a stigma for taking this medicine because there absolutely is a potential for addiction/dependence/abuse."
37088,"I'm glad that I can get some benefit from the medication, but when I talk to doctors about it, I'm always afraid of talking to new doctors about my history of taking it long-term because I'm afraid of being labeled as a drug seeker."
37089,"They take weeks to make an effect, and I never know if it is the drug or the therapy that gives me a small boost, because usually when I'm changing meds, I'm also seeing a therapist more often."
37090,"I will say that I've had some very irresponsible insurance companies who have refused to allow me to taper my doses when I switch meds, and some irresponsible doctors who have switched me around so fast that there would have been no real way of knowing if the drugs were working because they hadn't had time to take effect."
37091,"I'm afraid to go off these meds because the withdrawal is so terrible, and I also believe that I genuinely should be taking them."
37092,"I get suspicious that free, grow your own medicine could be a big threat to business that wants you to depend on buying the drugs they make and profit from."
37093,"This is a bit of a rant, but I want to know your thoughts, and experiences with anxiety meds."
37094,"If you had any of these symptoms, what did you find to be the best medication?"
37095,After reading up on old posts on how people feel after finally getting medication for anxiety issues..
37096,"*edit* I am seeing a therapist regularly (just recently, my fourth session is coming up) I haven't talked to her about meds yet, this just popped into my head today


Thanks"
37097,My girlfriend is my rock.
37098,She's always been the person I tell everything and confide in the most.
37099,I have always had ADHD but it's never been much of a problem up until I got to college which is also where I developed severe anxiety leading into the depressed state I am in now.
37100,When it started to get at its worst I decided to tell her that I was depressed and that my anxiety was starting to run my life.
37101,I got her up to date on my treatments/medications which did nothing but seem to scare her.
37102,So now I have a dilemma.
37103,Anytime now I even give off the slightest image of feeling anxious or sad she jumps all over it and tries to comfort me but all it feels like is her smothering me.
37104,"I'm a person that enjoys his privacy, I for some reason enjoy just sitting alone somewhere pondering life and shit."
37105,It's really the only time when I'm not anxious and my thoughts are actually rational and calm.
37106,But when I say that to her she gets all kinds of upset about how I won't let her help me with my anxiety and thats all she wants to do is help.
37107,Why the fuck is is it so unacceptable to want to be alone for a few hours of the day.
37108,It is something I enjoy which these days is hard to come by.
37109,"It's just like my girlfriend used to be this person that I wanted to always talk to or be around, and she was someone that actually reduced my anxiety levels some, but now she is becoming a trigger and it's tearing me apart."
37110,I don't feel happy around her anymore all I feel is is embarrassment and shame because of my inability to function as a normal 21 year old and how anxiety has become a constant excuse for why shit goes wrong for me.
37111,"I hate that more than anything, always falling back on it."
37112,I swear I could kill someone and somehow my mind would find a way to convince itself that it's okay and probably just my anxiety.
37113,She just looks at me like I'm some weak little scared puppy who needs to be monitor 24/7.
37114,My relationship of almost four years now has completely turned upside down on me in less than a week.
37115,Literally out of fucking nowhere I can't even be in the same room as her for more than an hour without having a panic attack.
37116,I am losing my damn mind and the girl who only a week ago I claimed to be in love with.
37117,I just don't know about anything anymore.
37118,I should have never told her anything in the first place.
37119,Put another one on the board for anxiety I guess.
37120,"I have had GAD for my entire life, diagnosed when I was a teenager and have been on anti-anxiety medication for 8 years."
37121,"I am currently on Xanax which helps the majority of the time, but as most of you well know, an anxiety attack can come out of no where even while on the medication."
37122,"My job in retail requires I deal with people constantly but I feel like I need to see my doctor and get off medication, then go from there."
37123,"I'm still in school (last year) and I take medication (betablockers, they're not from my doctor though because I haven't seen one about it yet) just to function in the classroom."
37124,I go through serious depressive episodes every so often and I worry that taking a medication will trigger one.
37125,He gave me medication and it was better.
37126,"I still felt tired and derealisation (at least I think that's what it is)

So after two weeks I stopped taking the medication and the I felt worse again."
37127,My diagnosis was colitis and they gave me meds saying it would go away after I take them.
37128,I took the meds they gave me and I felt that the symptoms still persisted.
37129,I don't want to stay on meds because I know how bad they are and I don't want to be dependent on them.
37130,"And I'm going to cardiologist to prescribe me some meds for my hypertension, but I was wondering what if he'll prescribe me beta blockers and they calm down me only temporally ??"
37131,"Back to the point: I'm wondering if meds for hypertension:
a) help my body with preventing adrenaline rushes and controlling my blood pressure and I gain massive confidence and calmness OR
b) what if they help only temporally; it will be ok when I will be taking them, but if I'll be going to cancel them, my anxiety will go worse??"
37132,"I need your opinion should I take meds for hypertension or should I wait few months, get rid of those adrenaline rushes and then go to Doc??"
37133,My doctor prescribed me Xanax and I am a weird person I don't like taking medication unless absolutely needed.
37134,"I have tried not eating for a couple days, smoking weed, taking my grandmother's Ativan medication and tums directly before I go out - doesn't help."
37135,"Hello, I was recently diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder/Depression and it's been pretty rough."
37136,"I'm a pretty bad hypochondriac, so most of my panic attacks are related to health."
37137,My doctor started me on Lorazepram and Escitalopram.
37138,The second day after I began my medication I experienced a *horrid* heat flash.
37139,I thought I was having a stroke!
37140,"Didn't help my anxiety one bit, I can tell you that."
37141,"Anyway, I stopped for about a week, but my doctor insisted I try taking it again because it's helped so many people before (I can see by searching /r/anxiety that a lot of you swear by it)."
37142,"Now, for a while, I've also been taking lorazepram."
37143,"I know that's a very temporary measure, but it's been helping me relax for the past week when I refused to take the escitalopram."
37144,So I've actually been doing a lot better for myself.
37145,But just today I took *half* of the dosage I'm supposed to daily and almost went into a panic attack at the movie theater.
37146,"I managed to keep it together for the most part, but I was very unsettled throughout the whole experience."
37147,Even now I'm misspelling half of the words as I'm typing them; I feel very on edge.
37148,"Anyway, the whole point of this is not to seek your pity, but just to ask if anyone has had any experiences like this and what they did."
37149,I'm very new to being treated like this and I'm not sure of how to proceed.
37150,"Could things eventually get better if I keep taking the Escitalopram (I know these medications can take a while to kick in), or should I ditch it and ask the doctor to start me on something new?"
37151,"Thanks for reading this, hope it's coherent."
37152,The meds I'm on.
37153,"I'm on two different anxiety medication, my mom is with me, it's a very trusted airline but I'm still shaking and have an awful need to vomit all over the place."
37154,"So I can't get any medication until I have been to a therapist (on waiting list), so I decided to go down to my local pharmacist and ask for something natural for anxiety, she gave me rescue remedy spray and was wondering if anybody had any experience with anything like this and if it worked, something tells me I just wasted €8 but thought I would ask about it."
37155,I only get anxiety attacks at night right as I am about to go to bed.
37156,"I have tried to control it, I've seen my personal Psychiatrist many times about it, I have tried taking over the counter sleeping pills, nothing is working for me."
37157,I only have the attacks every 7-10 days or so.
37158,Do you guys know of any medications that I can take as soon as I feel I am having an attack come at night?
37159,One that will help me just fall asleep?
37160,"Once I am asleep, I will sleep until my alarm clock goes off."
37161,Any help would be greatly appreciated.
37162,I’m on medication off and on and I struggle to find a good therapist.
37163,"Hey all,

So I'm on some medications as of around 5 to 6 months."
37164,"I am on Prozac 45mg for about the 5 to 6 months, Strattera about a month and a half now (18mg) and Propranolol (10mg 2x a day, but I'll skil.if I am drinking)."
37165,I also have Xanax prescribed for as needed (.25mg - the smallest prescription dose).
37166,I used to be a pretty heavy drinker.
37167,"Not a frequent one, but I'd indulge heavily on the weekends at parties and bars and such."
37168,Then I got sick with anxiety and my world came crumbling down.
37169,"For awhile I had chest pains and stomach issues and such, and no one knew why."
37170,Then we figured out it was anxiety.
37171,It got to a point earlier this year that I couldn't go anywhere but work and home and my fiancé's house without having an attack.
37172,Slowly but surely I worked my way back into the social atmosphere.
37173,So far I've had friends over and I've been out to a few houses for gatherings.
37174,I've made great strides and I know that the medication won't fully walk me through everything... so I push myself.
37175,"Anyway,  when I have gone out, I'll usually take a half of a .25mg Xanax a few hours prior,  eat and drink water."
37176,This makes it so I can get into a foreign social setting and I am not breaking into a pile of panic.
37177,I'll feel a bit anxious but I can contain it.
37178,Then I'll have some beers and it'll get much better over time.
37179,Has anyone else done this?
37180,I feel fine usually at that point in time.
37181,I did indulge heavily a couple of times.
37182,The only thing is that I get a terrible hangover.
37183,It's more like death.
37184,I take a Xanax and sleep a bit longer and I am ok.
37185,I think I talked about something along these lines on here already... but I forget.
37186,"Anyway, the reason I bring this up now is because tonight I am going to a birthday party and there will be a lot of people that I haven't seen in years....like since high school."
37187,It's a big deal to me.
37188,I want to look confident and leave a good impression.
37189,Has anyone ever dealt with this as well?
37190,"Like I said, I've done I before, but I feel terrible the next day if I overdo it."
37191,"It's been about two years since I have met with a therapist, and I have been off medication (prozac) for about six months now."
37192,"Since I made the stupid decision of quitting my meds without consulting my doctor, well, I feel great."
37193,"I've had anxiety for a while now, and panic since last December, and it's been getting better with medication and therapy."
37194,My cousin has told me to wean off my meds before.
37195,I also felt I was mentally ready to commit to the challenge of being medication-free.
37196,PS: I don't use any medication.
37197,"Granted, I went off my meds without the supervision of a doctor and paid hell for it, but is it EVER easy?"
37198,"Early next month, I'm due to see a psychiatrist for social phobia."
37199,"Finally, I'll (hopefully lol) be getting some diagnoses and medication."
37200,"My GP says that since I'm under 18, they'll only give me Zoloft (sertraline)."
37201,I'm not sure if this is different in countries other than Australia?
37202,From prior research I've learnt that sertraline is a pretty much catch-all SSRI that is approved for quite a variety of mental disorders.
37203,"It's one of the two (in Australia at least) that is approved for social anxiety disorder, along with paroxetine."
37204,The side effects and efficacy rates are similar across the board for SSRIs.
37205,What can I expect from this medication?
37206,I want to hear it from people who have experience with being treated with these medications.
37207,Did they reduce your problems from anxiety/depression and how pronounced were these effects?
37208,"What side effects did you experience and how problematic were these side effects, if they were problematic at all?"
37209,"I haven't been in a situation yet that would normally make me extremely anxious, so I can't say whether or not the medicine works, but I have noticed a side effect."
37210,"Is it worth it to try and get on different medication (Going on day 4, I'm thinking it might be)?"
37211,"I decided last night I wanted to stop taking my antidepressant medication, a generic for Lexapro, escitalopram oxalate 10mg (taken once daily)."
37212,It's a long story but while on the medication I left Christianity.
37213,"I'm scared the medication is hurting my sex life with my SO, though I have no previous sex life to compare it too."
37214,So I can't say the medicine caused my lack of emotion at times.
37215,"I think I need meds and counseling because this is also affecting my job search and just about every other area of my life, but short term - how do I send that stupid e-mail?"
37216,I am so happy and relieved right now as I was totally worried about switching meds.
37217,Is there anything I can do aside from seeking professional help or taking medication?
37218,"So, (I see a therapist and do not take medication) I'm hoping that I can make a change in my life that will alleviate this anxiety."
37219,Other second I'm convinced I need these meds.
37220,"I'm afraid I'm gonna avoid it all if I don't do meds, but the prospect of needing meds to do it makes me uncomfortable."
37221,The only medicine that actually makes any noticeable effect on my anxiety is illegal and frowned upon all over.
37222,I have been working hard to get out of my little hole.
37223,"I started to dress more feminine, I am on a diet, I take my medications, and I try to stay active."
37224,I figured since I have had a pretty good reddit experience so far to see how I was doing with my looks.
37225,I set myself up for disappointment.
37226,"Posted on r/amiugly and even though I reply with a smile and as kind as I can be, I feel like crap."
37227,I feel like I did all the hard work for losing 15 pounds for nothing.
37228,Yet some people say im pretty I find it hard to believe that now.
37229,:/ I feel shaky and nervous and I am back in my hole...
37230,This is the picture I posted as an update: http://imgur.com/PRuXW
37231,I was on a medication once but it made me feel weird and i havent tried another.
37232,About a month ago I noticed I started to lose my appetite but figured it was from coming off some medication called [Ranitidine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranitidine) for stomach pains.
37233,I figured I'd stop the medication and a few weeks later I'd be better.
37234,I am Male &amp; 18.
37235,"I have been on over 40 different medications for psychiatric purposes since I was 14, mostly for anxiety-related disorders (GAD, OCD, Panic Attacks, &amp; Anorexia Nervosa), and also other diagnoses (MDD &amp; BPD)."

37238,"I went to the hospital and didn't really receive any other information other than a severe reaction to the medicine,but now almost 3 weeks later, I experience some facial twitching and signs of those same tremors from before even though I had immediately discontinued the medicine after one pill."
37239,Going back on the meds probably by the end of the week.
37240,I've gone to a doctor for ADHD for about a year now (I was diagnosed decades ago.)
37241,"In my first appointment, I told her about the depression that I had experienced a few years prior."
37242,She chalked up the fact that I went from depressed to normal (thanks to a good new job) as a symptom of bi-polar disorder.
37243,I mention this because it was a ludicrous suggestion and I haven't trusted her analysis much since.
37244,"Today I told her about the growing anxiety I've been experiencing in small ways my entire life, but in very big ways over the past few months."
37245,She seemed to conflate depression and anxiety and recommended putting me on an SSRI.
37246,I have known depression and I know anxiety.
37247,"Most importantly, I know the difference."
37248,I don't want to be treated for depression when my problem is anxiety.
37249,"In fact, I'm quite reluctant to take any kind of SSRI."
37250,"I've seen others take them and ""zombify"" to a degree."
37251,"I don't trust my doctor's diagnoses, so I'm reaching out for more information."
37252,"Obviously no one can offer medical advice on a forum, but I would like to hear from you about your experiences with various medications and whether they worked."
37253,Thank you!
37254,**TL;DR: I want to treat my anxiety but don't trust my doctor.
37255,Looking to learn from others' experiences with various medications.
37256,**
37257,He currently takes meds for it but has slowly been weaning himself off and tells me it's causing fluctuations in his moods.
37258,I was put on some meds and have started a bit of therapy but have yet to get far.
37259,"I've also tried medication on and off, but it felt very *artificial*."
37260,"I'm a 21 year old female with social anxiety, depression, and GAD."
37261,"I've been on medications for 5 years now, starting with citalopram for 3 years, Lexapro for 1.5, and hopping between Prozac, Mirtazapine, and now celexa again in the past year."
37262,"I'm starting to feel like I don't want to be on medication anymore- I have IBS, and I feel like the medications, particularly celexa, are making my digestive issues worse."
37263,I'm getting sick of the side effects and am also feeling that the meds aren't really doing much to help me.
37264,"I'm scared, though, to go medication-free."
37265,I feel like most people in the anxiety communities I've seen are using medication as their main help (I could be wrong!!
37266,"), and that makes me scared that I can't get better without it."
37267,"I'm wanting to try seeing a weekly therapist and going off my celexa, but I'm hesitant to do so because I'm not confident that therapy alone can heal me."
37268,"I'm scared that I'll go off my medication and realize I was better off on it, and then have to go through the whole hell that is medication startup side effects again."
37269,"I was prescribed Celexa and will start taking it tomorrow at a low dose (10 mg.) I've been reading reviews of the medication online and am starting to get scared... a lot of people say that the first couple of weeks are really rough, with a lot of additional anxiety, dizziness, loss of appetite, etc."
37270,"I used to have a serious addiction problem before I started the meds:

Eating: I'd get hungry at odd times of the day and night and start pacing around while devouring snack foods."
37271,I'm very pleased that my meds have evened me out enough that I now tell myself in the moment that it is time to stop at the right time.
37272,"hello all,
I posted here a couple times when i first started my meds back in jan/feb."
37273,"this medication has helped me greatly, but I'm concerned with the growing weight."
37274,It never occurred to me that anxiety to the point of throwing up so violently that I lacerate my throat would be an indication of needing medication for emergency situations.
37275,"I feel like the future could be bright, even if that means medication and clinging to my laptop."
37276,"As the title suggests, I recovered from Generalized anxiety (GAD) and Social anxiety (SAD) about 6 or 7 years ago (I am 31 now) without the help of medications."
37277,I wanted to make a post that will hopefully help a few people through their conditions.
37278,"I will try to be brief and get to the point, so i'll provide a short backstory and then get to what cured me."
37279,"Backstory: I started getting panic attacks at around 18, which lead to quite crippling GAD and then SAD."
37280,At my worst I was unable to leave the house for more than short periods of time.
37281,"I had dozens of panic attacks daily, could barely interact with anyone but family, and was underemployed for many years."
37282,"I tried dozens of medications for the first couple years, but nothing really treated me effectively, and many made things worse."
37283,I suffered immensely until I was 24.
37284,"I started seeing a therapist, who insisted that I had some deep seated trauma in my childhood causing my anxiety."
37285,"Like probably most of you, there was nothing apparent causing my anxiety."
37286,It just happens to some people with no specific cause.
37287,"My therapist kept digging for something, and I kept wasting money and saw no progress."
37288,Therapy was a bust and I was completely hopeless.
37289,What changed my life was a book: Feeling Good by David Burns.
37290,It introduced me to the concept of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
37291,I quickly realized that knowledge is power.
37292,"I read about a dozen books about CBT, learned everything I could about anxiety and depression (namely, that negative thoughts are the root of the issue) and worked persistently through it all."
37293,I spent about a year doing daily CBT exercises that I found in various books and on the internet.
37294,I LIVED this stuff.
37295,"Every time I had a negative thought, I plucked it out and rationalized it."
37296,Told myself over and over that these thoughts were wrong and that I need to break the bullshit habit of irrational thought.
37297,"After maybe 6 months of CBT, I felt significant improvement."
37298,"After a solid year, I was probably 75% cured."
37299,"6 years later, today, I can honestly say it's 95% gone."
37300,"I've had maybe two panic attacks since, and I was able to talk myself through them so easily, they didn't last more than 2 minutes."
37301,"I'm now confident, successful, employed in a fantastic job and live independently."
37302,"I didn't turn into the life of the party; I still need to work at social interaction, but I barely flinch at things that used to send me into a panic attack just thinking about."
37303,I'm happy to answer any questions or provide details for anyone that needs it.
37304,I'm not suggesting that CBT will work for everyone and that medications are useless (they are extremely beneficial in certain situations) but I want to share my story in hopes that some people will benefit.
37305,"I'm on Zoloft for both, and when I drink it intensifies the effects of my medication."
37306,I've been dealing with major depression/anxiety for past 5 years and have been on medication for it (Celexa 20mg).
37307,"Two weeks ago, I forgot to take my meds in the morning, and I noticed a dramatic increase in mood, confidence, and sports performance."
37308,"Over the summer, I started seeing a doctor regularly again and decided a few things: 1) to go on the pill to get rid of hormonal migraines; 2) to go on antidepressants to help the anxiety; 3) to go on sleep medication so I could sleep like a normal human being."
37309,I kept up the SSRI and sleep meds.
37310,Fast forward through some medication changes and therapy and things get better.
37311,"He thinks I need to go off all of my medication -- currently Effexor, Trazodone, and Camila -- because it exacerbates all of my problems."
37312,Boyfriend thinks it's because of all the medication.
37313,It's a lot of fun and I'm getting a little upset that sometimes needing a medication during work will keep me from having fun at night.
37314,All this came shortly after reaching out to my family for help and starting medication.
37315,They stopped her from checking and asked her to go to a dr. for meds (escitalopram).
37316,"She has been fine until now where they talked to her, found out she wasn't taking her meds, and now they are forcing her to go back up to check."
37317,But I do not want to be reliant on this medication.
37318,I've had general anxiety and depression for a few years now.
37319,"I started seeing a doctor, eventually started meds and gradually leveled out."
37320,"Then I felt pretty much back to normal but after a while, I started to feel like a zombie."
37321,"Like most people, I don't like the idea of taking medications on a daily basis."
37322,"The doctor I was going to is fantastic but he's more of an administrative head of department, and he was only seeing me because my father knows him."
37323,I always felt guilty about this and so it's been over a year since I've seen him.
37324,"Now, I realize I was dumb to decide to ween myself off medication on my own, but what's done is done at this point."
37325,"I started to feel like I was doing so well that I didn't need it and for over a month, I felt great and I felt even better that I felt great without taking medication."
37326,But then my anxiety hit me and most likely withdrawal.
37327,"For the past 2-3 weeks, I've resorted back to xanax as needed but I really think stopping Lexapro was a mistake."
37328,I tried taking it again and have felt horrible.
37329,"I realize I need to make an appointment asap (and get a referral to a recommended, more accessible doctor), but was just curious if anyone else has experienced something similar and am curious about anyone who has successfully weened off of medications."
37330,TL;DR: Has anyone else decided on their own to limit/stop their medication?
37331,What happened?
37332,"I was on anxiety medication for awhile, but stopped about a year ago."
37333,I'm not meds but they don't work.
37334,I have been dealing with a severe anxiety disorder for 8 years and have tried many different kind of meds.
37335,"I want to know what to look for when I'm on the medication in terms of side effects and the positive, desired effects."
37336,"I recently got on meds and it's helping a lot with my anxiety, mood, psychosis, and the physical pain I was having from anxiety."
37337,Compared to not being on meds I feel amazingly good.
37338,My meds (esp antidepressant) seem to be helping my mood and anxiety.
37339,"I've suffered with anxiety for 15+ years, and tried a few medications, paxil which I didn't like and celexa, which was also just OK.."
37340,I am curious what works for you.
37341,Herbal supplements and other ideas welcome
37342,Does anybody have an experience with this medication?
37343,I've not taken medication for it but have tried CBT and deep breathing exercises that have helped immensely.
37344,"I used to take a SSRI-medicine called Sertalin, I took it around 2007-2009 but I got some very nasty side effects so I had to quit it."
37345,thanks to this medication.
37346,So my question; is there any medication that is **not** a SSRI that could help against anxiety (WITHOUT making me a careless zombie)?
37347,Does anyone take a daily medication that works in settling their anxiety?
37348,"I'm considering seeing a psychiatrist to talk about meds instead of my GP, but I'm a little worried about how it will go/what to expect/what my parents will think about it/costs/etc."
37349,"Particularly, I'm hoping that my psychiatrist can prescribe me a medication to take ""only when I need it"", because my anxiety comes and goes in waves and when it hits, it hits really hard and usually leaves me extremely depressed for a few days."
37350,Is an immediate relief medication appropriate for my situation?
37351,"For example recently I've suffered oral thrush (which I did go to the doctor for once, got some medication, and the hospital twice after the fact, because it wasn't working and was told to go home and that it was healing), mouth ulcers, and now what looks like and sure feels like Perioral dermatitis."
37352,She's on her second day on meds right now but don't think she can hack more than a week of these side effects.
37353,EDIT: Thanks for all your comments - my GF went to see her doctor today and the severity of her side effects was unusual so she's been prescribed some different meds now.
37354,"Hi Reddit,
So I have been diagnosed with PTSD about a year ago and am on medication."
37355,"Also, not sure if this is too much to ask of you guys also but my family is having a hard time with my diagnosis, they keep asking when I'm going to be off meds and are pushing me to see my doctor to get off them."
37356,"So I guess I have a question for myself: in terms of meds, how long is too long?"
37357,"I have anxiety about being taken off my meds, I also have depression although not as severe as the anxiety, and can't picture not taking them."
37358,"It's weird that my benzo's will take away the physical pains while they're in effect, but not any type of pain meds."
37359,"I realize the difference as far as Psychiatrist being MD's and focusing on medicine, etc."
37360,I've read to start with a Psychiatrist to get diagnosed and be prescribed medicine if needed and then follow up with a Psychologist for longer term therapy.
37361,"I want to get on medication, but I'm worried it's something far worse than Anxiety."
37362,"I've considered asking about medication or something, but I just don't know."
37363,That was successful in terms of my body adapting to the medication.
37364,Both my brother and I have anxiety.
37365,We are at different levels.
37366,"I have self learned to manage mine very well and can socialize without problems, take criticisms and haven't had a panic attack for at least 8 or 10 years without reason."
37367,(Family death.)
37368,However my brother's anxiety is something different.
37369,"His hands are always shaking, constantly."
37370,I've never seen him hold his hands still without trembling.
37371,"He gets angry, often, which seems like any time you talk about him or tell him he's doing something wrong he flies off into a rage usually slinging insults and yelling."
37372,He doesn't take any medications other than smoking weed because he does not have a job.
37373,"He cannot get on accss because he does not have a mental disease, no children, not in school, not under the age of 18 and not over the age of 65."
37374,"I know once he has a job he can get the treatment needed to take care of this but while he staying with my mother and I, things are extremely out of control."
37375,He's had two panic attacks last year and was taken to a hospital.
37376,He was prescribed medication but now cannot get it.
37377,He gets angry at any little thing.
37378,"I tell him, ""You need to make sure when you put the dog outside he has water first."""
37379,"And he'll yell, ""I know what the fuck to do, don't tell me shit."""
37380,Usually followed by a string of insults as he's walking to his room.
37381,Has anyone had any experience with this level of anxiety getting to this sort of level?
37382,Since we both have disorders we are completely different and I have no clue how to help him until he can get a job to get on some proper medication or see a therapist.
37383,Advice?
37384,First post here... if this is wrong let me know and I'll delete it...
37385,"I am a 29 female with gad, bpd, ptsd, ibs, and migraines among other things that the doctor suspects but doesn't want to diagnose me with."
37386,I am currently on disability and have been for 2 years.
37387,Which was a horrible mistake on my part.
37388,Doctors kept pressuring me to apply but I refused.
37389,Once I finally did I see now that not having to push myself to work has made my anxiety increase big time.
37390,That's besides the point..
37391,The point is I can't swallow pills because I have an extreme anxiety of choking.
37392,It's so bad I sometime won't even eat because I'm so scared (I currently weigh 93lbs).
37393,My doctor has been trying to work with me by calling in disintegrating pills.. and even a nose spray for my migraines.
37394,My insurance however won't accept any of it.
37395,Even having my doctors office call them does nothing.
37396,"At this point I'm crushing, cutting, and opening all my medications."
37397,Not good since some say not to do that but I have no choice...
37398,I don't know what else to do.
37399,To make things worse 3 weeks ago I had a severe allergic reaction to something.
37400,My face was so swollen I couldn't open my eyes and words were slurred because my lips were so swollen.
37401,It took more than a week for the swelling to go down.
37402,I refused to go to the doctor because I was so scared.
37403,I had an appointment with my normal doctor 2 Monday's ago and told her what happened.
37404,She said she was worried because my reaction was so severe that my next exposure could cause anaphylaxis (?).
37405,She gave me a prescription for an allergy pill (chewable) and an epipen.
37406,She was great and gave me a prescription for an epipen that kept the needle hidden and talks you through the process.
37407,She even taught me in office how to use it.
37408,Now let's bring in my awful insurance.. they refused to give me chewable pills.
37409,So I agreed to have them swap it with a pill the same size as my birth control.
37410,Here I am still with no medication because the pharmacy said insurance is refusing to pay for the new pills until November because they just paid for the old pills that they denied.
37411,I'm so confused.
37412,The pharmacy gave me the epipen and I left in tears.
37413,Now I got home and looked at the epipen it also I'd not what my doctor prescribed and taught me on.
37414,"There is no way I would ever be comfortable enough to use this.. no matter what the emergency.. 

And plus because there are only two allergy clinics that accept my insurance and those places serve people with better insurance first (what the nurse told me) I can't be seen until next July."
37415,I don't know what to do..
37416,I am so overwhelmed and panicked and honestly resigned to the fact that if I have another reaction I will die because there is no way I could inject myself with this thing (the one she prescribed was automatic and the one I got I have to do manually).
37417,Thanks for reading.. and I'm sorry for the long rant I'm just so frustrated and tired of being sick and scared...
37418,I just want a break.. even just 20 seconds of not being scared all time.
37419,Sigh..
37420,"I'm curious to see how long anxiety lasts for people when it is ""on""."
37421,I don't mean anxiety as a whole because I know that is a life long battle for people in most cases.
37422,I also don't mean in the form of a severe panic attack.
37423,In order to best flush out  the point of my question I will describe my situation and hopefully that helps.
37424,"I have battled depression for around 8 years, doing much better without medicine the last 2 and not having any true bouts of anxiety any of that time."
37425,"Then, with the onset of some serious sinus infections in January, I had my first full blown panic attack."
37426,"The anxiety continued on from there, I was diagnosed with GAD and tried three different daily medicines before my doctor concluded that my body does not work with having its serotonin levels messed with and he has gone back to the drawing board with trying to figure out a daily pill I can take and leaving me with Xanax for spot treating severe attacks."
37427,Over this whole time I have continued to feel like my body was fighting anxiety even when my mind or spirit didn't feel it that day.
37428,"It feels like I'm always tense, always tired, never relaxed."
37429,The physical symptoms have kept shifting to now having joint and muscle pain and muscle twitches on a daily basis - to which I can only assume is from constantly being in a physical state of tenseness.
37430,When it gets worse I notice it more and the original symptoms get worse or others symptoms like numb mouth appear.
37431,My question is how 'normal' is this?
37432,Is dealing with anxiety at a heightened level for a continuous 5 month period something others have dealt with?
37433,Or is more traditional to have anxiety which spikes to unhealthy levels and then subsides in a few days or weeks?
37434,Any advice or comments would be greatly appreciated.
37435,Hope this post finds everyone doing well and making progress in their own daily battles!
37436,So I finally decided to at least try medication.
37437,Do you use meds?
37438,I missed my medication because of this.
37439,I happen to not be taking any medication currently do to the loss of my insurance.
37440,"My own mother had to sneakily do it years ago (she's been taking medication since then, and she hasn't told him about either), and she could possibly help me get an appointment, but I don't know yet."
37441,"Well I decided to go off the meds and let me say this first, THIS IS NOT A HORROR STORY, this is a story of a confused lost kid who went through withdrawals and then started self medicating and is now at a point where I need help and support."
37442,So here goes the story I went to see a psychiatrist to get off the meds.
37443,"Having this time off has made me realize that I DO NOT want to go back on meds, they are scaring me, the only thing I can tolerate well is xanax for panic attacks."
37444,"I need help and I'm sorry if this is TLDR, but to summarize: Went through a ton of bad shit, started feeling enhanced depression/anxiety with pain, broke down, took time off, scared to death of meds anymore."
37445,My anxiety has gotten pretty bad - to the point where I'm contemplating going on medication to help.
37446,"The thing is I'm already on medication for bi-polar AND ADHD/ADD so don't really want another medication, esp."
37447,What types of anti-anxiety meds have you tried/taken and what have the results been?
37448,What of they take my meds off me?
37449,"When I had anxiety symptoms before meds I would think ""aw my man my anxiety is getting bad, but i know im okay"", but sometimes I did worry that I was dying or about to have a heart attack."
37450,"But when I feel my symptoms now that I take meds I think, ""my meds are making my anxiety worse"", ""what if Im allergic to my meds and they make me die?"""
37451,Basically my point is that meds only give me more things to worry about.
37452,Therapy is a fucking God send and some meds should help you tackle the physical symptoms so you don't sweat like a peadophile in a nursey every time the pressures on.
37453,"My family doctor presented me with my options, but I've always felt like I had excellent coping mechanisms and never thought medication was the right path for me."
37454,"**Side story (optional):**
During high school &amp; college I was pretty depressed due to family issues &amp; others."
37455,"I went to a therapist back then who prescribed me Lexapro but I stopped it because of the side effects and never went back to therapy until now, 6 years later."
37456,"----

This psychiatrist has prescribed me:

1."
37457,"Inderal/Propranolol 10mg
2."
37458,"Xanax/Alprazolam .5mg
3."
37459,"Viibryd 20mg (doing the two week 10mg-20mg sample pack now)
4."
37460,She is also planning on putting me on an adhd medication like vyvanse after a few weeks if the other medicines work out ok.
37461,I feel like this is a lot of medication to be taking?
37462,"On one hand I definitely remember the days where I for example looking for a new job just sit there and cry to myself, and then other days I feel fine and wonder why the hell am I going to be taking these pills?"
37463,"I'm also really worried about the side effects of these medications, and if there are any long term/permanent side effects."
37464,"I know when I was taking Lexapro I didn't feel as depressed, but I didn't feel much of anything else either and I still have a lot of memory loss of my Junior year of college which depresses me more :(."
37465,*Basically I don't want to sound like an asshole but I'm a huge TYPE A personality.
37466,I just want to be a slightly above average person in life and the fact that I have all these problems/take medication disappoints me.
37467,Am I overreacting here?
37468,Thanks a lot everyone!
37469,*
37470,"I go to counseling weekly, and take meds for the anxiety, and it feels like the only thing that is helping is Lorazepam."
37471,"I needed to get my feelings out, i hope other people out there can relate."
37472,I'm a fifteen year old girl in my sophomore year of high school.
37473,I am introverted to the moon and back so i appreciate alone time greatly but am alone too much that it is starting not to work in my advantage.
37474,I have been feeling very very anxious socially and generally (more lately than usual).
37475,I feel like i cannot physically get close to anyone anymore.
37476,"This was no problem for me as a child but ever since i've grown up and become more aware of my anxiety and got insecure and started caring what people think, it hasn't been easy for me to make close friends or make strong connections."
37477,There seems to be a barrier of how far someone can get to know me before i completely push them away or isolate myself from them because i get so anxious talking about myself that i avoid it.
37478,I never talk about my family because i'm scared that will lead to me having to talk about the death of a loved one.
37479,"That feeling of someone showing sorrow or pitying me is completely terrifying, but also terrifying for me to talk about because i wouldn't know what to say as i don't talk about it often."
37480,"Believe me, i want strong relationships and to be able to be myself around people and at least have friends to go out with and do normal teenage activities with but i CANT."
37481,"I say this but when i am actually out of my house i avoid talking to strangers at all costs and get scared when someone approaches me or tries to start conversation first, because i will have little to say...and even if i feel like i have a lot to say, it won't come out or i'll hold it back because i'm too nervous to say it."
37482,My anxiety prevents me from doing so many things i want to be able to do and it is leading me to become depressed.
37483,I feel there is no hope because i'm too scared to open up to anyone....even telling my mom how i'm feeling regarding my anxiousness and depression scares the hell out of me so i avoid it over and over.
37484,"These feelings of being controlled by anxiety and being trapped inside my mind (overthinking everything to the point of paranoia) are getting extremely tiring and hard to deal with, I really want to live normal and stop only being myself when i'm alone."
37485,Also do anti anxiety medications make you feel less anxious/are they worth it?
37486,I'm sorry if this is hard to understand.
37487,I don't know if this sounded better in my mind or what.
37488,"Although i would not wish these horrible/crippling feelings upon anyone ever, i'm hoping somebody out there has gone through what i'm going through and will give me hope to get better and live how I truly want."
37489,"Even if at first I was reticent, I now consider getting a medication to help me out a bit, probably Zoloft."
37490,What are your experiences with medication?
37491,How do you feel under this medication?
37492,"Working on the whole Obamacare thing...I think I need medication, because it's consuming every second of my day."
37493,"Hey guys, considering meds."
37494,I'm curious how you were before vs after meds.
37495,"Just some context, I've unknowingly had social anxiety for probably 10 years now, and only recently did I realize that I'm not just super shy and introverted and that it's actually starting to affect my life."
37496,My problem right now is mostly just the thought of any social interaction that is new gets me nervous and I just avoid the interaction.
37497,"Meeting new people in person, job interviews, etc."
37498,"It's really bad, and up until recently it wasn't that big of a deal cause I didn't have too many responsibilities."
37499,"Now that I'm nearly done with college (done in January), everything is coming at me at once."
37500,I've identified one of the causes of my social anxiety is my parents.
37501,"Don't get me wrong, they're amazing and I love them to death but I'm just too dependent on them, and I have been all my life."
37502,I don't have the social experiences that I should have at 20 years old because I've been cruising along with their help.
37503,"I've met some really good friends online who live nearby, and they offered for me to move in with them when I'm done with school."
37504,"Problem is I haven't met them in person and anxiety kicks in every time I want to, I also don't have a job right now and I'll be needing to save up some money before I move."
37505,This is an enormous challenge for me but it will force me to become less dependent on my parents and I'll have some really good friends to help me should I need it.
37506,I've got 7 months before I start preparing to move.
37507,"I'd like to think I have a pretty good head on my shoulders, I understand my problems and from experience I know that I'll be fine after meeting my friends a couple times, or going to a couple job interviews."
37508,It's all I need.
37509,I wanted to ask about medications.
37510,"My main question is, in what ways, if any, could an antidepressant like Paxil or Zoloft help."
37511,Could it get rid of some of the inhibitions I have so I can get some much needed social exposure?
37512,In what ways could my mindset change after starting on these (or similar) medications.
37513,If anyone has used these medications I would appreciate hearing your experiences.
37514,"I've looked into CBT and I would much rather just go about my day with a kick in the butt from some meds than have to go to a therapist on a regular basis while I'm busy with work, school and planning for the future."
37515,I can always go back for CBT for a more permanent solution down the road if I can't get a hang of it on my own.
37516,Thanks in advance for any information!
37517,:)
37518,"If you are switching between meds, please make sure your Dr checks for interactions between the medications, and make yourself aware of the potential for serotonin syndrome."
37519,"It is not very well recognised in the general medical field, but it is becoming more common with the release of new anxiety meds coming into the market."
37520,"Check for interactions yourself online, look for the half life of your medications to be sure they will be cleared out of your system before starting a new medicine."
37521,"I am writing this from my bed, recovering from serotonin poisoning."
37522,"I was switching between mirtazapine and buspirone, to venlafaxine (buspirone did nothing for my anxiety, and mirtazapine was causing weight gain)."
37523,"We thought the buspirone would be clear as it has a short half life, but it is fat soluble and can remain in your body for up to five days."
37524,"A few hours after my first dose of venlafaxine, I became very sick."
37525,I was unable to move or speak.
37526,I had muscle tremors.
37527,I had a very high fever and heart rate.
37528,I hallucinated.
37529,I was very confused and mentally unstable.
37530,"If I had been able to call out, or move, I would have called my husband to get an ambulance."
37531,I honestly thought I was dying and there was nothing I could do about it.
37532,"After about six hours, I was able to start to move and speak a little and then was able to call for medical advice."
37533,I have had to stop all meds until Monday to allow my body to recover and rest.
37534,I am going back to the mirtazapine and I will work with my Dr on a suitable regime for weight control.
37535,"So, yeah, if you are changing meds, make sure you have all the information."
37536,Double check.
37537,"And if possible, have someone watch you for the first dose for a few hours."
37538,X
37539,"So, like the title says, I forgot to take my meds today."
37540,"(For those who are wondering why I didn't just take my meds later than usual, I didn't realize that I hadn't taken them until after I ate lunch, and I've found that taking my meds after I eat lunch tends to make me throw up, and I just didn't want to have to deal with that today.)"
37541,"I'm trying to make it through today as best I can (which I know I'm capable of, since I've forgotten to take my meds before), but it's tough."
37542,It's almost enough to make a person try to buy meds in Mexico...your thoughts are appreciated.
37543,"I know they say not to trust the internet blah blah and everyone's different, but reading all the negativity about medication is making me nervous."
37544,I finally picked up my Rx and now i'm debating starting the medication until next week because this weekend I have a lot of things planned with friends.
37545,"I'm looking for homeopathic ways of relieving anxiety, since I really want off my medication."
37546,"Then there is the select few, when CBT and medication doesn't seem to have an effect and you're constantly told that it's all in your head and it has to come from you to block the thoughts that consume your life."
37547,"I also feel afraid that there's no medication out there that can make me not depressed, but that's beside the point."
37548,I have had major issues with my sex drive since going on medication.
37549,"She's known me for a majority of my life, so I trust her opinion, but one of the things I'm most afraid of is medication and drugs."
37550,"The only medicine I take is benadryl for my allergies, and ibuprofen if I get a migraine."
37551,"I tried reading other threads, but I'm so unfamiliar with *any* medication, I just got overwhelmed."
37552,Or is there another anti-anxiety medication that goes better with alcohol?
37553,"My anxiety revolves around a phobia of vomit, so I have a constant fear that any medication I take is going to make me feel/be ill."
37554,I feel like I'm crazy but I could really use someone just to tell me that it's ok and that I'll be better in the end when I take these meds.
37555,I forgot to take my meds for a few days (citalopram 20mg) and noticed I was feeling fine.
37556,"I don't know what to do, I don't want to go back to my meds but I'm feeling like crap, I am anxious and angry and sad And I feel like crying (didn't cry recently, though)."
37557,"(sorta unrelated: when I stopped taking my meds I noticed I was sleeping less... 8 hours or less, while before I could easily stay I bed for over 10, 12 hours and still get out of bed feeling very sleepy."
37558,Is this because of the meds?)
37559,"UPDATE: I know, I know I should have gone to a doc first, but I forgot the meds and thought there was no problem..."
37560,"Because he already prescribed my meds reduction once, and things didn't go much differently."
37561,"Frankly, my last attack when I wasn't taking medication was MUCH, MUCH worse than the one I am currently having."
37562,"And last time, I did go to the doctor before stopping my meds."
37563,"I am tired of taking meds and wondering ""is this problem right now... is it me, or is it a side effect of the meds?"
37564,"I always had anxiety issues and by that age it got so bad I would look down from high places and think ""hmmm, what if I jumped from here..."", so, yeah, I went to a doctor and started medication."
37565,"So I have been takings meds,on and off, for over 10 years."
37566,"And have even skipped out on meds thinking I'm better off (awful I know)

Since being medicated I've found an awesome gf (I'm also a girl FYI) who supports me fully."
37567,"I just dont talk to her about my mental health, my meds or my therapist appointments with her."
37568,"This definitely fixed any dehydration issues, but my heart was still racing out of anxiety so they injected a small dosage of lorazepam (an anxiety medication) which calmed me down almost immediately, but had an effect on me for the rest of the day of drowsiness minus the feeling of tiredness."
37569,I need medication or something.
37570,"I suffer from mild anxiety, and I'm on an anti-anxiety medication as well as a benzo (which I don't use often)."
37571,I have had an anxiety-induced headache for almost four days now.
37572,"It's very painful, nauseating, and I'm headache medicine isn't working."
37573,"I'm taking my medicine as normal, and I'm not actively thinking about anything anxiety-inducing when this happens."
37574,Does anyone have any suggestions for ways to help me with these headaches?
37575,"I've tried taking headache medicine with/without caffeine, my normal anti-anxiety medications, tea, sleeping more, exercising, but nothing's working!"
37576,Thanks so much.
37577,Hello all this isn't my first time posting but it is the first regarding my weight issues.I say it's due to all the medication I'm on but my dr's swear they are all weight nuteral medications.
37578,"Either way here is what I am on (get ready it's a list):

Lorazepam: 2mg 

Lamictal: 250mg 

Wellbutrin: 300mg

Abilify: 20mg  

Effexor: 225mg


I used to be on Zoloft but was taken off of it in the early stages."
37579,Either either way I'm on a bunch of meds I've just recently turned 20 and I'm on more pills than most people over 70 I have gone up 6 waist sizes in just over 6 months and I think that this is more depressing than my actual depression.
37580,I've been feeling better than I used to but in no way am I good according to family members as well as myself.
37581,I just need some comfort and maybe even a bit of guidance from more experienced people that can help me guide my doctors in the correct direction for treatment.
37582,Please help that's all I ask for...
37583,I even asked my doctor is the medicine would numb me and he assured me it wouldn't but that's exactly what it feels like.
37584,I've lost 30lbs in the last three months from my medicine and from anxiety.
37585,"Basically, over the years I've tried all kinds of medications and tried all kinds of therapy, CBT, hypnotherapy, etc, for depression and severe social anxiety/""AVPD"", and it never helped."
37586,"In the case of the therapy it was interesting, but ultimately it never actually improved my problems, and it is expensive."
37587,"I really dislike the idea of having my parents pay for it, because they would insist on it and theres no way I can afford it in any case."
37588,I generally gave up on it after seeing how it had no effect and I feel like a lost cause.
37589,Is it still worth trying?
37590,People have recommended it recently and I've been thinking of trying it again for what its worth.
37591,"The depression is for the most part gone, though the anxiety is still very severe and its messed everything up, and as a side effect I get times where I get really depressed/suicidal thoughts on and off because of how its affected my life."
37592,Thank you for reading.
37593,I had four good days and was really hoping that I had finally found the medicine that was going to work for me.
37594,So I've been visiting a therapist for a month now to discuss my worsening anxiety problems.
37595,Recently they've been getting increasingly horrible and debilitating.
37596,I haven't gone outside other than to the bus stop for school for about 2 months.
37597,Ive been on a couple of medications throughout the last year but they didn't work that great.
37598,I was on Prozac for 5 months and I felt as though I lost 50 IQ points and I tried to kill myself twice and Zoloft made sleeping impossible.
37599,The one med that has worked is Adderall and I'm currently on 50mg per weekday as it completely erases all anxiety and depression (I have ADD along with GAD and mild depression) However I've discussed this with my doctor and therapist and we've decided to stop over the summer and find something that won't be so detrimental to my physical health like Adderall is.
37600,Two days from now I'm starting a low dose of Welbutrin and I'm incredibly nervous (anxiety right?
37601,"Haha) anyways, I was wondering if anyone has had experience with this med and if they found it more helpful than SSRIs or if it was just a general positive impact on their well-being."
37602,Thanks!
37603,(I am trying to beat these attacks without meds) so about a half hour goes by and I won.
37604,"I've also stopped taking my adhd medication, not because it makes me more anxious, but because I'm too afraid to ask to doctor to start prescribing it again because of the way I may be judged as seeking a high."
37605,So here I go shelling out 300 bucks to see if I get my meds.
37606,"(No insurance)

A good friend of mine is a RN and says the first thing they will do is change my meds."
37607,I'm not a rude guy but I'm simply wanting the current medication without a long process and bill.
37608,"TL;DR : going to psychiatrist for first time, what to expect and will my meds change for sure?"
37609,I would hope to get some sort of situational medication like beta blockers to take before making presentations.
37610,"I make very little money so I think paying for a doctor's visit or even a lot of prescription medication would be rather difficult, but again since I haven't had health insurance for years I have no idea how the process works."
37611,Does the medication help?
37612,My meds do nothing.
37613,"I keep trying and trying, medication after medication, counselor after counselor."
37614,"Another plus, the side-effects of the medication have been almost non-existent."
37615,For years I was very hesitant to look into any medication because I'd heard nothing but horror stories.
37616,I have a check-in appointment in a month to see how I'm doing with the meds.
37617,*tl;dr:* Started anti-anxiety meds.
37618,I don't take meds and normally it's controllable as long as I'm not hungover.
37619,"My question, and hopefully someone can help me out here, is what can I do to bring my anxiety down, I'm not on any medication because everyone thinks this is just something I'll get over."
37620,"For the last two or three months I've been having tremors in my hands, fingers and my mouth/tongue."
37621,I went to the doctor and since all my labs were normal he attributed them to anxiety.
37622,I'm taking xanax whenever I feel overwhelmed and I have recently started taking Buspar.
37623,Just wondering if anyone else has ever felt these symptoms..not necessarily because of medications but just because of their anxiety?
37624,( I know its not from my medications because they have been there before and they are still here).
37625,Now my doctor wants me to see a psychiatrist.
37626,Thoughts?
37627,"I'm going to a therapist, who suggested that anxiety medicine will help supplement my therapy."
37628,"My boyfriend is from a country that views going to the therapist or taking any anxiety/depression medication as only someone ""crazy"" or ""weak"" will do (his words)."
37629,How do I tell him that I want to start taking anxiety medicine and explain it in a way that has him really understand why I'm making this decision?
37630,I'm afraid to  try to take it quickly so I won't worry about it the build-up because I may worry after and make myself short of breath and then blame it on the meds.
37631,I feel better but I feel like I am to young to be needing this medicine.
37632,On my senior trip it happened and I had to bring a mattress into the bathroom and sleep on the bathroom floor when I could finally calm down with no medicine.
37633,"Today, for the first time, I saw a doctor about my anxiety."
37634,"After speaking with me for an hour, he said he was 100% sure I suffer from generalized and social anxiety, as well as OCD compulsions."
37635,He gave me a few options and I chose to do a combination of medication (anti depressants of some kind) and CBT.
37636,I'll be starting those in a few weeks (I'm having surgery and he wants me to wait until after to start the medication).
37637,"I was wondering if anyone wanted to share any tips/experiences with either medications or CBT, as this is all really new for me."
37638,"This year I moved out with my boyfriend and finally decided that as an adult, I need to get help for these problems."
37639,"I finally feel like maybe I have some control over my life, and that my final semester in university y might be manageable."
37640,I have a strange anxiety/fear of taking new medications.
37641,Anything from tylenol to birth control to antibiotics.
37642,Does anyone have suggestions for dealing with this?
37643,Even meds I have taken before without any issues I am still anxious about taking.
37644,It is incredibly frustrating and I REALLY need to start a new med but keep pushing it back due to the fear.
37645,Cbt didnt help and meds make it worse.
37646,"My brother has an extremely severe case because anti-depressants completely fucked him up and made him so much worse, so taking any kind of medication is out of the question."
37647,Hello everyone!
37648,"I am currently conducting some research (For my Postgraduate MSc HPaB Psychology degree) on Depression/Anxiety and I would be very, very grateful if members who are currently taking medications would take a moment to complete the survey in the link below."
37649,"The broad goal of my research is to examine the different classes of anti-depressant medications in relation to side effects, specifically addressing the severity level, type and tolerability of side effects in relation to medication BNF classification (the pharmacological body which classifies antidepressants into categories depending on the primary proposed mechanism for how the medication works)."
37650,"The link is: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3933B5L
Again, I am very grateful to those who are willing to contribute the 5-10minutes it will take to complete the survey, an introductory page; disclosure and debriefing are included within the first and last pages, also an exclusion criteria is presented on the first page (For example, only persons +18 years can participate)."
37651,Thank you again!!!
37652,P.S.
37653,"Please feel free to forward on the survey link, the higher the amount of responses and the more varied the participants the more robust my research findings will be."
37654,Also please complete the full survey once you have started or the information will be lost!
37655,"Again, many thanks."
37656,Nick.
37657,I have been on medicine.
37658,"I was diagnosed with anxiety problems at a young age, and I've had huge avoidance problems ever since, so much as destroying my school career, and I was on medication for a long, long time for both anxiety and depression."
37659,"I got off of the meds a couple years ago and I feel like I'm much better off, the weird thing is I have a hard time remembering most of what went on during the time I was on the meds, but I know my behavior had gotten much better."
37660,"It's to the point now that, while I remember in the past not having any problems just saying ANYTHING to people I thought were my friends, to a degree that I regret it and I blame on the meds I was taking (since I was an awful freak holy shit), but I don't feel comfortable asking my parents for help."
37661,"I've tried meds, but in the same classes - MAOIs interact with my other meds and SSRIs don't do anything, good or bad... which is apparently a fault of not being on the right one or for long enough... but it leaves me wondering about the significance of side-effects, in particular."
37662,"After about an hour on the road, I realized I forgot my meds - Wellbutrin 300mg."
37663,"I considered turning around, but thought I would just have my girlfriend FedEx the meds to my destination rather than add another 2 hours of driving onto my trip."
37664,I'm back home now and have taken my meds and am thinking more rationally now.
37665,My father doesn't know I have been taking meds.
37666,"so my doctor prescribed me buspar for my anxiety, and my mom said I shouldn't take it everyday, like other medications."
37667,(I'm not on anything else).
37668,Is buspar not a everyday drug to get acclimated too?
37669,"My concern is that this medication has been a lifesaver for me, and I want to use it responsibly."
37670,Has anyone noticed a difference with heart beat while on medication?
37671,"When I give them medication, I stay awake all night checking that they are still alive."
37672,Is this developing into *another* fuckin' mental disorder or do you think this is just the medication fucking around with me?
37673,How different are the meds ?
37674,"However, I am particularly apprehensive about being overwhelmed with anxiety next semester, and am considering taking meds to get a better hold of my life."
37675,I know only my therapist would have the best idea whether meds (and which ones) would be a good choice and each individual's situation is unique.
37676,"However, as I have never taken medication for any reason in my life up to this point, I was wondering if /r/anxiety could give me any idea of what to expect, to do, and possibly avoid."
37677,TLDR; I am a mad stressed out college student who had never taken anxiety meds.
37678,"I suggested we see a psychiatrist and she said, ""All they do is prescribe medicine, you need to talk to someone about your problems""."
37679,I improved a lot over summer and got on medication and then felt ready to come back but now I can feel the stress creeping back in.
37680,"I'm not sure what to do, I'm going to see my uni doc to tell her I'm on medication so she can monitor my dosage (saw her for anxiety last year but was prescribed meds at home) and I'm seeing my tutor next week for advice on support the uni can give me (she knows the score and I had special circumstances in last year which gave me consideration on borderline pass grades, extensions and uncapped resits) 

The feelings of worthlessness and of ""omgicantdothisiwanttorunhometosafetyevenifitmeansbeingaNEETwasteofspace"" are creeping back and I'm scared."
37681,Taking meds is not an option.
37682,I am seeing a psychiatrist this week but really don't want to go back on any meds since it's been maybe 3 months.
37683,"I tried medication, and it gave me such a severe anxiety attack that I became delusional and tried to kill myself."
37684,I stopped taking my meds for awhile (they were low dose to begin with) but plan on going back on them because I'm still having problems with my social phobia.
37685,What I'm wondering is what are things you do to deal with your anxiety other than using medication?
37686,tl;dr - what are other ways of dealing with my anxiety in addition to medication.
37687,"Being that I'm a bit skeptical of psychiatric medication, I chose to ""train"" myself to be able to talk myself down from panic attacks and they eventually went away for a while."
37688,"I expressed my desire to take a ""rescue"" medication on an as needed basis."
37689,I don't want daily medication.
37690,"Any and all thoughts, opinions, advice on this medicine would be appreciated!"
37691,So today i decided to reset my sleep schedule because it was effecting the times i was taking my medication.
37692,I didn't understand why medication for ADD could help me to deal with my anxiety.
37693,I'm completely off any meds for three months now and I'm not too good.
37694,"I started seeing a succession of psychiatrists and trying various meds, few of them helped, but it did help to feel like I was doing something about my mental illness."
37695,"it's so odd... it could be because of meds I've taken, I've taken a lot over the past few days."
37696,meds I've taken...
37697,"Aside from anxiety medicine, any tips or tricks?"
37698,I do have anxiety and I am taking medication for it which seems to help.
37699,"However, now I'm pregnant, so any meds are completely out."
37700,I've been exercising and taking medication from my doctor (gone through maybe 7 different pills) and I still feel like I'm dying.
37701,Looking for peoples experience with medicine to combat anxiety and depression that won't cause horrific side effects.
37702,I went without meds for a few months until I decided to go back to him and he gave me bupropion/welbutrin.
37703,"She got me a laptop desk since I don't have one,  a cellphone case and helped me get my meds."
37704,"i saw my doctor last week and he suggested i get a companion animal to help with the action plan we made to tackle my anxiety (which also includes taking medication to help me)

my husband and i do not yet have an animal of any kind, as we are not allowed to have one in our rented home."
37705,"I’ve been on medication before, and it has worked *fairly* well for me (Zoloft with a Xanax on the side for really tough days), although I’m a sexless, useless zombie during the first 4-6 weeks."
37706,"I take a drug that has a rare side effect
	They tell me it will help me sleep through the night
	They tell me that it will calm me down
	They tell me that it will all be okay
		Just take your medicine
	I walk when I am feeling low
	Just to a park around the corner
		It doesn't attract a lot of people
			There are corners I can hide in
				I write there."
37707,"after experimenting with a few different meds, my new psychologist just prescribed me Zoloft."
37708,"I don't want to start right with medicine, and I started therapy last week with my next appointment this coming Monday."
