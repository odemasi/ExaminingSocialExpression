- Heavy cardio exercise 3-5 times a week (3km runs and soccer)

- General blood tests (Vitamin and mineral levels, e.g - iron)

- Thyroid via blood test

- Testosterone levels via blood test

- A sleep study, to rule out sleep apnoea

- 3 years of seeing a psychologist (ACT I think, some CBT)

Yet to check:

- Adrenal function tests (Maybe that was already tested as part of blood tests, to be confirmed)
