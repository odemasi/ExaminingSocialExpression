1,0.9999689716096455,3.102839035277956e-05,I've tried medications but they only made me feel like a zombie and going to sit down with a therapist only increases my anxiety.
2,0.9999517557973688,4.824420263122715e-05,I'm against taking medication after what I had to deal with in the past but I realized this is my only option to get better.

4,0.9996123020455943,0.0003876979544186043,"A bit of a strange question, I suppose, but here goes:

I've been really trying to focus on getting off of any anti-anxiety medication and overcoming/dealing with this in a more natural way and I really think I've had a lot of success."
5,0.9999955973906806,4.402609311010856e-06,I'm currently getting off lexapro and I've had this happen to me before I was on this medication.
6,0.9999605086440496,3.949135594343627e-05,I honestly think the only thing left that would help me is some sort of medication.
7,0.9999711837348626,2.8816265147702263e-05,How can I make it clear to whoever can actually give me them that I want to try medication?

14,0.9999740629793051,2.5937020704410384e-05,Or should I go back to the doctor and tell him I want to keep trying medication?
15,0.9999884479971939,1.1552002788124898e-05,"The medications I've tried are

24,0.9996707502251783,0.00032924977481575153,I'm trying to get pregnant and the last thing  I want to do is try to rely on a medication (though there are times like tonight where I just want to throw my hands up and say OK fine I will just take it).. who knows what it actually does to your brain.
25,0.9999933121631496,6.68783686825629e-06,"I've gotten myself on some meds for this, and I'm trying."
26,0.9999657415898086,3.42584102097181e-05,"Also, how do you approach your doctor for a specific medicine?"
27,0.9999952777548262,4.722245190240749e-06,"Hey guys,

I just got prescribed new meds Lexapro and lorazepam."
28,0.9983041907316551,0.0016958092683400509,But then he goes onto say that it doesn't really get to the heart of why I want to go into medicine and then questions why I want to be a doctor.
29,0.9999780963616015,2.1903638390182978e-05,Instead she said that every symptom I've ever discussed with her was because of marijuana and that she would no longer give me any medication.

32,0.9999593247790505,4.0675220954656975e-05,I'm sure I'll have to try a few things out and see how I'll feel but I could use advice on how you guys time everything with your meds so you're not feeling like a dopy mess at the wrong time.
33,0.9999950700189157,4.929981074816038e-06,She was then put on some pretty strong medication.
34,0.9944659108442161,0.005534089155779334,On top of that due to my sporadic incomes over the past 12 years she does not ever see us being able to have children and on top of that she feels a big part of her breakdown &amp; subsequently being on medication is because of me and the trauma she's experienced watching &amp; having to constantly support me having such horrible panic attacks.
35,0.9999952555597988,4.744440221751682e-06,I stopped taking my medication before leaving because i had decided i wanted to join the military (incredibly stupid for someone in my position.)
36,0.999341733230226,0.0006582667697772956,Now my anxiety and depression are getting to the point where i'm having anxiety attacks a couple of times a week and don't have any medication to help me.
37,0.9999551742477603,4.4825752250537644e-05,"I'm back on my meds now, but a lower dose."

40,0.9999931136655478,6.886334449489018e-06,I've been having issues for about 5 years have been taking medication for 3.
41,0.9999957275159332,4.272484049766238e-06,"I'm not sure what I hope to achieve by seeing one; I have no problem with taking medicine, but I feel like I have nothing to lose."
42,0.9999951414423488,4.858557645020741e-06,"The thoughts are fears of me doing something unintentionally... like I'm afraid I'll sleepwalk and overdose on my medication, or sleepwalk and injure someone with a weapon, or do something completely out of my control."
43,0.9999701935353219,2.980646469302492e-05,So I open these questions up to those that are currently on both meds (Wellbutrin and Prozac) or have been.
44,0.9999414259303673,5.857406964643503e-05,I don't want to have to try a different medication but this is not gonna fly.

47,0.9999928472971065,7.152702888271989e-06,Topical medications?
48,0.9999928472971065,7.152702888271989e-06,Oral meds?
49,0.9999892114991132,1.0788500901369127e-05,"I am ok.  

At 10 am I take my ""morning medicine,"" which consists of 1 mg Xanax extended release, 40 mg of prilosec (for my terrible stomach acid), 800 mg of Gabapentin (again, for anxiety), and 25 mg of Seroquel (anxiety)."

52,0.9999992293965917,7.70603421961221e-07,I just feel like I am too scared and crippled to do anything now and I'm not sure if I should give anxiety medicine another try.
53,0.9999851387938544,1.4861206159350796e-05,"Please don't tell me to talk to my doctor about this, all he does is suggest different medicines for me and doesn't listen to me at all."

56,0.9999808158685386,1.918413144237646e-05,I got it under control by going on different medicines.
57,0.9999778028632993,2.2197136716124645e-05,(they do not allow anti anxiety meds before the sedation.)

61,0.9999967718041904,3.2281958027768597e-06,She was an alternative-medicine type therapist and helped me talk some things out and give me some coping strategies.
62,0.9999658217960553,3.417820395484459e-05,im excited to see how the meds are gonna kick ass over my anxiety!
63,0.9999668727176343,3.312728237185524e-05,I'm a little iffy about medication after a really bad experience with Paxil last year.
64,0.9995433587718855,0.00045664122812994867,I haven't taken medication in a while so I can't remember if it was the same while on it.
65,0.9999537658637678,4.62341362335872e-05,I also feel that it makes me weak as if I cant survive without this medication.
66,0.999978075151128,2.1924848855421415e-05,"My depression and anxiety are fairly well controlled, I am on meds that help me significantly."

68,0.9999934327574944,6.56724248627277e-06,"I think 3 things kept me from giving up on the meds at that time:

* Hearing some stories, either here or on other forums, about people having really high stress/anxiety when they first get on the meds."
69,0.9993179299754114,0.0006820700245992553,"* Not being sure if this was caused by the meds themselves, or if I'd starting taking them just the nick of time, and that first weekend was just the tip of a particularly depressing &amp; shitty iceberg."
70,0.9996678323766941,0.0003321676233157375,"Two questions I have for you fine folks:

* Has anyone experienced insomnia, but had it subside over time without the addition of some other medication?"
71,0.9999945481501619,5.451849844515137e-06,"I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow if possible, to try and start some medication to help cope with my anxiety."
72,0.9999932107758571,6.789224137003849e-06,"I'm planning on going to a psychiatrist sometime soon, and I was wondering if they make you use a certain medication, or do you they let you choose?"
73,0.9999608462180141,3.9153781997390246e-05,I'm at the point in my life where I feel like I need to start taking medication.
74,0.9999920405537038,7.95944629220952e-06,In fact I was on BP meds for YEARS.
75,0.9999974518343182,2.5481656767191636e-06,"Now, like every medicine i get i don't want to take it."
76,0.9929436646344872,0.0070563353655097635,I'm scripted Ativan 1mg as needed (along with a cocktail of other medication for my many disorders) and last month I needed to take it (on average) about once every 2 days.
77,0.9996352107553318,0.00036478924466649797,"I always feel the need to make them feel better, its as though my brain just picks up all the uneasiness of others, makes them feel better and in return i end up stuck with all these shit feelings...

i dont know what to do and am honestly considering therapy or some medications that will just calm me down."
78,0.9998663786332789,0.00013362136672378532,"Things were really looking up for a while, since the medication was prescribed."
79,0.9999859782913069,1.4021708691042889e-05,"But does anyone maybe have any tips for dealing with things like I've described, short of therapy or more/different medication?"
80,0.9999125876132597,8.741238674984283e-05,Anyways I cannot think of any solutions aside from breaking up with her which is the last thing I want to do and want to ask for any ideas on how to cope with this (no meds please).
81,0.9999951603661333,4.8396338539390056e-06,"Other general info if needed: Age: 16 (Junior in High School), No meds or any drug use."
82,0.9999012769636086,9.8723036376128e-05,Do I even want medication since it seems like you have to kind of shuffle through them to see which ones work and which ones don't...?
83,0.9999778646655991,2.2135334416914554e-05,I recently had to take some melatonin to improve my sleep quality as well as other medication to calm myself down.
84,0.99997355096146,2.644903852963178e-05,"I have never taken prescription medication before until July 2014 I started on 1mg lorazepam (Ativan) once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and then .5mg at night."

86,0.999960530829165,3.9469170827529014e-05,"I am not on meds currently, because I had to go get a blood test before my MD will give me meds."
87,0.9999883727444808,1.1627255523761603e-05,"I notice blood on my T-shirts (Actually, I should note, I have been prescribed minocycline and a topical cream for my acne, so yes, I have been given medication)."
88,0.9999484569907843,5.1543009215358786e-05,"I am on my sixth day of anxiety medication (celexa) and I am seeing my family doctor once every week, in addition to my psychologist once every week."

91,0.9999891692679204,1.083073207683308e-05,"I suppose my medication is for laziness too, and the cuts on my arms are just coincidental."
92,0.9999937551019844,6.244898024378229e-06,What anti-anxiety meds have worked for you that don't cause vertigo or nausea?
93,0.9995334203877316,0.0004665796122814561,"My Psychologist suggested medication, which has been a fear of mine for some time."
94,0.9999804187385045,1.9581261481606886e-05,I am just exhausted emotionally and wanted to hear some POV of fellow anxious redditors who may have good / bad experiences with medication therapy.
95,0.9998001338396051,0.00019986616039927333,"I've had insomnia issues before, a lot actually, so I'm not sure if this is just my brain not turning off again or an actual side effect of the meds that will maybe eventually clear up."
96,0.9999727949460699,2.7205053921239847e-05,I'm really starting to feel scared about what my meds are doing to me in the long-term.
97,0.9999495893894501,5.041061055201951e-05,"I really wish I could quit taking meds altogether, since I'm also afraid of what Zoloft is doing to me now."
98,0.9997621228241468,0.00023787717586067615,"I'm wondering if I should seek medications from a psychiatrist again, at least so I can get it under control in these types of situations and learn how to function again."
99,0.9999642582765055,3.574172348641686e-05,I have no idea how these medications work or if it's worth starting up during a transition period like the new few weeks when I start classes.
