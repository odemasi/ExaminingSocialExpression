0,I have a feeling that this will only get worse from now on since she's also looking up all sorts of alternative medicine bullshit for OCD now...
1,I've tried medications but they only made me feel like a zombie and going to sit down with a therapist only increases my anxiety.
2,I'm against taking medication after what I had to deal with in the past but I realized this is my only option to get better.
3,I see my doctor next week and I don't know what to tell him about these meds.
4,"A bit of a strange question, I suppose, but here goes:

I've been really trying to focus on getting off of any anti-anxiety medication and overcoming/dealing with this in a more natural way and I really think I've had a lot of success."
5,I'm currently getting off lexapro and I've had this happen to me before I was on this medication.
6,I honestly think the only thing left that would help me is some sort of medication.
7,How can I make it clear to whoever can actually give me them that I want to try medication?
8,"I've always what I'd consider moderate anxiety, I don't need medication, but I'm starting to consider it."
9,I scheduled a GP appointment last week and he diagnosed me with anxiety and panic disorder and referred me to a psych for further evaluation and medication and a therapist.
10,I can't afford a consular right now or medication.
11,This last time she asked I explained that I was getting my anxiety medicine adjusted a few days before she needed me to watch them and maybe it would be easier for me.
12,"I first went it wanting to treat my anxiety which has plagued me for a while but only recently got worse, and he prescribed me some meds."
13,"I've put thought into it, and I still want to attempt to treat it my anxiety with medication, if the option is still viable."
14,Or should I go back to the doctor and tell him I want to keep trying medication?
15,"The medications I've tried are

Fluoxetine: Horrible nausea: lasted all day and interrupted work."
16,"**Actual experiences with meds will be quoted, background story will be in regular text."
17,"Mentally, this medication made me feel like a zombie."
18,BUT I currently do not take any medication at all for either.
19,"I wish it was something they could treat with medicine and be done with, fuck you anxiety."
20,"I do not have depression or anxiety, I have never taken any medication other than antibiotics though I may have some of the symptoms of ADHD."
21,Though recently I heard that some people on anti-depressant medication experience a similar symptom.
22,Is anxiety manageable without meds?
23,"I guess after all this rambling.. my question is, can it really get better without meds?"
24,I'm trying to get pregnant and the last thing  I want to do is try to rely on a medication (though there are times like tonight where I just want to throw my hands up and say OK fine I will just take it).. who knows what it actually does to your brain.
25,"I've gotten myself on some meds for this, and I'm trying."
26,"Also, how do you approach your doctor for a specific medicine?"
27,"Hey guys,

I just got prescribed new meds Lexapro and lorazepam."
28,But then he goes onto say that it doesn't really get to the heart of why I want to go into medicine and then questions why I want to be a doctor.
29,Instead she said that every symptom I've ever discussed with her was because of marijuana and that she would no longer give me any medication.
30,I took time off from school and work after the relationship ended and my parents were a big help to me as I got my thyroid meds in order and started losing weight.
31,"I cant catch a break i think im finally broken i don't know what to do i can't take meds because i hate having to rely on things like this to get by, this is how i quit cigarettes just cold turkey."
32,I'm sure I'll have to try a few things out and see how I'll feel but I could use advice on how you guys time everything with your meds so you're not feeling like a dopy mess at the wrong time.
33,She was then put on some pretty strong medication.
34,On top of that due to my sporadic incomes over the past 12 years she does not ever see us being able to have children and on top of that she feels a big part of her breakdown &amp; subsequently being on medication is because of me and the trauma she's experienced watching &amp; having to constantly support me having such horrible panic attacks.
35,I stopped taking my medication before leaving because i had decided i wanted to join the military (incredibly stupid for someone in my position.)
36,Now my anxiety and depression are getting to the point where i'm having anxiety attacks a couple of times a week and don't have any medication to help me.
37,"I'm back on my meds now, but a lower dose."
38,The ER doctor gave me muscle relaxants and some pain meds and referred me to a neurologist because they suspect I have some nerve damage.
39,Ive had around 3 attacks in the last 24 hours that leave me crippled and I am on no medication.
40,I've been having issues for about 5 years have been taking medication for 3.
41,"I'm not sure what I hope to achieve by seeing one; I have no problem with taking medicine, but I feel like I have nothing to lose."
42,"The thoughts are fears of me doing something unintentionally... like I'm afraid I'll sleepwalk and overdose on my medication, or sleepwalk and injure someone with a weapon, or do something completely out of my control."
43,So I open these questions up to those that are currently on both meds (Wellbutrin and Prozac) or have been.
44,I don't want to have to try a different medication but this is not gonna fly.
45,I also didn't take any anti anxiety medication before I went to the hospital.
46,My doctor doesnt seem to be concerned at all and has just upped my meds in an effort to help.
47,Topical medications?
48,Oral meds?
49,"I am ok.  

At 10 am I take my ""morning medicine,"" which consists of 1 mg Xanax extended release, 40 mg of prilosec (for my terrible stomach acid), 800 mg of Gabapentin (again, for anxiety), and 25 mg of Seroquel (anxiety)."
50,At 4 pm I take my day time medicines (seroquel 25 mg and gabapentin 800 mg again) and keep playing my game.
51,I am taking my medications exactly as prescribed by my doctor.
52,I just feel like I am too scared and crippled to do anything now and I'm not sure if I should give anxiety medicine another try.
53,"Please don't tell me to talk to my doctor about this, all he does is suggest different medicines for me and doesn't listen to me at all."
54,I did not receive medication until I was 22 because of my parents.
55,"I have had bad anxiety/depression since I was a child and have been on and off tons of different medicines, when I was around 19-20 I started having panic attack often and it cost me a job or two."
56,I got it under control by going on different medicines.
57,(they do not allow anti anxiety meds before the sedation.)
58,"The counselor helped a little bit, and I'm not entirely sure if the medication helped at all because I still felt anxious."
59,The first thing the VA wanted to do was give me medication.
60,"I didn't want to take medication as the onset of the problem was quite rapid for the most part, so I was determined to get through it without medication."
61,She was an alternative-medicine type therapist and helped me talk some things out and give me some coping strategies.
62,im excited to see how the meds are gonna kick ass over my anxiety!
63,I'm a little iffy about medication after a really bad experience with Paxil last year.
64,I haven't taken medication in a while so I can't remember if it was the same while on it.
65,I also feel that it makes me weak as if I cant survive without this medication.
66,"My depression and anxiety are fairly well controlled, I am on meds that help me significantly."
67,"Up until this point I was strongly averse to medication, and had put all of my energy into trying various mindfulness or cognitive techniques (quite a lot of meditation, have been reading about ACT, but have never made a strong attempt at CBT)."
68,"I think 3 things kept me from giving up on the meds at that time:

* Hearing some stories, either here or on other forums, about people having really high stress/anxiety when they first get on the meds."
69,"* Not being sure if this was caused by the meds themselves, or if I'd starting taking them just the nick of time, and that first weekend was just the tip of a particularly depressing &amp; shitty iceberg."
70,"Two questions I have for you fine folks:

* Has anyone experienced insomnia, but had it subside over time without the addition of some other medication?"
71,"I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow if possible, to try and start some medication to help cope with my anxiety."
72,"I'm planning on going to a psychiatrist sometime soon, and I was wondering if they make you use a certain medication, or do you they let you choose?"
73,I'm at the point in my life where I feel like I need to start taking medication.
74,In fact I was on BP meds for YEARS.
75,"Now, like every medicine i get i don't want to take it."
76,I'm scripted Ativan 1mg as needed (along with a cocktail of other medication for my many disorders) and last month I needed to take it (on average) about once every 2 days.
77,"I always feel the need to make them feel better, its as though my brain just picks up all the uneasiness of others, makes them feel better and in return i end up stuck with all these shit feelings...

i dont know what to do and am honestly considering therapy or some medications that will just calm me down."
78,"Things were really looking up for a while, since the medication was prescribed."
79,"But does anyone maybe have any tips for dealing with things like I've described, short of therapy or more/different medication?"
80,Anyways I cannot think of any solutions aside from breaking up with her which is the last thing I want to do and want to ask for any ideas on how to cope with this (no meds please).
81,"Other general info if needed: Age: 16 (Junior in High School), No meds or any drug use."
82,Do I even want medication since it seems like you have to kind of shuffle through them to see which ones work and which ones don't...?
83,I recently had to take some melatonin to improve my sleep quality as well as other medication to calm myself down.
84,"I have never taken prescription medication before until July 2014 I started on 1mg lorazepam (Ativan) once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and then .5mg at night."
85,So I've been on these meds for about four months now.
86,"I am not on meds currently, because I had to go get a blood test before my MD will give me meds."
87,"I notice blood on my T-shirts (Actually, I should note, I have been prescribed minocycline and a topical cream for my acne, so yes, I have been given medication)."
88,"I am on my sixth day of anxiety medication (celexa) and I am seeing my family doctor once every week, in addition to my psychologist once every week."
89,I'm on meds that are supposed to help with the obsessive thinking.
90,I've been on multiple medications.
91,"I suppose my medication is for laziness too, and the cuts on my arms are just coincidental."
92,What anti-anxiety meds have worked for you that don't cause vertigo or nausea?
93,"My Psychologist suggested medication, which has been a fear of mine for some time."
94,I am just exhausted emotionally and wanted to hear some POV of fellow anxious redditors who may have good / bad experiences with medication therapy.
95,"I've had insomnia issues before, a lot actually, so I'm not sure if this is just my brain not turning off again or an actual side effect of the meds that will maybe eventually clear up."
96,I'm really starting to feel scared about what my meds are doing to me in the long-term.
97,"I really wish I could quit taking meds altogether, since I'm also afraid of what Zoloft is doing to me now."
98,"I'm wondering if I should seek medications from a psychiatrist again, at least so I can get it under control in these types of situations and learn how to function again."
99,I have no idea how these medications work or if it's worth starting up during a transition period like the new few weeks when I start classes.
100,"I have to take medication for it, so i guess that puts a little more feedback on how ""severe"" it is, but i don't really think it's that bad."
101,"I would really like to ask my therapist about medication, but I'm scared."
102,"I don't want to be the way that I am anymore, and I don't think I can change myself without the help of medication."
103,"My boyfriend is on SSRIs for his depression, and he has the common side effects, and has tried different medications, but eventually just settled on one that made his mood feel the best, regardless of the side effects."
104,I've been on the medication since January and fortunately haven't had any anxiety attacks for several months now.
105,"The doctors, mental health professionals, and a psychiatrist that I've spoken to have all recommended that I increase the dosage of my medication as they believe that changing my medication is the only solution to me getting better."
106,And I also have anxieties about psychoactive substances like my medication having control over my mind and making me unable to exercise free will over my thoughts and emotions and instead making me into someone that is unhappy but still functional in society.
107,So I'm just curious as to other people's experiences regarding dosage change on this medication.
108,"Reddit, how do you deal with the weight gain from your medication?"
109,"And then one day i realized I'd been so much happier &amp; less stressed lately, &amp; that I hadn't taken or needed any of my meds in months."
110,I've been off any &amp; all anxiety meds &amp; antidepressants for going on 4 years now.
111,I'm just putting this here for anyone who's having trouble treating their anxiety or doesn't want to have to take meds long-term...
112,I was lucky enough to get state aid for the past year for my prescription medications and the discount helped a lot because otherwise I would be paying a ridiculous amount.
113,"However, I've now been told that I make too much money and will therefore no longer be able to receive the discount on my medications starting April 1."
114,The thought of not being able to get my meds is making me really anxious and last time this happened I ended up in the hospital.
115,TL;DR My discount for my meds is ending soon but I need the meds to function.
116,"Meditation and talk therapy are also part of my regiment, but this is one medicine change I've been very happy with."
117,Then I had a massive panic attack so I took 1mg Lorazepam (my first time taking any anxiety meds).
118,I've been on 3 different SSRI medications in the past and HATED the way they've made me feel.
119,"Recently, I had gone 4 months without one severe enough to require my medication, I was really proud of that."
120,"The meds didn't help that time, I just walked into walls a lot and felt wobbly woozy."
121,The only meds she is on now is Buspirone 30mg and Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day.
122,Are these meds making her nauseas or is it her “nerves”?
123,"I'm considering going to see a psychologist about anxiety meds, but it seems so weird to me that dating is the only thing I can think of that brings this out in me."
124,Considering meds.
125,Today is my first time ever taking any type of medication for my anxiety/depression.
126,I know it takes a few weeks for meds to take effect so I don't know if it's because of the Prozac that I feel like this.
127,Is this normal or am I having a bad reaction to the meds?
128,"Hey y'all

I am on a medication right now for my severe anxiety and noticed something now when having sex with my GF:

I can't cum!"
129,"EDIT:  I don't know the name of my meds I have to look at them, I'm also on an anti-psychotic for my psychosis."
130,"During my last semester abroad in graduate school, I was living independently, long-distance with my girlfriend, taking 9 courses in school, and was given news before arriving abroad that my kidney condition, although stable, was acting up a bit, but not enough for him to say I definitely needed medication."
131,"I'm getting migraines from stress, I'm trying to use my medications sparingly but I find myself crying and having a hard time pulling myself together more and more."
132,"but I'm hoping I can get some advice:

I suffer from social anxiety and have tried multiple medications for this but they all failed (I am currently prescribed 100mg lamictal &amp; 30mg adderall which I have been on for years) but I never tried benzos until yesterday when I was prescribed .5mg of clonazepam from my psychiatrist."
133,I'm new to this medication and would do anything to get rid of this social anxiety so I could use all the advice I can get.
134,"I'm also on medication for anxiety, and I'm seeing a therapist."
135,"She's never seen a professional about it, had any medicine, or anything like that."
136,"I think this has helped me realise that the medication I'm on, while dulling the anxiety and depression, also dulls the good feelings sometimes as well."
137,"I think I'm going to mention this to my doctor and see what she says about it, because if there are other medications I could try that dull the anxiety but don't necessarily dull the happiness as much then I'd like to try them."
138,"This discovery is the result of an accident, and I intend to get back on medication as soon as I can, because I know I'm still not at a place mentally where I can handle the anxiety without meds."
139,"Last night my girlfriend and I had sex while my parents weren't home, and due to my medication I took forever to climax so we eventually stopped."
140,"I have not taken any medication other than Acetaminophen, which has no side effects."
141,I have recently gone off my meds for anxiety because my Dr told me it was possible that my brain chemistry could change.
142,I have been off of them for over a month now and I have now realized the thoughts and irritability I exhibit off of my meds are bad/different.
143,I want to stay off the meds but I need to control my issues.
144,"Are there any meds that help with nausea, bloating and loss of appetite because Im losing lots of weight ever since my life has begun to get more social."
145,"I don't have, and I can't afford, any medications or professional help at the moment."
146,My best friend is studying to get his Phd in homeopathic medicine and has been using me as his case study.
147,I was hesitant because I am a nurse so I'm trained in western medicine and don't have much knowledge of herbal remedies.
148,"I've always been anti-meds (because taking medication makes me anxious; I'm always afraid I'll be allergic to it, or that I won't be able to handle the side effects), but right now all I want is for someone to hand me a pill that will let me sleep and feel ""normal"" for a while, whatever normal is."
149,"I mentioned this to my Doc, but I don't know if he considered it when he started me on meds."
150,I've gone to various doctors and gone through numerous medications to no avail.
151,I need to be armed with information about what to ask for when the topic of medication comes up.
152,"Please only answer if you are open-minded and have had experience or know someone w/ experience for adderall as a medication for anxiety and being a more productive, better person."
153,Does anybody know about this anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication?
154,"It's frustrating because I am not asking for a medication I could potentially become addicted to, I am just asking for something to improve my functioning."
155,"If I do, I'm just curious what medications worked for you guys, if any?"
156,Share your stories of what has worked for you medication or otherwise.
157,I'm on meds for this but I feel like they're wearing off.
158,"Because I don't want her to always rely on the meds and only take them when she needs them, but I have already told her that she needs to have them with at all times in case it gets too bad."
159,"In perfect world I would love to see her off meds and be able to not be bothered by all these things but I know that might not ever happen, which is okay."
160,I currently take depression medicine and am going to talk to my Doctor for anxiety medicine.
161,I'm currently off the medication I used to take but I am thinking I might need to go back on.
162,"Also, I obviously need a job to have money to pay for treatment and medication but until I get that, are there any medications I can get without a prescription for anxiety?"
163,"I am currently conducting some research (For my Postgraduate MSc HPaB Psychology degree) on Depression/Anxiety and I would be very, very grateful if members currently taking medications would take a moment to complete the survey in the link below."
164,"The broad goal of my research is to examine the different classes of anti-depressant medications in relation to side effects, specifically addressing the severity level, type and tolerability of side effects in relation to medication BNF classification (the pharmacological body which classifies antidepressants into categories depending on the primary proposed mechanism for how the medication works)."
165,"Personally I have tried to avoid getting medication, as I don't feel risking side effects is worth it."
166,I'm struggling with something normal people would find easy even with the correct dosage of medication.
167,"Although my medication has worked great for the past months i have been on it, i can feel the anxiety building and im worried ill suffer another large attack, im terrified."
168,I'm wondering if anyone else here has had minimal help with Valium and has had help from another medication like Xanax or something alike or if I should just stick to Valium?
169,"I'm out of meds, dads in the er and mom won't answer her phone and I have no idea what's going on and I'm in charge of two little siblings rn (asleep for now)


I.just.fucking.can't."
170,"Here's my background: I'm 19 years old, male, and I recently enlisted in the military (I've wanted to do this since a young age), I've never been diagnosed with anxiety or never taken any medication, I keep it to myself, never told anyone about it."
171,I've been on medication for the past several months.
172,"After a few days of trial and error with meds, turns out that just a little increase in my Zoloft was all it took to make me feel pretty much back to normal."
173,Im at the local library and my moms car broke down and i have no meds i dont know what im going to do
174,"So, here I am, not talking to anyone but my family and one single best friend, being angry and confused since I can’t find a way to be more talkative and not shy again (even though I am on Atarax, the medicine one doctor prescribed me to use against the anxiety, it doesn’t seem to help much so far)."
175,"We've tried counselling and medication, but we gradually lost hope in finding a 'cure'."
176,I am dealing with a TON of anxiety and derealization disorder (everything feels like im in a dream) and am trying feverishly to get meds that actually work.
177,Side note: I do receive profesional help and was diagnosed with a GAD and given meds just looking for support or someone similar I guess.
178,I've had to go back on medication...
179,I am currently on meds now plus birth control since I believed it was hormonal.
180,Anyways a little over a week ago I got really sick and bedridden for 3 days in which caused my anxiety to sky rocket because I never had to call out of work once (other than earlier this year when I first started due to getting bad attacks and to get put on meds to control them better) and I never sat at home that long before in a looong time either.
181,"(in which I think being bored is another trigger and with drinking coffee making me hyper and not knowing what to do with myself)

Also I did get my meds changed from citalopram to the generic of zoloft because of the attacks last week."
182,"Sorry it was a random post, but I would love to hear some opinions though :) I am okay now although a little zoned out due to the new meds."
183,I started taking meds again two weeks ago.
184,"I recently switched to an extended release anti-anxiety medicine, so I'm really hoping to get through this day with no attacks, or at the very least, few tears."
185,I take my medicine in the mornings and after about an hour I'm more stable.
186,Could it just be morning anxiety or possiblly medication related?
187,"She says her fear is of taking medicine that might make her want to kill herself, but I think it is also the anxiety of going to a doctor that prevents her from going."
188,Afraid of medicine but not herbs.
189,I'm not sure if the return (and subsequent worsening) of my anxiety is a result of becoming tolerant to the medicine.
190,"I know i need to seek professional help, ive been on several medications before everything from once a day pills like zoloft, paxil... shit its a long list and normally those end up really fucking me up."
191,We have begun to more seriously discuss medication as an option.
192,"The opinion of the professional was that meds could help, but doing as much natural remedies as I could before turning to them."
193,"He's on medication (Prestique), but has used alcohol as a crutch for too long."
194,I have been taking meds for about a month now and felt pretty good the last 2 days but today the scalp tingling is back.
195,And did medication help (beta-blockers in partciular)?
196,My boyfriend loves me to let me stay home and go to school again but he doesn't understand that I wouldn't be able to make it in the workplace even with the medication I take.
197,I am on meds to no effect I suppose and therapy seems insane and stressful to me.
198,I guess Im going to try to get some meds prescribed for the first time just for this interaction that lasts moments every day I work.
199,And I don't know how much longer I can go without my medication.
200,I'm generally pretty sensitive to medicine and this is no exception.
201,Anyone else have experiences with this cough medicine or any others?
202,"Before you mention it I've tried the medication route with horrendous results, Zoloft made me have extreme Akathasia, so much so I was almost committed, one of the worst experiences of my life."
203,"I feel like some of you go on about how it's the *only* option, but meds are a big no for me, and others like me."
204,How do you beat anxiety without meds?
205,I take meds.
206,It's a very sad way to live life and I am hoping the meds and meditation will help snap me out of this a bit.
207,I feel like I can't and won't set foot in an airplane unless someone drugs me so today I got some medication.
208,"I've got some questions that I hope someone might be able to answer:

- The doctor told me to try some medication at home to see what kind of side effects I can expect, so I'm thinking about trying one tomorrow."
209,I'm really worried I'll get to the airport and board the plane and realise that the medication isn't working.
210,"**Just** **some** **general** **info:**

21, Male

General anxiety, been taking medicine

Don't have anything that triggers it

**Symptom:**

I'm transferring to a new university for several different reasons and I don't know but one or two people there."
211,"This isn't the first time I've been in this situation, but regardless anxiety creeps in even with the medications I take."
212,I'm already on medication for depression (10mg per night) and on bc.
213,"If she's right, do you have any suggestions for medicine that will cause less damage?"
214,"Yesterday, I had accidentally left my meds at home."
215,"Hi Reddit,

So yesterday after having a bit of a break down, I realized I might have to back on my meds."
216,"I have anxiety/panic disorder and agoraphobia, which I have been medicated for and have overcome (which subsequently led to me stopping my medication."
217,I don't know what to do and I don't have much time to properly deal with the issues.... right now the only thing I can think of is going back on my meds and hope that I can manage it when school starts.
218,"TLDR; going back to school is making me feel depressed and bringing back my anxiety, wondering if I should go back on meds."
219,I was laid off from work a while ago and used up the last of my meds (prozac).
220,"The reason I am writing this is to tell you that your anxiety and panic disorders *can* be cured, and it doesn't require medication, or endless doctor/ER visits."
221,"I didn't want to deal with what had happened, and decided to take medication (zoloft, started at 25mg) and it seemed to take the edge off, but it never truly helped me."
222,"What about anxiety meds, is that something that can come about from starting here?"
223,"I sometimes wonder if medication would relieve this at all, but my mom is *very* much against me going on medication."
224,"I don't take any medications, or drugs."
225,My counselor suggested it because I want to try to get over my anxiety without and serious medication.
226,"I went to my doctor a few weeks ago to discuss my meds and she mentioned looking into getting a workbook as anxiety is one of the more 'managable' mental ""problems"" (sorry, not sure how to phrase it) and that workbooks can help find triggers and overcome them etc."
227,I never really learned how to manage the anxiety without medication.
228,"Recently, my symptoms have greatly improved with therapy and meds."
229,Recently I've started the process of taking medications for my anxiety.
230,"To the main question, how many medications must I try before I find one that doesn't cause me side effects?"
231,"How long did it take to find the right medication for you, and how did it improve your life?"
232,"Sorry if this question has been asked before, I'm just always leery of starting new medications (WOO, HYPOCHONDRIA!)."
233,Is there a medication (for daily use) that has been successful for you with anxiety?
234,I went to see a therapist and the intern (the person who gathered my info) said SA is usually treated with 50/50 medication and therapy.
235,I had no idea that it was my anxiety killing me so I never went to a doctor to get checked out hence never got any medications.
236,Tried some meds but the doc gave me this really weak shit that didn't help much.
237,"After a year of doc visits and multiple medications,  I'm turning to the collective wisdom of reddit, if for no other reason than to find some common ground."
238,"So far, my medications and effects have been:

Citalopram - Intensified the yucky mental feeling (anxiety?)"
239,"Wellbutrin - Seemed to level things out, but would still make me feel worse for a few hours after taking the medication."
240,"The first 3 medications I gave up after 1-6 weeks, depending on how shitty they made me feel."
241,"Second I'm on two medications already (Zonisamide for seizures, Concerta for ADHD) and this just sounds like it will counteract or cause some problems."
242,I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety six years ago and been on medication since that time.
243,"We don't know what caused it, but she was put on medication and discharged and hasn't had a seizure since."
244,I'm someone who is afraid of drug interactions and side effects so it's hard to find a medication that works.
245,"I just wonder if I'm better off seeing her more often and working through the cognitive distortions and unhealthy patterns on my own, which seems better, or taking the medication as well, even though it's not really ""me."""
246,"At this point, I've already taken my sleeping meds, and I'm still a bit dazed from an anxiety attack earlier, so while I'm stumbling groggily down the very steep steps whilst admiring the moon, I think I'm at the bottom of the steps, and stick my leg out, but I'm not at the bottom - In fact, I'm a good 3 steps away."
247,Wondering if anyone has had any luck with meds helping these kind of things OR anything that I should probably stay away from.
248,She's on meds for it but didn't get counseling.
249,"If this is all or mostly anxiety-caused as people are telling me, I both do and don't want to turn to the meds as the solution for the reasons above."
250,"I have been on two different types of medication since September, and I don't think the dosage is right for me yet but I won't stop trying."
251,"And if medication is not the right answer for me, that's okay, I'll try something else if it comes to that."
252,"My psychiatrist suggested I do this test that involves swabbing the inside of my cheek with a cotton swab and sending it to a lab where they run your genetics against the common gene that the meds are composed of (all are in a different ""class"") and it tells you that based on the make up of your body and the class of the drugs, which class of drug your body metabolizes normally."
253,I don't take any medicine whatsoever.
254,"I trust my doctor, but I can't help wondering if my different medications are reacting poorly with one another."
255,"I've been working for years with different medication, as I get closer to college,I just don't see how I'll be able to function in the real world or work place when I can barely make it through high school."
256,I've been on anxiety meds for a long time now.
257,Since the major reason for taking the legit meds is gone I'd like to get rid of them; the side-effects are still there and reduce my quality of life.
258,"I have been seeing a psychiatrist for a little over six months now, and she's been fantastic - as far as helping me to find the right medication to alleviate my anxiety and depression."
259,My psychiatric sessions focus solely on the efficacy of the medication.
260,"I've been on a number or medications such as citalopram, fluoxetine and pregabalin but nothing has worked."
261,"I have an appointment with a psychologist next week, but I know she can't help me with medication management."
262,"I need to have my medication adjusted *right now,* but it seems like no one can help me."
263,With this new look and lifestyle I began to realize how good I was feeling without taking my daily anti-anxiety medication.
264,So now that time has passed I'm wondering if I should/could stop taking any medication all together.
265,Is there anything I can do to ease the anxiety during the appointment if I don't have access to medication?
266,"I need to learn to start controlling them because my attacks are situational, and meds aren't really necessary at this point."
267,"Over the last few months, my doctor and I have been experimenting with different anxiety medications with little success."
268,"I'm getting tired of switching medications every 4-5 weeks, so I'm wondering first of all if anyone here has had success with this medication."
269,"Part of me wants to try medicine just to see if it'll help, but I'd rather try out some natural remedies."
270,"I don't have any medication to deal with this, or anything?"
271,So I've been off the meds now for over 3 weeks and have been doing pretty well.
272,I cannot afford therapy or medication.
273,I'm on medication for anxiety.
274,"You would probably tell me something about ""*It'll be fine*"" or ""*You have all your life before you*"" or even ""*There is medication for this*""."
275,I don't want medication.
276,"I know it's bad to continue to ignore such an issue, but I don't want medication."
277,"Unfortunately, I do not know what kind of doctors specialize in herbal medications."
278,Decided it might be best to totally abstain from all medicine and supplements to see if I just need a reboot of some kind.
279,"This was about 4 months ago and since I got out of the hospital I had been off medicine and kind of strolling along, trying to keep my head up and keep on keepin on."
280,"I developed a drinking problem after my boyfriend lied and left me for slutsherface and didn't see a way out, and I had refused medication all my life saying there was ""another way"" but needed a helping hand other than my therapist and took the pill route."
281,"I had no sex drive, before and during the meds after starting birth control in 2008."
282,I've had panic attacks my whole life and was treated with medication from 6th grade through early college.
283,Should I go back on the medication?
284,I thought it would of came back as the meds kicked in but still nothing.
285,"this might be a dumb question, but is there a definitive moment when i can truly know the meds are working ?"
286,ive never taken meds before so im not sure what to expect
287,I KNOW they suck and I KNOW how bad they feel to go through but fuck that we are all gonna get through this together without meds or doctor bullshit.
288,I'm currently on Lexapro (Cipralex in Canada) and I'm worreid about the sexual side effects of this medication.
289,I'm on my first week of taking medication and i'm already starting to notice these effects.
290,Last year I decided that I didn't want to rely on medication for this anymore and prompted instead for finding other ways.
291,I have been off Paxil for my anxiety and depression for a few days because my psychiatrist office and my insurance company screwed me out of coverage and no longer taking appointments and I ran out of meds a few days ago.
292,"EDIT: Also, I've never been to therapy, or been on any medication."
293,"The patient must go through a series of Cognitive therapy practices and medication must be supplemented to overcome these harmful thoughts."""
294,"I don't know how to talk to my doctor about pain medication, I've been taking tylenol extra strength and it only barely numbs the pain."
295,"I haven't been on any medication because I can't afford to go back to my doctor, and I really can't miss as much work as I have been."
296,Or is it okay to try this medicine?
297,"&gt; 
&gt; I've been on countless medications and few things have helped."
298,"&gt; 
&gt; I'm on medications now and they barely help."
299,My family and I determined it was caused by this medicine I had been taking for my acne.
300,I have been off the medicine for 3 days but yesterday the anxious feeling came back.
301,Will it take a little time for the medicine to get out of my system before I feel normal all the time again?
302,I'm so scared to tweak my meds.
303,This mostly went away after I started my meds until about a month ago.
304,Perhaps talk to my psychiatrist and switch meds?
305,I've been off my meds for a really long time- almost two years.
306,"During those two years, I was out of school and didn't really need the medications to help me through it."
307,"Well, I decided to go back to school this summer, and realized that I would need meds as well."
308,"I was worried that my doctor would judge me for quitting them, and wouldn't want to give me any more meds because I would stop taking them."
309,"She helped me get the medications that I do need, the ones I feel actually work for me."
310,I started a new medication and my appetite has completely gone away.
311,I know this can be a side effect of the medication and I'm hoping it will even out in a few days but... should I be worried?
312,I'm on meds (effexor) and have seen two separate psychologists.
313,I have nausea meds incase I do feel nauseous but I'm tired of constantly feeling sick and worried.
314,I haven't had attacks like this since 2.5 years ago before I started taking medication and the only way I had of dealing with it then was cutting myself.
315,Is it even possible to do without meds?
316,"I have been on meds for just over 6 months now and have been through cbt therapy, I would say i have a clearer direction in my life and a lot less depressed then before, but my anxiety is still a major problem."
317,"Due to a mix up at the clinic pharmacy, my medication wasn't filled and now i'm out."
318,I need that medication for my blood sugar and my anxiety meds are almost up too but now I'm afraid to go back to the clinic.
319,"Usual questions at first, what medications do you take etc."
320,I have been to the pharmacy many times to pick up medication and I never end up taking it because I am scared.
321,"I have read all the negative stuff, which is why I haven't started taking this medication for a while."
322,"Please help
Im not currently on any medication"
323,"I was able to deal with it when I was on anxiety meds, but I'm not on them anymore."
324,I have GAD and it was pretty out of control until mid-July when I went on meds.
325,Are there things the regularly happen because of the use of the medicine that I should be worried about?
326,"I have taken god knows how many prescription meds (Paxil and Wellbutrin, currently) and struggled through 10 years of therapy, including DBT, but I'm not doing so hot right now."
327,I cant remember putting the medication in or actually sitting there doing it.
328,He is really old and just started a new medicine so I don't know if it was making him feel loopy or what.
329,"The only time I go outside is to take the dog out (and chain smoke while we're out there) 

I feel like I'm unravelling everything I accomplished this year, and I know I should see my doctor, and talk about meds, but I'm too afraid/ashamed to even call."
330,I'm close to being off as my doctor and I thought it worth an attempt to get off medicine and see how that goes.
331,I was originally on medicine for anxiety.
332,I attribute this to the phasing down of the SSRI medicine.
333,I think I need to go back onto medicine and I want to switch to something different.
334,"I have no idea what options are available to me, I've tried for a couple years to get a grasp on this mentally, but that hasn't worked so in terms of help I'm looking to medication."
335,"And I'm not sure if this is a situation that deems worthy for anxiety meds, but I'd prefer not to have to take some medication that will numb me and not make me feel anything, although I'm open to anything that will help with any of these symptoms."
336,"and im no good with keeping up with meds long term, so SSRIs are out."
337,I'm currently unmedicated but I'm seeking medication in July (the earliest they could get me in).
338,I will no longer judge these medications.
339,"while therapy helped a little, i am starting to realize that it would be great to get a proper evaluation and try out some meds."
340,"What medications, or combinations of medications, have you personally found helpful for managing your anxiety?"
341,"I realize all meds are ""your mileage may vary"" but it's still nice to hear from people who have had success on theirs since often you read horror stories online."
342,I'm on two anti anxiety/ depression medications and they seem to help for the most part.
343,My mother has diagnosed anxiety and takes medication for it; but the level of anxiety appears to lessen with each generation.
344,I know that meds effect everyone differently.
345,"I'm just afraid of becoming dependent on these meds, especially Xanax as I hear it can be addictive."
346,I finally got on meds to try and help with my adhd so I can maybe finish college.
347,"I have not seen a Dr. Id really like to avoid medication if possible, however with the worse it gets I'm starting to not care about what they give me as long as they can make it stop."
348,"Like I lost my computer charger cable, I freaked out, and then my mom told me that if I didn't stop acting like a two year old then I would have to take medications."
349,But I don't want to take medications and I don't want to see a therapist and she doesn't want to pay for it or have to drive me to a therapist so I'm not going.
350,I'm on day 4 and I haven't felt exactly the same any of the 4 days I've been taking the medicine.
351,I've read it can take up to 2 weeks to start feeling a more positive effect of the medicine.
352,Or a psychiatrist who concludes medicine isn't a good fit because I'm fine most of the time and to just suck it up.
353,I have had anxiety disorder for roughly three years and have managed to get it under control (with very little use of medication) but every time someone starts talking about it I start feeling anxious.
354,"So far I've tried/had checked:

- Careful attention to diet (Low glycemic index foods, lots of vegetables)

- Heavy cardio exercise 3-5 times a week (3km runs and soccer)

- General blood tests (Vitamin and mineral levels, e.g - iron)

- Thyroid via blood test

- Testosterone levels via blood test

- A sleep study, to rule out sleep apnoea

- 3 years of seeing a psychologist (ACT I think, some CBT)

----

Yet to check:

- Adrenal function tests (Maybe that was already tested as part of blood tests, to be confirmed)

Anything else I should check before accepting the side effects I might get from medication?"
355,It's been well-controlled for 15 years with medication.
356,Did you change your meds?
357,"He also said that he would give me an anti sickness medication before I came round, and that it wouldn't make me feel woozy or sleepy."
358,I'm not on any medications at all.
359,I had a bad experience with benzodiazepines and it's put me off of the whole medication thing.
360,"On our very first date, he explained to me that he is bipolar and has pretty bad anxiety issues (on medication for both)."
361,"Girlfriend is leaving me because she can't ""be there for me"" through this positive process of change and growth I'm going through due to therapy and medication."
362,I have had anxiety attacks daily which are bad enough to warrant meds.
363,However the meds she likes to give me when I go through periods of extreme anxiety or depression just make me stupid.
364,"I finally found a medication and therapist  that works for me (the combo was a complete game changer), my life is 10 fold better and I know many of the triggers that can kick in this anxiety so I can avoid them."
365,"TL;DR - need over the counter medication to help relieve my public speaking anxiety, any suggestions?"
366,Anyways I wanted to ask could it be a side effect of the medicine?
367,"i've seen doctors, all who refused to refer me to mental health specialists and reccomended me antidepressants/anti anxiety meds which i am vehemently opposed to taking."
368,I have anxiety but I can't take meds.
369,"I barely made it 2 weeks, had a 4 day long panic attack (while on medication) that made me book and early flight and come back home."
370,No medication please!
371,I've tried to tell him he needs to go to therapy and get medication but he refuses to even entertain the idea.
372,I'm 30 and have been off meds and happy for years.
373,"Well a couple weeks ago, my endocrinologist tested my TSH levels and they were low (hyperthyroidism), so he changed my medication (increased metformin and decreased levothyroxine), then I proceeded to go on vacation and LEFT MY ANXIETY MEDS AT HOME."
374,All the meds I'm taking mimic some of the side effects of pregnancy and I'm sufficiently freaked every time one of them makes an appearance.
375,"I went through some meds, none did anything beneficial, a couple had mild side effects like sleeplessness stomach stuff etc., but nothing too bad."
376,"After trying three meds, my doctor decided to tell me I need to talk to a therapist about the problem and that she would not be able to help me further."
377,I went back to the doctor today for an unrelated illness and mentioned that I have not been able to call the therapist and was damn near accosted for not having done so and then she begrudgingly prescribed me a new medicine with the requirement that I come back to her in 30 days and having talked to a therapist.
378,What if medication doesn't work?
379,"I'm going in today for a therapy session, and then am being diagnosed soon and put on medication soon after that."
380,We made the decision that I'll try to control it on my own and not go on medication.
381,I decided not to because I feel like it will change who I am and I also don't want to depend on meds.
382,"So guys, I was wondering what medicines are prescribed and how dependent you are on them?"
383,(I stopped taking my meds because I feel better generally without them).
384,"I've been on and off anti-depressants and/or anti-anxiety meds for the past six years, each to varying effects: Paxil, Lexapro, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Effexor, Remeron, Trazadone, Abilify."
385,"I took the first pill last night, and it's my first experience with any sort of SSRI, or any form of medication other than aspirin/tylenol/etc."
386,"Now here's my question:
I'm going on a 4 day cruise in 10 days and am thinking I should stop medication until after the cruise."
387,"I'm not on medications right now and can't get on any for a few months at least, so I just have to figure out a way to deal with these I guess."
388,There's no shame in considering medication.
389,"Taking medicine turned my life around, find the one that's right for you, I tried three before I found one that doesn't make me hazy."
390,"It's been a while since I've had an attack (I don't take meds/I haven't discussed it with my family, so that's dumb on my part)."
391,I don't want to go back on my anti-depressents and I am already taking a medication for my anxiety that I love.
392,"I have never sought professional help for my anxiety, and although this is largely because my anxiety has prevented me from doing so, even when I've felt confident enough I've refused to seek help because I don't want to be put on medication."
393,"Surely if one has a mental problem, allowing your brain to become reliant on medication to correct it is just going to make it impossible to function properly without it?"
394,"I've never had any kinds of medicine or treatment for anxiety before, mostly because I'm too scared/embarrassed/proud to ask for any (which is stupid, I know), but I also didn't start noticing many problems with anxiety until July 2012."
395,"TL;DR Currently on Wellbutrin for GAD, what are your experiences/opinions; what other medicines (preferably non-ssri/srni) may help?"
396,I was on medication for about 2 months then stopped.
397,"I had been doing so well off meds, and now have had a lot of stress in my life."
398,"So here they are again, and I will resume my meds since they did work well."
399,"Recently started a new medication, which was very scary for me because I don't like taking things that I don't know what they will do."
400,"Even when I started this medication, my thoughts were ""How is this going to help?"
401,The medication is allowing me to get to a point where I have the resources to care for myself.
402,"For me medication will not be the answer, but it provides a door to a long tunnel to the other side of this mess if I'm willing to do the work."
403,"Now a couple of years ago, I started having extremely bad panic attacks out of the blue, to the point that I am now currently on medication (Lexapro) for it."
404,"They discouraged me from seeing a therapist/taking meds, but this isn't about them, this is about me."
405,"I've also tried Lexapro and Zoloft, but I'm not keen on meds and I got off them earlier than recommended (weeks.)"
406,"I'm not keen on meds for a few reasons, all of which are my personal beliefs and I don't mean to belittle or offend anyone on them."
407,Just in case: I'm not on any meds (aside from some pain killers for now) and I've never been diagnosed with anxiety problems of any kind.
408,I have health insurance that covers what I would need to see someone about therapy or medication.
409,"Girl in above story actually gave me some meds that helped her in similar situations (which again, I should focus on that she cares about me enough to try to help me instead of dumb phone shit) but I havent noticed any difference really."
410,I've had panic attacks all my life and I have been she people about it and taking meds.
411,"* - I used to eat very healthy and do a lot of cardio, but since my sleep meds has lowered my blood pressure I can't do cardio without fainting D: and I have been eating very bad unhealthy stuff lately."
412,"Coincidentally, this is how long I've been taking my meds (escitalopram, 10mg once a day)."
413,Could the meds and/or anxiety be causing it?
414,"I know this did not happen on its own, I did years of therapy, studying, and medications (I am no longer on.)"
415,Ive never taken any meds for my anxiety before and today was the first time I talked to somebody about it (except my mother).
416,"I took off last week to allow myself to adjust to the medication, but also because I was scared something was going to happen go me on my way to work... Now, it's 1230M, I'm supposed to go to work tomorrow and I'm profusely sweating and have myself believing something is going to happen if I go to work tomorrow...."
417,"A month before her graduation she began to take medications for the attacks- I don't remember which ones specifically, but there were two."
418,"She was on the daily medication for about eight months, and closer to our wedding she got off it."
419,She still has the other anxiety medication to take when the attacks get bad.
420,"The medication is helping, but full-effect is still a little while away."
421,I went on medication and it's been 4 months so I've decided to re-test.
422,Been on anxiety meds for about 1.5.
423,I don't want to take meds because I'm trying to get off of them.
424,should i get an anti-anxiety medication to help me sleep?
425,It's my first time taking any kind of medication and to begin with I was feeling very positive about it.
426,I know medication isn't going to be a miracle cure but I'd like to know how long it normally takes to kick in to see how well it's working for me.
427,"My doctor told me that a side-effect of the medication is anxiety, and I expressed myself probably a little too hostile-- ""NO, I don't need MORE anxiety, THAT makes me feel anxious, just thinking about it!"
428,"This is the first time I've ever been on any kind of medication, and I suppose it's a bit worrisome."
429,"Edit: just thought i'd add, I haven't been on any medication for probably a year now, and I've been a lot better."
430,I was going to a doctor and got some meds.
431,"i go to bed panicking i won't wake up the next day..  and go throughout my day checking my temperature with my thermometer i carry with me if i'm feeling particularly anxious about my temp..  (probably should stop doing that)..  

i have smallish pains in my body..  

i wonder how much of it is my head making the issue out and how much are actual issues..  i know a decent bit can be caused by anxiety, but i don't know how much..

my nurse practitioner told me it was okay i take myself off the anti-depressants i was on if they were making it weird..  increased panic and weird dreams = taking myself off..  

only thing is that's the 3rd time i've ""failed"" a particular class of medication, and she's told me that she can't do anything for me if that's the case."
432,Foundation of my therapy was samatha and vipassana meditation + cognitive behavioral therapy rather than taking meds.
433,"Met an amazing girl, made new friends, went on some trips - made the mistake of going off my medicine."
434,I am confident and hopeful that returning to my medication and potentially going back to therapy will help me get back into recovery.
435,I see a therapist and psychiatrist every month and take my daily medications every morning.
436,"I feel like i have the right tools through therapy and medication to stop the anxiety/panic but it just steam rolls over me.I try to read, go for a walk, talk to someone but it feels like if a panic attack wants to get me, its going to get me."
437,I am wondering if anyone has any advice for temporary meds with a short half life and minimal withdrawals to take during a withdrawl from venlafaxine .
438,"Well a few weeks ago,  the doctor decided to check my prostate, but instead of stick his fingers up my ass, he decided to stick a giant stick up there to take pictures of my prostate and bladder (Was not a pleasant experience) Well all came back normal and he said I have an overactive bladder and gave me this medicine to take for 2 months."
439,"I took an oxycodone to help ease it and am waiting for it to kick in fully, but I know it may not help the headache itself since different pain medication types work on different kinds of pain."
440,"Therapy and medication are not to be overlooked, despite the unfair stigma that may surround them."
441,"This past month he's been going to a psychologist and a psychiatrist because he decided that he wants to stop using medication (the Parotexine, which he has been using without any supervision from either a psychologist or a psychiatrist for about eight years now, I think)."
442,"I am on medication, so I no longer actively have outward panic attacks...but my fear inside is just as strong."
443,I pushed through it as I am not on any medication.
444,"Im not against taking medicine again, but im not exactly looking forward to it."
445,"I just started a low does of Lexapro (for anxiety, social anxiety and depression, may be adding more meds later but psych wants to do one at a time to see how i react) and I've had some side effects."
446,"I haven't been on anxiety medicine for a long time, probably for 5 years."
447,I think these are things that would make normal people freak out so I'm not sure if it's reason to get back on anxiety medicine.
448,"If I do need to get back on medicine I worry about the doctors appointment, hospitals and doctor offices stress me out and it embarrasses me a lot to cry with a room full of people in a waiting room, does anyone have any suggestions to help me out with that?"
449,"TL;DR: If I have a reason to have a lot of anxiety, do I still need medicine?"
450,"If I do need medicine, is there a way for me to not embarrass myself at the doctors office?"
451,I have trouble breathing and writing and I'm out of medication.
452,"Is it possible to try out anxiety medication without it ""rewiring"" your brain forever?"
453,"But also wanted suggestions of some meds that don't cause weight gain due to struggling with that from Paxil and finally losing all of that, I want to avoid it coming back."
454,"She is on medication, something along the lines of Prozac, and seeing therapy but I don't think she is completely honest with the therapist."
455,I used to be on medication for anxiety.
456,I have anxiety disorder and I've taken my medicine but it doesn't seem to be helping.
457,"When I first developed this anxiety I went to this doctor S. Doctor S prescribed me Ativan and a sleeping medication and sent me on my way, but he made me feel a little uncomfortable and I wanted to try someone new."
458,"I am moving out of state soon, I don't have the time to be trying new medicines like this."
459,"Last time I told him to please just let me start taking the prozac again, side effects were minimal compared to these new meds and it works."
460,I would like to get on a good medication now so I can think straight and sort this stuff out.
461,"This, by the way, is with the help of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication."
462,"Now I don't like psych meds and I don't like homone replacement therapy, so I started doing some research on my own."
463,I'm confused as to why I'm still feeling like this and why is it still so intense even when on meds.
464,"Do you suggest asking to change my meds, or have I just not stuck with the citalopram long enough??"
465,I'm hesitant about changing meds and it would feel like I'm starting all over again.
466,"I'm on meds, I've tried a million different types, I've been through countless hours of therapy and was even inpatient once in the hospital for behavioral health."
467,Last week I was told by my doctor that I could remove my daily dose of Buspar from my medications due to my new abilities to help control my anxiety.
468,"I was on this medication for years, so to be finally able to come off of it was a huge accomplishment."
469,"It's still a daily struggle, but coming off these meds is a big step!"
470,"However, I have talked about my therapist about the possibility of going on medication."
471,The option I was given was the kind of medication that you take regularly and the kind you take as needed.
472,that's just a guess off the top of my head) and am wondering if anyone would share their experiences with those types of medication.
473,"I'm a student of psychology at university and, particularly lately, studies have shown that cognitive therapy can be equally, if not more, effective as medication."
474,I've also tried 3 daily anxiety meds to no success as my body absolutely does not react well to changed in the serotonin levels.
475,2) For the meds - has anyone found good daily medicine to control anxiety outside of the serotonin inhibitor family?
476,I am wondering if anxiety medication could be useful for when I have these episodes.
477,"Technically, if I asked him ""I think I have anxiety attacks and I think anti-anxiety meds would help"" that is drug-seeking."
478,I feel the best thing for me is medication because I've been living my whole life with depression and social anxiety.
479,"Basically the point of this post is to get this stuff off my chest and also, how can I convince my mom to allow me to get medication?"
480,She is on a lot of medication and not eaten will obviously make her feel like that.
481,Did you try counseling + medication?
482,I was able to go without any meds and didn't have many panic attacks.
483,"i have anxiety as it is (it's normally manageable so i don't take medication for it, and it really hasn't been bad at all for the past few months), so right now it's through the roof."
484,"After 18 years of dealing with panic disorder I'm at the end of my rope so to speak, so I have found a place that focuses on functional medicine and getting to the root cause."
485,"I've posted about it again and again whenever I get anxious, and I've received feedback telling me to try medication."
486,But I was just wondering about medication and how it actually worked.
487,"But to give him and *myself* a piece of mind, I've been thinking about going to therapy and asking for medication."
488,Let me know your past experiences with the medication.
489,I have to get some kind of medicine or see some kind of therapist because my life is being controlled by this.
490,"Found out in my first visit that three meds I am currently on (two psychotropics,  and one to treat my migraines) all leach away Vit B's."
491,I don't want to boost my meds again.
492,Thank you if you guys know any medicine can help me.
493,What are your views of taking the medication Lexapro.
494,I am on medication for depression and have emergency medication for panic attacks/severe mood swings.
495,"Anxiety medication is the last resort (again), and I'm kind of hoping they end up putting me on some type of mild sedative, so I can at least do some type of work."
496,"I was beginning to feel like I'd gone in a kind of remission to my anxiety/panic attacks and depression, so I wanted to see how I'd do off medication."
497,"I've quickly realized I wasn't any better, the medication just suppressed it..."
498,"I need to know that if I'm going to be on medication forever, there's one out there that doesn't cause SO many long term side effects."
499,"I am calling my mothers social worker tomorrow to organise daily care for her, a social worker for my dad is supposed to call me tomorrow morning
and i will also call his own doctor to see if there is some type of monitoring that can be done, or medication to settle him."
500,"My tools, my medication, my stubborn attitude aren't enough this time."
501,"He then suggested that I can try Ciprolex, which he said about 40% of his patients suffer from decreased libido, but is also a good medication and much cheaper."
502,I spoke with my doctor about medication but I felt as if I would try to seek advice and counselling first.
503,Should I take more medicine that day?
504,Would pursuing drugs or medications be helpful or am I just being wishful?
505,I also don't have a lot of money to try to pay for therapy or medication.
506,"I know I can't get better by myself, but the thought of being on medication and having it not work scares me to death."
507,What else is there to do if no medications are able to help me improve.
508,The only medications I've tried seemed to kill my emotions EXCEPT for the anxiety.
509,He gets medication monthly.
510,"The only benzo that has relieved my suffering is Clonazepam, and I have developed a tolerance to that medication due to using it daily to help me get through my last partners suicide."
511,"The medication still works, but only at high doses (3-4 mg) my psychiatrist doesn't like the idea of giving it to me on an as needed basis because of its long half life, and while I understand the point he makes, it's also hard to accept because it was the only thing that helped me through my darkest moments and panic attacks."
512,But I just keep thinking man what in the hell would I do without my meds?
513,I want to give the medication at least a month but I don't want to be uncomfortable the entire time.
514,"About a year ago, I got prescribed escitalopram and thought 'fuck it - I've tried most other anti-anxiety medications so why not?'."
515,"Is it me, my failing relationship or my meds?"
516,"I'm not on xanax or the other medication thats for anxiety (I'm really sorry I'm such a noob at this, the meds that start with a C) and I'm trying to get an appointment with my psychiatrist and a therapist, but I really hate relying on meds to be ""okay""  

I feel really weak and pathetic because I need almost constant reassurance that things will be okay eventually"
517,I took it for awhile but eventually i kind of just started taking it here or there and it didnt really feel important since there was no proof it was a seizure and i hate taking medicines i think i dont need especially stuff that involves my brain.
518,Also i had just taken my anti seizure medicine before leaving for my friends house so i guess that rules that out.
519,2 have said it could've been the mixture of meds I was given after my car accident.
520,They never really found a medication that has worked for me.
521,A lot of side effects wore off as the weeks went by and the medication worked it's magic.
522,"For about a week and a half, after the meds had time to set itself, I felt amazing."
523,"I've been struggling with general anxiety fpr quite some time now, and I've been getting professional help without medication for the past year."
524,"For the first time, after getting my medicine, I have an anxiety attack and needed the xanex."
525,"I never thought my anxiety would get this bad, and xanex is an addictive medicine."
526,"My mom doesnt know I went to the doctor and got my medicine, but I feel better."
527,I started medicine recently but it hasn't been long enough to kick in.
528,"I lost my insurance and could not afford my medication, so over the course of a month-2 months, I halved my dose and then halved it again until I ran out."
529,I know as soon as I get back on my medicine I'll be fine again and I'm afraid of scaring off a guy I really like early on in our relationship.
530,"I got my approval letter for insurance, but my coverage does not start until March 1st so I can begin my medications again and get back on track, however that is still awhile away and I'm having a hell of a time in the mean time."
531,"My question is, has anyone else withdrawn from this medication?"
532,"Being the anxious person I am I've googled every horror story involving meds but I've gotten to the point where I have a lot of stress coming up (in med school, boards are in 5 months) and I've finally let my pDoc prescribe me something."
533,So being on the medicine doesn't bother me at all.
534,Im afraid of switching medication and it not working.
535,"I may take my medicine a few hours early and head to bed, or not."
536,I don't want to go off of the meds because they help so much and I'd rather be spacy all the time than be extremely depressed and have anxiety/panic attacks.
537,Over the years it kind of ebbs and flows but I've always been able to keep it together on my own and I had always hoped that I would never need medication.
538,"I'm not sure what - therapy, counseling, medications, whatever ..."
539,"At any rate, I was on some anti-anxiety medication (paxil and later, lorazepam) from the ages between 16 and 23 (I'm 27/m now)."
540,Originally I began medication because a friend of mine took his life when I was in highschool.
541,"I didn't want to go back on medication because I was slowly getting off of it, but I thought it was best."
542,Should I be going back on medication?
543,"I was thinking of seeing a psychologist, especially because I am very hesitant to use medicine."
544,Neither do I want to start on some meds.
545,Do you think getting medication can be a good start?
546,I don't know do meds for anxiety really work and change you or they are just blocking the symptoms or something like that...
547,I don't want to be put back on any sort of medication.
548,I had really slipped when things started to get pretty bad and then took a year off... came back this year and finally was diagnosed and on the way to get my meds sorted out.
549,I've been through different meds but never quite found the perfect one.
550,"I've been off meds for a year and a half after a terrible experience with desvenlafaxine, but now I've gone through a major life change and my symptoms are starting to overwhelm me again."
551,I think it's time to get back to meds for a while.
552,"Haven't done it since I went off the meds, but it always goes through my head."
553,"I also have ADHD but have decided to not take meds for that, since they made my anxiety worse."
554,"I've been seeing a therapist for awhile at a clinic, and she recommended seeing the resident Psychiatrist to get meds, so today I finally went."
555,I'm not on any meds other than Progesterone only birth control pills and the Ativan I just took when I got home.
556,"For this instance, its because her father is visiting and he hounds her about her meds and such."
557,"Fast forward a bit more (after my train breakdown incident and letting go of crappy ADD meds) I recall quite often, at night being in bed with my girlfriend and watching ONCE AGAIN the door."
558,My medical record was finally reviewed by a psychiatrist which then switched my meds completely.
559,First time taking this heavy of meds
560,I should've started weeks ago but I've got a fear of medication (I hate not knowing what reaction I could have with substances as I have an unknown allergy that almost killed me in the past.)
561,"My main fear of this medication is because my ""allergies"" are now so broad that I know that these pills will set me off, but my doctor has told me just to keep going regardless of what they do to me."
562,"Has anybody else experienced increased allergies as a result of anxiety, or noticed an improvement with medication?"
563,"I have never been diagnosed or treated, am I a candidate for medication (what about side effects, possibly with birth control)?"
564,Are there medications that I should flat out avoid?
565,I've finally come to terms with the fact that I need meds...for whatever reason it bothers me greatly to go on meds.
566,"I've studied psychology (just graduated with a degree in it, actually) and I know anxiety can be the same thing as diabetes; both can be manageable with no medication, but sometimes meds are necessary."
567,I'm terrified that any medication I go on will make me gain weight.
568,"After trying to cope with meditation and other methods, I feel as though I would benefit from seeing a psychiatrist and receiving some short lasting medication, and was wondering how medicine has helped anyone in a similar situation to me."
569,I know the dangers of becoming addicted to benzos etc...I just want to know how medicine has or has not helped any of you.
570,I sought CBT and took meds for this particular conundrum before but honestly just want someone to talk to that gets it rather than another terrified look and unnecessary apology for my situation.
571,"* I’d tell my other sister she needs medication for her depression

* I’d wear my diapers proudly and without fear

* I would fix people’s computers and bill them, for the obscene amount of money I deserve

* tell the CEO how much she hurts me when she bullies me

* be alone with my own brain for a day

* Have a conversation with a stranger

[update] In the light of day, some of these seem extra crazy (I should be afraid) and many seem like 'i could do that'."
572,"Basically I'm schizophrenic, and while my psychiatrist and care worker will give me help and meds for the psychosis, they don't seem to care about the anxiety attacks that I experience daily, and everywhere."
573,"I guess the point of this is do I need some kind of anti-anxiety medication, temporarily?"
574,"I try to do all the stuff I'm supposed to do to calm myself and change my thinking (therapy, changing self talk, mindfulness, meditation, medication, exercise, etc.)."
575,"Since I did that, I went about 3 days where the meds weren't seeming as effective, but that has seemed typical that every two weeks around the same time I'd have a few days like that."
576,"Now they're effective again but now I'm back to where the effects will fade over night and I feel okay, but I don't feel ""great"" until about an hour after I take the meds."
577,I know it's a side effect of the medication but it brought back that intense fear from anxiety that I'm dying and no one will know hecause I'm the only one who's awake.
578,So I'm wondering for those who suffer from similar situations what was your bodies reaction to the treatment/medication.
579,I honestly have no idea about any anxiety meds or anything...
580,I have meds but meds are meds (in other words I still feel this anxiety) &amp; I don't have enough ativans to keep popping them over the next 10 days or so.
581,I'm considering going back on meds.
582,"A giant part of why I'm anxious about seeing a psychiatrist is I've been misdiagnosed before, and been on the wrong meds."
583,I went to counseling for two years and on medication for two years as well.
584,I don't want to go back on medicine.
585,Number 10: people with ADD/ADHD like me that dont take stimulant medications NEED exercise!
586,"It's been about a year now on the meds, and my anxiety and obsessive thoughts have been basically null."
587,"Now, don't get me wrong, I'm totally supportive of her being on ADs and have never pressured her to change medications or stop taking them, because sex isnt important enough for me to make her stop taking something that makes her feel normal, and good."
588,"It's just something we talked about together, and she's considered changing medications because nothing else was helping her orgasm."
589,"Also, since she's on a higher dosage of Cipralex, would she have weird effects when changing her medication to something that's a little more libido-friendly?"
590,"So I've posted here before and thankfully have been helped out quite a bit and made an amazing recovery in a short span of 3 months from my anxiety(only took meds a handful of times ) and it was great, for that I will always be thankful to this subreddit, but today and the past three days I've been feeling these symptoms and would like an opinion:
New symptoms not present before:
-Pain in left arm (only began today) and it went away after a few hours, has not returned
-the feeling of something stuck in my throat permanently 
-my limbs go numb really fast when I sleep on them (never used to)
-very constipated(I get enough fiber and drink lots of water)
-my throat feels incredibly dry all the time even after a healthy dose of water throughout the day 
Returning symptoms:
-the feeling of my heart dropping in my chest 
-churning stomach as If I were nervous all the time
-shortness of breath

Last time this happened I had a handful of EKGs done and all looked fine, I'm keeping my meds and aspirin at hand when I sleep in case of emergency but this is driving me insane, I keep having paranoid thoughts of an impending heart attack."
591,"I'm worried about working tomorrow because I don't want to have to take meds while on the job, or if I will be allowed to at all."
592,"Only side effects have been some yawning, a little dry mouth but i can still wank and i still feel horny just takes a little longer but it's better as i was wanking like 5 times a day before

so ill hopefully give an update in a month too see where i am and how im going

also starting a nice execrise and diet program on monday to shed that 10kg's i want and get a sixpack for summer yew

feeling good people, id suggest trying medication for those at are afraid it may work for you so don't look for reviews online because if i listened to them i'd say nope wont work and wouldn't be enjoying myself as i am now."
593,"I'm not sure if the meds are speeding things along, or if I'm just THAT out of shape."
594,"Since that happened, I figured I would go and see a professional about medication."
595,"However, I have had this compulsive thought that I have obsessed over for about 3-4 years (I have been taking medication for OCD since kindergarten, same dosage, just fyi) and it is very hard to describe; I just keep thinking about how I don't get how I can move my body, like just all of a sudden I'm moving my body and I don't know how I am doing that, and then that makes me afraid that I am not going to be able to move my body or something and it just keeps on going like that."
596,Should I try to back off the Xanax and talk to my doctor about getting my OCD medication upped?
597,"Usual coping strategies:

* yoga 2-3 times per week

* relaxation exercises before bed

* setting small goals for daily progress (like, get dressed upon waking)

* adequate &amp; restful sleep

* taking my supplements daily (not currently on medication other than BC, which lessens my mood swings)

* planned social outings with a couple friends at a time (not spontaneous - I always know who, what, when, and where)

So my overall strategy is to focus on my thesis and get that done, but I've been having anxiety attacks every couple nights as I'm going to bed, and I won't get to sleep until 2 or 3am, which has created this cycle of sleeping in and then not being productive that day."
598,I have never been officially diagnosed but I tried out a few meds from a doctor with no luck a few years ago and tried a therapist.
599,I did a therapy and got daily medication (which I still take today).
600,"I have an ""emergency medication"" for those moments, lorazepam (I think in the US it's compareable with *Ativan* or *Orfidal*) but I can't take that every time I'm feeling striked by a slightly but constant panic-attack."
601,Anyway starting to feel like maybe zoloft/meds in general are not for me.
602,"I've been prescribed many other medications which had little to no benefit and I've seen several psychologists, social workers and psychiatrists, some better than others but none of whom who could ""fix"" or even really help at all with my declining mental state as the panic, anxiety and depersonalization pretty much took over."
603,"They prescribed me synthroid, and it put my mind at ease, knowing that finally, these meds will help this awful feeling go away."
604,I also really don't want to go on any SSRI's or anti-anxiety meds.
605,Except medication.
606,"Anyway is that unheard of, reduced anxiety due to taking anti inflamm meds?"
607,He said that he was on medication now and desperately wanted to reintegrate into society.
608,"And I really feel legitimately scared - even if he is now on medication and has his illness under control, I still feel that somebody who has committed such a severe crime is a danger to me and to other women."
609,He has recommend I go on medication.
610,The two medications of choice are Lexapro or Celexa.
611,"Now, I knew people who go on medication for anxiety+derealization/depersonalization+depression but I feel that I hear so much about those medications leaving the taker unfulfilled, with a void in their life."
612,"Here I am, no anxiety, no panic attacks, no medication, just a normal dude."
613,It's my first time being prescribed any sort of medication so I'm a bit skeptical/worried on what to expect.
614,Or is it just a fact that meds can only do so much when my head is full of screwed-up thinking that can't even be changed by understanding logic?
615,I should also mention that I can't see my psych until June 8th and that the meds she suggested I adjust over the phone haven't been working.
616,Should I seek out medical attention and maybe medication?
617,"I want to stop, but more than I want to stop taking the medicine, I want the ANXIETY to stop."
618,"I was first diagnosed and put on medication a little over 10 years ago, but I haven't been medicated for approximately 3 years due to lack of health insurance."
619,"I wasn't able to fight through it over the past few weeks to have my records sent from old doc to new one, and now I'm worried that the new doc won't trust me when I tell her what meds to put me on (because I already know what works and what doesn't)."
620,"I've never taken medication for my anxiety before (just therapy for coping mechanisms, it was very helpful overall) but I'm really considering making an appointment for that purpose, because I think my fear of losing this job may just turn into a self-fulfilling prophesy soon."
621,Hooray for medication!
622,"(Maybe I'm making up symptoms, what if medicine changes me, etc.)"
623,I'm diagnosed adhd and take meds for it and my significant other is highly introverted.
624,"A few years ago I was diagnosed officially with GAD, although I'm no longer on medication as it was too costly to keep going to the doctor's at the time."
625,I should mention I have ADD and was taking medication for that as well.
626,"Once DH got a better job and were doing better financially, I decided that I was sick of taking my meds."
627,"The doctors determined that the diuretics had taken a toll on her kidneys and she could no longer be ""aggressively treated"" for her water retention problem, and the hallucinations were due to her medication poisoning her."
628,"I have to be on medication for my ADHD before I start college next year, so thats extra money."
629,I want to know if I should up my meds or try something completely different.
630,I am considering meds to get me through but I just don't know.
631,"It got better, when I first got properly diagnosed by a then-new doctor and put on appropriate medication."
632,Ive been on meds of ADHD since I was in the 3rd grade and have been to therapy once before for masochism and anxiety.
633,I do suffer from depression and I take meds for it at the moment.
634,I have been a bit sloppy lately (bad sleep schedule leads to late mornings and outside of my routine taking meds is easy to forget).
635,I take other medication as well but theres no interaction there.
636,"Ive also tried benzo's without other meds and diazepam as well , same reaction."
637,"As of yesterday, back on therapy, and meds (I hate that I'm on them, but we dicussed that they are for short term.)"
638,Do people who have anxiety issues always seek medication or are there other ways of dealing with it?
639,A glass of water and medicine.
640,He upped my dosage of Lexapro from 10mg to 20mg and also prescribed this new medication in the title to take as needed.
641,"**

Anyone have anything to say about this medication?"
642,I am not on medications because my mom doesn't want me getting hooked on them and I don't have a counsellor to talk to.
643,It would also be helpful if you could give a brief description of your symptoms that led you to medication.
644,"My dad pretty much told me ""you shouldn't walk out of that office with some sort of medication""."
645,"If I tell him that a few attacks have arisen due to weed, will that impact an ability to get some sort-of medicine?"
646,Would revealing that weed has caused some (not all) of my panic attacks impact the possibility for some sort of medication?
647,For about 5 years now my doctors (I've moved around) have suggested that I take anxiety medication.
648,I've always refused medication.
649,I'm very afraid to take medication.
650,"Please, someone tell me that the meds don't make you numb."
651,**TL;DR** I'm afraid of what getting on anxiety medication will do to me.
652,"But recently I've discovered that my dad has anxiety too, and even was prescribed medication (my mom made it seem like it wasn't a huge deal) but after a while quit taking it because he ""didn't want to be propped up on it his whole life""."
653,"I'm kind of scared to talk to my family or friends about it because they all think I'm a pretty well adjusted, happy person....and I don't want to blind side them with something crazy like this and freak them out......I feel like I need to go to a therapist and maybe get medication or something."
654,But I don't know if there's any medication to deal with this kind of thing....and I really don't like the idea of medication but I'm not sure what else I can do.
655,"Truthfully, I was in a much worse place mentally when I was taking that medication."
656,Reassurance that its okay to give meds a try?
657,"I don't plan on being on the meds for an extended period, just until I can get into some counseling and get things under control, until I learn to deal with my anxiety."
658,Should I talk to my Dr about changing medications?
659,I'm also nervous about medication because I write music and I am afraid of what it will do to that.
660,I just wanted to point out the irony that adjusting to my anxiety meds has made me over the top anxious.
661,"I had started taking medication weeks before this and it has completely made my thinking worse, and how I feel about things."
662,"I panicked every single day and ended up texting her to remind her this isn't me, and it's the medicine that she even wanted me to take to help myself."
663,"All but one of my friends just say ""be mentally stronger"" or tell me how bad medication is for me."
664,Or should I try a different medication?
665,"He doesn't realise it but he's very naturally against mental illness or medicine/tablets such as anti-depressants, it's just kinda of sub-conscious."
666,"I'm seeing a doctor about it soon, i'm not on any medication currently and whether i need to be i don't know at all."
667,should i get medication?
668,I'm thinking now medication might be the next step.
669,I don't really know if I'm seeking advice on medication or if I just need to vent but I'm not in a good place today.
670,I don't like having to use medication because I think the cons outweigh the pros.
671,"I've tried everything so far except medication, I'm sick of wanting to stay home, not spending time with friends, my poor boyfriend basically has to beg for even a kiss because I just feel like shit."
672,"I stayed at my parents house for 3 days this past weekend and forgot to bring my medication with me, so the last time I took my pill was on Thursday night."
673,I currently do not take medicine to control anxiety as I have not had much success with medications.
674,This has been going on consistently through therapy and various anxiety medications for essentially as long as I can remember.
675,I've just been put (just over two weeks) on the meds but it's the first time I've felt hopeful.
676,I also plan on maybe getting medication sometime early next year if it continues.
677,I was curious if anyone has gotten medication for it and if it's helpful.
678,"At the age of 19 I was then put on Lexapro by my GP, then began seeing a psychiatrist soon after who continued me on the same meds."
679,"So, long story short, I want to get off of SSRIs and all medication."
680,I'm not currently on any medication but perhaps I should talk to my doctor about going on some.
681,A few weeks ago I started taking medication for anxiety/depression.
682,The first time I sat down to meditate after the medication started to kick in I was amazed…at how *freaking easy* meditation is now.
683,I feel like my life is not genuine when I am on the medication.
684,"I talked to my bishop and he said ""The Lord made medication to help us, this doesn't make you a weaker person""

My question and topic is."
685,Should us who need medication just accept the fact that we need chemical help; or should we find a way to deal with it sans medication?
686,About to start taking it and I've never been on any meds before.
687,If needed though I will incorporate actual anxiety meds but im currently optimistic that Passionflower and CBT will help me overcome anxiety.
688,"**NEEDLESS TO SAY**, DO NOT take with any other anxiety meds without talking to your doctor first."
689,"She did some simple tests on me to rule out further testing for brain MRI's as I thought I had brain cancer/tumor but this one doctor could feel my worry and concern and instead of prescribing me medication (as all docs before her did), she told me to buy this book that only cost me $3.49 from amazon."
690,I'm so terrified of being put on medication because I don't want to feel plastic.
691,"Can you think of anything, outside of meds (a last resort option for me) that I could do to try to resolve this?"
692,"I have been medicated, but then I get the thought process of ""I hate that I need medications to be normal."
693,I was just diagnosed with panic disorder and PTSD and started meds (a combo of very low doses of Prozac and Xanax) a few days ago.
694,"I've also been curious about trying shrooms, but don't know if my anxiety (or new medication) would get in the way of having a good experience."
695,"Anyway, since I started my medication my anxiety has been at an all time high."
696,"Anyway, I know the medication isn't fully in my system yet, I just worry about my anxiety being at an all time high since I've started taking it."
697,TL;DR when do signs and symptoms of anxiety start to fade with combined therapy and medication?
698,Doctors mentioned medication but I don't want to become reliant on a drug to regulate my mood (I know I smoke weed already but I'm gradually cutting this down).
699,I've been going to a local clinic to receive medication that charges based on income.
700,I was being prescribed a benzodiazepine by a doctor at this clinic but this medication has been blacklisted from being prescribed.
701,I'd like to continue this medication so I'm thinking of visiting a psychiatrist outside of this clinic who will continue my prescription.
702,"I know that psychiatrists charge per visit and I'm not looking for psychiatric counseling, so I'm wondering how often a psychiatrist expects someone to come in if they're just doing medication management."
703,"I'm guessing it depends on the psychiatrist, but I'd like to ask if anyone here is seeing a psychiatrist to receive medication and not for psychiatric therapy and if so how often are the follow-ups?"
704,"(if you want the link just ask) Is there some medication I can take that makes it just go away, and I keep my sex drive?"
705,"I have a history of GAD and am about 2 months into a new medication, could this be contributing to the symptoms?"
706,I was depressed for 3 years and took some medication to help me out of it.
707,I've been seeing a councilor and we've both agreed that medication was the next logical step.
708,"I didn't eat anything yet, just sipped water and took my meds as usual and something got me to the point of puking."
709,"The meds didn't work, well they did help with the anxiety, but so far the SSRIs I've been on all make me horribly depressed ... but hey they stop the panic attacks!"
710,I'm currently on NO medication because my last round of Lexapro wanted to make me kill myself.
711,"She has access to quite a lot of medicines to treat her autoimmune disease, so overdosing wouldn't be too hard of a thing to do."
712,"I was given a prescription for meds for my short term anxiety, and those have helped me, but I don't want to take them unless I absolutely need them since they aren't the long-term type of meds."
713,My partner wants me off the meds badly but I don't know if I shouldgo back on something to get some relief.
714,now its the 3d month and I don't feel that the meds are working.
715,"I'm not used to taking meds in the morning, so it's not uncommon for me to be sleepy enough in the morning to forget to take my meds before I head to work."
716,"I don't usually drink any caffeine, but I had one morning last week where I was literally falling asleep at my desk after forgetting to take my meds and so I grabbed a cup of coffee."
717,"I noticed that my anxiety was actually better than when I was on my meds, but it's kind of a sweet spot; too much or too little and it screws with me."
718,"I've noticed that the best combination is when I remember to take my meds AND I have about 2 cups of coffee, but the second best is no meds with 2 cups of coffee."
719,I have recently gone off my meds a month ago after 7 years on them.
720,"So a two years ago I went to a doctor that was recommended to me and I asked for anxiety meds, I got my prescription and came home and realized he gave me exactly 15 xanax - for a year."
721,"But he made me feel like a pill seeker when I asked for the meds, it's VERY difficult for me to ask for help, so I lived with it."
722,Is my body adjusting or should I talk to my psychologist about switching meds?
723,"I take medicine for it but of course, it doesn't always help."
724,"I am a little afraid to try other medicines, but I want to know, what should I look for as potential alternatives?"
725,Have any of you guys ever have something similar to this happen to you on any medication?
726,"I'm worried that if I take the Prozac I might have some nasty side effects and/or experience withdrawal if I try to stop, which is a concern as I really don't want to be on medication more than a year at most."
727,That way I can also continue to work on it with my therapist and hopefully be off of the meds sooner.
728,Or any other medication?
729,What meds would I most likely be given?
730,"Pregame: Honestly, I probably should have taken small bottles of liquor with me to take the edge of since meds are no longer a thing for me, but instead I pregamed with my crochet (like knitting)."
731,"I don't know what's worse, the idea of losing him for his own mental health or the idea of admitting that I'm a worthless piece of shit who needs mental help and committing to a lifetime of heavy-duty medication and being a zombie."
732,I've been in therapy but I always refused medication when it was suggested.
733,"I was assisting in surgeries, euthanasia, office work, janitor work, grooming, animal care, medication dispensing, and going to multiple unpaid meetings."
734,I can't afford therapy and I can't afford anything but Anxiety medications from my general dr and they just make it SO MUCH WORSE!
735,I've never taken anxiety medication because of this.
736,"I decided that I don't like feeling so drowsy and out of it all the time, due to the medicine, and wanted to stop taking it."
737,"My anxiety is at a phenomenal level, one that I have not even experienced ever prior to taking this medicine."
738,"I believe I'm psychologically addicted to it because once I start experiencing this sheer panic of having a seizure from stopping the medicine, it subsides a second after taking my dose, and I know the medicine doesn't work that fast."
739,"I told her I wanted to go through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, not be on any long term medication after she tried pushing an SSRI on me, and even after me telling her this, she prescribed this medication ""just to take the edge off while I'm doing the therapy."""
740,"I am going to be put back on medication soon, and thinking about it terrifies me."
741,I've never had a good history with pills or any sort of medication.
742,The rare times I could visit my Dad he would take all the medication and flush it in one go since he doesn't believe in medication.
743,"My friends all said that it wasn't healthy to mess with my medication and constantly be going on and off, but none of them had any problems (or so I had thought), medication, therapists, so I would get in arguments and have breakdowns."
744,After faking a happy act for a while I was taken off of the medication when I was barely 12.
745,"Two months into the school year and I had begun to form very unhealthy eating habits (skipping meals and binging later, restricting), but my Mom thought that the medication was really helping me, when I was really the acting classes I took after school twice a week."
746,"Every little blob was disfigured in a bright colorful palette that made it burn to open my eyes, I felt like it was some sort of lucid dream, someone had messed with my medication, no I threw away my medication this morning."
747,But I'm about to be put back on medication soon.
748,"I no longer use pain medication, sunscreen, commercial toothpaste, or anything weird to ingest/ put on my body."
749,I was in charge of one of the many hotel rooms and this dog usually gets medication with this meals (in the past some supervisors usually take his dinner and put in the meds) well this dog went swimming earlier so he wasn't allowed to get his dinner until later.
750,When the time came to feed him I was wondering if my supervisor had given the dog his meds because he didnt get fed yet.
751,"So I went over to the meds sheet and read it, and I read it wrong."
752,"I thought the dog had not gotten his meds, so my thought process was:

""Okay he gets meds in his food."""
753,"He said he already gave the dog the meds without food and came running in the room, he then showed me that I had misread the medication sheet."
754,Its like my brain completely failed me because even if the dog actually didn't get his meds ITS NOT MY JOB TO GIVE THEM.
755,"Late November, I finally decided it was time to try out medication."
756,"But really, to think I may have found the right meds so soon alone makes me joyful."
757,"A few months ago I switched to a new medication, mirtazapine."
758,Now on this new medication it's making me feel panicky.
759,"It seems like I've learned to control that better now - thanks to meds, therapy, and my girlfriend."
760,"The appointment went great, my doctor prescribed me some meds to try and we headed back home."
761,"If I had to put a number on my anger and irritability before any meds, I'd say I was a frequent 8/10."
762,"After starting on meds, an often 6/10, and sometimes 8/10."
763,"She refuses to try medication and never did the ""homework"" given to her by her therapists (ie."
764,"I am in therapy &amp; on medications, and have recently been reading about Buddhism, since I need something more."
765,"MY ONLY concern is that she doesn't get put on all these medications her whole life, i am very much against long term usage, if she needs to take whatever medicines for a few months, i'm okay with it, but i don't want her on anxiety or depression pills her whole life, its not curing the problem, its just masking/numbing it."
766,"I have an appointment with a psychiatrist for next week, but I don't think any non-medicine things will make a difference."
767,"I go to therapy, and I take psych meds for my anxiety and other mental illness but I also drink passion flower tea and it helps when my anxiety is so bad that my body just feels ""off""."
768,"Edit: As well, I'm 22 and no longer taking medication or attending therapy."
769,"However, after some bouts with meds and some years, I've leveled out about as nicely as I can hope for."
770,When I first saw a doctor for anxiety I was prescribed Celexa (20mg) and given clonazepam to take as needed until the meds kicked in.
771,I'm going back to my doctor soon and want to ask her about some medicine combinations.
772,Once I go back to work I won't be able to return to the doctor every month to adjust my dosage or the medication I'm on.
773,TL; DR- The medications I've been prescribed thus far have been limited in effectiveness but have crappy side effects.
774,Before going back on my meds my resting heart rate was between 95bpm-105bpm and everyday was an anxiety fulled nightmare.
775,"Now that I've been on my meds I am able to function and go out and do things, and my resting heart rate is between 75bpm-85bpm."
776,I was just wondering if it's normal or ok for a persons heart rate to have that much of a change with just medications.
777,I know 5-HTP isn't a 'real' medication like SSRIs but it's my last line before I approach a doctor for them.
778,"I realized that over the course of several months of being on this medication I began to stop answering my friends text messages, stopped becoming enthusiastic about anything, and my interest in anything was very slight at best."
779,So this is why Ive decided to stop taking my medication.
780,"Im nervous to try new medicine, but i really need to get a hold on my anxiety before i go back to college."
781,"I am a pretty anxious and neurotic person as is, but due to some bad experiences with medication in the past, I've tried to find non-pharmaceutical routes to dealing with my anxiety."
782,"Now, the psychologist who did my ADD testing simply recommended a stimulant medication (adderall, vyvanse, etc.)."
783,"I feel like the medication is the only thing that could potentially help my attention defecit, but i don't want to have to go through more panic attacks if i have to."
784,"To get to the question, can anybody with anxiety here take a stimulant medication without it triggering a panic attack or making your anxiety worse?"
785,"I have taken a friend's ADD medicine during high school (i know, i know) before my anxiety began, so i know what it feels like."
786,"It doesn't affect my day to day life like my panic attacks did, so I'm wondering if it's something just associated with my anxiety that I don't need medication for exclusively?"
787,"**


I've suffered from anxiety since I was 17, exactly the time I was taking anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications for my mental issues at the time."
788,"Before taking the medications, I was perfectly fine when it came to anxiety and never, ever suffered from a panic attack."
789,"I can't take medication for it and even if I could, I don't want to have to live off of medication for the rest of my life in order to function."
790,I only left to do groceries and pick up prescriptions and medications.
791,"I'm not sure if my recent spike in general, constant anxiety is due to a increase dose of medication or what."
792,"I finally decided to accept medication, and I have been on cipralex for about 2 months."
793,I rejected the idea of medication because I didn't want to believe I needed it to be happy.
794,"Not just medication, but in anything that offers you some kind of peace."
795,Do i need to consult and doctor and take meds?
796,I took a medication named Risperdal for 3 months.
797,The last time I took the medication was match[march] of 2013.
798,"I am unmedicated due to my mom not wanting me to have medicine, because of a suicidal almost attempt thing."
799,"A bit of background, I'm at 20 year old male who's a third year college student, I'm not on any medications and nor do I want to be."
800,"Trust me, I am seeking the right kind of support, I've been on dozens of meds and I am still figuring it out."
801,"Nothing feels okay, I've been seeking different forms of treatment for years and nothing has paid off, not even medicine."
802,I feel like medicine doesn't help me.
803,Effexor worked great (only noticed a bit more sweating) and I took that up until about 5 months ago when I decided that I wanted to try living without medication.
804,More recently: My anxiety is not nearly as bad as before but I still often get that sick feeling when I go out with friends so I had my doctor prescribe me Klonopin at .5 mg to take as needed because I wanted to try everything that I could before going back to taking meds every day.
805,"My ADD medications were not helping me focus anymore, they only helped combat the tired feeling in my head."
806,After reading some of the side effects I became really anxious about taking the medicine and am now having second thoughts.
807,"** The puppy and it's owner have recently been abroad on vacation, and because of a tapeworm called Echinococcus Multilocularis, there's a whole regimen of medication you need to give the dog at a vet's within 5 days before departure - and then when you're abroad (again, at a vet's) if you're gone for more than 5 days - and then *again* within five days after you get home."
808,"**The owner knows I'm a hypochondriac,** so I usually just ask her about these things (I've had a lot of dog related hypochondria scares), and she'll tell me what the dog has done, what vaccines it has, meds it has taken, and so on - but what if she hasn't followed the tapeworm medicine regimen?"
809,"I went off my meds (Cymbalta/SSNRI), and I feel good about that decision because I'm meeting the ""demons"" that cause my issues head on, and no more side effects, but I'm beginning to wonder if I'm really strong enough at this point in my life to live without them."
810,"He is on medication with some improvement, but anxious feelings and attacks persist."
811,"I was in therapy (cognitive behavioral, no meds) for around a year but haven't been seeing anyone recently."
812,At the moment it's reasonably managed with medication.
813,I currently take depression medicine and am going to talk to my Doctor for anxiety medicine.
814,I'm in pre-medicine so it's a lot of work and competition.
815,"I was put on Zoloft (100mg I believe) for that, but then I was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and was given medication for that as well."
816,I told my therapist I didn't want to up my medication (10mg lexapro) until this term is over.
817,"I politely declined every offer and tried explaining the anxiety was getting worse, and I'd been taking the medication as prescribed."
818,My medication runs out in almost a week.. and I'm freaking out.
819,"Just before i jump into my story when i say self medicate i mean i am using the anxiety medications i was prescribed from 1-2 years ago, now."
820,"I have 2 months until the course, 2 months to entirely stop the medication, 2 months to improve myself as a person and 2 months to decrease my anxiety by doing exposure type therapy, good luck to you all with anxiety, i wish you all luck, anxiety is such a motherfucker but the fact that you are seeking help simply by looking on this forum means you are TRYING."
821,And I really don't want to take any meds unless absolutely necessary.
822,"He didn't prescribe me medication but encouraged me try some tricks to help with my anxieties.If I get prescribed, what medications work for you guys?"
823,"i currently don't have health insurance so meds/therapy are out of the picture, and i would much rather use techniques and natural methods to help my situation."
824,I started aggressively trying to treat my anxiety/depression with the help of some medications.
825,I've been off my meds for a few weeks because I haven't been able to get an appointment with my doctor and I haven't seen my therapist in months.
826,"I get too worried about taking medication the first time to try it in private, and don't really have anywhere I need to go right now."
827,"I'd love to go back on meds, but I'm terrified they'll make me gain weight again after months of very difficult work of trying to get the weight off for the wedding."
828,"It seems like any medication for panic attacks takes awhile to kick in, and by that point the panic attack is over."
829,I am considering switching medications and I am wondering if anyone thinks that I am making too early of a decision.
830,"It just goes to show that sometimes hard work, a good support system, a therapist, and medication (looking at you Xanax &amp; Wellbutrin) can get you through even the darkest of days."
831,"So far we've gone over medication discussion, healthy eating, relaxation."
832,"I've read a lot about how people don't get relief without medication, and it worries me that I won't ever get better."
833,I took my meds and am now sitting in bed.
834,"Treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Northport generally includes prescription medications, often in combination with psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy."
835,"Anxiety disorders are often treated with SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medications, such as Zoloft or Prozac."
836,"Benzodiazepines are often effective in providing short-term relief from anxiety symptoms; however, they do carry some risk for dependency and addiction, which physicians must take into account when prescribing these medications in Northport."
837,"Benzodiazepines as Treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Benzodiazepine medications are commonly prescribed in Northport as part of treatment for generalized anxiety disorder."
838,"In fact, four common benzodiazepines--- alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan) --- are among the top 100 most prescribed medications."
839,"Although not everyone who takes a medicine like alprazolam is necessarily going to become dependent on it, physicians in Northport generally take these risks into account when prescribing them."
840,"I get as much sleep as I can (lost my sleep meds, a couple nights of hell)."
841,"I've tried probably 20 different medications, most of which have fucked me up more."
842,"And even if I get medication, there's the potential of going through a fucking medical laundry list trying to find something that works."
843,I just started taking medications.
844,I think that this could be because of the medication and maybe it literally one day just kicked in.
845,"Because of my medication, not I can."
846,"My whole life, I couldn't fathom how to control my feelings and with this medication I finally can."
847,I've only seen life full of anxiety and I guess maybe I had REALLY bad anxiety and now the medication is making me normal and who I am.
848,Is my medication just kicking in and is this a great success story?
849,I have been having to rely on my medication.
850,"The medication is working, but it's a short term effect.."
851,"Is there any medication that works in the long term that you take, that you think I should ask my doctor about?"
852,"I see a therapist weekly but I feel like I get nowhere without medications, and even then, I don't notice any progress."
853,"I have Health Anxiety, so of course I googled up the medicine, even though I've taken it before, in fact, earlier this year."
854,How can I calm down and take my meds?
855,I also started meds (Pristiq) just yesterday.
856,Thankfully with the help of medication I was able to get it under control.
857,I've reached a stage where I'm extremely dependent on the medication to even get tired at night.
858,So the question I have is this: Has anyone encountered medication for anxiety which doesn't have effects on your sleepiness?
859,I'm already on a low dose of depression medication is it better to ask my doctor for a acute anxiety medicine like Xanax or try other coping methods for the attacks?
860,However I got my diet under control and got a started on some meds.
861,My anxiety is recognized by my primary care physician and I'm on medication.
862,It has existed before and after my medication.
863,I'm off meds now and stopped seeing the therapist I saw for 4 years.
864,I began a D supplement and thyroid meds.
865,"I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's, then needed more thyroid meds, then adrenal fatigue, then Epstein Barr Virus, and that's likely not the end of it."
866,"She told me to take my klonapin, but because of my issues, I HATE medications and will avoid them until there is no other option."
867,I just picked up my medication and I've never had it before.
868,I know never to mix the two but with my problem I want this medication to help as soon as possible
869,"I have been irritable, unreasonable and weepy for about 3 weeks now (I was on the medication for 9 weeks before I quit)."
870,"Anyways, medication sounds like it could be a good idea."
871,I am not currently on any meds due to only recently having started with my health professional and I have been given relaxation techniques but I find myself worried over my work and my job and providing for my wife and baby.
872,"I thought I would share my experience with my medication in the hopes that it may help someone, or at the very least resonate with people."
873,"Obviously medication isn't for everyone, but it definitely saved my life."
874,Hate being dependent on medicine to keep me rational.
875,Back on meds but not Paxil.
876,Came off meds.
877,I'm back on meds.
878,She is on medication for it.
879,"Anyway I post again asking for any assistance, I've had it recomended to me to try to come off of paxatine to try new medication, but paxatine is well known as a heavy side effect drug to come off of, I've lowered my dose from 40mg to 30mg and am alredy feeling like hell."
880,I bought some generic Tylenol Cold Multi-Symptom Daytime and Nighttime cold medicine.
881,"I started having chain panic attacks shortly after my first dose, and they lasted for hours until the medicine finally wore off."
882,"It didn't take me too long to catch on that the meds must have caused it, so I looked up the ingredients."
883,"Some side effects are worth researching, and I'll be sure to check out the ingredients in my replacement cold medicine prior to purchasing for sure."
884,It's completely infeasible for me to meet with a doctor to get any kind of meds.
885,Later this month I will be going to see my old psychologist and looking at medication for the first time in four years.
886,The people at the place I go to have told my mom that medicine is an option that can be discussed later.
887,Can medicine help me?
888,"And no meds, no way of getting them."
889,I waned off both the meds and therapy only to find myself back drowning in it as soon as college started.
890,"I got back on the meds and I've been completely fine, until last week."
891,"Hey everyone,

As per my doctor's recommendation I'm slowly weaning off my medication that I've been on for +/- 10 years (Paxil 40mg), to be put on another medication, and I was wondering what kind of things to expect (physical sensations, moods, etc)?"
892,I hope the medicine helps soon.
893,She has gone to see psychologists and psychiatrists and she is currently on a few different forms of medication.
894,"Male, 20 y/o, no psychiatric diagnoses/medications."
895,"She told them she takes klonopin and paxil, which are, if you don't know, anti-anxiety and anti-depressant meds."
896,"She's been on some form of anxiety medication (she won't tell me what it is) for about a week, and I like to think it's getting better."
897,I told my boss I was on prescribed medicine before I took the test.
898,"To be honest, I am quite scared of taking a medication that is going to hide or change my emotions."
899,"Also, I don’t want to become dependent on this medication every single day (for the rest of my life) to have a happy life."
900,I am prepared to stop so that I can get used to my new medicine and so that in four weeks my doctor can make a clear evaluation.
901,Should I have to worry about smoking while on my medication?
902,"I know that serotonin syndrome is a risk in combining these meds, but doc says it is very minimal and I would be slowly increasing the amount of Elavil I'm taking daily until it was at an ideal level for me."
903,"With therapy and medication, I've come to realize that those kinds of thoughts were caused by the anxiety, and were not an actual reflection of reality."
904,I was just diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and told my job I was having a hard time with medications.
905,I knew at the time he had anxiety problems and was taking medication from it.
906,"He told me a bit about is problems, but since he was on meds, symptoms were never really an issue."
907,About a month ago he told me that he felt really confident and that he decided that he was happy enough that he didn't need his meds anymore.
908,I'm destructive to those around me; when i'm off my meds i just cant control.
909,I know that since he is only recently coming off his meds (been coming off for about 8 weeks now) he may be suffering from withdraw.
910,I'm taking meds for depression an anxiety and that seems to be going ok.
911,"Problem is, when I was given a 3 month dose, I went to a different place for my medicine for convenience."
912,Anyone have this sort of problem with generic medicines?
913,"I've always had sleep-related issues (difficulty maintaining sleep, 7/8 wakings/night), but I've never taken specific medications besides melatonin."
914,"Meanwhile, Mum's sister has been diagnosed with depression and has been on therapy and medications."
915,"She's getting worse, she's becoming incapable of dealing with her life, and I just want her to be her old capable self, or at least learn some coping techniques or find some medication which could help."
916,"I realize that I should speak with a psychiatrist --and trust me, I will not take medication without the assistance of a trained professional-- but I was wondering about my fellow Redditors experiences with Lexapro..."
917,"I've never taken any meds since then, other than birth control."
918,"So recently I was taking some medication and while on the medication I was experiencing eye twitches(standard side effect of the medication) and the occasional muscle twitch in my arm, doctor said that was caused by tiredness."
919,I don't feel like I need therapy or meds on a general basis as I am still functional.
920,"I have been on meds since November, but I am still feeling suicidal."
921,"I have been agoraphobic with panic disorder for 23 years (agoraphobic on and off, the last 6 years on) and although I do have a doctor for meds for anxiety, I have not had therapy in 7 years."
922,I'm 24 and haven't taken medication before for any of my issues.
923,"I wasn't doing great, but I was a bit better when I was on medication, seeing my doctor &amp; a therapist."
924,all this happened when i started medication and therapy.
925,I can't tell if I'm just worry way to much about things or if I should call the doctor and get some medication.
926,"I have an appointment this Friday to discuss the medication with my GP, but I'm curious if this is normal or not?"
927,And I've been getting headaches and intense dreams after finishing up the meds.
928,Back then the medications for anxiety were in their infancy and not covered by insurance.
929,&gt;(Now of course the medication available for mental illness are a godsend.
930,"I will state that not everyone with a mental illness has access to either therapy or medications, which I believe is a crying shame."
931,"Remembering to get Pollux's medications refilled on time, not to mention getting him to not vomit up said medications."
932,&gt;So I talked to our doctor and was given a short-term medication.
933,But it bought me time and gave me relief enough to do some research into other medications.
934,"**As an aside, I won't be mentioning the specific medications, as every person's body chemistry is different."
935,&gt;Shortly thereafter we (our doctor and I) started playing with new medications.
936,The first long-term medication we tried actually made me depressed as a side effect.
937,We switched to another medicine that night and suddenly I felt like myself again.
938,"I work in a group home for people with intellectual disabilities and when giving meds we have a 2 hour window to do so (so if it's an 8pm med then you have from 7 until 9), if it's outside the window you get a med error."
939,Basically in the dream I had waited until the last minute to give meds so I had 15 minutes to do the meds for the four individuals.
940,At one point I was yelling at them to turn the lights on so I could read the medications and pop them in the med cup.
941,So after I got up and turned the lights on and went back to doing meds I started to hyperventilate in my dream.
942,"Then, in the fall of 2013, I started trying out different meds, to see if I could find one that worked better for me."
943,"So how this relates to meds: Leaving the hospital, the doctors wanted me on no narcotics."
944,"This is pretty rough considering I had loads of broken bones -2 burst vertebrae, 2 broken vertebrae, 4 broken ribs, cracked manubrium, broken ulna and radius- and am now off opiate pain meds."
945,**UPDATE:** I ought to add that BuSpar isn't my first medication.
946,"Ive been doing well with them lately, ive noticed that once I have tappered off my meds (Paxil and Xanex) that the severity of the panic attacks have gone down."
947,"I really want to try anxiety meds again, but I know I did not trust myself with them 3 years ago."
948,"I'm on medicine for my anxiety, effexor XR, and it's working pretty well for me."
949,"I have tried therapy, medication etc."
950,As my education is being effected now I decided to go on medication and using beta blockers is probably a place to start.
951,"everyday from there out till today id wake up and have crappy thoughts and feel crap, feel sick in the stomach and vomit and go to the toilet all the time ""Number 2"" on Saturday and Sunday i would fell amazing and normal so i always looked forward to it, however i did not seek help because i thought what i experienced everyday was normal as it runs in my family and my dad and his dad has it, other symptoms i get is freezing feet, always tired, horrible memory, horrible concentration, and always think something bad iss going to happen eg, house burn down :Z.

anyhow i am now 19 and seeing a therapist and started taking Paroxatine 14 days ago i have yet to see any improvement but i know medication takes time 6 weeks at least."
952,"i have come to terms that my anxiety will not go away i am just hoping that the medication at least aids in the severity of it, and the therapy gives me techniques on how to deal with it which therapy is all about."
953,"I had panic attacks, but I was still able to deal with every day life, and I attribute that to my medication."
954,The week between the two medications was crazy.
955,I want to get off my medication because I feel like I could do better in school.
956,I want to get off of my medication but I don't think I can every be in a romantic relationship without it.
957,"and
Do you think it is smart to get off my medication if it is clearly helping me deal with everyday life?"
958,I'm wondering if medication could be the best option for now.
959,I just don't want to visit a doctor and tell them I just want meds because I don't have time for therapy... That seems a little sketchy.
960,"For those of you taking medications, could you share your experiences?"
961,How can I talk to my doctor about taking medication without seeming like a potential drug abuser?
962,"It's been treated on and off since I was 12 or so, first just the symptoms-migraines, dizzy spells, etc., but I was finally diagnosed and got appropriate meds around age 30."
963,My SO is super supportive and was pretty much responsible for my finally getting the right doctors and meds.
964,Should I get my meds adjusted or changed?
965,"I told my friend about this though and she was making a big deal out of it asking how do I know that it's from the anxiety and meds, it could be something serious and I need to talk to my doctor because even if it is a side effect, it's a serious side effect."
966,"I'm pretty sure it's maybe more apparent because of the meds and as my ""issues"" have gotten more serious, I've become a ton more anxious."
967,"And if so, what medicine do you think would work for me (if the Concerta is part of the issue)?"
968,"I'm also wondering about your guys' medication stories--BuSpar, ADs."
969,"I'd love to do it without medications, but I feel like I might be in too deep and too afraid of too much to be able to re-integrate into a social life without crashing and burning."
970,Did medication help you?
971,"Thanks for taking the time to read this :)

A little background, I've dealt with anxiety/panic attacks since I was 10 years old, I've learned how to manage it on my own without any medications about a year or so ago, still present but have the skills to calm."
972,I finally broke down and decided to try medication for my anxiety.
973,"My mom in particular keeps telling me how worried she is about me, and how she wishes I was on medication so she could feel better."
974,"They're all convinced that lexapro wasn't for me, and I need to keep trying different medications, but being on lexapro was such a frightening experience I don't think I can ever go on medication again."
975,What have your experiences with medication been like?
976,I know it's probably too early to tell but I just hate wasting time on medications when I feel like such crap :(
977,"I have taken Kavinace and it done wonders last year for me, for a herbal medicine alternative."
978,I have been prescribed multiple anxiety medications as well but have yet to get past my problem.
979,My attention never improved with the medication.
980,I chose to stop taking the medication after a few months.
981,"I started 20 mg Viibryd 1 month ago today, after over 10 years of unsuccessful treatment, over 7 different medications, and almost no hope remaining in my soul."
982,"I am open to taking medication, but a little nervous about the idea as well."
983,I took those meds for about an entire month out of fear of getting more anxious.
984,"Experiencing new weird stuff, almost like paranoïa, and figure I should write this stuff to wait for my meds to kick in rather then building up more anxiety by letting my brain go free."
985,I asked my doctor for medication for social anxiety and he prescribed me paxil.
986,I really hated the idea of taking medication that would numb my emotions.
987,I also hated the stigma around such medication.
988,Should I look for a better medication?
989,"All in all, I ended up getting started on 10mg of lexapro, even though i'm strongly against medication personally, she assured me that it would help."
990,"Gotta get through the first couple weeks, today is day one and the medicine is sort of making me a bit tired."
991,Does anyone have any experience with this medication?
992,I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was pretty young and my parents opted to keep me off medication.
993,"I'm very nervous to get help though, my ex-gf passed away from being on too many prescriptions, and my family is very ""organic everything"" and ""nobody needs medications, you just got to be more disciplined"" and shit."
994,"Depression aside, bipolar aside, other symptoms aside, what medications are you taking /r/anxiety, and does it help?"
995,"I'm on several meds that should help and getting therapy, but I'm getting no relief."
996,I had anxiety all my life but am on medication now so im a lot better.
997,"I don't particularly want to get on medication (I was previously with some terrible side effects), but I can't even get an initial consult with the mental health center until November."
998,"I'm on meds now and haven't had an attack since starting them, until this."
999,I make good money but not quite enough to pay for health insurance separate from my own (Of which she isn't covered) so taking her to a doctor and getting her some medication seems to be out of the realm of possibility.
1000,I tried to look for over the counter anxiety medication and apparently it doesn't exist.
1001,Been on anti anxiety/depression meds for the last 8 years.
1002,Tried so many different therapies combined with different meds but nothing ever seemed to work.
1003,"I had been struggling with stress, social anxiety and depression for a while before this, and it got to a point where I was actually thinking of talking to my parents about it and seeing if I could find some meds that might help me."
1004,"I know there are some people who actually do have serious problems such as severe anxiety and depression, and some of those people do need medication to help, but I think a huge number of people diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and a number of other problems don't need to be on meds, and if they can just take the time and effort to better their lives, they can do it."
1005,It's been a while since I've posted (or needed to) because my meds have been absolutely amazing (aside from some memory loss).
1006,"At the start of my 15 birthday i started taking medication for my anxiety, as it was getting worse and forming panic attacks, starting home phobias and social disturbances ."
1007,I was in amazing shape and i believe i quitting medication or slowly got off it myself (sorry cant remember) it seemed everything was working out and i grew out of it.
1008,I attend community  college and beginning of my 2nd semester of freshman year i cold turkey my medication and felt great and exercised and went to school clubs and what not.
1009,"I scheduled myself to see the same therapist and plan to follow through on everything she says, yet i don't know if i should go back medication."
1010,The whole reason i quit medication was because it was making me sick.
1011,I have tried several medications and combinations over the 3 years (18 now).
1012,Should i go back to medications?
1013,What medications would not have the most side effects?
1014,"I'm on meds, but I generally rarely take benzos."
1015,I was told I should see a doctor about anti-anxiety medication.
1016,"Last year, I stopped taking my anxiety medication."
1017,I decided to get on medication and have been on Prozac for about 6 weeks.
1018,"I am going out for a bachelorette party tonight and want to have a couple drinks, because I feel like my anxiety is pretty well managed by medication."
1019,Have you gone on medication and been able to control your anxiety the next day?
1020,My doctor has put me on some meds that don't seem to be doing anything but give me pain &amp; headaches.
1021,"My sleep patterns are all screwed up because of my medication (I almost think I may also have chronic fatigue syndrome as well, I sleep for at least 16 hours a day, but still feel exhausted and really anxious when I'm awake)."
1022,I feel more relaxed being off medication than on it as I worry about medication side effects.
1023,"I stopped taking a medication that I had been taking for a while, and as a result my job performance has weakened significantly in the last few months (don't feel like going into details on that for now)."
1024,TL:DR ENT says Eustachian Tubes (previous doctor said I probably have ETD) are pretty finicky and don't respond to medicine/there's really no treatment.
1025,"That had never happened to me before, so now my only reliable medicine is either not working or making shit worse."
1026,"So, naturally taking new meds sucks for me, especially when im reading about bad experiences people have had."
1027,I haven't had the chance to start on any medications or therapy since I've been visiting my dad in another part of the country all summer.
1028,I finally started seeking help by getting on medication and seeing a psychologist.
1029,My Dad regulates it through meditation and using a workbook and my sister uses medication.
1030,"I've been thinking about trying meds again, but I have no idea what to try."
1031,"I've been thinking about meds again, but I am really not fond of SSRIs."
1032,"tl;dr: Tried meds and therapy, but I'm ready to try again."
1033,"Also, i find that within the first few hours of taking the medicine, i feel kind of spacy and tight chested, kindof like the beginnings of a panic attack."
1034,"The first session with him wasn't bad but he revealed to me that he is against treating anxiety with medication (while, admittedly, meds were what I was hoping for) and insisted that if we went through some of the more troubling memories from my childhood, it would fix everything."
1035,Has anyone else tried this ayurvedic plant medicine?
1036,"New meds, more therapy, move back home with parents because I can't be trusted to be alone."
1037,"About a month ago, I was put on 75 mg of Effexor for generalized and social anxiety, as well as minor depression, and it's proven to not be the medicine for me."
1038,"I've started the process of weaning myself off it and will probably look into cognitive behavioural therapy as an alternative to medication in general, but I understand coming off the drug can be rather difficult."
1039,I've had bouts of therapy and medications throughout my teens and early 20's.
1040,"Note: When my anxiety medication wears off, I now GET anxiety immediately."
1041,After that I decided I didn't want to depend on the medication any more and started working with a Psychologist on my anxiety.
1042,I started it 14 days ago and I felt like it is the right medication to help me quit lorazepam completely.
1043,I'm reluctant to be on any medications because I used to be addicted to drugs.
1044,I've tried so many medications in my life it's ridiculous.
1045,"I made it to my first therapy session today, and the doctor said I should go on medication considering how long I've had panic disorder (almost 10 years now)."
1046,This medication has ruined my life.
1047,"I've started CBT, and I'm trying new meds to help deal with it."
1048,"I don't want to get back on medications, but I need a breather and to find work that doesn't have me possibly having panic attacks."
1049,I've tried a few different types of medication but they all seemed to make me feel worse.
1050,"I'm thinking about seeing a GP and asking for a different kind of medication, I heard Lyrica and Gabapentin are quite effective for anxiety."
1051,"My parents won't let me see a psychiatrist anymore (not like I have time anyways, I am at school from 7 AM to 5 PM, and until 11 PM I am doing homework), and they are deadset on not allowing me to take medicine."
1052,I find myself doing really well on my new medicine of Lexapro.
1053,"It was just awful, but I got medication and by the time I was 13 I was totally anxiety free."
1054,I stopped taking my medication back when I was 18 and from then on it wasn't an issue.
1055,"So, I have suggestions to start taking Xanax to ""deal"" with my anxiety, but I'm strongly against all kind of medications,because I heard many stories that antidepressants and anti-anxiety pills can help you temporary to ease up the symptoms,but it fuck you up in the long run."
1056,I thought I had my medication in a good place until recently.
1057,There's not a direct medication that can be prescribed for everyone.
1058,What meds plug that mental hole for you?
1059,"Celexa and Seroquel, are my current meds..."
1060,"I don't know what's wrong with me, I always take a good 8 hour sleep everyday so that's out of the things that would make me feel sleepy, and I don't take any meds except for Vitamin C supplements."
1061,Maybe it's time to get some meds but I don' t like taking medication.
1062,I've tried meditation and several kinds of sleeping medications.
1063,"I've tried multiple medications (Lexapro, Celexa, Cymbalta, Abilify, Zoloft, Xanax), and most of them haven't done much for me except relieve my insomnia."
1064,TLDR: I've been through a lot of trauma I haven't dealt with even in 2 years of therapy and a shit ton of medication.
1065,I've had benzos in my medicine drawer for 5 years.
1066,I don't fit the profile of someone who abuses meds.
1067,"Open to other effective meds, of course."
1068,My medication doctor hasn't filled my anti anxiety medication so I've been off it for 3 days.
1069,Anyone else decide to stop using medication?
1070,"I am seeing a therapist a couple times a month, and I am not taking meds (I don't want to be on them)."
1071,Currently I'm on no meds besides the methadone and my depersonilization is always present.
1072,I've been seeing a therapist for half a year and I do not take medication (I have lorazepam and beta-blockers but I never use them).
1073,"I am not a 12 year old, I am a 30 year old who was just diagnosed with GAD and have been working through it with a variety of methods, therapy, medicine, breathing exercises and stuff like that."
1074,Ever since I have been having recent massive panic attacks and got diagnosed and on meds I have not had an epiphany like this.
1075,"I know that the meds and the therapy have helped me in these weeks, and helped me realize that I have had this problem for a long time, but I just want to say ""fuck you anxiety, seriously, fuck you."
1076,"I've tried ginger root, drinking flat 7up, antinausea meds, and antacids."
1077,"I don't feel like I noticed the ""night and day"" difference that some people describe when I started taking it, my anxiety and depression symptoms aren't as debilitating as they used to be, but I don't know if I should attribute that to the medication or just lifestyle changes, and I don't want to experiment with stopping it because the withdrawal symptoms make me feel like crap."
1078,"Hello all,
So I've been seeing a therapist and counselor and taking meds and whatnot for a few years."
1079,"While all this is going on, My mother is in a rehab center to try to become independent enough to come home as she has tardive dyskenasia from her meds she was on, but after visiting with her after viewing an apartment, it became clear that she wouldn't be able to come home and I will have to turn it over to Adult Protective Services to have them assume guardianship and have her put in a Nursing home (something she always dreaded because she used to work in one)."
1080,I took myself off a lot of medications actually.
1081,I just recently moved to Atlanta and pre-move my anxiety was managed and I was off of medication.
1082,"On top of that, I got a lecture from a dentist of all people this week about anti-anxiety medication and about how useless therapy is because, ""people can solve their own problems."""
1083,"They've tried everything to help me, therapists, ADHD medication (even though I feel  I don't have it)."
1084,"*necessary stuff*


There is a huge stigma attached to meds in my my household, my mom personally knew a man taking antidepressants who killed himself, and my dad had a terrible father who also abused many substances, so he believes that anything that alters the way you thing is bad and it took tons of convincing to try a barely helpful amount of ativan

I was wondering what the best course of action is."
1085,Any specific medications that are all natural?
1086,"Is medication needed, or even an option?"
1087,"He also really wanted me to get off the meds as well, so I decided to stop."
1088,I had a breakdown at work so I am in therapy along with on a medicine regime to try and control my OCD and anxiety.
1089,Stuff I tried: Taking meds in the evening instead of morning didn't really change a thing.
1090,"Hi, I have anxiety and been on medicine for 8 months, am coming off them now and I feel like my chest is so tight, am kind of lonely..my family in another country and my friends I feel like they don't really know what am talking about when it comes to anxiety and depression."
1091,I'm not on medication.
1092,"Maybe its the change to my anxiety meds, but I do not feel the need to post on a social website about this anymore, but my family sees it as this huge insult."
1093,I do not take birth control or any medications.
1094,I'm going to talk the a psychiatrist soon to talk about medication I might take.
1095,Just wanted to ask if anyone knows any medication that doesn't make you feel weird?
1096,I've been to a doctor and have gotten some anxiety meds along with depression meds.
1097,I've been on and off meds and working through therapy.
1098,Currently I am on adhd medication and my doctor has given me the option of starting Prozac or doing .5mg of klonopin in the morning and night.
1099,"So to recap I'm supposed to take these two medicines and I ""might feel better by Easter"" in the mean time I'm supposed to just stop thinking anytime I feel anxious and breathe, not take the klonopin I got from my school doctor that I took maybe three times a week tops, and then he might do therapy."
1100,I started on lexapro and switched to various other medications.
1101,I started college last year and decided that I would be fine without medication.
1102,"So, I use them as my medication."
1103,His is worse then mine (at least at this stage of my life) since without his meds he can't be in  a crowd of people without losing it.
1104,"I should go and talk to someone about medication, but at the same time I'm a stubborn ass."
1105,It s amazing how fast the panic settled when we told him he could get medicine to help him.
1106,"I was told I should go on anxiety medication temporarily to learn how to regulate my anxiety since it would be unlikely I'd be able to do it myself in my current situation, but psychiatrists in this area are always booked, and I have no idea when I'll be able to get an appointment."
1107,"One of the major hurdles convincing them to go that they are worried that if they seek therapy, the therapist might force them on medication."
1108,"Asides the medication side effects, they are afraid that might it affect their employment record."
1109,"She manipulated me into leaving my gp &amp; urologist (I have an incurable chronic illness) and told me her method was the only way and my original doctors were ignorant - then got me to lie about my condition so she could prescribe me medications not relevant to my illness and got angry when I asked questions or said it wasn't working, saying that it was my fault."
1110,"I've started to see a therapist recently and she's come to the conclusion that I most likely have GAD, and is going to refer me to a psychiatrist to possibly get me prescribed some medication while we start therapy."
1111,I tried getting off the meds a few weeks ago and had such bad panic/anxiety that I started taking them again.
1112,Do I try and talk to a dr about being on meds that are safe while pregnant?
1113,"It took me so long to find one that works, and to be honest, I don't want to take meds while pregnant."
1114,"I've tried many meds to control it over the years, along with counseling, but I continue to spiral downward."
1115,What medication worked best for you that had minimal side effects?
1116,"I'm not looking for suggestions of therapy or medication, though that has been a real consideration recently, because I know most of the medication has horrible side effects I'd like to stay away from."
1117,"I truly couldn't get any schoolwork done then, because without the medication my anxiety was too unbearable to even make it to the doors of my classroom."
1118,"My sophomore year of college, I got so drunk (wouldn't take meds when I knew I would be drinking) that I fell off a balcony, broke my neck, which now has two rods in the back of it and a metal plate in the front."
1119,"Any medicine, teas, powders?"
1120,"This helps usually, but lately it has been hard for me to follow through with the techniques, so my psychologist suggested I get a prescription for a mild medication that'll relax me a bit so I can do my breathing techniques, etc."
1121,I recently spoke to my therapist about this and asked for some help to deal with this and she suggested the possibility of medication to help me cope.
1122,My only problem is that i'm really hoping to avoid the use of any sort of medication if possible to help overcome this.
1123,"My questions are:

1.Depersonalization-wise, does anyone know any good strategies to help cope with depersonalization without the use of medication?"
1124,What type of medication are most normally used to help with depersonalization?
1125,and what type of things do the medications normally do to help fight the feeling of depersonalization?
1126,"To anyone who's currently using medication to help fight depersonalization, do you think it's effective?"
1127,Normally I force a panic attack just to stop the feelings (off meds) but today..
1128,"i've been coping well(ish) with my anxiety, i see a therapist and take medication but it just feels unbearable right now."
1129,I'm in therapy and have been taking medication but it's not helping.
1130,I want to be able to control my anxiety without meds.
1131,I really want medication because nothing else has helped and I have tried everything!
1132,My doctor won't give me medication for this.
1133,"Fiddled with meds at first until they got the right combo, 10mg Lexapro daily, added 150 mg daily of Wellbutrin to help combat sexual side effects."
1134,"Over the last 4 or 5 months, however, I feel like the meds have been having *more* of an effect."
1135,"After doing some reading, talking with my wife, my therapist, etc, I think I'm ready to taper off the meds."
1136,"In the past, when I've gotten out of the habit of taking my meds for a couple weeks, I've had a few symptoms of withdrawl (brain zaps, teeth grinding, etc)."
1137,"So please, if you'd be willing, share your experience coming off meds?"
1138,"I went to visit my doctor again and he recommended that I stay on the medication (also on the same dosage - 10mg) and that it will get better, but it already has been 2 weeks and I'm not sure if I'm willing to commit."
1139,Or should I ask to switch meds?
1140,I don't like taking meds if i don't have to so i'm curious if this happens to anyone else; if so how have you dealt with it ?
1141,Here I am one week after stopping taking my meds feeling like crap.
1142,Is it possible that the meds are still in my system and I'm going through withdrawal?
1143,I have no idea if the way I'm feeling is because the meds or if it's unrelated.
1144,The reason I'm posting here is because it feels like how I used to feel when I would either miss a dose of my meds or because I quickly tapered for medical testing.
1145,Has anyone dealt with something similar coming off of meds?
1146,"I feel like a shell of the former person I used
To be and it's depressing me and getting worse :(

EDIT: I should mention that last month I had really bad sleeping problems/anxiety and took various meds to help me."
1147,"Some background information: I have general anxiety and ADHD, which I both take medicine for."
1148,I have doubts and questions surrounding a medication that changes the chemistry in your brain.
1149,"I mean, I know how meds are supposed to work, but then sometimes it is discovered how they actually work."
1150,I know that the medication may help.
1151,"I am trying to look at it and ask “what would be worse, taking medication and facing your anxiety and going against an idea you’ve held as a principle for a long time, or not being able to continue and live your life because of your anxiety?”."
1152,More and more the answer to that question has been that meds may help so I should at least TRY.
1153,Blah blah it sounds melodramatic but going to 3 different professionals and being told 3 different medications will help me does not inspire confidence.
1154,"I don't know if I should see a primary care physician (which I don't currently have) to try and get medication, or start therapy with a psychologist or psychiatrist."
1155,"I have depression and anxiety

I was feeling so anxious I wanted to throw up

Took anxiety meds and felt like shit for about 30 min

Now it kicked in and now I just feel really sad instead of anxious

Fuck

Fuck

Fuck

What is wrong with me

I hate mental illness

Makes me so sad"
1156,"I have never been on any medication for anxiety

I've also been to a ""therapist"" type person who taught me some techniques on how to deal with the anxiety (E.g breathing and relaxation techniques) and they helped cure it for a short period of time but now they are only just about getting me by."
1157,"I can't seem to get rid of it
I've tried herbal remedies, chamomile tea, acupressure etc but I still feel sick everyday
I'm also currently on SSRI medication (citalopram) and receiving counselling sessions from university (on my third one currently)
Also, I've always had trouble socialising and now I think I've realised that I don't have a personality really."
1158,I have always had anxiety about the medications I am prescribed for being sick etc.
1159,After stupidly going on Google and researching the medicine I found that there was a report that says it can cause sudden cardiovascular death.
1160,I haven't taken the medicine yet but I already have anxiety over it and I feel as though I will have an anxiety attack if I take it.
1161,I looked into it and CBT years ago because I had no money to afford therapy and I wanted to fix this problem without taking medication.
1162,"Tried some meds, didn't work, and I got worse and worse."
1163,"Finally got on the right medicine, life is going so much better."
1164,"So, I'm off those meds and I begin having panic episodes."
1165,They had been wanting to put me on depression meds but I had been fighting it.
1166,I started on a new medication.
1167,"**TODAY:** About 1.5 or 2 years later now, the medication is working great, no side effects, and the majority of my symptoms have gone away now."
1168,I work in the creative field and I think one of those go-to arguments was that meds may affect your creativity and such.
1169,"Truthfully, for me, it didn't affect me but positively once I found the medication that worked for me."
1170,"I basically went to my school counsellor, who told me there's 'take as needed' medication for anxiety (which I wanted, my anxiety was never that bad), I went to my doctor, he told me it's too addictive and gave me Effexor XR which I took gladly because like I said, my anxiety was topical; I'd feel anxious before presenting, or before meeting someone new."
1171,"It was never an issue I suffered everyday with, and because my anxiety wasn't that bad, I was brave to start this new medication."
1172,i do not want to take medicine.
1173,I have memory problems and I'm on anxiety and clinical depression medicine aswell.
1174,"But I just wanted to make a post saying that for the last 4 or 5 days I've felt pretty much like the old me, the pre-medication, pre-seizure me."
1175,TLDR: Starting to feel like me again after struggling with my diagnosis and medication.
1176,I have considered all other things that involve someone with a phD prescribing me meds that I can't pronounce and talking to a councellor but first I would like to gain some perspective on my situation.
1177,"After suffering from severe social anxiety for my whole life and taking meds for 9 years, I decided to start seeing a psychologist 2 months ago."
1178,Is there any way the medicine could hurt my anxiety even more?
1179,You know the person who cares so much about their job they will literally put their HRT medication at work?
1180,Anyway me and my doctor decided to try a medication swap as I just wasn't functioning.
1181,Talking to a psychologist or taking medication and all are not really options for me.
1182,"(no meds because doctors suck so hard) I'm not afraid of flying, I'm just worried that with this increased anxiety things that didn't bother me are suddenly going to make me have an anxiety attack."
1183,This is the first time I have taken a medication for it longer than a month.
1184,"I don't feel like the medication was helping (especially considering the amount of anxiety I still feel about getting refills despite being medicated), but the withdrawal is unbearable."
1185,"So I'm on a few meds, saphris (anti physcotic) tegretol  (mood stabilizer) and Zoloft I have been on this mixture for over a year now and it seems to be working but I have no sex drive at all I was wondering if anyone else experiences this or I'm just totally crazy and on my own (commence anxiety about posting this nowwww)"
1186,"I was recently diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks and was given a prescription for an as-needed medication, 'ativan' to use during panic attacks."
1187,"I was wondering though, if anyone else has experience with a similar medication who might be willing to share strategies they have for only using the medicine when they need it so they can avoid getting addicted."
1188,And nobody is willing to rearrange my meds because I'm only 24 and it would set me up for a life of disaster.
1189,Side note: I'm not allowed any anti anxiety medication because I'm on blood thinners related to the traumatic event.
1190,"My Councillor tells me I need to consider ""Mild"" anxiety medication."
1191,"I was offended because my initial response was 'that's a bandaid not a solution' then she told me 'well you better consider it because I don't see a reason for us to talk anymore so it's your only option'

TLDR; My Councillor said I'm not doing CBT, go on Anxiety meds."
1192,"My question is, has anyone else been skeptical about ""Mild"" anxiety meds, given it a try and it actually made a difference??"
1193,"It started when i was 16, I took a medication that I happened to later find out I was allergic to."
1194,Lexipro...Buspar (both anxiety medications) stomach medication (due to the anxiety I was producing too much stomach acid) I was in HELL...
1195,Fast forward to 3 therepists and 4 medications later I met someone who saved my life.
1196,I am now 23 years old and on no medications for anxiety.
1197,"Upon taking the medication, I experienced a high."
1198,I almost fainted when I was writing my exam (reason for taking expired allergy medication).
1199,"I got used to been an aspie and kind of thought of it as a privilege, but know matter how many psychologists i saw and medication i took i still could not get to school."
1200,"Also, I've never been to the doctor for this and I'm not on any medications."
1201,"I've just started taking this medication and had high hopes for it, but this dizziness is very unpleasant."
1202,"I guess what I'm hoping for is some glimmer of light, a reason to believe that I could get rid of this somehow, preferably without meds."
1203,I just downed some sleep meds.
1204,I have tried some medications which just heightened by depression and anxiety.
1205,So I repeated the same thing medication.
1206,I wanted to see if anyone has similar experiences and has found a way to cope - either through medication or some other method.
1207,**tl;dr I get nervous when performing in social settings and want to find possible medications or methods to get over it.
1208,I was taking several anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications for years.
1209,Anxiety medicine is the only thing that makes me sleep but turns me in an angry zombie for 24hrs.
1210,Problem is this medication is making me extremely tired.
1211,Or maybe see if they changed medication (like Celexa) and had a lesser side effect.
1212,Having to tell people that I have anxiety and panic attacks is one thing... telling them that I have to take schizophrenia medication is another.
1213,I know it would be well controlled with the medication but with all the medication I do take it makes it harmful to have children..
1214,I've never been for medication.
1215,"I was diagnosed with clinical depression in high school, which, combined with several family related issues, caused me to fail out and generally be in a daze until a couple of years ago when my meds started working and I was able to get (mostly) back on track."
1216,"Now, in my second year of college, I'm off my depression meds and having anxiety issues remembering what happened to me in high school, and it's gotten so bad that I can barely attend classes."
1217,"Should I just keep it to myself, even if I going back on medication?"
1218,"(Quick info: F, 21, stressed about school and being around others + their expectations, no medication now but previously on Wellbutrin and Ritalin)"
1219,"I do not want to take any medicine for this though, because I hear that those can be addictive and do not work long term."
1220,"But anyway, I'm on meds this time so hopefully it won't end up like that again."
1221,It's like the anxiety is getting too strong for the meds to handle.
1222,"I haven't taken anything including Tylenol since January because I have bad acid reflux from all the stress

I guess my questions are: how do you guys get over anxiety to taking medications and also have any of you taking the one day dose and what side effects did you have?"
1223,Pro tip: don't read medicine side-effect pamphlets
1224,"This goes for any other type of product (toothpaste, pop, lotion, medicine, etc.)"
1225,"I am scared of medication as I don't quite believe pharmaceutical companies have the best interest for us, but our money."
1226,"I started medication 3 weeks ago and I'm working on it slowly with my therapist, but money's getting tight."
1227,My sister woke me up early this morning looking for meds because she had vomiting and diarrhea.
1228,"I totally feel apart 
at work the other day and my boss suggested I take the summer off to reevaluate my medication and whatnot."
1229,I am on 2 medications but it is not getting better and i'm starting to wonder if it has to do with my mental state.
1230,I went back on my anxiety medication (nortriptyline 50 mg at night) and was in counseling for a while.
1231,"I saw my doctor today who told me that she would tell the people at the mental health services place to get me in pronto, and she prescribed me a medicine to take before driving."
1232,I would like a medicine to take before driving to calm my nerves but not something that could possibly lower my blood pressure to dangerous levels (I have anxiety about having heart problems.)
1233,all i have in terms of medication is a 25mg dose of hydroxizine  (which i usually only use part of).
1234,"I also read over the counter cough meds can cause simmilar affects, oddly enough dylsem causes the same thing to happen when I take it."
1235,"I used to want to study medicine, but I can't anymore because I am too terrified of being around sick people."
1236,I keep saying that I don't need this medication and that I should just go to a spiritual retreat or something but I do think that I have been downplaying the extent of my issues to myself.
1237,Last November I decided to stop taking my meds.
1238,"I didn't want to be on medicine forever, I thought I could handle it through proper exercise and meditation."
1239,I was trying so hard not to be on meds.
1240,I really do have an imbalance that can't be handled without meds.
1241,Tldr: tried not taking meds and failed miserably...
1242,I already took my dosage of antidepressant/antianxiety meds but I think I'm having a minor mental break/panic attack all of the sudden and I can't stop shaking.
1243,I've been on 3 different types of medication in my life and nothing has worked.
1244,"Now that the doctors have given anti-anxiety medication, she has been able to start eating more but she is still struggling with anxiety attacks."
1245,"I'm constantly thinking about me not being me, like depersonalisation/derealisation, that I will go insane, and If I will leave this untreated with meds , my brian chemistry will change forever and I wouldn't be able to feel again me."
1246,"For example: I have now finished my exams with marks over 90% , I'm in the last year of medicine school."
1247,I don't want psychotherapy or meds.
1248,Please share your experiences as well on getting off your meds.
1249,I don't want to take medicine.
1250,"Can you start reacting to the medicine differently later on, or if it works for you will it tend to keep on working?"
1251,"If this is going to be a long lasting side effect, I'd almost rather deal with learning to control my anxiety without medication."
1252,"Tried several meds, currently on Prozac."
1253,No meds have seemed to help.
1254,"I've never taken medication for anxiety before, but I'd certainly consider it as this pain is already starting to drive me crazy."
1255,So unless I find a job real soon I’ll be in a world of pain once I run out of Cipralex and the withdrawal from my medication kicks in.
1256,I decided to write it here because the other mental health professionals that I've spoken with where I live only seem to focus on increasing the dosage of my medication when finding some sort of regular income would actually be more helpful.
1257,"Around 2007 I got these really scary panic-attacks that resulted in me getting SSRI medication, which worked for me."
1258,"I tried to get myself of them too early though so I ended up getting back on another medication(Mirtazapin, since I had trouble sleeping due to anxiety)."
1259,"Because honestly, before my OCD episode this year, I had never considered myself to need meds and looked down on people who were on them."
1260,"Some info, we're both in our early 20's, she's in therapy but not on medication."
1261,Finding myself taking the Clonazepam that just sits in the medicine cabinet most of the year.
1262,"I've tried several different medications, and they do help, but I'd prefer to be off of them because of the lack of enthusiasm I experience for things like creativity and sex."
1263,Finer than before meds.
1264,"Pain, uselessness, reliving fights... Can't stop obsessing but I don't want to say out loud the thoughts I'm having, or what happened with my family...and I don't want to take Zoloft anymore but I don't want to test meds until something else works."
1265,5 years of no libido plus I gained almost 60 lbs on meds.
1266,"I know I need help, honestly to the point where I think I need meds."
1267,Unfortunately when I was about 15 (23 now) my anxiety problems climaxed because I was overprescribed medications.
1268,I gave up when every other form of medicine kept leading to either hair loss or weight gain.
1269,"But this thing has really helped me out, written by a Harvard MD with scientific results; it blends eastern philosophy (meditation, breathing techniques) with western medicine."
1270,I am on so many fucking meds and the only one that does anything lasts for two hours and is highly addictive.
1271,I quit my meds.
1272,I dont want ot have to be on meds for the rest of my life.
1273,"I went to a ""doctor's assistant"" last week (she can prescribe medicines but she is not a doctor) who did not speak English."
1274,I need to take enough of this medicine to stifle the anxiety response.
1275,I would like to hear your experiences with medications.
1276,"People who are suffering from different kinds of anxiety and depression, which medication was the most effective for you."
1277,"I've taken antidepressents/antianxiety medication for fifteen years, and I've taken Pristiq since it became available."
1278,"Now, for two days, I've taken it, but it doesn't feel like I've taken it; I get that weird ""you haven't taken your medicine in some time"" feeling: cloudy head, balance issues, so on and so forth."
1279,"Anyone have any idea of how to get back to that good point while i was taking escitalopram, or can perhaps suggest a new medication?"
1280,"I've tried all sorts of medication (Zoloft, Abilify, Effexor, Prozac, Viibryd, then back to Zoloft with Xanex and Clonazepam added to those)."
1281,"This is the original: http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2h9b8o/meds_stories_about_zoloft/ 
If it doesnt work go to my profile I don't have alot of posts you'll easily see which i meant."
1282,"When I first started medication and was feeling the lowest I'd ever fest you guys would talk me through it, when I felt like my head was going to blow up, again, you guys were here for me."
1283,Does medication help paranoia?
1284,"Ultimately, I am scared, as always, that I will regress and not make progress with my anxiety, that the meds will stop working or I will get worse with each anxious episode I have - and I am also terrified that my anxiety is going to drive away the person I love, the person I am engaged to marry."
1285,I'm not on medication and to be honest my life is pretty good right now even with every now and then there are super stressful times like exams and stuff.
1286,I'm afraid to take medication because of the side effects and get the impression they don't really work.
1287,"I'm currently on (new) medication, Mirtazapine, although this was happening before I started on that."
1288,"Finally got a hold of the doctors and everything and they've started me on Pristiq, took my first tablet about an hour ago, really nervous about this new medicine, but hoping it's gonna help a lot."
1289,"If I feel worse I'll see a doc, but I feel like if I can endure a flu with anxiety, with nothing more than over the counter meds, that when I finally wake up feeling better I'm going to feel some major relief from an anxiety standpoint."
1290,"Of course one should consult a doctor, consider medication, therapy, etc etc."
1291,"But so far, out of everything I've tried (including some prescription meds with horrible side effects and withdrawal symptoms) this has left me feeling the most positive and like it's actually helping, and figured I'd pass it on in case anyone else had been looking for something new, or wasn't sure about trying meditation."
1292,"I started it on Feb 3rd and have been feeling more anxious, which she told me might happen while the meds regulate."
1293,Anybody else have any experience with this medicine for anxiety and how did it work??
1294,I've never been on medicine before so I'm just trying to have as much knowledge as I can.
1295,"I did stop at an emergicare to get some headache meds, but forgot to ask for a note (which I don't actually need for my bosses/work, just an afterthought as a way to ""prove"" that I was actually ""sick"")."
1296,"If it is medication, I want help."

1307,"(On meds for it now)
- how the body works - foot bone connected to the leg bone.. yeah that'll pretty much do it."

1310,"My parents think talking to a counselor might help, the truth is I wouldn't mind some anti-anxiety meds."
1311,"That aside, I am taking medicine and that's working extremely well until something happens and just fucks me up completely."
1312,"Most medications they suggest for this tend to make you into high functioning zombies in my experience  so to avoid that if you can, all you can do is learn your triggers and practice coping mechanisms - like chamomile tea or meditation for me."
1313,I want to try going off my meds to determine whether it's a matter of chemical imbalances vs. external factors.
1314,I am on meds and the depression is at bay for now.
1315,I'm currently taking 30 milligrams of Citalopram once daily and I was wondering if taking vitamins or anything else would interfere with my meds?
1316,The meds aren't making much of a difference and I want to try something natural to help.

1333,I have also recently had my meds changed after being on the same ones for 2 years.
1334,"I'm running out of medication, so I call to see what's going on, and the pharmacy has placed it on hold for an interesting reason... because of ""how expensive it is""."
1335,"So now the medication that I NEED, and they were supposed to have, they haven't refilled."
1336,This is the exact same medication that I have gotten from this exact pharmacy for almost a decade now.
1337,Yet they didn't think me renewing and refilling my prescription was an indication that I actually wanted my medication.
1338,Its gotten to the point where I've been prescribed Zofran (vomiting/nausea medication given to pregnant women) for whenever these attacks happen.
1339,"Also, to note, I never finished my medications."
1340,I’m seriously considering taking some kind of meds though if there is something that can suppress my extreme involuntary adrenal response.
1341,"**TL;DR** I have panic problems, the medications I've tried aren't great, and I want to give benzos a shot."

1345,Does anyone have any positive or even life changing storys about antidepressants or any kind of anxiety medications?

1348,"I want to be able to go back to school but I don't want to go back without medication to help me, I don't want to go through all that again and honestly I don't think I would be able to."
1349,I've tried like 20+ medications.
1350,I'm not really interested in therapy or medication at this point.
1351,He has been diagnosed and prescribed meds but I have not.
1352,"I went to my boyfriend's, he helped calm me down, gave me one of his meds and I fell asleep until the next morning."
1353,I just want to know if there is any type of medication you fellow redditor's have found that really helps that is non-narcotic?
1354,"I've been in therapy on and off since I was seven and have tried several medications, all of which have either had no effect or have made me worse."
1355,Like I said I've taken many different medications but none of them help.
1356,The last one I was on caused such severe side effects that I developed a fear of pretty much all medicine and my last therapist agreed that the anxiety the act of taking medicine caused wasn't worth the possible benefits at that given time.
1357,"Food, alcohol, medication, social situations...name it."
1358,"Would it be worth sucking it up and trying another medication (this would be the 5th for anxiety and the 9th overall) 

Also is it possible this is somehing more than general anxiety?"
1359,"All three disorders are pretty mild,  but since I had success with medication before, I'm ready to get on it again."
1360,What medication would be good?
1361,"I have been to five different therapists, and I have been on medication."
1362,"Going on one medication, waiting for it to work, and being disappointed when it doesn't."
1363,"Or going on a medication that makes you so sick that, on top of your severe anxiety and depression, you're confined to your bed and house all day."
1364,But I've had my fair share of taking medicine I can't swallow.
1365,"I am currently on medication and seeing a therapist, but what comes next has been my way of coping since my disorders first took over my life."
1366,First job interview after starting on medication.
1367,"This is the hardest thing I've ever done, it seems so much easier fighting along without meds."
1368,I've struggled with anxiety/OCD thoughts for a couple years and recently attempted to take medication (zoloft) for it prescribed by my doctor but after 3 days I was convinced and paranoid that the medication was making it worse or would make it worse if I kept taking it and I would fully lose control.
1369,"Last night, I forgot to take my Zoloft medication before going to bed (it's a habit formed from trying to sleep through a lot of side effects when I first started nearly 2 months ago)."
1370,"I always get offered medication, but I never think it's a convenient time to start trying to change my anxiety."
1371,I've definitely improved myself through therapy and medication but there's a long road ahead.
1372,I am currently fighting against my agoraphobia (without meds because they're too spooky for me).
1373,"I describe what happened as well as I could, he tells me it was likely a grand mal seizure, and that it's a side effect (though rare) of my anti-anxiety meds (Zoloft)."
1374,I should have known better than to mix alcohol with my meds.
1375,I assumed I was safe since I took my meds in the morning (xanax and lamictal) but I did take my Celexa at night because I didn't want to have a drink and forget.
1376,I am also worried about them putting me on new meds when the ones I have been taking have worked.
1377,Also I am supposed to be leaving for Disney World on Thursday and I really don't want to be trying out new meds while I am stuck in a camper for 5 days with my in-laws.
1378,I used to be afraid of medication.
1379,I imagine I'd be a wreck without these medications.
1380,I've even taken seizure medicine.
1381,"It's not really direct pain, it's almost like a very irritating pressure that pain medication cannot help, like my mind is tying itself in knots."
1382,"Would medicine effect someone who is anxious about illness, disease, cancer, etc."
1383,"My fiance is a bit annoyed with the meds, 
But he is here supporting me."
1384,"Without that total hopelessness I felt, I could make better decisions regarding my anxiety treatment and Im finally talking to people about it and getting back on medication."
1385,"It's not a stimulant, like many other ADD/ADHD medications are."
1386,"Also note that THC is the cannabinoid that makes you feel ""high"", so if you find a very low-THC, high-CBD strain, it will be much more of a medication than recreation."
1387,"I hope this doesn't qualify as a ""quick fix"", but I believe it's in the same tier as acute panic attack medication, if not better, with fewer negative side effects."
1388,"My problem is I'm very wary of medication changes, I worry about side effects etc."
1389,Is there a good tried and tested medication that I might ask about next time I visit the doc?
1390,"I went to a free clinic because I can't afford to go anywhere else and they told me it could take 4-6 weeks before I can get an appointment to even discuss medication, let alone actually get any."
1391,"It wasn't too long ago that I was unable to leave my house for over 5 years (this was about 6 years ago), and now today I'm still kinda staggered at the changes I have been able to make (largely in part of a supportive partner), and without the aid of medications."
1392,I'm hesitant because I have no health insurance (and never previously prescribed medication because of that).
1393,"I've been on medication for as long as I can remember, and am currently on a waiting list to see a psychologist (I'm already seeing a psychiatrist) after my former therapist of a year saw that I wasn't improving and suggested I see someone higher up."
1394,"It's been three days since and I still have chest pains and mini attacks with shaking and hyperventilating despite medication, all the meds really do is sedate me to the point of where my brain is mush."
1395,Can anyone help is there any maybe other medication you recommend I went to the hospital and they claim this is anxiety disorder but they didn't keep me in the mental health ward what is going on with me I just want my life back.
1396,"She wants to avoid medication, but it keeps getting worse."
1397,i decided (finally) to do something about it and went to the doctor and was prescribed some meds.
1398,"i don't know whether or not to go back on the medication, honestly, the fact that it changes your brain chemistry kind of freaks me out."
1399,i also get reinforcement from my bf to the same end: that antidepressants/anti-anxiety medications mess with your natural brain chemistry and it's probably better to find a different outlet.
1400,have any of you found a different way to deal with your anxiety other than medication?
1401,TL/DR: college student with GAD looking for advice on medication versus other outlets.
1402,I think it might be time to see a therapist and maybe get on some meds or something.
1403,"I have a fairly high tolerance to medication, if that matters."
1404,"After trying many options, my doctor has recommended I try some medication to help with my anxiety/depression."
1405,I've been avoiding medications up till now and I'm looking for anyone who is willing to give their experience on taking loxalate 10mg.
1406,"I'm going to docs appointments and will take the meds, but as far as a plan."
1407,I am impatient and restless and I hate the way some of my meds make me feel.
1408,On Monday I'm going to see a psychologist about getting some sort of medication to deal with anxiety.
1409,I'm worried about taking medication.
1410,I've lived with anxiety and depression for 15 years without any sort of medication.
1411,"I know this is insane, there are other examples of me doing crazy things, and i'm on medication now for mood swings that i thought would maybe help me with this but it's not really helping and as much as  i've tried to change i'm still afraid that they do things behind my back when i'm not there, so  i try to be at home every night and i try to be around either him or her twenty four seven, and it's hard to do."
1412,Just meds on their own do not work.
1413,"I was just sort of feeling so comfortable in my ability to control my anxiety that I got too cocky and just let the meds do everything, and I expected them to do everything."
1414,"I'd like medication for my anxiety, I tried Xanax, but I have the paradoxical disinhibition effect when I take benzodiazepines."
1415,Does anybody else know of a good anxiolytic/anti-psychotic medication that could treat my anxiety but let me stay awake?
1416,"The meds I've tried haven't helped much, and I've been rather resistant to therapy."
1417,I've prayed to god every night hoping I can get help because I sure don't want to take any SSRI's or meds.
1418,I don't want to have to be on medication to feel normal damnit.
1419,Tried many different meds throughout my life with various degrees of success.
1420,I'm on meds.
1421,I don't think my shrink can give me any more medication.
1422,My dad takes medicine for it.
1423,"So I'm still thinking that I have a side effect from a medication I took earlier this month, and the panic and worry it's caused me has me waking up freaking out three times a night."
1424,I attempted intercourse with my bf while about four days into the meds and it just didn't feel electric or amazing like it always tends to.
1425,She also said highly unlikely the meds had a thing to do with it.
1426,I've never taken any medication for it before but my doctor put me on lexapro and buspirone about a month ago and it's done absolutely nothing.
1427,Or maybe there's other medications I don't know of besides benzos that have helped you guys?
1428,"I read a lot of tips on talking to people in your family, but no one in my family really understands mental disorders and a good number of them don't believe in medication."
1429,I find it hard to find somewhere to go and I don't really know what I can be doing beyond therapy and medication.
1430,My mom called the psychiatrist and she said to have me stop taking the medication until she can talk to me again.
1431,"Now, I've been very afraid to take medication for anything for quite some time now, which is why I think it may have been in my head."
1432,I can't imagine I was taking the medication long enough for it to have any effect on me...

1435,"I've recently started the medication shuffle and right now I'm on 112.5 mg effexor and 100 mg zoloft nightly, with the effexor scheduled to go up and the zoloft down at my next psych appointment."
1436,I don't want to take medication again because I don't want to feel like I have to rely on them to be okay.
1437,And what else can help me aside from medication and CBT?
1438,"I was just having a look through this subreddit, and I may be completely wrong, but just having a look through the posts it seems like a really large proportion of posters are taking medication for their anxiety and aren't really mentioning seeing psychologists."
1439,"And I've seen some suggestions to newcomers include medication, but not seeing a psychologist."
1440,I know thus far they are most certainly stress related (work and stuff like that as I work at a call center) and wanted to know if I should be trying to find medication for it or what have you.
1441,(even things that aren't medically related or on a medication level)
1442,Has anyone here switched medications from Paxil to something else?
1443,At the moment I'm weaning off of Paxil to get onto a new medication.
1444,Will withdrawal symptoms continue until I'm on my new medication?
1445,"I used to be on medication as a child, but I stopped taking the drugs of my own free will and have been un-medicated for 10+ years."
1446,"Should I keep trying to fight my way out of this without meds until I'm either cured or completely ruined, or should I try whatever the doctor prescribes me one more time?"
1447,"What are your experiences with anxiety treatments, whether it was through meds or more 'natural' approaches?"
1448,"Is it worth it to try another type of meds, or do my past experiences prove that they're not for me?"
1449,"Or I could try to be treated for my anxiety, and risk wasting precious time that I don't have right now figuring out what medications work for me, etc."
1450,"I think I'm finally on the right dose of my meds, and my meditation practice is beginning to help!"
1451,"Hello people…
Recently I took the drastic decision to stop taking my medicines by my own."
1452,"I took many medicines together during the last years… Like litium, quetiapine and paxil… Among others."
1453,"Guys I really want to get away from these medicines, I’ve been taking pills for depression for so long, I got fat and kind dumb."
1454,I know depression is a disease like others and need to keep in treatment and maybe I will never will be like other people BUT medicines no more for me.
1455,I was wondering if there is anyone who has had seizures in the past and take meds for anxiety.
1456,I have heard that many anxiety meds do not mix well with someone who has a history of seizures.
1457,"* I have mild asthma
By way of medicine
* I was on doxycycline/moxycycline for acne for 2-3 years and just stopped it."
1458,But my acne makes me feel worse than any medicine ever could.....
1459,"So continuing on with the anxiety bit, my doctor told me that I have anxiety (without even assessing me or ANYTHING) and she'll have me see a psychiatrist and if it goes on for a longer time I'll be attending therapy and receiving medicine."
1460,"My psychiatrist hasn't brought up medicine yet, how do I bring it up?"
1461,I have been taking medication for ADHD for the past 8 years but I have found that *compared to those I have reached out to in person and you great people on the internet;* I am taking a dose that I am suspecting is NOT normal.
1462,Not taking the medication has caused me to sleep like 18 hours a day but I am at a point now (6 MONTHS) later where I can sleep for 9 hours and feel 'just' tired.
1463,"My medication regimen for ADHD is as follows:

1465,"The lack of medications is killing me, I've tried a change in diet, exercise and such..Thanks in anticipation of some love."
1466,"TL;DR - No insurance anymore, system is going into literal shock from lack of medication."
1467,"And also I'm too scared to go on prescription meds, I always feel like they are going to fuck me up even more."
1468,"Some background:
I have a history of OCD and Anxiety that I have been on and off of meds for, but for the last year or so I have been OK handling things without meds."
1469,"They tweaked my meds (upped my beta blocker, metaprolol, from 25 to 50, and added in daily baby aspirin), gave me a holter monitor, and sent me on my way."
1470,"Will he subject me to a bevy of tests, write it off as anxiety and offer medication, I just don't know..."
1471,"However, she has anxiety issues too; I know this since she said she was on anxiety meds on our first meeting."
1472,"Please, I don't want therapy or medication."
1473,"As a guy, I can't talk to anyone about this and when I mention this elsewhere they say I should seek therapy and medication."
1474,"I get a bit lightheaded and really drowsy while taking this medication, but the thought of getting vertigo again (I had my one and hopefully only episode this past october and it really fucked me up, both physically and on a mental level) makes me want to literally die to avoid it."
1475,I was on medicine around 14 or 15 and it would help my anxiety but worsen my depression so I just stopped taking it.
1476,I don't want to go back on medicine what can I do?
1477,"I am pretty good with mental health, I have an anxiety myself, but my girlfriend has anxiety and depression, she recently had her anti-depressant meds doubles, since then she has been terrified about going to work, she can't get up in the mornings, even getting out of bed seems scary."
1478,"I don't find him too understanding nor helpful other than prescribing medication; all he says, ""Well, just try to push your negative thoughts away and try your best and you'll be fine."""
1479,"Now I'm not one to normally take medication, so this really freaks me out, especially because after googling the drug one of the possible side effects are heart palpitations (which could mean there's a death possibility), others are dizziness, and swelling of the throat."
1480,"10 months ago i went to see my doctor about my anxiety after struggling with it for a long time, he ended up referring me to see a psychiatrist, who gave me several different diagnoses (i don't know if this is normal or not) but she said that i had GAD/panic disorder, and suspected that i had mild OCD, but my dad didn't want me to start any medication despite her recommendation of Zoloft."
1481,"I know you guys can't really give me medical advice, but i just don't know if i should wait it out, with the hope it gets better after a month or two, or if i should go back and really push for medication."
1482,Constantly on medication.
1483,"I stopped taking the medicine after some research, and now after a week I am still getting the bad attacks."
1484,Did the medicine permanently fuck me up?
1485,"A few years ago, I came across a medication called [Tramadol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol)."
1486,CC obviously isn't for me...or could it be if I had the right medication and state of mind?
1487,"Im not against medication for it, but I generally try to use that as a last restort."
1488,"Also, the first thing she pushed was medication."
1489,I have an appointment with a psychiatrist BEFORE my next appointment with this new therapist and she absolutely thinks I should take meds without knowing ANYTHING about me.
1490,"I don't want to take meds because of her advice, and she doesn't seem to care about what they might do to me."
1491,This is an update on how my medication is working for me.
1492,Backstory: I'm resistant to Benzodiazepine medication (xanax etc.)
1493,"Anyway I haven't noticed anything 'major' the changes I talked about are very minimal at best but, finally seeing relief somewhat really is making me feel hopeful for this medication."
1494,"I know however how meds and alcohol don't mix well, but I was wondering: if I don't take my 5 mg Escitalopram on that particular morning, would there be no problem with me drinking alcohol later in the day?"
1495,The doctor weaned me off my meds about a year and a half ago.
1496,"I now live in a new city, and I don't really want to go back on medication."
1497,But I don't want to end up being on medication.
1498,"Any people on medication reading this, how has it changed you as a person?"
1499,"However, none have ever felt like I needed medication."
1500,"After a while on meds and doing therapy I thought I was ok with my anxiety problems, but I'm not."
1501,But I very recently increased the amount of meds and I never did this before.
1502,I get an anxiety medicine mailed to me on a bi-monthly basis.
1503,"Today, however, my mother, extremely upset, told me the order of my medicine that I was supposed to get several days ago had been messed up and that I wouldn't have it for at least another week."
1504,"I'm saving that for the day I graduate (thank God I forgot to take my pill when I got up this morning), but I'm still going to have to get through today, tomorrow, and graduation (plus, probably, another week or so) with no medicine."
1505,Exciting news - extra virgin coconut oil shown to be as effective as anti-depressent medication on mice during a forced swim test.
1506,"I've had these pills since July and I haven't started them yet because I was skeptical on being on three different medications with very, very prudent side-effects if I was to cut them off."
1507,I have been on medication before within the past two years.
1508,"I've been fighting the fact of being on medication, but within the past month and a half and as a result of a few ""episodes"" and breakdowns I've had, I really can't do this on my own and I *need* to be on something if I want to live a normal life."
1509,I am just looking on what other people's thoughts are on these medications and what I should potentially do.
1510,"My mom thinks that medication is the only answer, I think its a waste of time, I stay on them mostly to keep her from worrying too much."
1511,In addition to my frequent urination symptoms ( that have gotten better thanks to meds) I seem to cum too easily when masturbating by hand ( TMI sorry!)
1512,"My meds make me irritable, crazy and irrational which try to help my anxiety."
1513,I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression in November and had started on medication.
1514,I was prescribed some anti-anxiety medication which works 50% of the time.
1515,"I have failed classes due to lack of effort, even on adhd medication I just hate to persevere through even moderate difficulty tasks."
1516,"I was put on medication months ago to help with the anxiety, but found I kept forgetting to take it regularly."
1517,"So, yesterday I started taking my medication again, starting with a small dosage, intending to work my way up again (these were the original instructions given by my doctor)."
1518,"ADHD meds have not been working for me and I'm starting to wonder if treating anxiety first, which was a surprise diagnosis for me but actually makes a lot of sense, is the way to go."
1519,I've been thinking about getting off my meds because I feel like I'm not truly an 'anxious' person anymore.
1520,I have not yet taken any medicine to relieve the symptoms because they aren't that debilitating.
1521,"I've been on Effexor and Strattera for a while now, and they are a great help to me, but I still often wonder if there's just some medical deficiency or other issue I have and am masking with the medications instead of getting to the source of the problem and dealing with that."
1522,I am taking my medicine and you know what?
1523,My doctors didn't know what to do so they just kept giving me more meds.
1524,"Well, the constant cycle of doping to do school, running out of medications early, suffering withdrawals, missing class due to withdrawal, and then the anxiety of making up so much work got to me a little over half way through the semester."
1525,"I stopped all medications almost two years ago, but recently my anxiety has reasserted itself into my life."
1526,I genuinely went into medicine hoping for a better life for myself and hopefully a chance to make a difference in other peoples' lives too.
1527,I feel like my anxiety is progressively getting worse but I am not sure if it is from chronic marijuana use or if my medicine isn't right for me or what.
1528,"Regardless, she sees her psychologist maybe once every other month, and is extremely resistant to trying new medications her doctor and psychiatrist wants to put her on."
1529,My anxiety has been under control thanks to medication but seeing diseases and other disorders makes me feel in some way like I have them too.
1530,"When I got into middle school, I was finally given medication, and that has helped a lot, and for a very long time I had no issues."
1531,"You see, I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, and being on medication for that has worked wonders for me, however it does increase my anxiety."
1532,I don't wanna compromise my sex drive just for a medication :(
1533,My biggest fear is the medication people take for Anxiety.
1534,I don't take any medication and I hope I never have to.
1535,I'm not on medication because my anxiety isn't eating me from inside and I actually feel okay most of the time.
1536,"I got a relapse and so they decided to change my meds to Zoloft 

I don't have the dizziness, migraines, and exhaustion a ymore, but I feel tense and also zone out for most if the day."
1537,Should I change my meds??
1538,"Hey everyone,
Just thought I'd come onto this subreddit to offer my time and experiences with taking Lexapro to those of you who might be contemplating going the medication route or therapy route or whatever might be bothering you."
1539,Is there some of other type of medication that could help with anxiety and mood?
1540,I'm not good at telling people when I need help but I am afraid of going through another medicine change... My therapist says I would do better on Abilify but I've heard bad things about it... Should I expect the issues to go away?
1541,"I don't know if I should see a doctor for some meds, or if I should stick with school, or take sometime off to work things out."
1542,"2) Watch Comedy TV Shows - make yourself laugh, as everyone knows laughing is the best medicine."

1545,"I have gone a long way of battling my anxiety and that is completely on my own, without any medication or doctors."
1546,Do you suggest any other medication?
1547,I'm currently not taking any medication.
1548,It worked fine for 2.5 years[unless I forgot to take my meds].
1549,"Can the symptoms of anxiety (Dizziness, foggyness, tunnel vision, nausea, depersonalization, headache, etc) Go away WITHOUT medication?"
1550,Ok I have been suffering from SA ever since I can remember and recently decided to try meds for it.
1551,I'm wandering if I should ride it out or switch meds.
1552,Is there a medicine that can actually help me?
1553,": I've heard anxiety meds usually make you gain weight--but if it makes me feel better, and helps me relax and not sleep so much anymore (I sleep to avoid the day and avoid feeling anxious), couldn't it actually help me to get up and lose weight?"
1554,After a couple of months of severe anxiety I was able to manage it with medication and some counseling.
1555,"I realize with my rational mind that it is probably because I weaned myself off my meds two months ago, but with my anxiety riddled mind I feel positive that I'm going to feel this bad for the rest of my life."
1556,"Also, even when I was on my medication and managing my anxiety I never felt as good as I did before all this started."
1557,"I'll be going to my family doctor to discuss my problem and hopefully get a referral to a psychiatrist in order to begin some form of therapy, perhaps medication (though, preferably not, but I guess we'll see), and whatever else."
1558,"I tried medication (which kind of helped, but not really - crappy side effects, and never really solved the problem, and of course you have to keep amping up the doses to get the same effect over time)."
1559,"Basically I'm afraid to take meds and would like to know how you feel...

Is it working?"
1560,I'm not on any other medication and haven't had a drink since yesterday.
1561,I suffer from anxiety and OCD but have not been on any medication for a few years now.
1562,"I've strongly been against taking meds for my anixety, in part because therapy always helped."
1563,I got meds the other day and adjusting to the lexipro has me nauseated and even more panicked for a good 45 minutes.
1564,It was like there was zero withdrawl from the medicine and I was shocked.
1565,I hate wasting money and time on medication I could go without.
1566,"She suffers from GAD too, but is still on her medication and is fine most of the time, besides money problems of course."
1567,"She knows I have GAD and has tried her best to support me, but I've been doing so well without my medicine, she just assumes I'm sick and tries to make me feel better."
1568,I don't want to get back on medicine because life without medicine AND GAD is ideal.
1569,Does medication help the what ifs and the feeling small?
1570,Does medication take away the choking feeling?
1571,Background: Yes I am on meds 40mg of Celexa and it helps a lot like 75-80% cured but still get anxiety attacks once in a while.
1572,"I am pretty good with mental health, I have an anxiety myself, but my girlfriend has anxiety and depression, she recently had her anti-depressant meds doubles, since then she has been terrified about going to work, she can't get up in the mornings, even getting out of bed seems scary."

1574,"New doc gave me some different prescriptions (I'm on high benzos, Klonopin, so we started with the benzos first) and told me to start the new meds right away, and that we would be going a new direction."
1575,"After I told him, and I quote ""fuck the new doctor, this is between you and me"" he finally stopped going off about it and we got down to talking about my treatment, directions, and meds."
1576,"He seemed to scramble and gave me a list of meds, telling me that ""we can try anything"" since my current meds aren't working."
1577,"After giving me a list, I was tasked with picking a new med or meds."
1578,"I was prescribed anxiety/depression medicine and it didn't help, got tested for gluten intolerance and allergies and that didn't help, went to a therapist and that didn't help."
1579,"I was so frustrated that I started looking into alternative medicine (acupuncture, etc."
1580,Also important to note is that I had tried heartburn medicines before but they weren't the same kind and they didn't helped.
1581,"I am a 27 year old male who owns his own place and has a decent job, I am able to push through a lot of the day to day stuff thanks to meds, but recently, my family has really been up my ass about visiting them."
1582,"And personally I've found medications just mess up my mindset even more, seeing as though drugs got me into this mess in the first place."
1583,I'm on my third medication for anxiety.
1584,The first two were zombie meds.
1585,and shouldn't I be on another medication aswell as the one I am currently on if this is happening?
1586,"I should mention that I've never taken allergy meds and have never been diagnosed with allergies but with my sinuses always being so  bad, I'm thinking I have some type of allergy."

1591,I've been considering getting on medication for my anxiety for a long time and I read so many things that say its good or bad and what not.
1592,"Just thought it would be interesting to put together a poll maybe a few of the questions could be..

- Are you on medication?"
1593,"(Y/N)    
- What kind of medication?"
1594,- How long have you been on medication?
1595,"(Scale 1-10)    
- Do you regret getting on medication at all?"
1596,Yesterday I saw my psychiatrist and he has suggested I change my meds (for anxiety and depression).
1597,"I'm not really concerned as I knew this would happen, but I do have an intense day of work tomorrow (informed my boss I was changing meds and may be a bit off colour this week, although I did not tell her the nature of the meds."
1598,"**For those of you that are taking medication...**

A."
1599,B. I've read that most mood medications have a negative impact on sex-drive/performance and can cause serious weight gain - have you found this to be the case for you?
1600,"**For those of you that are foregoing medication...**

1601,I don't want to be put on anxiety meds until I rule this out.
1602,I have never been on anxiety medication.
1603,Without medication?
1604,"Normally, when getting off a medication, I would feel proud, like I were finally cured of the disease, but as many of you know, this is not a disease you can cure."
1605,I have been to three different Dr's in regards to this and two of them prescribed different anti anxiety/anti depressant meds.
1606,"He prescribed medication to begin work on shifting me back towards a normal sleep routine but last night, it totally failed."
1607,"So I stopped and explained the situation with my doctor and my medication to which she just said, ""Well, that's not good."""
1608,"What are some other anti anxiety meds, and should I worry about addiction?"
1609,Hey guys I'm on a shit ton of medication ranging from lexapro to klonopin to lamictal and I've always gotten really sweaty under my armpits even with antiperspirant while putting on clothes out of some insecurity or anxiousness.
1610,I feel as though I have lots of deep issues with myself that need fixing/therapy beyond taking medications.
1611,I've never been on any mental health medicines before so I'm not even sure what to expect if I do get put on something.
1612,So when my friend (from a Southern European country) told me that she suffered from severe anxiety and got dismissed by her doctor and put on the wrong medication and had a terrible time finding a job out of school I actually doubted her (although I didn't say that) because reddit has convinced me that living literally anywhere else in the Western world would get rid of my anxiety completely.
1613,I'm not sure if that was the medicine getting me into a pattern or if that's just the nature of my miserable life.
1614,"Well ""suffer"" its a bit not well put because I alternate now taking meds."
1615,"Yesterday somehow I waked up, ate yogurt and took the meds I guess half of a 2,5 mg tablet  the ones that melt in mouth."
1616,"I know it has 6-8 hours half life time or more not sure , my doc said 9 to 12 hours .How you guys manage with this medicine ?"
1617,There years later after medication and therapy I tried to go back and finish only to have a miscarriage in the bathrooms there and start the attacks all over again.
1618,"I've been on pretty much all the medications, none of which have ever helped me at all aside from the occasional and temporary relief I get from Valium, which obviously comes at a massive price."
1619,I honestly do not wish to continue this medication because it does nothing to keep my thoughts from spiraling out of control.
1620,"My worry is, will medication make studying harder?"
1621,Should I ask for CBT and decline meds?
1622,What's your experience with medication been?
1623,I went and spoke to my doctor about this today and talked about medications that might work for me.
1624,I forgot my meds this morning too and I'm sure that's not helping.
1625,"I'm not sure if I should wait for my Depakote to take ""more affect"" and then see, or if I should just try some other medication."
1626,"**BIPOLAR RELATED:**

* I haven't had a single episode since I started my medication, so that's already a good start."
1627,"* I *want* the medicine to work, badly, so I'm afraid of that clouding my judgement."
1628,"Well, my meds are in at Costco...but I have no way to get there."
1629,I suffer from anxiety and depression and have been managing it well for the last 10 years using various medications.
1630,"I'm 31 and my husband and I would like a baby, so since January, I've been trying (with the help of my doctor) to get off my medication."
1631,"Through some alternative therapy, I feel like I'm really close to getting off my medication finally, but now I have another problem ... my job."
1632,"With a ton of practice, a xanax or two, and my regular medication, this isn't a problem."
1633,"I have no idea how long it takes to get pregnant, but in meantime, I'm like a sitting duck here with no meds."
1634,"Once I'm pregnant, I feel this is a more appropriate concession to ask for (to be allowed to skip the client presentations) but in the meantime, I'm not sure it's OK, so if they do ask me, I either say no (for some reason that I can't even begin to come up with) or go back up on my meds and do it, but lose the 6 months of progress I've made toward getting off these meds."
1635,(I know there are other medications that aren't so bad- like wellbutrin- but I'm breastfeeding my son and none of them are known to be safe.)
1636,"I do CBT exercises, take medication, and have been through extensive therapy so that I may live a very quiet, shut-in life while being financially dependent on my partner, as I am not emotionally fit to work."
1637,"Thanks to assholes who don't listen to their doctors and take their meds correctly &amp; the use of antibiotics in animal farming, one day there's gonna be some ridiculous super-illness like the Black Plague that wipes out a good portion of humanity."
1638,The only anti-anxiety meds to help are benzos.. but those motherfuckers scare me.
1639,"I took myself off my medications around October of last year (buspar, zoloft, xanax) and was actually was the turning point for me."
1640,"During my time on the medication I felt VERY suicidal, and at timea I very well considered it."
1641,So the first class begins and I am on edge despite the propranolol I took (this is basically a heart medication which tries to reduce the adrenalin dump we experience during stressful situations).
1642,I've had bad experiences with psych meds in the past and I'm terrified to start taking benzos (my mom was addicted to ativan until she died).
1643,"I've been on many meds for all of these afflictions except the anxiety, and nothing seemed to work, so at this point I'm not taking any."
1644,I'll have to make the decision to go on meds.
1645,"In the beginning, I felt great, but now with a sudden move I am starting to feel extremely anxious and helpless, and I don't feel my medication is doing a suitable job."
1646,"I'd like to put off going up a dosage in my meds if I can help it, which is where you come in."
1647,"I've been to the doctor and they prescribed me with Buspar, but I have yet to take it because I feel like meds aren't the answer."
1648,"Maybe it's weird, but - I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for several years now, and I've gotten better at handling them, without meds or therapy, just me and time."
1649,I'm on no medication except for birth control.
1650,I'm sure my anxiety from lack of meds isn't helping this either.
1651,I'm getting lots of palpitations... WAY more than I did without medication.
1652,I'm looking to do this without taking any meds if possible.
1653,"He then asked me if I was on medication, and said ""So if you're on medication, why are you having panic attacks?"""
1654,"Plus, I think if I go for help with my anxiety, they will be skeptical about giving me medication for it (even though I really think it would make a difference to me) because they would probably find out that there's every possibility I would abuse it for overdosing purposes."
1655,"But everyone was getting their a-level results today, and I just feel complete and utterly pathetic because I haven't done anything with my life for the last three years, apart from monumentally mess my health up to the point I'm on medication for my stomach and heart (and antidepressants)."
1656,"I've been on medication for about 3 weeks now, and I'll be able to see a counselor in 2 months (when the health insurance from my new job will begin)."
1657,So far all they've done is give him anti-psychotic medicine and they do group sessions were they state their mood and goals.
1658,"She also prescribed me some meds, one of which I took already: Propranolol."
1659,"I still feel nervous and scared, because I don't really want to take meds, but I HAVE to get through this quarter."
1660,"TL;DR- Huge panic attack, went to Doctor, got some meds, super tired and still nervous."
1661,"Don't swallow, but suck, because it tastes **rank**, and idea of ""medicine"" can help panic sufferers think you're *stopping a heart attack*."
1662,I am due to see a psychiatrist for medication in a few days after talking about it (medication) with my therapist.
1663,"After 4 hellish weeks of lots of medication, practice, and terrible, stuttering speeches.. And improvement!.."
1664,btw if it helps I am on no medication.
1665,Is 85 to old for medication?
1666,"age: 18

gender: male

type of anxiety: unknown

trigger examples: School, emotion, change

medications: none

country: US

insurance: parents"
1667,the past month i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and my medicine is not regulated at all so I'm still having super bad panic attacks.
1668,"My life is not without its ups and downs, I have an anxious disposition and experience bouts of depression, have been in therapy a few times during tough life experiences, but overall I've managed to get through life smoothly and without medication or serious issues."
1669,My therapist told me it was a good idea to try the Xanax now so I could get some rest and also maybe get used to the idea of medicine.
1670,"So now i'm here, hearing all these bad things about Xanax, having had a bad experience with it before, without knowing if it was just the panic attack or if it was the small amount of medicine affecting me."
1671,"I'm 90% sure it was just the anxiety of taking medicine making me have the bad reaction, and the medicine dosage was just so low that it didn't calm me down."
1672,"I see a therapist and take some SSRIs, but I spent my last therapy session crying my eyes out because i was so scared, and the medication doesn't really help when I'm this on edge."
1673,My meds dont make me happy anymore.
1674,"I have arranged a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy session that I am taking next week, and have been prescribed Citalopram as medication to help with my anxiety."
1675,"I had stowed away some medicine, but used it sparingly because I didn't want to run out."
1676,But I'm curious how this or similar medication has effected your day to day physical symptoms?
1677,"And you stopped taking your allergy meds, so your inner ears are all gunked up."
1678,"Also moving forward as we visit a counseling center/continue medication, is there anything I can do other than just be there?"
1679,I started seeing a new therapist a few weeks ago and she said we can try medication if I want but that she would like to give me tools to try to conquer panic on my own without medication.
1680,"I agree with that in theory but as time goes by I feel like I really want medication...really the thing that has worked for me well before is Xanax but I feel like if I ask for it I sound like a drug-seeker or something, or that I'm giving up on trying to help myself on my own with deep breathing or relaxation."
1681,"I got the call this evening that my blood work was much the same this time (to be expected so I'm on cholesterol medicine now), but she also said "" when that levels out your EKG will be better."""
1682,"I'm asking this question because, well i take xanax for my anxiety and i wanted to see what other medications that are out there that can help, because i do not like xanax too much."
1683,I have an oxygen machine that I turned on and I took my blood pressure medication also to help calm me down.
1684,"She started asking if things were cool, why am I being moody, eventually leading to a one sided conversation that I might be bipolar and probably need to speak to someone or get meds and that she had meds for a while etcetc."
1685,"When I was first diagnosed, I was put on tons of meds, we changed them every few weeks."
1686,"In middle school, I was on 4 mg of Klonopin daily, plus numerous other strong medications."
1687,"Since then, I have weened my way down to just 20 mg of Prozac daily, no other meds... And I recently went off that."
1688,"I was so happy to be off the meds, to be me finally, to know that I and I alone can manage my anxiety."
1689,"**

I find this feeling ironic, given the fact that now that I'm not on any medication, I *am* myself."
1690,"It makes me sad that I can't be happy on my own, it makes me depressed that I can't manage my anxiety without help from medication."
1691,I have to go back on the medication.
1692,"I know logically that going back on the meds is the next step in me feeling better, but I can't help but feel that I've lost this battle with anxiety."
1693,"I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and recently started seeing a psychiatrist to get my meds in order."
1694,"After about an hour I started having chest pains, and became worried that I took my meds wrong or something - which I didn't because I took the vyvanse earlier that morning and the Zoloft in the afternoon (this was before I was prescribed lorazepam)."
1695,"At the hospital, they did some more test and x-rays; the doctor said I was fine; they gave me some anxiety medication and released me."
1696,Only medication I am on is birth control pills.
1697,I've tried 5 different medications for anxiety although I haven't been back to the doctor since I got dumped.
1698,It just sucks that this medicine that actually works and makes me feel like a normal person is a pretty heavy duty narcotic.
1699,I am seeing my doctor on Thurs and was curious if anyone knows of any alternative medicines I should try.
1700,Now I can't afford to see anyone or continue medication but I really need it.
1701,"No one in my family is on board with the medication as it is, and it just makes me feel more different..."
1702,"I've struggled with OCD and anxiety for roughly 4 years now and it's been pretty manageable without meds but I feel like it's turned awful, now and I'm lost and freaking out."
1703,What sort of anxiety medications would I use for sexual performance anxiety?
1704,I don't want to start medications because I hear that it will mess with sex drive and that la the problem I'm trying to prevent in the first place!
1705,"As such, I was going to make an appointment with a doctor to consider medications."
1706,"I was wondering if you could provide advice on this, is there a particular medication that has worked for you?"
1707,Did you use a medication in conjunction with any other type of therapy?
1708,"Lastly, there is no big danger of becoming addicted to medication or having any other major adverse effects from usage right?"
1709,Hey guys i've been suffering heavy anxiety over the last 6 months and i've finally decided to try medication since therapy didnt seem to really work.
1710,I was just wondering if i should continue this medication or ask my doctor to siwtch so something else or it may be the caffeine that triggered it again.
1711,Took meds.
1712,But for as long as I can remember ...I've felt constantly tired and just overall sluggish so I've been kind of wondering if this could be the paxil as it is the only anxiety medication I've taken.
1713,"I'm also tired all the time, but I'm not sure if I can chalk that all up to the medication."
1714,"I am terrified of letting this relationship become ruined because of something I can't control, but I'm in the middle of a move and looking for a new job and I can't risk weening off this medication/changing and having a panic attack every day of work."
1715,Do I sound like someone who would benefit from a medication change?
1716,"Hi r/anxiety,

Something I've struggled with for a while is taking medications."
1717,Do any of you have suggestions for ways I could calm myself down when taking medications?
1718,"Tomorrow I have a consultation for meds, then therapy, then an appointment with my doctor to prescribe the actual medications."
1719,I asked a while ago for medication when my anxiety got really bad.
1720,But I'm also terrified of medication.
1721,"I used to have really bad GAD, the feeling of someone tightly gripping your heart ALL the time... i'm better now that  have medication, but now i really don't feel like anything anymore, i go to the gym, play the guitar, have a girlfriend, a good family and all that."
1722,"I would have no social life if not for the internet and I couldn't leave the house if not for brief moments of clarity afforded by smoking marijuana, being drunk or when on my medication, clonazepam."
1723,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for years, and I am not on any meds, fwiw."
1724,Since then I have been worried that my meds are working as good.
1725,I know the meds aren't going to completely take away anxiety.
1726,"Basically, I want to know if it's possible for me to actually be able to go out and have a good time with friends and have some kind of motivation in my life as a result of medication, because everything I read online seems to only tell me the negatives of these medications."
1727,She diagnosed me with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder which I am now taking meds for.
1728,I do have bills and expenses to pay for but I'm still living at home due to my condition and I'm currently on medication and seeing a counsellor which helps a bit.
1729,"I've got some pretty severe social anxiety that I'm currently on medication for, as well as likely GAD according to my doctor."
1730,Without relying on medication?
1731,Never been on any medication.
1732,"I went on medication and started therapy, and things got a lot better."
1733,I just want to be off the medication and normal again.
1734,"I know it's stupid to dwell on the dates but it's just particularly hard for me this year for whatever reason.mAlso coming up is the day I started taking meds and the day I ended up in hospital, and I guess I'll have a whole new set in the summer too after last summer."
1735,"Basically, I have life-long issues with anxiety and depression - I began seeing a doctor and taking medication two years ago this month."
1736,AFter almost getting off and changing meds im back on a full mill of 25mg of atenolol.
1737,"I'm 19, nearing 20 and have been considering getting medication for the past few years."
1738,EDIT: I'm not currently on any medications.
1739,"If anyone has been through something similar, or just knows about the medication, will this continue if I switch meds?"
1740,I don't know why Im having these thoughts I just know I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and I don't take meds for it.
1741,Does anyone else on similar SSRI medication use the Pill and if so have there been any complications for you?
1742,"In my early twenties, I was under the care of a psychiatrist briefly and she prescribed some fast acting medications such a valium."
1743,I am currently working with a psychiatrist and I would like to try a long term medication.
1744,"I assume because this is 10 years later, their might be some better medications with less side-effects."
1745,"TL:DR As far as long term anxiety medication, what do people recommend."
1746,"He said that, especially in comparison to medicine, the field is still in the dark ages and that a lot of this is based on trial and error."
1747,I've ended up going to urgent care or doctor visits a few times in the past couple years because of a 100 degree fever and total body aches and they tell me my white blood cells are normal and that its just stress/anxiety and give me painmeds and muscle relaxers.
1748,"I can’t help but think about a therapist sitting there listening to me and thinking “SNOOOOOOORE” while I blather on, and medicine is last resort for me, so I really want to start with some good reading."
1749,"How long should I expect for a diagnosis to result in some form of treatment or medication (a lot of what I'm experiencing causes me harm on a daily basis – not to say that there's a huge rush for getting help as I'm not at risk for self-harm whatsoever, but obviously I would like to start moving in a positive direction as soon as possible)."
1750,"I have a mild panic disorder and have made real progress in the past few years with therapy and meds, but I did have another panic attack last night after fighting with family."
1751,"I do not abuse any substances, and take my medication on time, 98% of the time."
1752,"(Previous ones have been unwilling to hand out medication, but I truly do need it)."
1753,What anti-anxiety medication (long-term) are people put on usually?
1754,At 25 I decided to stop taking the meds for fear that I had been on them for too long &amp; that I needed to live life without medicinal crutches.
1755,I'm not on any medication.
1756,"I can't get professional help since my parents would kick me out if I tried, they are very much against psychiatrists and medication for psychological issues."
1757,"So to start off I am 21 years old, male, I take medication for ADHD (Ritalin, 36 mg) and I live in the United states."
1758,"Finally I got medication and therapy, and they seemed to help, but it's like a xenomorph: constantly evolving and finding better ways to kill me."
1759,I hate that I can't tell if my medicine works or doesn't.
1760,"The pain medicine makes me want to puke, no idea how people get addicted to those, haha."
1761,"I'm comforted by the successes I've had already, and I do take medication but it's hard not to get into a spiral of anxiety, especially because I pay all my own bills."
1762,So I haven't been taking my meds for about two weeks.
1763,Guess I'm going to just tuck this half a pill away somewhere and in 6 months when I can (hopefully) stop taking these meds I can take it as my last dose (presuming I'll be weaned off them and go back to half-pills before quitting?).
1764,"Must have meds to feel that way, feel depressed upon waking up."
1765,"Became much more manic, but not completely, without the anxiety meds to tranquilize me.|Self: At this point I become oddly extraverted and manic, my mind starts racing more."
1766,"Didn't want to do that, so I tried to get both medications from mom with a knife (to make her know I seriously need it) (!!"
1767,"Due to paperwork they don't get me medication until the end of my stay, where I have a panic attack (Just the stress of being there, it's a shitty place and I don't have a private room) and start shaking uncontrollably until I bit my lips and bled."
1768,"After the panic attack they transfer me to hospital #1|No meds until panic attack.|I didn't even see a psychologist, fucking useless hospital."
1769,"First 2 days at H. #1|Hospital 1's staff conflicted with me alot, wouldn't let me into my treatment info and wouldn't let me sign consent forms for medication."
1770,"Rest of stay (2 days)|I go back on Zoloft and anxiety medication, but I decide to reject the anxiety meds."
1771,"This was the first time I realized I may be manic, my weekend doctor observed this in me but didn't know if I was bipolar or it was the meds."
1772,"I reject the anxiety meds, but couldn't get Xanax for as-needed upon release.|Still Maj. Dep and General Anxiety, but I may be bipolar."
1773,"Today, morning|Serious suicidal ideations in the morning (first time since hospital stay #1), then take meds and become hypermanic and close to inconherent, a serious basketcase."
1774,"Background info: Girl, teenager, started like anxiety meds 2 years ago."
1775,"Alright, I've been on strong anxiety medication for a few months and apparantly can only be on it for 6 months max."
1776,I want to know if this is related to the fact that I'm on the anxiety meds and if coming off them would help.
1777,The fact that one of the doctors a couple years ago gave me a prescription jock itch medication (I didn't mention that it could be skin irritation) that didn't work makes me worry he messed up as well and I actually have angina or heart disease.
1778,Two years ago I started seeing a doctor and taking medication because I just couldnt function without my boyfriend taking care of me.
1779,Should I ask my doctor to go off medication?
1780,Is your life better or worse since you stopped medication?
1781,"On May 2013 i jumped on 50mg zoloft, im very against meds but i couldn't handle anymore i was on the verge of suicide."
1782,"2 weeks after the meds started to take place and finally i could go back to collage and start working out again(had a panic attack in the gym) and the anxiety calmed a little on me but the panics attack ofcourse hit everyday, i tried meditating and taking long walks but it didn't make any big improvements."
1783,Semb 2013 decided to withdrawal zoloft and go without taking any meds.
1784,"9 Months later im meds free,smoke free and im living a healthy life."
1785,"I'm sure the propranolol is contributing to a bit of my dizziness since it is used to treat high blood pressure and mine is relatively average, but I've been dizzy and clumsy like this from my anxiety long before being put on meds."
1786,"I'm the first to admit that I have a problem with anxiety and physical symptoms related to it, no doubt about it, but I don't want to go to a doctor for it because I strongly believe that my mental state shouldn't be controlled by relying on medication."
1787,"Maybe if it gets to the point of needing to I will, but I've only heard bad or neutral experiences from meds and I don't want to become dependent on them to function like a normal person."
1788,"I feel like a fool in front of my parents for causing this scene, even though my mom, aunt, and grandmother all take anti- anxiety and anti depression medication including xanax."
1789,"I've been through a handful a meds, and thankfully,  Celexa was the one that worked best for my biochemist."
1790,I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the right sub but I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I am currently on medication for them.
1791,"I am 
&gt;currently not on medication for it because the attacks are very 
&gt;infrequent and most of the time i can deal with them myself."
1792,"Anyone have the same fear of new medicine, have been through a switch or have taken Prozac?"
1793,I'm so sick of these meds not working for me.
1794,I usually have to vomit if the nausea is really bad because it is the only thing besides my dwindling supply of Zofran (anti-nausea medication) that makes it better.
1795,Before posting this I searched this sub reddit and the web about pros and cons about this medication.
1796,When I described my problems I've been having he said that some people have good days and bad days and they need a band aid medicine for that (I'm assuming like Xanax or something).
1797,I have also never taken any kind of anxiety medicine before except for over the counter st john's wort which has never really worked.
1798,"I've been taking medication for my anxiety for a while now, and it has made a difference."
1799,"So my question is, is this something that I just have to work through, or should I be getting some different medicine to help alleviate some of it?"
1800,Are there other ways to treat anxiety without prescription medication?
1801,(other than prescription meds)
1802,I don't want to take meds I want to deal with it myself because I know I can.
1803,"I told my doctor that I've sensitive to medication, so he prescribed 10 mg Prozac (generic) and .25 mg of Xanax (generic) when needed."
1804,This is my first time taking any type of medication.
1805,She advocated that I take medication with my therapy at first but I was stubborn and refused.
1806,"I don't know much about his credentials, but I can tell he is a special man: he is in his eighties and still very dedicated to his art (he called it an art, specifically, which impressed me since I have always felt that way about medicine in general)."
1807,I’ve thought about seeing a psychologist but I don’t feel like talking about things (not like I can do that anyways…) or taking meds will help.
1808,I can't decide if I want to try medication.
1809,I could eat better and exercise... or I could resort to medication.
1810,I'm really iffy with taking prescribed medication like Prozac or Lexapro when it comes to anxiety issues I'm having.
1811,Any tips or meds that have worked for you.
1812,"I don't like taking medication because I'm a firm believer that it actually doesn't help, it just helps me sleep sometimes."
1813,I've been on SSRIs and the like but being on medication made me even more anxious because I knew how bad the withdrawals were.
1814,"I'm worried, because my anxiety has actually been better and I'm hoping this isn't a sign that my meds are failing or something."
1815,"My meds, my doctor, my therapist...nothing is helping."
1816,My doctor wasn't much help; just prescribed more meds.
1817,"So I've been off my medication for almost 12 months, have been attack free for 18 months and tonight out of the blue I just had an attack."
1818,"However, I'm not sure if this is due to the medication."
1819,"She's also one of those people who doesn't believe in me ever taking medication, and has bought 'vitamins' for me my entire life to help with the depression and anxiety."
1820,I have taken medicine but nobody ever sees a difference because it is all internal.
1821,"I am currently prescribed effexor and buspar, but I want to start taking some vitamins and nutrients that will also aid the medication for a good mental health."
1822,I have an appointment in a month to discuss meds with my doctor and im extremely anxious about that.
1823,"I'm 22, female, with social anxiety, and I've never been on meds before."
1824,I'm also worried about types of medication.
1825,"I really want to be on beta blockers or something similar because I've heard they help with the physical symptoms, but I also really want to be able to drink on whatever meds I have to take."
1826,"It's just that it's what I do with my friends, and I don't want to give that up or to have to tell them that I can't drink any more because I'm on meds."
1827,"I already went to the doctor a couple times, got medication, but a pharamacist who is a friend aswell told me to not take it, he said it was way too strong for me (I am 19)."
1828,She recommended I take some meds and see how they work.
1829,But when I tried to discuss meds I was kind of blown off.
1830,"Now this kind of annoyed me, I've been battling these issues for years and my doctor won't even consider medication."

1837,"I don't believe it's necessary for everyone, but at the same time, taking medication when you feel you need it isn't necessarily a bad thing."

1846,"I was diagnosed with OCD and Dermatillomania at 16 and I'm 22 now, and my process was much smoother than his; I got help with medicine and therapy right away and I have an extremely supportive family, while his is supportive but misinformed and closed."

1859,"Have you thought of harming yourself daily because the idea of leaving your house and dealing with a job, something that apparently everyone else in the world can deal with without psych meds, therapy and tears, is too much to deal with at least 3 times a week?"
1860,Finally I'd just like to add that from tomorrow I will be starting on some meds.
1861,"I just couldn't imagine after the horror of exams and finishing my first year of law, taking on an internship without medication."
1862,Hello I have just been given medication for my anxiety and the medication has been giving pretty bad side effects while in at work.
1863,I have been told that if my doctor prescribes me medication that's not over the counter then technically I've been diagnosed and must write a note or give me a copy of the notes the doctor has made about me.

1872,"The medication never really helped at all, so these are things I experience at least weekly anyway."

1874,"Some background

After just ""getting by"" with medications I started to do some research and found that the medications can actually cause the anxiety I was feeling."
1875,"I have never been on medication before, so I think I'll stick to one a day and go from there."
1876,"They said I can't just stop taking the medication without calling my doctor first, but I need this right now for the shit that's going on in my life."
1877,"I was on medication and tranquilizers till my mom begged me to get off of them at 15 and a half, back then I had anxiety with the slightest things."
1878,And what is the point of socialised medicine if it comes to a stop when our outdated monarch has a birthday?
1879,"TLDR; This is going to be too long, so I’ll just say that I am in need of a suggestion for a medication that will reduce my anxiety, increase my focus, and not make me sick or act weird."
1880,and I'm getting the thyroid medication adjusted.
1881,"So bottom line: I'm really scared to take this medication, but I think it would help me in the long run."
1882,The new MD (I just seen her two weeks ago) changed my entire meds around.
1883,"I feel like the medication isn't working, but I'm afraid to come off it."

1886,I've come off these meds once before and it took me 6 months.

1888,Have any of you had any luck with coming off medication and using more natural remedies?
1889,I've been on prozac for 20 days now and haven't seen much improvement but I know it takes time for some medication to start fully working.

1891,"I only took the meds one more night, and called it quits."
1892,"4 days ago I tried taking medication for my problems (citalopram), and I barely made it through a day."
1893,"So I can't take medication, meditation doesn't help, and the therapy doesn't seem to stick with me."
1894,"I have SEVERE anxeity disorder(to the point im thinking of applying for disability)...my husband is going to help me make a weighted blanket and a small tent (dont ask, small spaces help make me feel secure)...we dont have money to pay for a bunch of meds(im already on 4) and I really need some cheap things to help me deal with my attacks....does anyone have any little tricks or tools that are DIY that helps?"

1899,"E told me she would stay with me, as long as I got medication to help my anxiety/anger."
1900,"They refused to give me a medication consult, stating that because I was getting out, they wouldn't be able to monitor the effects properly."
1901,The earliest they could see me for a medication consult was the end of October.
1902,Then I had a break; I got an appointment with a PCM for tomorrow afternoon for a medication consult.
1903,I am quite apprehensive regarding medication since I was on it once and it did nothing and only had bad side effects.
1904,I have heard some horror stories going off this medication from those who were on much higher doses.
1905,"I'm prescribed several medications, none of which ever seem to work."
1906,For the most part its pretty contained and I'm not on any medication at the moment.
1907,I'm not sure how much the medication is really helping.
1908,I feel like the medication is to blame for that.
1909,"I've been on Many medications (Zoloft, buspar, lexapro, Xanax, klonopin, welbutrine and some other I can't think of right now) and all they do is calm me down and let me exist."
1910,I'm not currently on medication.
1911,"I do smoke marijuana as a medication, and have been for the last 6 months or so."
1912,"I worry now that I'll have issues with my insurance, or have difficulty obtaining medicine in the future that I legitimately need because I was labeled as a drug seeker."
1913,"I started to get panic attacks around this time, for over a year I tried different medications."
1914,Face to face is just too much for me to handle while I'm off my meds.
1915,I just can't handle it and don't want to be reliant on medication that makes me slow and stupid.
1916,"My meds are useless, journaling doesnt help, excersize does nothing for me, I'm falling apart and I just don't know what to do."
1917,Seeing a psychiatrist and getting on meds (Zoloft and Klonopin) has been the one MOST EFFECTIVE move in feeling better and being a productive member of society.
1918,Yet I feel generally good being on my meds.
1919,I don't want to go back on meds.
1920,I had a problem with illegal drugs during my first time at university and being on legal meds would bring back some bad memories.
1921,I really don't want to go on medication or anything and am wondering if someone that has gone through the same thing has any advice to better myself.
1922,"But then again, all of this could be psychosomatic and linked to my newfound anxiety and dramatic medicine changes as of late."
1923,"This is the first time in my entire life I've ever been on medication, and it's hard to imagine daily life without it now."

1927,How has everyone coped with being on meds at work?
1928,I am just wondering whether I will be ok taking meds and working at the same time.
1929,"Since then, my doc put me on some strong anti-anxiety meds, and it seems most of my secondary symptoms have disappeared."
1930,"I was diagnosed with GAD my freshman year of college (~4 years ago), and since then I have been on 4 different medications."
1931,I have had a few friends give me some anxiety meds when things have been really bad.
1932,"Should I be generic when discussing meds and say something like I've taken this before, and it didn't work but this other one did?"
1933,"Before I get blasted, yes I know the dangers in taking other people's medicine, but the risk outweighed the benefits."
1934,"And yes I was taking expired meds, but again, risk vs benefit."
1935,I was constantly in a state of anxiety and had constant panic attacks to the point that I got a therapist and began medication.
1936,I'm never too sure if the anxiety went away because I ended and completely cut off the relationship or if it was the medication.
1937,"I've tried medication, but the first pill they gave me (mirtazapine) possibly made my symptoms worse, and i was puking every morning."
1938,I haven't been able to get myself to stick with any medication since.
1939,After considering everything he suggested I might have General Anxiety Disorder but said medication wouldn't be his recommendation at this time.
1940,I dont want to see a doctor because i dont want to be prescribed meds.
1941,"I will start my medication tomorrow (10mg, 30 count, once a day), and am curious if I am able to have a beer or two while on the medication."
1942,"Now I am no asking if I can down my pill with a beer, but if I take my medication in the morning, can a have a few beers at the brewery in the evening?"
1943,Or is this one of those drugs that must be taken everyday for the the medication to continue working?
1944,"I'm having anxiety over a medical situation where my current doctor wants me to go on some serious meds for Crohn's (a biologic) and I'm not sure they're the right choice, but he is insistent."
1945,"Medical stuff gives me heavy anxiety because I don't want to mess up or find out something isn't covered by my insurance, and on top of that I don't want to make the wrong decision about what medicines to take."
1946,I finished up the last year of college with no counseling or meds.
1947,It has seemed to get even worse lately since I got on these meds.
1948,"Men there's more to it but it sucks ,hopefully I here back from hem tomorrow cause I only got 30 days of meds left"
1949,"It's 2:30am (really 3:30am GRRR time change), and I took my meds on time (anti-thyroid pill, beta blocker, xanax, ambien, plus an antibiotic for abscessed tooth), went to bed."
1950,When this medication after 6 or so months failed to do anything I was put on Effexor.
1951,"Now I should note that I did not have a family doctor at this time, I was perscribed these meds from a clinnic physcian, and eventually I stopped taking the effexor and only took the klonopin when needed."
1952,"I've been taking lexapro for around 4 months now, it has been the most effective medication i've taken for my anxiety but the worst side effect is anorgasmia, decreased sex drive and just a general disconnection with my sexuality."
1953,So ever since my doctor and I changed my meds (lowered my level of lithium and increased my abilify) my anxiety has gone through the roof.
1954,What is frustrating is that we can't just change the meds back because the reason we had to change them was a tremor related to the lithium so I feel kind of stuck.
1955,This time I'm willing to try medication.
1956,More or less I didn't want to become a zombie like some people said happened once people were put on meds.
1957,"But now that I see that my depression isn't going anywhere but instead manifesting itself into other horrors, maybe medication is the right route to take."
1958,"I've overcome this once before, though, without medications."
1959,"I feel compelled to share what helped me get through this last time, because this time I was too quick to jump to meds."
1960,I've tried meds before.
1961,Is there really a medication out there that won't give me these side effects?
1962,I am seeing multiple therapists and doctors and am on meds but it just isn't getting better.
1963,"I've done a lot of research and I thought I had social anxiety, driving anxiety, I thought I was a hypochondriac, I thought I had claustrophobia, I always think if I've drank the night before that I'm having alcohol withdrawals or I'm super unhealthy, that my ADHD medication is the reason for anxiousness (even though it's never ever been a problem in my 10 years of being on it)... but because I've thought ALL of those things and I relate to each and every single one of those and I know it's unlikely it's ALL of them, I've discovered that it might just be more specific than that."
1964,"Up until that point, I was SUPER against taking medication, but things were getting out of control (clearly) and just therapy wasn't working."
1965,"During that period where I went off my medication, I was also not in therapy at all, and I ended up going to the walk in crisis centre as I was having anxiety attacks and the heart palpitations were coming back and I was feeling suicidal."
1966,"I had to go through my whole history and everything with him, which was rough, and then when we talked about medication, he thought that I should switch mediations because I can't even take the typical dosage (60mg) without side effects, and thought I was still experiencing a lot of anxiety."
1967,I'm so scared to switch meds and have horrible side effects again and do poorly at my job that I LOVE and get fired or something.
1968,":) 

**TL;DR: Have OCD, social phobia and depression, don't like having to take medication."
1969,"New psychiatrist wants to switch me to new meds, usually starts with Zoloft and clomipramine."

1973,"I took medication back in my early middle school days for like a month, then I tried a few therapists since then and I didn't really like it at all."
1974,Not on any medication but it is getting worse.

1998,"It gets in the way of so much I want to do, and even on medication and seeing a therapist, it's a steep, uphill battle."
1999,"I feel like a total shit putting someone on the spot to ask them for meds because I realize I risk making them feel ashamed or inadequate if they don't think they can part with them, and also that it is just rude in general, but I'm desperate to avoid a complete meltdown."

1. wondered if the chemicals in food, like MSG in the eggroll you just ate, might possibly interact poorly with your meds
1. stick a Xanax in your pocket unprotected?"
2031,Told someone all of the medicines you took that day in case this was the time that this really wasn't really a panic attack and you really did pass out and need to be rushed to the hospital for surgery for a life threatening situation and wanted to be sure the doctors and anesthesiologist knew exactly what was in your system so they wouldn't give you a lethal combination!

2053,I actually don't want to take medication much at all...but I have been seeing limited progress with my therapist (we are speaking tomorrow to discuss a new plan of action or the possibility of me finding a new therapist) and there have been enough times lately where I am non-functioning enough that I kinda relented and decided to consider it.
2054,Doctor suggested three meds...and right now I've been prescribed 30mg of Cymbalta for 7 days then I am to up the dosage to 60mgs.

2063,I have tried a lot of different medications.
2064,I'm thinking about all the panic attacks I will get and all the medication I won't be able to afford.
2065,"I'm going to the doc in a few days to be put back on some meds again, it's at the point where it affects my job and willingness to just go outside even if it's just for a walk."
2066,So does anyone know of medicine where it replicates the anxiety removal effects of said shrooms and speed without the trippyness?
2067,Another checkup is scheduled in 3 weeks to see if the meds have also helped with the ADD since a lot of the symptoms overlap for both conditions.
2068,"Despite my personal dealings with these disorders, I struggle with counseling patients on anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medications."
2069,"For the most part, they just want to pick-up their medication and leave."
2070,What can I do to help people feel more at ease when it comes to these medications and conditions?
2071,How do you feel when I ask you if you're taking your medications every day?
2072,Is it okay if I ask you how your medication is working for you?
2073,I am 22 and currently taking medication for depression/ anxiety (escitalopram/cipralex.)
2074,"I'm doing everything I can to stay relaxed and healthy (therapy, medication, etc."
2075,"And he gave me my anti-anxiety medication no problem, so certainly he would understand me not exactly wanting to go out and get a pap."
2076,"I recently went to a psychiatrist to see if I could find any medication that would work for me, since over the past few years I've tried zoloft/lexapro and xanax which neither really did anything for me minus the xanax.. and recently been taking way too much of that because I started a new position at work a few weeks ago and my panic attacks are pretty frequent."
2077,He asked me if I wanted to get on any meds but I said no.
2078,He always is taking new medication which makes him over weight and fucks up his skin with stretch marks and pimples.
2079,I took some medication and I got help from different people and things were working fine for me.
2080,I'm not on any medication anymore (I used to take prozac but stopped because it caused sexual dysfuntion).
2081,"I'm seriously considering therapy and getting on a new medication (currently taking sertraline, which is zoloft ?)"
2082,I need internet hugs and maybe thoughts on peoples different experiences on different medications.
2083,But now that i am taking those medications the fast heart beat really isn't there anymore when i have the attacks.
2084,"I'm hopeful of this option, as I feel I could get a lot better if I invested some time with competently-guided CBT or perhaps medication."
2085,"Ive had quite a few things happen lately that are my major triggers for anxiety and i expected more panic attacks, upped my medicine, etc."
2086,I finally took the leap to get medication for the anxiety from my GP.
2087,"Also do this medication ""correct a chemical imbalance"" or is it just suppressing anxiety symptoms(while I take the medication and things go back to like they were before the meds)?"
2088,"I have a stressful job, so I'm not sure if it's from the meds or my mind racing all of the time about work things."
2089,"So far I've done trials for 5 different medications, each one has failed."
2090,"I don't even notice I'm taking the medication, I feel absolutely no different in any way."
2091,"-----

###Story

So far, every medication I've tried has been an utter failure."
2092,"These medications are:

* Effexor
* Zoloft
* Xanax
* Prozac
* Lexapro

I took the maximum allowed dosage for each."
2093,I wouldn't be so angry if I at least felt *something* when I took these medications.
2094,"At no time during any of my 5 trials could I even tell I was taking the medication, it felt the exact same when I was taking the medication as when I wasn't."
2095,"To test this, when I was supposed to transition off of a few of the medications, I didn't bother to taper off; instead, I went from taking the maximum dosage one day to not taking any from the next day on - I noticed nothing."
2096,"Some of the medications made me very slightly more sleepy throughout the day (which was really bad given that this is actually the largest reason I was seeking help in the first place), but also probably the worst side-effect was intensifying my RLS to the point that I couldn't control my leg movement when I laid down and wouldn't be able to sleep for days."
2097,Is this the reason the medications have no effect on me?
2098,**Would someone who's not depressed/anxious notice any effects from taking medication?
2099,"Should I ask my doctor to only prescribe medication for anxiety only, ignoring my depression until later?"
2100,"A lot of it is just backstory/thoughts, hopefully it doesn't detract from my overall question about what I should be feeling/expecting when taking medication."
2101,Well I've been reading a lot and I start to get scared of continuing with the meds.
2102,I'm not depressed and I'm getting the meds thanks for anxiety and being able to eat solid food because I'm scared of choking.
2103,I can handle a week of this I guess but then I read about how hard it is to withdraw from the meds once you're on them and that you will feel like shit and it's the worst feeling you can experience.
2104,"Hah, worried my anxiety meds won't work, I just realized how cliche that is."
2105,And I will really really give these meds a shot.
2106,"I was doing so well on medicine, I don't know what changed."
2107,"So ideally, my pain would get better thanks to other treatments and I could also figure out to deal with my inhibitions and social anxiety without meds."
2108,"He said if it gets to the point where I'm constantly anxious during the day, he would give me a longer lasting medication."
2109,Any ideas what this medication would be?
2110,"And for those who take medications at work, what do you take and how do they work?"
2111,"I went to a Family Doctor, and she gave me some medication that helps when I have the ""feel like dying"" panic attacks."
2112,The Dr. tried finding me a cardiologist and a psychiatrist (or psychologist)- one that proscribes medication; that are within my medical network.
2113,"As a disclaimer, I don't want to say that medication is bad."
2114,I've been in a place where I had no other choice but to use medication.
2115,"I began taking medication in March and started seeing my therapist regularly, which allowed me to do ""normal"" things again."
2116,The psychiatrist switched my meds from Celexa to Pristiq and I've had three sessions of talk therapy for 45 minutes each.
2117,"I don't want to just take a pill and be done with it, I know that meds won't cure anything, they just make things manageable."
2118,"They prescribed some type of medication, I took it, but within two weeks quit taking it because of the way it made me feel."
2119,"Here is the short version, I was recently diagnosed with anxiety disorder/panic attacks and after trying to deal with it for a while and having it wreck destroy my body I finally asked for some meds."
2120,"I am seeing so many people advising sufferers to get medication, as the FIRST step in their treatment."
2121,"If you have really bad anxiety, yes, sometimes medication is useful but medication doesn't change your thoughts which means you are more likely to relapse when you go off and you will have more trouble with withdrawal symptoms just because it will freak you out more."
2122,"If you have CBT sessions and you are on anti-anxiety medication, your brain will not learn very well to habituate to everything that makes you anxious."
2123,"Some medications are ok to take with CBT, some aren't."
2124,My main point is that newcomers or new sufferers come on this website and ask for help and people straight away tell them to take medication when their symptoms aren't always really severe.
2125,"All I am saying is that people should be informed of BOTH options - therapy and meds, rather than just meds] ***"
2126,"Actually, I just came back from my Target pharmacy for my anti-aniexty and depression medication, thankfully I have insurance through my mother's husband who is a raging alcoholic and drug addict, but at least has a job."
2127,I ask the technician to place back at least one medication that I know I still have pills of at home.
2128,"The medication used for the depression has a side effect when coming off of it...major depression and suicidal thought/tendencies, which has happened before and is a terrible feeling I wouldn't wish upon anyone else."
2129,"My other medication, allows me to function 'normally' by calming me and keeping me from experiencing severe anxiety and/or panic attacks."
2130,"I choose to put back the depression medication and felt so worthless, even more than I usually do."
2131,"I've got the meds now but I'm very scared about it happening again, even after taking a dose today."
2132,"And I keep having fits of crying that I seriously can't control, which is embarrasing :( I'm even feeling like I'm back to before the meds."
2133,I am currently seeing a psychiatrist for adult ADD (and only take my  meds during the week.)
2134,"I start feeling sick which makes the whole thing even worse ETC ETC...

For example right now im worrying that I have some disorder as I seem to be a lot more anxious than everyone else, my mohter is a very anxious person but am i just more anxious and need some different thought structures or am i Mental in need of medication etc...

Basically Ill end this with what I imagine is a fairly common phrase.."
2135,"We were together until recently, she broke up with me because she wanted to sort our her various issues without always relying on me

While obviously it hurts, I want to be supportive and so was wondering if anyone had any advice with how to at least make things a bit easier for her as at the moment all I've ever been able to do is tell her ""It's going to be ok""

We're both 18 and she's not on any medication; she's been diagnosed by her doctor but the only thing they prescribed her were phone call appointments with a therapist, which she dislikes and some sort of weekly group sessions that she only went to one of because it was not for her

I just want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to help her even as only her friend."
2136,"I'm off of my medication and have been for over a year now, without any significant issues... aside from this."
2137,I'm not sure if it's worth a mention but I'm currently on medication for ADHD.
2138,"Anyways, I was going to a doctor and was on a waiting list for a therapist, I’ve been through plenty of meds for depression and anxiety, my last prescription I’ve taken was a generic clonazepam, or k-pin."
2139,I’ve never driven in my life and I’ve only had one job in my life and that was through college when I was going and taking my medication.
2140,I also fear medication.
2141,I've seen therapists regularly and have been on and off of antidepressants and anti anxiety meds.
2142,I have been having issues with my memory since I started medication to help my anxiety.
2143,TL;DR: I take anxiety meds to make my life easier but they make me stupid and I still have anxiety issues.
2144,I was kind of hoping to see someone that has the ability to prescribe medication since I don't really trust my general doctor for that sort of thing.
2145,"All I know is that studying medicine and human biology has made me a bit more anxious about my health (and more motivated to lose weight, get healthy etc even though it's difficult) and right now I worry I'm tachycardic."
2146,"I have seen no positive outcome in medication, but since my intestinal pain has worsened (as a result of bulimia most likely and among other things,) I'm not exactly sure what to tell my doctor first."
2147,"My logic is, get the mental shit down, get the ""meds"" I need and deal with the intestinal, stomach, liver problems from my drug/alcohol abuse as well as, bulimia later... but that doesn't seem too logical."
2148,first i argue with myself that it's not that bad -- i can handle the attack without meds!
2149,I recently got a job in an office and started taking a new kind of medication.
2150,And I don't really know many other people taking meds for anxiety to compare notes with.
2151,This is my first time taking meds for my anxiety and I am extremely nervous.
2152,I'm most nervous about the potential sexual side effects right now and I'm worried that all of my nerves and my anxieties about the medication will end up counteracting it or I'll have a load of placebo effects happening to me because I'm so scared of certain things.
2153,"I've tried medications, pharmaceuticals to quell these reactions to stimulus - and while some have helped, I often find I can't cope with the laundry list of side effects."
2154,I'm already on meds for my anxiety.
2155,"He put me on Buspirone, with xanax as an emergency medication."
2156,"Today, we decided we should try another medication, and it came down to Lexapro being what I am trying now."
2157,"I was wondering if anyone had any experience with the medication, of generally what to expect or some red flags I need to discuss with my doctor if they occur."
2158,"I don't want to be on meds, I don't even think that it would help me any."
2159,"Isn't there some way to beat this anxiety legitimately, without the use of meds?"
2160,"I felt sad so much, figured it was a side effect of the medicine."
2161,My dad has since scheduled a psych evaluation so hopfully I can get properly medicated because the medicine i take now is always a tossup between crippling fear or crushing sadness.
2162,"'Normal', happy, carefree, invigorated... until the medication wears off again.. Until my next prescribed doseage."
2163,I'll be better tomorrow.. after my meds.. not so useless and high strung..
2164,Can anyone give me suggestions for meds I can suggest to my doc so I don't make an ass of myself?
2165,So medication is unfortunately necessary for the time being to calm my body down.
2166,Any suggestions on what I should do or what medications or therapies have worked best for you I would love to hear!
2167,I constantly worried that people would still find me annoying even though I've been taking my meds for a few years now.
2168,I'm in a relationship with medication.
2169,I come from a very anti pharmaceutical background and taking medication probably depresses me more but I have no choice.
2170,"So basically, I want to stop taking this medicine in its total form, some day, but I definitely want and need to take the 1mg off at nighttime sooner rather than later."
2171,"One last also: any other alternatives for anxiety medication that aren't in the  benzodiazepine class and are effective without the long-term side effects and highly addictive potential of  benzodiazepines, would be greatly accepted and noted!"
2172,He also said that I need to see a doctor soon and get on anxiety medication.
2173,How can I afford to pay for a therapist AND a doctor's appointment AND medication?
2174,I'm still on medication.
2175,I've been off meds since May after being on them for a year and a half.
2176,We're in the UK if that changes anything in regards to medication/healthcare.
2177,"And if you're interested, I'm going to be using this medicine while I also work on the cognitive part and doing exposure therapy."
2178,I decided that I'd ask about medication.
2179,"My parents insurance will cover medication entirely, but not a penny in coverage for a psychologist."
2180,"I *would* go back to my doctor and just ask for medications, but hey surprise!"
2181,Obviously I didn't know much about medications at that point.
2182,"So due to various circumstances, I will be unable to get a prescription for my medication until the 27th."
2183,"I was lucky to stock up on my antidepressant for 2 months, but my anxiety and sleeping medication will be out."
2184,"I have gotten so much better, but it feels like it's all due to the meds."
2185,I remember some blissful times while on meds.
2186,"So far I've managed to only take the prescribed anxiety medication, but the urge to fall back into my old habits is becoming too strong."
2187,"I had been getting support, tried medicine, then I just stopped."
2188,"I want to take any medication that will make me stop being so overwhelmed and afraid, I don't care if they make me feel practically nothing."
2189,I used to be afraid of meds but now I just don't care.
2190,"Please, if anyone has any info that would be helpful, or would like to share their experiences with meds, I would really love to hear."
2191,"Hey reddit,

I felt like sharing my experience, because I postponed taking meds for very long due to fear of side effects and because psycho meds are ""evil"" in my eyes anyway."
2192,"I already feel better, but it most certainly isn't from the meds."
2193,That's awesome though because in 2-3 weeks I should feel *even better* when the meds finally do their thing!
2194,"As I said, the nausea sucks for me, and the tremors are annoying because I hate shaking hands and have them all the time (even before the meds), but that's just me."
2195,"The thing is, I know I'll get better in a couple of weeks due to the meds, and the downsides aren't a real issue."
2196,"*)

Edit: I take my meds in the morning btw."
2197,"The first day I just felt weird, but that was honestly expected taking those evil meds ;)"
2198,I came in today telling them that I'm not happy with the medication as the Zoloft is making my RLS worse and the vistaril does nothing for my panic attacks.
2199,I was sat down with a PA who told me medication isn't the solution and that I need to be in group therapy 5 days a week 8 hours a day.
2200,"I know medication isn't the solution, I told her I wanted to use it temporarily to get my life back on track but she just repeated herself."
2201,Fortunately I complained to another PA and have an appointment tomorrow with an actual psychiatrist that is going to try other medication with me.
2202,"Best I've felt in a long while, and in my elation, I somehow forgot to take my meds (Probably because I fell asleep in my workroom and then went straight to bed skipping the much needed step between)."
2203,"During the school year, I considered going on medication for depression."
2204,"What I want to know is, for anyone who took anxiety medication, did it help you cope with your relationships?"
2205,Your input about either the medication or maintaining relationships is greatly appreciated :)
2206,I've been on anti anxiety medication to help me sleep since I was 14 years old.
2207,"I was on medication (clonazepam, 1mg as necessary) for a couple months and even started to go back on my Bipolar meds I had been on when first diagnosed (Lamictal)."
2208,I have since been off all prescription medications for the last 7 months.
2209,"I do not want to be on medication, and I was just wondering what other people’s experience has been managing mood disorders without medication."
2210,What are some pointers anyone might have for coping without medication that have been proven to work for you?
2211,Gone on and off medication over the years but don’t want to poison my brain with prescription drugs.
2212,I want to know how I can continue to move forward with my personal growth WITHOUT the help of medication.
2213,"I already have pretty bad depersonalization due to my Anxiety and medication, and I'm worried that it will worsen greatly, becoming debilitating."
2214,"I was given anti-anxiety meds but because I get the I-don't-give-a-shit attitude I'm afraid that if I feel suicidal, I just might follow through with it."
2215,"I've now had the trembling, retching, loss of appetite (and weight loss), lack of sleep and feelings of depression for nearly one month, my doctor told me it's anxiety and have been put on medication, and counselling to start in the next week or two."
2216,"I should probably look into getting some sort of medication for this at this point, I brought it up to my doctor and I've been referred to the behavioural medicine department for an opening they have sometime in March."
2217,"I attributed some of this to the medication, but once I started school again all the old issues came back."
2218,I guess I'm just confused and stressed about finding the right medication for me and was hoping for any advice or stories you might have.
2219,I want to see people's view on their experience with this medication.
2220,"We ARE going to seek a second opinion, but my wife wants to start taking the Zoloft immediately because her Neurologist said so, but I am hesitant to start her on mind altering medications just yet, especially over a very mild form of anxiety (especially when Anxiety was not even close to the issue we were there for, See: Epilepsy/Acid Reflux)."
2221,And would you think medication is necessary for someone extremely high functioning?
2222,"I've already been diagnosed with depression, but I am not on medication and not seeing a counseling psychologist or psychiatrist."
2223,"I took some of my prescribed blood pressure medication, fell asleep for 5-10 SECONDS, yes, seconds, and felt a lot better."
2224,Been seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist for some time now and have seen a douzen or so different medications.
2225,Is this common for meds to suddenly stop working after a while?
2226,It took me about five years to get my medications correct.
2227,"If any of you have questions about medications, I've been on a lot of them, so maybe I could help with my own personal experiences."
2228,"After about 25 minutes, it still felt like I hadn't taken any medication, except I was a tiny bit more relaxed."
2229,"---

**Daily meds:** 170mg Venlafaxine, 180mg Propranolol, a IBS med, an acid reflux med, a contraceptive pill, a diazepam, and a (not important) multivitamin."
2230,You can't tell me whether I did double-take the meds but I need to get this out.
2231,"I initially did very well in controlling my medication and only taking it when I needed it and made my first prescription (90 pills total, 30 per bottle with two refills) last about 8 months, which was way longer than I needed to."
2232,My goal now is to simply get a refill and ask my mom to help regulate my medication so I can find the happy medium I know exists.
2233,I am embarrassed and find it hard to admit to my parents and doctor that I lost control of my medication.
2234,"I'm not sure how to admit i have an addiction, albeit much more mental than physical, and im worried my parents will be disappointed and angry at me as they are the type of people who would rather not have me on medication at all."
2235,I feel slightly better after typing this out but I am anxious that i won't be able to get a refill on my medication and I feel guilty and like i've done something wrong.
2236,While I was there the doctor's changed my meds very aggresively.
2237,This lead him to start seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication.
2238,"The medication has made things manageable day to day, but it really affected things sexually now."
2239,"When he started the medication, it made it really hard for him to cum for awhile even though he still had a desire to have sex."
2240,"He said that if he stopped taking the medicine he would be able to easily cum again, but his psychiatrist said that if he stopped taking it he would build an immunity and never be able to take the same depression meds again."
2241,I talked to my psych about this and said I was ravenous all the time and was gaining weight but she said anxiety meds don't cause weight gain.
2242,I'd take meds but my insurance wouldn't cover all of it and I hate meds.
2243,Anytime I take meds I turn into a different person and get every bad side effect out there.
2244,"I have been off of my meds for about a year, and I just can't take it anymore."
2245,"Also, when I DID have meds, I felt like the doctor wasn't dosing me properly or even giving me the correct meds."
2246,"I don't think she was used to dealing with people with anxiety, so she just slapped me with a very low dose of the most common medication and I had to ask her to up it every single month (Because she made me go back for an appointment once a month, and charged me $300 for a five minute ""No, my dose is still too low"" appt)..."
2247,Would you recommend I talk to my psychiatrist about another medication?
2248,"I don't do drugs, moderate with alcohol, not on any medication and exercise regularly."
2249,"My doctor did not seem to be too concerned about them, just put me on anti-anxiety meds and told me to try to get some rest."
2250,Should she look into going back on the medication again?
2251,"For the longest time I would have disagreed to taking meds, but now I have changed my mind, I would totally take something just to let me controll my fear for a brief time."
2252,Is there special medication to overcome simple panic and/or fear?
2253,I have tried medications but they don't seem to work.
2254,Started to think about medicine to help me cope.
2255,Im afraid that I will be a hopeless boyfriend because the medication I take makes my sex preformance unpridictable.
2256,"I'm on several meds, and am going to therapy regularly."
2257,"Don't worry, I'm not going to act on them and I objectively realize that they're a result of the medication."
2258,I don't want to have to see a therapist or go on medication.
2259,"My mom got me an appointment at the doctors, and I thought, Ok I can get some meds and be alright."
2260,I've been diagnosed with both and took medication on and off for a while but am not taking anything now.
2261,Can anyone enlighten me with their experience with the use of this medication?
2262,I've been taking medication (Escitalopram 5mg) for a bit over a month now and thankfully I'm no longer experiencing levels of anxiety that affect my well being.
2263,"When I say consistently, I'm referring to the ***time*** that I take my meds."
2264,"The depression seems like it kind of went away on its own, and the anxiety was SO much better when I started medication."
2265,-I recently upped my medication from 50 milligrams of sertraline to 100 milligrams.
2266,-The medication is just not as effective as it used to be.
2267,Has anyone experienced anything like this after increasing their medication dosage?
2268,The last medication I was on gave me lasting memory problems and I'm scared that it will interfere.
2269,"I'm going to bring my medicine, just in case something does happen, but I'm going to try to not take it."
2270,"I posted about my new meds last week: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/zvwjw/has_anyone_taken_cymbalta_andor_xanax/

The Cymbalta is going ok, but the Xanax is making me feel strange - it seems to be increasing my anxiety and making me feel very agitated."
2271,I already had a lot of hesitations in starting the medication because I didn't want it to change who I am and now that it is increased I feel like maybe I am crazy or something.
2272,"Unfortunately, I'm from kind of a small town, and so the only person I could see about it was a social worker, and totally creeped me out, so I only ended up going a couple times and refused medication because I didn't want to turn into a zombie."
2273,"(Also, I am on no medication for my anxiety, and do not plan to be in the future.)"
2274,I'm on meds and also have ones to take only when I'm feeling specifically anxious.
2275,"I'm wondering if anyone has experienced similar experiences with meds, is it my body getting use to the meds of does it seem like I should try a different med?"
2276,"She also has some mental health issues, but takes medication."
2277,His mother has relapsed and stopped taking her medication (I don't know how long or if she's started again since then).
2278,"Don't waste your time with these pharmaceutical passion-stealing medications, just GET some good weed."
2279,"Take a moment, breathe, and think "" Is this life of being told what I have and being given this medication, good for me?"""
2280,"If I can't stop myself from having a panic attack, then I might have to get back on the stronger meds and all my progress has been for shit."
2281,I am on medicine.
2282,"Despite trying all different types of medicine, the only way I was able to go to the bathroom was by taking a gallon of colonoscopy prep."
2283,I know the medication can take longer to work but it's little consolation when you feel this way.
2284,I also started taking medication for it.
2285,I can't take any other meds because I have to drive the cat to the vet (I have emergency xanax).
2286,"**tl;dr - Unreasonably anxious/worried a close and great friend will suddenly forget about me and abandon me in favor of another person, she might have suspected and reassured me we'll always be friends, but my anxiety persists and I'm not sure how to relax and feel better just yet despite even I feeling completely ridiculous over this but not sure how to relax right now :(**

On one hand, right now I'm on some medicine that does have depression, anxiety, and nervousness as side effects."
2287,I have had bad anxiety for the past several months and I just started a new medication for it.
2288,"I recently ran into an ex girlfriend (one who I genuinely dont care for) and since I have started the meds I have been having strong and unfounded feelings towards her, which is strange because I dont want to have feelings towards her."
2289,"I talked to a pretty close online friend about this who suffers from depression and they said they take some meds which make them feel relaxed and fluid and they said it might be good for me too, is this something work looking into?"
2290,"I've taken a lot of different medications in the past and was always pretty unhappy, but I'm considering seeing someone and trying again because it's getting so bad."
2291,Have any of you here tried this medication on such a low dose?
2292,"I'm just wondering whether to get a second opinion or not, I know I should try out this medication but I was hoping for a more immediate result because I'm going back to school soon and my anxiety increased ten-fold."
2293,But if I'm causing these reactions and they're not just due to the medicine or anxiety I'd like to know so I can better watch out for it.
2294,"I spent about 9 months isolating myself from the world, trying to figure out how to manage my anxiety without meds or therapy."
2295,"I've struggled with anxiety all of my life, taken various medications, but I've been off meds for over four years now."
2296,I completely understand that everyone is different and reacts differently to different medication but am still wondering what is the general opinion or feeling of drinking while on beta blockers.
2297,"I'm back on meds from the doctor, but it'll take bout two weeks for them to kick in."
2298,I am on meds and seeing a psych and all that.
2299,"There's some stuff going on in my life right now with my partner that I am focusing on, to the point where I work myself into a panic, obsessively researching medication side effects and horror stories online, and such, and I can't seem to control myself."
2300,"I am taking medication, but I know I have to change the way I handle these thoughts if I want true change."
2301,My panic attacks got triggerd by a medication for the first time.
2302,From that time i have fear to take medicines (I always read the leaflet hundred times and every symptom of side effect in every meds causes fear).
2303,"I ran out of real meds two days ago, and within the last two months, have fully redeveloped my insomnia."
2304,"Before I had friends and could go out for a drink or two and a deep convo but now it's medication, sleep, ekg's, and panic."
2305,"Every medication the was suggested, I tried for quite some time before, to no avail."
2306,I have an anxiety and a general distrust for medications that alter the chemical makeup of the mind anyway.
2307,For the past three days now I've been feeling more anxiety and fear than I had before I started taking the medication.
2308,I've never been one for medication if something can be cured without it.
2309,I don't have health insurance now so taking to someone/getting meds isn't an option.
2310,What happens when you can't get your meds for whatever reason?
2311,"The next day, I took the meds and zofran, but I still felt like I was on the verge of another psychotic break."
2312,"The ER doctors and my Primary basically told me to wait until I see a Neurologist before starting on another anti-seizure medication, but things got so bad I went back to my Primary and begged to get on another drug."
2313,I do not have insurance right now so I cannot go get checked out and prescribed medication.
2314,After doing some research I found out that Propanolol isn't the go-to medication for anxiety sufferers.
2315,"I'm a firm believer that the right medication **is** a solution, contrary to popular belief."
2316,What other kind of medication can help?
2317,"I'm not sure how much longer I should give the medication, but I really do feel like I am losing my mind..."
2318,I take medication for my anxiety and I see a therapist but I still suffer from anxiety attacks :\
2319,"That was the first time I tired taking medication, I took a half a peach ( Xanax ) it helped."
2320,"But I didn't start taking them, my friends got bad into them so I always avoided taking medicine my whole life."
2321,"I got medicine for anxiety today, but I'm not sure when it will kick in."
2322,"I have some Prozac leftover I am going to consider using, but do you guys have any other suggestions on medicine?"
2323,I was put on medication but it didn't really help.
2324,Side note: Looking for ways to help anxiety without the use of medicine.
2325,"I was forced onto medications, the ones that have caused my current cognitive impairment."
2326,"-I can no longer work because of its severity, and the fact that medications triple the severity of every issue I have had (and I've been trying all kinds of meds for over 10 years) 


So, all that out there... My life is pretty miserable at times."
2327,Off anxiety medicine for a month or so.
2328,"Didn't have meds with me so I had to wait to take those,  wish I could crush the sensation earlier on."
2329,"I've not been diagnosed, but I'm trying to find a therapist to talk about these things with, and maybe talk about medication or coping mechanisms."
2330,I am currently on anxiety meds and they are working well but then this has happened a few times randomly when I am relaxing
2331,"I went on medications for a year and a half, but those didn't help so I went off of them."
2332,I took anxiety medication in the past but it didn't really do much and I got tired of not drinking alcohol I'm not an alcoholic I'm just 21 and like to go out with friends regularly.
2333,"I have just been prescribed Buspar and Paxil to fight a depression/anxiety combination and was just wondering if anyone else is on or has been on these two medications together or separately, and what to expect and your experiences with them."
2334,"I take Cymbalta and after months of steady improvement with therapy and medication, I've tapered my dosage down to 20mg (lowest) where it will stay for a while."
2335,"Thanks doc, for still not getting me the medications I am looking for, while emphasizing the thing that I am most panicked about."
2336,"I've played brain juice roulette with a total of 3 different medications and 1 supplement, and the 3rd medication is doing reasonably well."
2337,"Me (to good friend): ""Yeah so I halved my anti anxiety meds and I've just been having a really rough time coping, I can't sleep, my generalized everyday anxiety is through the roof...""
good friend: ""You're probably just stressed about work, you probably just need to relax a little""."
2338,"(Visited a psychologist to see if this was a good plan, she agreed)

My situation is as follows, this has happened a few times…

I take my daily meds at night, because my wake up time does vary quite a bit."
2339,"For example: Last night I stayed at my boyfriends house, came home this morning and didn't realize that I forgot to take my meds until around 4."
2340,"I was feeling unusually exhausted and out of it and started wondering why, then realized I forgot the meds."
2341,I don't have any medication for anxiety.
2342,"Taking medication has never been easy for me (medicine in general, not anti anxiety) as I hate the thought of not being in control of myself."
2343,My question to you all is how do you find the courage to take your medication?
2344,"Basically, I know I've had anxiety and have taken medicine for it in the past; it was diagnosed by a doctor, and let that not be of any concern furthermore in this."
2345,I dont know where else to turn and I hate the meds I keep getting put on (Prozac and zoloft).
2346,"What kinds of different medications have you tried, and what worked?"
2347,"The therapy didn't really help (it may have just been my therapist), but I began taking medication to clear the fog."
2348,"Eventually the medication started doing more harm than good, though."
2349,She also told me that I would definitely need to give medication another try.
2350,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Since all of this has gone down, I've also been formally diagnosed with combined type Adult ADHD and am on medication for that as well."
2351,"For years, I didn't want to be on medication because I, like so many others, thought I should be able to ""handle it"" myself."
2352,"I am on medication, but quite low doses."
2353,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If anyone needs to talk about anxiety or medication or ADHD or anything, really, feel free to contact me."
2354,"I don't want to take any medication, and it's difficult finding a therapist here in Japan."
2355,](http://www.medicinenet.com/mitral_valve_prolapse/page2.htm) am pissed.
2356,"I hate medication, and therapy does not do anything for me after trying it for a month."
2357,"I really want to go to the doctors to try and get some meds, but I am scared of the side effects."
2358,"Obviously I'll talk to my doc before I make a decision, I'm just wondering if anyone has experience with non-SSRI, non-benzo meds for anxiety."
2359,I did okay off meds for a bit but then had a bad episode and decided to try a different SSRI.
2360,"TL;DR SSRIs make me fat, benzos make me tired, brain seems to require meds for decent results."
2361,I have been on about 10 different meds and am currently on 60mg of Paxil daily.
2362,"I've been prescribed with medication, and have plans to meet with a counselor in the fall."
2363,"I have been suffering from anxiety for the last eleven years, recently diagnosed bipolar, and started taking medicine for these conditions."
2364,"I know it's not the other medicine, because I still had the palpitations with it."
2365,"I know that because it worked for me it might not for you, and maybe some of you can't take supplements with your medication."
2366,"I'm looking for a solution to try and get on meds, but my agoraphobia stops be from being able to get to the doctor or eve getting gas for my car most of the time."
2367,"The problem is I want to try meds so I can leave the house and not be afraid, but I can't seem to get those meds because I have these panic attacks and vomit with my panic."
2368,"""People would come to me for medication management or things like that."""
2369,Management of existing medication regimens (which seems to me to be more in the realm of a general practitioner) or the use of medication to manage psychological disorders?
2370,I've suffered from anxiety as long as I can remember and have been taking medicine for about 5 years now and finally have it mostly under control.
2371,I am without easy/affordable access to healthcare providers so I have been off or without my anxiety meds for a while.
2372,Does anyone have an herbal supplements or advice on how to lessen the effects of anxiety without medication?
2373,She has gone to therapy in the past and has medications she takes daily.
2374,"I have a second interview later today at a theater company - so not a super formal environment - but I am freaking out a little bit since I'm on medication that is making me feeling totally foggy, a little dizzy and not super eloquent."
2375,(also tired... and did I mention - zonked on meds??)
2376,"Just out of curiosity, what are the /r/anxiety community's feelings towards medications, particularly benzodiazepines?"
2377,"My SO was very freaked out, and told me later it was as though I had taken WAY too much Lorazepam, and just zoned out completely (note: i had not have any meds in 24 hours prior to this.)"
2378,I would prefer not to see a therapist/take meds but looking at my own writing it appears I'm pretty fucked up.
2379,"Although I tend to be way over worried about job security (probably unnecessarily), I probably wouldn't have thought I'd medication."
2380,Medications have always made me nervous because I've seen a lot of people I know turn into terrible bitches on medication or become sort of emotion-less or gain a ton of weight and I don't want any of those things to happen.
2381,They make me afraid to go on meds.
2382,Should I be on medication or what?
2383,"What I was wondering, however, was how affordable medication is."
2384,And how did meds help you get better?
2385,I was put on medication at 15 and was on meds from then until April of this year.
2386,"At this point, I am not doing well, but I never did well on medication either."
2387,I don't think I'm really doing any better or worse than during the breakthrough anxiety periods I had on medication.
2388,I've been on medication for anxiety for over a decade.
2389,"Aside from the usual fears of being on drugs that will turn me into a different person or make my suicidal tendencies worse, or the fear that therapy won't help, I've also been overwhelmed with the realization that I won't be able to safely drink alcohol while on most medications."
2390,"They've got a medication they're giving her that protects her kidneys and liver from the pain pills/other medications she overdosed on (we honestly don't know what all she took, but the potential amount makes it a miracle she's even alive), but it tastes like shit and she's been refusing it."
2391,"She reminds me of a child, crying and refusing her meds, asking for her mother, clamping her mouth shut when we get a syringe to make her take the medication, crying ""no"" over and over again."
2392,So I have an appointment with a psychiatrist next week; I've been to psychologists and my own GP before for medication/treatment - but never to an actual 'psychiatrist'.
2393,"The reason I am going is to find a specific medication that will work for me, but I am a bit nervous about it all."
2394,"I have never had such tests done before from my local doctor even when changing medication, I had a blood test when I was first diagnosed with CBT to rule out other causes."
2395,I have to take antibiotics for a couple days and in total would be 3 rounds of meds to help remove this out of me.
2396,Because of this I probably won't end up taking the meds but I do wanna get better.
2397,"I'm practicing mindfulness, which I'll admit I could do a lot more of, as well as taking medication and frequent meetings with my psychiatrist."
2398,She's been prescribed an anxiety medication but doesn't take it because she doesn't like how it affects her mood otherwise.
2399,She's terrified of the side effects of most medications.
2400,I'm currently not taking medication.
2401,Which anxiety medicine have you guys had good experiences with?
2402,"Despite therapy and meds, keep getting worse...."
2403,"I've taken so much medication that I rattle when I walk, everything from benzos, beta blockers, SSRI, SSNRI, self medication with alcohol."
2404,"I had sought counselling in high school for depression, but I did not ever get counselling or meds for my anxiety in college."
2405,"Is it possible that I can make it without meds, just by myself?"
2406,Should I tell my doctor to higher my dosage or maybe switch to an other medication?
2407,I heard that adderal is the strongest medication for ADHD so if it doesn't work for me what is gonna work?!?
2408,I'm well aware this could come from codependency related to my mothers severe alcoholism but with all the therapy and medication I can't seem to change.
2409,"I wasn't on medication at the time (I have been medicated in the past, but when I feel I'm in a place where I can control my anxiety, I go off of it), and now I'm back on my medication, but it doesn't really appear to be working."
2410,"He freaks out when he has to take medicine, go to the dentist."
2411,"I should add that she's not the type to take medicine, go to counseling, therapy, or understand that she even has anxiety."
2412,So yesterday he switched my meds.
2413,"I have my medication with me, but this is really bothering me."
2414,At least the medication allows me to ask other people like you folks for help now.
2415,"Also, I'm not sure if it's the meds, but I've been constantly feeling like I'm forgetting something, or forget what I'm about to go do."
2416,its one of the things my anxiety meds doesn't help with at all.
2417,"Just want to say that if this medication worked for you, great!"
2418,"The doctor and therapist both told me that this medication had minimal side effects, no weight gain, and withdrawal was easy."
2419,"I know I needed the medication when I went on it, but I can't help feeling that it was a bad decision because of what it did to me."
2420,I went out to the car and freaked out because I knew without some Lind of anxiety medication is end IP back in the hospital.
2421,I'm not big on taking medications but I figured I would start the Zoloft and use Xanax as needed until my therapy sessions start.
2422,"Either in therapy, medication, approaches...etc?"
2423,"Most of the initial side effects have gone, however I'm still not feeling the medication having any effect."
2424,I've been looking into hypnotherapy for my anxiety/agoraphobia since no medication seems to be helping nor does CBT.
2425,the meds i got was from a surgery on my eye.
2426,Every medication I have tried that helps my chronic anxiety makes me suicidal and depressed.
2427,Is there anyone out there who has stopped their meds?
2428,I don't want to take medicine because I know I'm my own worst enemy.
2429,Has anyone had any similar experiences or know of maybe a different medication that mighty work better?
2430,I've tried four different medications in the past six months.
2431,I'm kind of freaked out by the medication after my run in with Wellbutrin and all the terrible side effects.
2432,Is there any hope for living a better life without medication?
2433,"The medication I take has been working for me, evening out my mood-- until recently."
2434,"Well, medication but I don't know if that ever helped."
2435,"I've tried medication, I've tried therapy, I've tried breathing and telling myself it's gonna be okay."
2436,I am 20 years old and have had social anxiety my whole life and even though its gotten better with medication and therapy it still holds me back in many regards.
2437,"I'm in Aus, no medications but booked in to see a counsellor on Tuesday."
2438,I use a medication called Clonazepam i use it orally and slip a pill under my tongue.
2439,I guess if it wasn't for the medication I probably would have a massive panic attack.
2440,I thought it was a side effect of my ADHD meds until yesterday.
2441,"I was feeling anxious, and made a mental note that my new meds also made me anxious, when I realized I never took my meds that day."
2442,I want to study medicine.
2443,"I don't want to increase my medication just to work without sobbing in the bathroom, I just need some time to calm down and get my brain back in a regular function mode."
2444,"Since it's the first time ever on this island that they use this medicine, they had to get a license, order from another country ect ect.. well."
2445,I have a prescription for prozac to help the anxiety but my psychiatrist said that the medication for ADD makes people anxious so he can't start me on that until he sees how I do with the prozac long term.
2446,"Does anyone else have anxiety and ADD, how did the ADD medication effect your anxiety or vice versa?"
2447,"It even led to me facing the fact that yes, I needed to fix something, talking to my doctor, starting medication, etc."
2448,Did medication seem to help?
2449,I am on several medications but I still get immobilized by anxiety attacks just thinking of going on a job interview.
2450,"During the school year I attended therapy with a private professional,and was prescribed medication that I had to take at school instead of home because of my parents."
2451,I was only ever given my medication on campus because my mother purposely neglected to otherwise.
2452,"But then the school year ended-and with it,the therapy sessions and medication intakes."
2453,"I've tried therapy, self-help books, medications and just plain ol' doing it on my own."
2454,Can medication help with phobias?
2455,My mother just recently mentioned that doctors reccomender anti anxiety meds when I was 12 for problems I was having sleeping and in school.
2456,I had not taken Versed or any anti anxiety medicine by the way.
2457,The anesthesiologist put a medicine in the IV drip to calm me down and I felt so much better really quickly.
2458,"The anesthesiologist put more medicine into the IV, and this time it burned pretty bad."
2459,- My other doctors prescribed me migraine medication and gave me tinted glasses to wear.
2460,"Seeing a psychiatrist is $200-300 a pop, and I can't afford that kind of thing, especially when trying to work out the right meds."
2461,Keep in mind I'm trying to avoid any meds just for the sake of learning and not depending on things with side effects and things I have to pay for.
2462,I keep forgetting to call my therapist to resume visits and talk about the possibility of medication.
2463,"The good thing - I survived everything and I didn´t had a heart attack ;-)
I never took any medication but I changed my way of living."
2464,"**I didnt use medication or a regular shrink and I dont think you require medication either, but if it helps then stay on it."
2465,Any alternatives to melatonin that you may be aware of or any other medication that's known to help people ease their way through benzo withdrawal?
2466,"I'm getting the IV done and i think either they're gonna put too much in, or whatever is in the IV is gonna react with my medicine or one of my mental issues and ill never wake up."
2467,"Normally, my anxiety medication is fine for this, but now I'm moving."
2468,"At 1:00 am, I took a 1mg risperidone (that I was prescribed a long time ago - I'm not on any meds now) to help me sleep."
2469,I'm getting back on some meds - I can't handle this anymore.
2470,"I have some ativan on me, but I haven't taken it in a while and would like to face this with out medication."
2471,The nausea would keep randomly showing up so I started taking the medication and it's helped for the most part.
2472,I sometimes have to double up on the meds if I know I'm going to be in a situation where nausea may arise (like meeting my boyfriend's parents recently).
2473,The meds help for the most part but also don't completely stop it from happening.
2474,"I'm not on medicine, and it doesn't look like I'll be getting the help I probably need until I'm old enough to go to the doctor without my parents knowing."
2475,"2) I do not want to go into a locked psych ward because of a traumatic experience as a teenager (I was locked up and restrained and injected with meds for refusing to take medication I didn't like), so I'm looking for more of a private treatment facility instead of a really clinical or hospital setting."
2476,"I really, REALLY don't want to use medication."
2477,"Off medication, worrying less, no panic attacks, etc."
2478,Is anxiety medication something that could help?
2479,For almost a year I was free from my medication until I started getting such bad panic attacks that I wouldn't even leave my dorm room.
2480,"I haven't got depressed because of this, but I am very frustrated and I was wondering if you guys have had similar situations going back on your medications."
2481,I have done all kinds of therapy for years and tried a number of different medications.
2482,"To hopefully get some meds for the voice in my head, but I have no health insurance."
2483,It's coming to the point were I'm thinking I might want to start taking meds because this is no way to go through life.
2484,"I'm just nervous because meds should not be the solution, but maybe they could help ease me into a full recovery?"
2485,I feel embarrassed and ashamed to have to tell my family doctor I want medication because of this.
2486,"I'm writing because my medication have an annoying side effect: When I first take them, I feel pretty dizzy."
2487,"After a day, sometime two, it pass... problem is, I sometime forget to take my medications."
2488,"Not ideal I know, but when I realize it happened, sometime a few days have passed, and then I put off taking my medication again, because I HATE how dizzy it makes me, and how it prevents me from doing even the simplest task(moving makes the dizziness worse)."
2489,"(My meds: Citalopram (Anxiety, morning), Atomoxetine (ADD, morning), Teva-Quetiapine (Anxiety, Supper). )"
2490,"I'm trying to be positive about this and would love to make friends from here who are also starting a new medication regimen, so we can support each other through a rough time but my question right now is for the veterans."
2491,"I'd like to hear everyone's personal experience with a new medication regimen, good or bad."
2492,"have been unable to get to sleep on my own, my insomnia is making it hard for me to rest peacefully to the point where I am back on sleep medicine."
2493,"And yet even when I take the medicine,  I only get maybe five hours of sleep."
2494,"I am doing well in general since starting medication and attending counselling, but I have been feeling very down and empty and anxious the last few weeks..."
2495,"Plus I have been on this medication before, and it relaxed me so much, that nothing in life threatened me."
2496,"Maybe it's effects are something I'm going to need as I move through the rest of my life, but right now it seems like a kind of backwards solution for me to start taking medicine to allow me to survive in this place, when I was pretty much fine before I came here, and would probably be fine even if I had been put in a different dorm, with roommates or like a common room or something, making it a lot easier to make friends (seriously, everyone in my hall is always just in their room or out somewhere."
2497,"I'm not the biggest fan of medication as I often have averse side effects, but I want something for these physical symptoms."
2498,"Like I said, I've only been on the meds for 10 days, but the change in mood is very apparent."
2499,"In fact, he upped the dosage on my meds."
2500,"The major issue for a while was depression, which I winged without meds because I've always been avoidant  of them."
2501,I just wanted to post to tell others to not be afraid to take that step towards therapy/meds.
2502,"He prescribed the same meds I used to be on (I had run out in around October and stupidly decided I could live without them - I can't) except because of the severity of my depression and anxiety, he started my prozac at 40mg with no upward taper."
2503,I suffer from anxiety as well but will not take medicine for it.
2504,I get depressed at times and I have a hard time confronting her since I know it is the meds and I do not want to worry her.
2505,If she gets off the medicine she wont be able to work.
2506,I have looked up non medicine treatments for anxiety but they aren't doing so well.
2507,"My medication and calming methods have been doing really well, and I haven't had a major episode in nearly a year."
2508,She said they could also discuss the possibility of medication with me.
2509,I don't know if I want medication.
2510,I don't know how anxiety medication Works.
2511,"Was recommended for a mental health assessment, don't know if I want to try medication."
2512,* Should I consider medication?
2513,if so what meds?
2514,Edit: Every week when I see my therapist she asks me if I'm still against the idea of medication.
2515,"Taking medication scares me - I've heard so many horror stories of SSRI side effects and such, and since I have such bad health anxiety I feel like I'll just be all worried about what could happen to me if I take them."
2516,Have you guys had good luck with medication?
2517,"I've been on medication before and it was not a good time, and I've been in and out of therapy since I was 13 (19 now)."
2518,Yet it seems like it would be such an obvious question for a widely used medication.
2519,"I told her I had a medication question, she said she would transfer me to his assistant, but transferred me again to the wrong doctors voicemail."
2520,A little background: Both my parents have anxiety issues and are on medication on a daily basis.
2521,They need to do blood work for anxiety medication.
2522,"So I have to go to the doctor to get a fast-acting anti anxiety pill, so I can then return to the doctor the next week after having taken it, and get my blood taken so I can be put on ANOTHER type of medication, so I can have the gall to go see a therapist."
2523,I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for it but I got to talk to a psychiatrist last week for my GAD and was told/given the list of meds I should take.
2524,"My parents **do not** believe in any of these and think of my anxiety disorder as just a ""personality with a mix of anger"" (I also got recommended meds for my ADHD, which they also believe is just ""my laziness"") and that I'm perfectly normal."
2525,They'd try me on meds which I don't want.
2526,"I’ve had a lot af trouble with anxiety over the past eight years; it has caused me to take varying medicines of diverse shape, colour and magnitude of effect."
2527,"However, I'm curious about what I could expect from the medication both in this ""waiting period"" and once it starts to take full effect."
2528,"I have had an anxiety disorder for awhile but over the past year have been mostly successful managing it without medication, so much so I don't think I have it anymore."
2529,With some medication and hard work I thought I was finally cured!
2530,I was off of any meds for about a year but I started buspirone at the beginning of the school year (in the fall) because I couldn't deal with it anymore.
2531,I've begun to stay up considerably later than I used to (as in before I started the new meds) and not sleeping all night.
2532,"And the topic has come up in the past, but she's always told me that I need to deal with it without medication."
2533,When I was 18 I got medications and never had seizures anymore.
2534,"They told me that I had to take my medications for three years, because they thought I will overgrow epilepsy in that time."
2535,"Fast forward... 21 years old and I was allowed to stop my medications, I panicked..I got scared that I would get seizures again."
2536,"(and because of the medications I don't drink..I face the fear sober) I told my buddies, that this was the most amazing evening/night in my life."
2537,"I was prescribed medications, but have not taken them because of fear of worsening."
2538,Should I consider doing medication?
2539,I've researched the pros and cons of meds for anxiety and I'm afraid of the side effects.
2540,Or should I just consider medication?
2541,"After resisting medication for a long time, i finally gave in and started on Efexor XR 75mg, that was six years ago."
2542,"This doesn't really make sense, because I've been diagnosed and am on medication."
2543,3 years go by and my mother found an article in the newspaper about acid reflux medication draining naturally occurring B12 from the body and recommended I take a B12 vitamin daily.
2544,I'm not on any meds or anything.
2545,Also is there any type of over-the-counter medication that would help calm me?
2546,"I just don't want to depend on them, but I think starting medication gives me anxiety and it may be for the best to calm my nerves."
2547,I have some meds prescribed but they don't work as well as I would like.
2548,My symptoms are under control after years of therapy and medication.
2549,Is it safe to have a couple drinks on this medication?
2550,"I'm really nervous about opening that can of worms in my life, getting dependent and all the bullshit that comes with medications like these."
2551,"I have noticed a bit of improvement in my overall mood, but I am not sure if that is the medicine or me."
2552,What would be a good started anxiety medication for people highly sensitive to medication.
2553,Has anyone else suffered horrible anxiety from ADD/ADHD medicine?
2554,"I don't expect anyone to tell me whether or not I should label this as anxiety or whether or not I should get medication, but I'd really love to know if anyone who identifies as having anxiety has a similar experience to mine so that I can reconsider my perspective a little bit."
2555,"I really am starting to feel like if I had medication or something, that I'd have a slightly better handle on my situation and that I could be a bit more productive without panicking all of the time that I'll never be good enough....or maybe I'm just being overdramatic."
2556,"I dont take any medication to trigger it and it comes up for random things, like getting a paper back in class, taking a test, presenting in class, going to new places, riding in cars with my friends and their parents."
2557,Is there any way to break the cycle of these thoughts besides going on meds?
2558,I'm just wondering what combinations of medicine you all take.
2559,"He offered me a medication (effexor) to help deal with the anxiety and although I was reluctant at first I figured, hey, what the hell, it can't be any worse than what I have already been through."
2560,Some notes about me and my situation: I was very reluctant to start a medication because I believe they are just bandaid's to a deeper issue.
2561,Ideally I would have liked to feel better without medication but I have tried my hardest for the passed 10 years and I think I have gotten as far as I can on my own.
2562,"They gave me anxiety medicine and it seems to help, but I do not want to take pills for an extended period of time."
2563,"3 months later they rescheduled my appointment and did not tell me I called after my refill was denied they said i was removed from the system entirely because i missed too many appointments I was mad so i asked how can i get my medicine back i need them to live my life almost normal she said i have to start from scratch go through therapy again then i might have a chance to to see the doctor which could take half a year or more so here i am gone 2 weeks without my medicine i'm scared, depressed and there is nothing i can do."
2564,At the time I didn't understand what it meant and it never directly affected our relationship until he decided to stop his meds overnight.
2565,I am not sure if stopping his meds played a role in what happened next but within a week he started having panic attacks with me.
2566,"For a brief context: I'm emetophobic (fear of vomit), and have always resisted taking daily medication for it, since will my anxiety occurs daily, it's not constant."
2567,Does anyone here have experience with taking medication for phobia-related panic attacks?
2568,I've never taken anti-anxiety medication before and am having a lot of anxiety and trepidation about it.
2569,"But also since it's so situation-based, what do you do when you're on medication and the 'danger' goes away?"
2570,I hope I can get a better management of this new medication soon.
2571,The second time it took a therapist and a bit of medication.
2572,I started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and got back on medication.
2573,"But I'm wondering if anyone here has any ways to cope that worked during their pregnancy since obviously medication is a no-go right now (I'm prescribed Xanax as needed, but I haven't taken any since September, and don't want to take anything while pregnant)."
2574,I try to stay away from meds due to their unsavory side effects.
2575,"While I know medication helps a bit, I am more curious about what helps when medicine can't."
2576,"I still don't know if medication is the right route for me but honestly I don't know what else to do, I have to do something to start feeling better."
2577,I've had to increase my medication just to keep myself from being too depressed to function and to be able to actually sleep at night.
2578,"They specialize in CBT and from what I've seen and heard are generally ""against"" prescribing medication."
2579,My gut is telling me to look for another psychiatrist that could prescribe me meds that can get me going but really would hate to resort to that.
2580,I can't remember if I stated this before but my sister is a hardcore alcoholic (she buys half pints of hard liquor and a few shots every day) and combines the booze with the several medications she's on.
2581,What medications are available and what are the side effects?
2582,I feel sort of embarrassed that I feel like I need medication to help keep my mind working as it should - is this a normal feeling?
2583,"I don't want to go straight to meds, but I can't turn my brain off when I'm not at home."
2584,"I starting seeing a psychologist in April of this year (no meds, refuse them) and the improvement i've been seeing was tremendous."
2585,Ive never felt the need to seek help or meds (but I am terrified of doctors so there you go).
2586,Have you ever asked a doctor for a specific medication?
2587,"By the way, you can find inexpensive Phenelzine (*and other meds*) with this site: http://www.goodrx.com/

Thanks for your time, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you have."
2588,"I came off of celexa and am trying to combat it naturally without medication, though I do have xanax for emergencies and as needed."
2589,I'm seeing an endocrinologist in April about a possibly thyroid issue (or if not that that to see if there is a medical reason for my anxiety/panic) and I think I've decided if he doesn't treat me with medication or give me an answer I'm going to look back at another SSRI.
2590,"I know that I have anxiety (and am on medications), but I have an issue."
2591,"Do any of you have advice about medication, or therapies for General anxiety?"
2592,"I am on medication, Effexor 37.5mg and have been since September 2011."
2593,"Yes, I hadn't been on medication for very long despite me having anxiety for as long as I have."
2594,"Could medication alone help me, at least to get through college?"
2595,Sometimes i want to go to my DR and ask for medication so i can live normal but then i have anxiety that the medication will change me and i wont feel anything.
2596,"What if because of the medicine i no longer need to turn around at the gas station, drive back to the house and make sure my hair dryer is unplugged JUST IN CASE one of the dogs bumps it and it turns on and burns the house down.... AHHHH 

Sorry this is such a massive wall of text."
2597,"I have told my parents I want to take some kind of sleeping meds like ZZZQuil because my friend(who also has a lot of anxiety) says it helps him, but they just say ""Oh we don't want you on an sleeping medication""."
2598,"I do take medication for my anxiety, Zoloft."
2599,Now i'm not on any medication currently and I am in good shape but I would like to know how common this is and did it improve.
2600,"If you're taking or have taken this kind of medicine,  please share your experience with it!"
2601,Tried nearly 20 different medications for both disorders.
2602,Klonopin and Xanax seem to be the only two medications that actually help my anxiety without the need for all the other shit.
2603,"i'm a 21 year old male, have had mild anxiety most of my life, was on anti-anxiety medications for a while but have been off for a year and a half."
2604,"I've been to the doctor a few times, and they have always sent me away with acid-reducing medication which don't seem to give me any relief."
2605,(im currently taking rabeprazole sodium 20mg) I'm tired of going to the doctor since I've tried at least 4 different acid-reducing medication now.
2606,"I've tried reaching my doctor but haven't had any response, so I was hoping anyone who has experience with the medication could give me some advice."
2607,I don't do well with anti-anxiety medications for this reason.
2608,"While medication helps to keep me from freaking out over small things, it gives me no incentive to do big things."
2609,"Her specialty is anxiety, and she's helped me make some strides in a positive direction without medication."
2610,Usually my appetite isn't very strong so it seems likely it's related to the medication.
2611,"I used to have major palpitations, but they went away after i started medicine."
2612,"Incidentally, I was off meds for a while for some stupid reason."
2613,I also switched some meds recently.
2614,I have been to see a doctor who has offered CBT and anti anxiety meds (citalopram / celexa).
2615,I started taking this medication for an infection.
2616,I dug more into the side-effects of the medication and what I read was pretty shocking.
2617,"I implore anyone not to take this, or any medication in this family of drugs."
2618,"The meds did help me, I have to give him that."
2619,"*  I have an appointment to see a doctor for meds on the 17th, but that feels so far away and I don't know how much it'll help."
2620,"My sole hope is in meds, which don't come for over a week and then need time to kick in *if* they're right for me."
2621,"In  the end of 2010- the start of 2011 I started on Zoloft which seemed to help, but had a bunch of weird side effects so I eventually stopped taking it both from a strong personal aversion to taking medication and the medicine it's self."
2622,"Extra information: I quit taking anxiety meds about a month and a half ago, as they weren't doing me much good."
2623,"I've never really spoken with psychologists about this, as I've always had an aversion to the idea of taking medication, but after seven years of feeling this way in what should be the prime of my life, I just want some relief."
2624,I have been on prescription medication for a very long time and it seems to help but in stressful times it gets worse and im struggling right now.
2625,Not too long ago I was convinced that medication is the only way to elevate the pain.
2626,"I have nausea medicine, but it does nothing but make me less likely to vomit and even then I vomit the medicine up sometimes."
2627,I don't know about getting new medicine because my mom basically tells me to suck it up... which makes me even more frustrated.
2628,"It lasted for weeks before I got on some medication, and even on the medication can go on for several days before I can completely control it."
2629,"Medication is great to temporarily gain firm enough footing so as to build awareness, however if nothing is changed behaviorally or psychologically, ie if awareness is not being cultivated, the medication is merely masking the problem."
2630,"Also, my meds and my stress have made my sex drive non existant."
2631,"Up until Thursday, my nightly meds (I take 0.25mg Klonopin at 9am, 1pm, and 6pm and the rest at 6pm) would immediately calm me down."
2632,"I have a psychiatrist right now, but the medicine I'm taking only does so much for me and I think it would do me good to have someone to talk to, like a therapist."
2633,I was out of town for the last 4 days and forgot to take my meds with me.
2634,Has anyone else felt the same after restarting their meds similar to the way I have just discribed?
2635,I haven't been diagnosed or prescribed medication.
2636,"So, I don't have any medication left until I refill it Friday."
2637,"I spent the week at my boyfriends place, and I never need medication when I'm with him."
2638,"What to do when you don't have any medication on you, your 'happy place' is unavailable right now, you're constantly trying not to think bad thoughts, and nothing is on Netflix?"
2639,I have been taking meds for almost a year (last resort) to help even out my moods and help me think clearly and sleep.
2640,Prescription medication sometimes gets dropped to sustain the meal budget.
2641,"Also somewhat recently, and a partial cause of my anxiety, my girlfriend was diagnosed with full-on schizophrenia, and as a result has been doped up on a huge amount of meds, depakote, clonapin, an antipsychotic, and zoloft, and it's definitely be impacting our relationship."
2642,She sleeps most of the time because she can't handle reality or the way the meds make her feel and it's been hard.
2643,"I'm just unsure of how to get over the feeling that I'm in the wrong relationship, or if I even should...but it's been keeping me up thinking which really hasn't happened since getting on my meds."
2644,"Now I cannot leave the house without my ""emergency medicine"" (klonopin) or I could have a panic attack thinking about what I would do IF I had a panic attack."
2645,"Now I worry that I may have a panic attack and need to take my medicine, which should not be taken with alcohol."
2646,Of course this dizziness makes me nervous that something could be wrong with me and it has since forced me to get back on my medication (which has yet to take effect).
2647,"When I don't take my medication I notice quickly, but when I do I'm fine."
2648,"So my question is to anyone else with experience with this medication, do you drink on it, and do you think its safe to drink lightly on it?"
2649,"She understood, and suggested it might be a way of self-medication, which I agreed with."
2650,"But now that I am on meds that work i started to drink about a cup and a half every morning and i do just fine, it gives me a nice push to start my day."
2651,"I can’t afford therapy as I don’t have insurance, and I’m not looking to take medication because I don’t want to become dependent and I’d like to be able to control it myself."
2652,"Last night I was going to take a melatonin but read on the package they're not awesome to take when your blood pressure is high (mine is usually low, but this past week it's skyrocketed), if you are taking meds that change your blood pressure, or if you're anxious or depressed."
2653,"The medication was working, I was rarely taking the valium."
2654,i've been to my doctor about this but the only thing she has to offer me is a medication that i have a long history with.
2655,"Not currently on any medications other than Adderall XR, which one psychiatrist prescribed me for ADHD."
2656,"At my previous university, I found that the Effexor-XR 150 for trait and Xanax 50 mg for state anxiety resulted in a relatively stable mode of living, but have recently started a graduate program at a different university where the clinicians are more negatively biased toward medication-based solutions."
2657,"In a beautiful, perfect world, I would have found a behavioral solution that reduces my social anxiety without medication."
2658,"3) At my previous university, with my standard medication, I **
loved** giving presentations (albeit, when at the beginning of having a panic attack, I had a Xanax)."
2659,The idea of medication terrifies me.
2660,"Thanks to my dad and stepmom, I quit going to doctor's appointments and I dropped my medication because she said that illness doesn't exist and I'm FINE...which I obviously am NOT because I'm sitting here freaking out."
2661,I am on medication for this and it has helped and ive gone through years of therapy and stopped because it really didnt help.
2662,The medication I am on is Pristiq.
2663,It wasn't until I got my anxiety under control with therapy and medication (of which I'm now off) that I lost that happy feeling.
2664,I maintained the same dose and medications as previously mentioned.
2665,"I was on the same medications, maintained the same dosage, and had no stressors to 'run away' from (such as work or school)."
2666,"I have a LOT of experience with mainstream western medicine failing me in various ways, so when it predictably happened again in trying to sort out my digestion problems, I turned to ""alternative"" health (which have helped me far more than western medicine, but that's a whole other topic)."
2667,I'm wondering if anyone who is on any type of medication for anxiety/depression or similar mental illnesses has had a bad experience with alcohol that they can share.
2668,I can only pin it down to the alcohol in me affecting my medication's function and therefore the panic attack came on full strength.
2669,I'm thinking I just need another medication?
2670,"After several weeks of medication, I wasn't seeing much improvement, and felt like my anxiety was just compounding because of this."
2671,"I don't know if I can attribute this to the meds (Lexapro + Wellbutrin + Klonopin as needed), or just the fact that the people here have been welcoming and friendly whereas the people at the marketing company (save a couple of cool people) were extremely passive-aggressive and self-absorbed."
2672,TL;DR A combination of meds and a new work environment has changed my life for the better.
2673,Maybe meds aren't always enough.
2674,"I have no idea how to feel about anxiety meds, the only med I've ever really been on is Concerta (Ritalin)."
2675,I don't know...I just don't know how to feel about meds...any thoughts?
2676,"EDIT: Well just an update, I ended up NOT taking the meds, and honestly I feel completely normal today."
2677,"**TL;DR: How the HELL did you get through your medication withdrawal symptoms, and how long did it take?"
2678,"Hey guys, Ive recently been prescribed Buspar and Im not sure what to expect from the medication."
2679,Can I go to a walk in clinic and ask for medication there??
2680,"I was medicated for quite awhile (2 antidepressants, as well as Vyvanse for my ADD), but I was having far more negative symptoms on these medications than I was benefits."
2681,I was very lucky--I did not have anywhere near as close to as bad of a time coming off of these meds that I expected.
2682,I really don't want to start back on medication and I know that it's in my head since I didn't have these thoughts on the medicine.
2683,I have no faith in medication or therapy anymore because I feel like i've tried it all.
2684,I have dealt with social and generalized anxiety for most of my life and at this point I can say that I have a pretty good handle on it without medication.
2685,With out medicine what it's the best way I can stop my mind from teaching and spiraling me in to a panic attack?
2686,"I just started medication this week, so hopefully it will do something..."
2687,"I buy her groceries, clean her house in between the monthly housekeeper coming, take her to doctors appointments (sometimes more than one per week), and get her medication."
2688,"I'm just full of meds, it sucks."
2689,"I've tried a million things to get rid of my anxiety: doctors, therapist, supplements, running, improved posture, you name it I've probably tried it except for medication because I'm scared to death of them."
2690,What makes this medicine work better?
2691,"I've resisted being put on medication but i think I might need it at this point, but I don't have a primary care doctor and it could take weeks to get in at the school clinic."
2692,"I am defending meds, but I realize they aren't the only option."
2693,And there are some for whom meds may be counter-indicated due to extenuating medical issues.
2694,"I can't find a psychiatrist that takes my insurance, so I can't get meds to help."
2695,"But at the same time, I don't want to just yet because if I do have a heart problem, the medicine can trigger an episode."
2696,"I finally got off of the medication rollercoaster at the age of 14 when my family changed cities, my parents split up and I finally successfully argued against further meds."
2697,I've had a panic disorder for 8 years now and have been through therapy and meds and being housebound and being fine.
2698,I've been officially 'off' meds 3 weeks tomorrow but today I had a panic attack.
2699,I was fine literally up until I fully came off the meds and now I'm finding myself worrying about silly things again that I thought I'd gotten over.
2700,Will the meds help this over time?
2701,I haven't taken any medication since.
2702,"I am in the shape I wanna be in right now, that helped reduced anxiety, but now I am gonna be overweight again cause of these meds?"
2703,"I read about the woman taking her meds, having 4 shots of Absolut while watching a movie with her husband and she blew into full panic.. qhich then caused me to worry about having some beers with some friends tonight."
2704,I really feel like shit and hate myself for not seeking help or effective medicines.
2705,"It has helped somewhat, but I'm starting to think I either need a higher dose or a different medicine."
2706,"It's gotten to the point where I need to go onto medication because I'm too hard to deal with, so I'm gonna go see the doctor and get all that underway."
2707,The thing I'm worried about is losing a piece of myself (like I don't feel like I'll be myself when I'm on medication) and what things are gonna be like afterwards.
2708,It worries me a lot and it feels like it's a big step transitioning from non medication to something that could change my life so much.
2709,"Any feedback on someone going onto meds for the first time, advice anything would be fantastic."
2710,I've been on and off medication for 3 of those years but it was never consistent past three months.
2711,I am thinking of starting medication again but I know that it’ll interfere with my schooling for at least a good week because of the initial reactions I’ve had in the past.
2712,"I have coped with my anxiety using medication, and have built a nice safe spot in my flat."
2713,I don't want to switch to a daily medication as I don't want to constantly feel medicated.
2714,"These meds are making my life worth living so I don't want to give them up, but I'd love some advice on how to deal with the issue of being... y'know... a little backed up."
2715,I haven't been able to get medication due to lack of health insurance but I shelled out 80 bucks today to talk to someone who told me anxiety isn't a mental illness.
2716,I just hope I can get health insurance soon because I'd really like to try medication I don't want to live like this anymore it's so fucking exhausting.
2717,"TL/DR: VS after head injury, please advice of experience, deterioration, medicine, cures, etc."
2718,"My question is whether there is treatment, is there anything I can do to improve, does it deteriorate, medication?"
2719,I have a doctors appointment this week but I'm afraid they're going to want to throw me on anxiety meds.
2720,I do not want to take any medication.
2721,"He's off his meds, not exercising, not taking care of himself, and lives far away from a major hospital (and he's across the country from me.)"
2722,"I had a doctors appointment this week just for a medication checkup and everything was fine, my Adderall XR (20mg twice a day, since it only lasts 6 hours each) is helping with my anxiety and ADHD without any side effects."
2723,She's painfully shy and has taken medicine for depression off and on.
2724,"She refuses to accept help, routinely take medicine, or go to a therapist."
2725,"Moved house, didn't realise registering at a new doctor would take so long, ran out of my medication yesterday."
2726,Should i try medication?
2727,"First thing she does is switch her to a new medicine, I don't recall what it was, we've been through so many at this point."
2728,"We switch to a new medicine(want to say prozac, with clonazapam as a seditive when needed) and it starts to kick in, she is able to go back to work and function semi normally again."
2729,She is miserable for two months before we try switching meds again in December.
2730,"Last batch of meds were gabupentin, piroxetin, and quetiapin."
2731,"I have no idea what the point of her taking her meds is, she is almost the worst she has ever been, and of course we can't get her doctor to speak to us."
2732,"I've tried medication, but I don't like how they make me feel."
2733,"I already feel super nauseous all the time, but the medications make it worse."
2734,"I don't have insurance or a primary care physician, so it makes it hard to try and get consistent help and daily medication that will help besides Xanax."
2735,I am 20 and have been on anxiety medication since I was in sixth grade (around 11 or 12).
2736,I thought this was withdrawals but I have been off the medicine long enough now for that to subside...
2737,"I'm not on any medication, I'm willing to fight these thoughts on my own-please, if you can advise any method of how to fight with them, help me."
2738,"Is there anything I can do behaviorally (that is, no medicine) to change this?"
2739,"After a trembling, sweaty, unmemorable appointment that I secretly set up with a psychiatrist, he nearly dismissed me without giving me any type of medication."
2740,I think I am going to try medication but don't know exactly what is right for me.
2741,"Eventually my parents realized what was wrong and took me to the doctors who referred me to counseling, after being assessed they prescribed me meds (no idea what ones) that were supposed to help me, I refused to take them as at the time I was very anti-drugs, especially drugs that I considered messed with your brain possibly doing more harm than good, permanently."
2742,Should I just take the medicine?
2743,My doctor gave me anxiety meds(avitan) that I haven't taken in two days because I don't want to destroy my liver and i don't want to be dependent of any substance but it's getting hard to not use it when the anxiety is getting overwhelming.
2744,No medication.
2745,Been off my meds for 6+ months because I was doing great and I don't like putting drugs in my body everyday.
2746,"Called my doc, can't get in for 2 weeks but starting meds tomorrow."
2747,I have another appointment with my doctor in 3 weeks to see how my medication is going and will be organising seeing a counsellor then.
2748,"I've been on medication (started off Zoloft, currently with Pristique) for the last two years and it really does help."
2749,"I'm on antidepressants, anxiety meds, the works."
2750,"I began to read up on these medicines more than I ever had and found that I had some symptoms seemed similar to what I had noticed but thought was normal - I was noticeable less intelligent than I remembered, had a harder time remembering things, and felt foggy a lot."
2751,"The day I lost my meds, I was due to go out of town with some friends."
2752,"Unfortunately, I'm currently out of medication, which brings me to my second question...

2) My doctor prescribed me 5 Ativan and told me to call him when I needed the prescription refilled."
2753,"I wanted to try a different medication, as Ativan doesn't help much, but it's obviously more helpful than anything else I can get OTC such as valerian or herbal tea."
2754,I've also never been on any SSRI or benzo or any type of medication for anxiety/depression before so I have no idea what to expect.
2755,"In anticipation for the new school year (college sophomore), I am going to talk to my doctor about perhaps a prescription for an anti-anxiety medication."
2756,":) So, does anybody, who has anxiety similar to mine (Occasional and acute), know of any medications that have helped them?"
2757,"I told my doctor about it, and he recommended stopping the medication."
2758,"I'm aware that people with my kind of problems develop this kind of thing as a physical symptom of anxiety, but what has me worried is that this had NEVER happened up until I took that new medicine."
2759,"Tremors are one of the listed rare side effects of the medicine, but both I and my mom think that it would have subsided without the medicine in my system."
2760,I know I can't blame my medicine because everything was my choice but I ended up skipping more than 50% of my college classes and eventually dropping out and quitting my good job on a whim one day not caring about bills.
2761,"I then tried to get off the medicine, I was at 30g and I stopped cold turkey...worst 2 weeks of my life."
2762,"I first started going for help with my adhd problems, she gave me medicine for my anxiety( my anxiety can be pretty bad) but i wasn't really wanting to fix that because I could live with it and I learned to cope with some things."
2763,I wanted help to do better in school and with life in general not do worse... Should I consider talking to my doctor about a new medicine?
2764,"I would really like to try out an adhd medicine or something at least then I could see if it would help, or is there medicine that helps both?"
2765,"She's the one who told me I need to see a doctor and get on medication, but I'm not even sure of what I have."
2766,I finally am on medication that's helping.
2767,"Well, I forgot to take my meds this morning, and my anxiety is through the roof."
2768,"[Rant][Meds] Should I increase Lexapro or go to something different

So this is a bit of a question about meds and a bit of a rant."
2769,"The past couple months have been very, very stressful for me and I started a new medication a week ago."
2770,"Recently (even before the meds) I seriously can't keep my hands off my boyfriend, just constantly pawing at him and asking him to flash me when we're not having sex, and have woken up groping/making out with him."
2771,"I'm already on medication for anxiety, can anyone help me?"
2772,"It'll be one year of seeing my main therapist (who determined that I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder)
My main therapist thinks I would benefit a lot from daily anxiety meds and suggested me seeing a psychiatrist."
2773,Chances are I will be prescribes anxiety meds.
2774,MY MAIN CONCERN IS...if I get prescribed anxiety meds...what are the chances of me gaining weight...I've gained about 15-20 lbs this year because of the emotional turmoil I've been dealing with....and now lack of motivation to lose it at the moment ..has caused me to be thicker than i'd like to be...
2775,I worried that if i go on meds...i'll gain more weight.
2776,Any willing to share their experience ... so I can have a better understanding of how meds might affect my weight?
2777,"Before I knew I was behind, I failed to submit work at university, I was being ushered towards counselling and was suggested medication."
2778,(The orgasm being an effect not listed on the medication list).
2779,"When I first tried to masturbate on the medication, it took an incredible amount of time."
2780,"I was not aware that I had never actually orgasmed wanking ever before, and I was suddenly more aware of what the medication has done to me."
2781,"The medication is not known for helping with sexual issues, though it is certainly responsible for my delayed ejaculations (given premature ejaculations are what they are also prescribed for)...."
2782,"The medication has not fixed me, but it has allowed me to understand myself better and certainly has helped to highlight and eradicate problems I didn't know I had."
2783,"We discussed medication and counselling, he left the decision of what  kind of avenue to pursue very much in my hands, and in the end he gave me the names of some support forums, and a prescription of low dosage Propranolol."
2784,"It was nothing like the terrifying experience that I had built it up to be, and I will be happy to return in the next week or two to discuss how my medication works (or if it does), and whether I need to be given a higher dosage, or try anti-depressants."
2785,I am getting SO MUCH BETTER now that I see a doc 4-5 x / wk and she changed my meds.
2786,I wrote this a while ago before I started taking meds.
2787,"I've tried what seems like every medication, with no help."
2788,I have trouble taking my medication because sometimes I think I'm okay but then realize I need it again.
2789,"A little back story I guess: I'm 19 and have been suffering from anxiety and depression since I was 13, have been taking medication since I was 17 but it doesn't seem to be helping anymore and I haven't been able to get to the dr's to talk about what's going on."
2790,"Before starting this medication, my attacks weren't so physical as they were mental."
2791,"While the medicine  seems like it is working, and with very little if any side effects, I am CONSTANTLY wanting to eat."
2792,She asked about what medications I've tried (I'll take a list next time).
2793,"He said there's nothing to do with anxiety except increase the effexor (now 225 mg), I'm maxed out on Topamax (200mg), he doesn't want to add anything else, anxiety medication is too addictive so he won't treat it and he suggests I find other ways to cope (as though I haven't tried)."
2794,I've seen family on anxiety meds and haven't seen great things come of it.
2795,"[Warning: Long, but if you've never tried meds you might find this worth a read.]"
2796,It's been a few days with meds.
2797,I was so anxious and skeptical of psychiatric medication.
2798,"So please, if you can relate to this story but haven't yet booked an appointment to see about meds -- DO IT."
2799,"After being off for about 2 months I thought I'd get a good ""baseline"" for what it's like to be off meds."
2800,My question is if you've come OFF your meds do you have any tips?
2801,I'm hesitant to start on meds again but will if I have to.
2802,"I think today was such a success because of the medicine I've been taking, which is: Lexapro."
2803,"She is afraid to take any medication, being very susceptible, and doesn't feel comfortable going to counseling."
2804,After 3 years of being on Lexapro I came off the meds feeling ready to be my old self again.
2805,The next 6 - 7 months consisted of medication and therapy.
2806,I took both meds immediately prior to beginning an 8-hour shift at work.
2807,"I have diagnosed generalized anxiety, I usually take my meds and the ill be fine."
2808,I was prescribed anti-anxiety medication sometime around January and I had been doing fantastic until Thursday.
2809,"Since starting the medication I haven't had any panic attacks and my depression was under control, but I'm feeling it pretty bad right now.."
2810,"People who are on anxiety medication, have you had ""feelings from the past"" return?"
2811,After talking with me and her doctor and getting on medication for depression (and anxiety soon) she's been happier.
2812,"I started seeing a counselor and got back on medication, but there are two problems with that: 1, counseling hasn't really helped me all that much and 2, I can't afford to go."
2813,"I'm still taking my medicine, but it's not helping all that much."
2814,I am too scared to take my medicine.
2815,I will also be having to get a medicine change as the zoloft was no good and made my problem much worse.
2816,"He refused to even so much as write me a refill after that, saying that I should have successfully withdrawn, and so I was left to find other means to get my medication."
2817,I am very hesitant about going on long term medication.
2818,"I just hear so many stories about side effects and I kinda have a litle phobia of taking medication that alters my ""brain"" anyway."
2819,I hear about meds like Effexor and how people are so addicted to them and get these brain zaps when they miss doses and so on.
2820,It kinda makes me wanna check out meds and see if it gives me some peace of mind.
2821,Recently the depression has gotten severe and I know it must be a side effect of the new medication.
2822,I know that you tend to feel worse before the meds finally kick in.
2823,I feel like I can't switch medications again because its only been 3 weeks on the new one.
2824,And if I'm not feeling better in 3 more weeks (which would equate to a total of 6 weeks taking 20mg of lexapro) then should I consider switching meds again?
2825,"I've been put on numerous medications to try to combat this, only one working which was Xanax."
2826,"I have suffered from depression/anxiety my whole life and was medicated with Prozac before I became pregnant (before anyone asks, I did consult my doctor about going off the medication before we tried to conceive."
2827,"I started seeing a therapist and am going back on medication, which quells my panic and fear pretty damn well, when i'm on it."
2828,Any psychiatrist I've seen since 2009 has completely barred me from being prescribed any medications that could be deemed potentially addictive.
2829,I never asked for a refill early or used my medication up too quickly.
2830,I also never abused this medication and always had leftover when my psych appointment would roll around.
2831,I absolutely NEVER indicated to any of my doctors that I was ever abusing ANY of my medication.
2832,"I guess the point of this is that I'm so sick and tired of dealing with this with SSRIs, SNRI's, and other anti-depressants and bunk bullshit anxiety medications (I'm looking at you Buspar)."
2833,I just want to go back to the medications that worked for me.
2834,"I want to know if I should just give up on this whole getting anxiety meds that actually work for me, and attempt other med free methods of dealing with this."
2835,"TL;DR - I used to shoot heroin a long time ago so now none of my doctors will prescribe me any potentially addictive medications, even if they've worked wonders in the past and I didn't abuse them."
2836,"If you need any general info, I'm in high school, I'm a female, and I haven't been diagnosed with any anxiety disorder/prescribed any medications."
2837,"I'm also convinced there's something catastrophically wrong with my heart, even though I'm on blood pressure medication and have had a normal stress echocardiogram, as well as a battery of other tests (all normal except for elevated cholesterol)."
2838,Meanwhile I lost a lot of hair and gained weight and was just generally feeling hopeless about my medication situation.
2839,"So, I'm in the process of getting some medication for my physical anxiety symptoms."
2840,"He is prescribed heart medications combined with Ativan and Zofran to combat his ""episodes."""
2841,"However, this time I do have medication on me (ativan) which I'll be taking before I leave, and carrying with me throughout the day."
2842,It started after I got back from a visit to the doctor about the adverse reaction to the medication.
2843,I don't want to go to the doctor and get put on medication for it.
2844,"I sometimes can't get a hold of my doctor or forget to renew my perscription, does anyone know how I can get this medicine without the formal channels ?"
2845,I was wondering if anybody else has problems like this and if medication helps?
2846,"Also will I  have to go to a therapist if I decide to try medication, I've been to 2 before and didn't find it helpful?"
2847,At first I thought it was just my own anxiety about taking medication but I also had a loose stool.
2848,I'm pretty frustrated right now and ready to give up on medications.
2849,**Anyone have any similar experiences but found it beneficial to keep trying different meds?
2850,"I also have a bad cold and have been taking cold meds with phenylephrine in it, which I just found out can increase anxiety."
2851,"And as a result of all of this - being sick, new meds, etc, I haven't been eating or drinking much."
2852,"I don't have any experience with meds, so I'm a bit worried as to how I will react to this."
2853,Does anyone have any experience with lorazepam or similar meds?
2854,"so anyway, im hoping to get put on medication again, just so i can cope with it and move on."
2855,I am new to the whole medicine thing.
2856,I've been terrified to take medicine until recently...
2857,And I just want to know if getting medication for this would help at all...
2858,"I don't even know what I would say to a psychologist, I guess I just need some feedback on if medication has truly changed peoples lives for the better... People that cope with anxiety, depression, etc."
2859,"I had always had problems with ADD and insomnia, but was not allowed to be on any medication for it until freshman year of college."
2860,I got prescribed medication for ADD and insomnia.
2861,"Both medications do a little bit to help, but the anxiety, which I was able to cope with or ignore before, gets worse and worse as my classes get harder."
2862,I have been reading on this sub that people have had issues with gaining weight on this medication.
2863,I have gained a lot of weight in the past year trying to cope with my anxiety and I don't want this medication to get in the way of my ability to lose that weight.
2864,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the place for this, but my fiance has just started therapy and medication for Generalized Anxiety Disorder."
2865,"I have read some good experiences with these two meds for treating anxiety, but it seems more people prefer some kind of benzo."
2866,Anybody here with something positive to say about these two medications?
2867,"I'm aware meds aren't going to be some miracle cure, but it feels like I've got as far as I can get with sheer effort alone."
2868,"When anxiety came into the mix a few years ago, I started seeing therapist and psychiatrists, and tried all sorts of meds."
2869,"* FINALLY get a chance to get my allergies which have proressively getting worse checked out but I only get on nasal medication which could have preforated my sinuses, according to the pamphlet which I did not read after a yaer or so of using it too much."
2870,"I became addicted to medication and had a nervous breakdown and I was sent to places that were traumatic because they ripped me from my safe home, and I went through A LOT of abuse in the psychiatric places."
2871,"One of them took the analysis test to see if i should be properly tested for ADHD and it was recommended that id be actually tested to get medication, but i looked around at all the people around me just claiming that they might need meds because they might have ""ADHD"" and it made me feel like one of them just trying to solve my problems with drugs that i dont actually need."
2872,"“MDMA catalyzes shifts toward openness and introspection that do not require ongoing administration to achieve lasting benefits,” the authors write, adding that this could provide benefits over medications that need to be dosed daily."
2873,"I just wanted to give you guys something before... 
 Two years ago I went from being someone who was afraid of being seen in public and almost throwing up two years ago to finding a doctor and getting medication that fixed me for the most part."
2874,I had a meds change (I am now on Zoloft) and so far so good.
2875,However I could see my family doctor for anxiety meds if I need to get them sooner.
2876,Should I try to make an appointment for my doc to get meds for Christmas?
2877,I was already diagnosed with anxiety prior to this but never took any meds.
2878,I am now on some medication that my significant other does not want me to take.
2879,I don't know if I'll ever get better or if my mind is just broken beyond repair and will have to experiment with different medications and deal with terrifying side-effects.
2880,"I've spoken with doctors, a psychiatrist, and have been in regular contact with two counselors who have all encouraged me to either increase my medication or experiment with other medications despite my anxiety centering around experiencing the effects of medications and second-hand exposure to other psychoactive substances."
2881,"I choose not to take anxiety medication, because I'm worried of its effects."
2882,"Also, are anxiety medications really that bad?"
2883,"Thank you if you made it this far.... thank you...

**Edit: I go to therapy (with a Psychiatrist that I am quickly beginning to think is useless) and I have seen many different counselors for years (probably since I was 16 so on and off for 13 years) and I take medication."
2884,"My second visit to this ""counselor"" and she gives me pamphlets on this pseudo-medicine garbage."
2885,"Needless to say it's all psychosematic bullshit medicine, right up there with the people in CA doing ""light therapy"" or whatever the newest unproven bullshit new age medicine is.....

Long story short, I'm out on Short Term Disability for losing it at work."
2886,(Also there was a medicine change in there from Zoloft to Effexor.
2887,"Now I'm looking at one last appt with her before the disbility leave ends (because hey I'm back on Zoloft and it's not as bad anymore... yes it sucks, and I still cry about it, but walking out in traffic isn't on my to-do list anymore), and I need to get in with a psychologist, who has the ability to play with my medicines and do it the right way, instead of my GP."
2888,Has gotten worse with age to the point where i started counseling after leaving school at 16 and meds at 18.
2889,"I have been struggling with GAD for most my life now and it's gotten better with therapy and medications but sometimes I get almost ""flair ups"" of anxiety."
2890,I am currently on a medication called viibryd.
2891,I have an appointment on the 1st to see how the medication is working out but I just don't know.
2892,"He's 62 years old, and takes medicine daily."
2893,"I'm trying this new thing where I muscle up the courage to go to see doctors about my anxiety and am trying to get on some medication, got my first prescription for a non-antidepressant yesterday for hydroxyzine (to be taken 4x a day) but it doesn't seem to be helping at all and is fully knocking me out (ex: i normally go to sleep around 3-4 in the morning because i work second shift, i took some when i got home at 8 yesterday and went to sleep an hour later and woke up at 3)

advice/anecdotes?"
2894,"Almost 10 hours later I can't remember if I took my medication today, (1 per day in the morning) so what I'm asking is if it is harmful to take 2 pills in 1 day (assuming I did take it) or taking the pill half way through the day is harmful."
2895,"Hey guys, I was wondering if you had any advice about what medications have worked for you or friends."
2896,"I've recently been dealing with a lot of anxiety, and while there are many different ways of dealing with it, medication, meditation, therapy, or the million other things you can do, I have found a really easy way to take about 1% of the edge off, and I'm sure a lot of people do it."
2897,"My mother is on anxiety medication and says that if I can handle it without medication, she recommends I try that."
2898,I am on medication now and regular therapy.
2899,This sub pushed me forward to try medication and I can't be more grateful.
2900,"I've told my psychologist every single visit that I'd rather not start anxiety medication, since I've had problems with drinking, recently stopped smoking cigs, and am really worried that I'll get hooked."
2901,"Well a recent visit to the doctor's office because I was worried about appendicitis finally made me cave in, and I discussed starting medication."
2902,"I told my co-worker today about the medication I was prescribed, and he assured me everything would be okay, that I should take it to try it out, and that we would take care of me if something went wrong."
2903,"**Anyways, it'd be cool if anyone had stories to share about the first time taking meds for their anxiety!"
2904,My current medication helps some with depression but does nothing for anxiety.
2905,I don't want to be on this medication any more.
2906,"~male, 20, very high-functioning asperger's, no meds at present
 
Hello friends."
2907,This has been going on in some form for the past five years and I've never taken any medication.
2908,I should also note that I have helped cope with my anxiety without the meds by seriously taking up weight lifting the past few years.
2909,"Background info: not on meds yet, I see a psychiatrist and counsler and I'm still going through my psych evaluation and all my other tests."
2910,I take medication for these and see a therapist.
2911,Then I hear about how commonly prescribed my medications are.
2912,I've been taking this medication for over a month now.
2913,"Why I started the course:
My psychiatrist prescribed me medication and that was it."
2914,"Although the medication was helping a lot (no more panic attacks, yay!"
2915,"Me after the course:
I'm currently still on medication, but tapering off (2.5mg currently and no major issues, just headaches, lucky me), and have not had a panic attack in months."
2916,"Since that time i have been taking medication, now at my maximum allowed dosage."
2917,"When i started, the medication felt like it was having a positive effect."
2918,Pot is literally my only medication/remedy when it comes to my anxiety.
2919,I'm too scared to go on meds after seeing my older sister almost kill herself trying to get off her antidepressants.
2920,I also have health anxiety and emetophobia so this has me worried that I'm sick with something... but I know some anxiety meds can cause fatigue?
2921,She prescribed me some medicine that I take occasionally when I can't manage the breathing on my own.
2922,"Strangely enough, yesterday I had a horrible anxiety day (mainly health-anxiety related)

Do other people notice peaks and lows of anxiety when on these medications?"
2923,"I know that the common advice for anxiety is therapy and medication, but I'm far too anxious for the former and strongly dislike the latter."
2924,Usually just opiate pain medication.
2925,He was placed on a number of meds and for a while they worked but now his panic attacks are getting worse and more frequent.
2926,Is it normal for the meds to not work good for a week?
2927,"I will be sure to wait a few weeks before I contact my doctor because from what everyone is saying, these side effects seem normal when you first get on the medication."
2928,"*Apologies this will be a bit of an essay but I need to get this off my chest/written down:*

**Background:** In Feb 2013 I started a good job in admin/scheduling, I was living with my boyfriend (together 2 yrs) and I was in control of my anxiety with no meds."
2929,I talked with my therapist and she said if I don't want to go down the medication route I'd have to have long term therapy which I don't mind.
2930,"I was put on Prozac and 5 years later (today at 20) I still have some very mild panic attacks with the agoraphobia, but am no longer in need of the medication."
2931,"I mean duh, my anxiety is triggered by unexpected death, mixing medications sounds like a Molotov cocktail."
2932,"I've never tried any other prescribed medication, I've always just worked with therapists/over the counter medications like Rescue Remedy and Kalms."
2933,I've read/heard things about getting addicted or becoming depressed/suicidal off of taking prescription meds and this freaked me out a little because I fear that the drugs would make me do things I wouldn't do if I wasn't on them.
2934,"It's been a few months now, and I've been taking this medication every day without missing any days."
2935,"I don't recall having these feelings prior to the medication, but I'm wondering if this is the positive from taking it."
2936,Should I attempt to switch medications?
2937,"I think I would benefit greatly from anti-anxiety medications, but how do I talk to my doctor without seeming like I'm just looking for drugs?"
2938,"first it was like faraway street lights seeming fuzzy and blurry and today just my sight seems off, i feel like i just wanna close my eyes could be eye strain from being on the pc for a while (online class) and reading in a dark room + meds but im getting scared its a a degenerative disease!"
2939,I'm currently on medication (Celexa) but it takes about 30 days to really work (I've only been on it for a week).
2940,"I'm not really sure what I was expecting, I've never really taken meds before."
2941,I was initially pretty glad about being off my meds but the withdrawals are really getting to me.
2942,Many times I debated going back on my meds but I really don't want to fall back on them again.
2943,"I wake up feeling instantly alert when I'm sleeping on a sofa, probably because I never get any good quality deep sleep, and I hate how long it takes me to wake up when I sleep properly (thanks meds)."
2944,I've been prescribed sleeping meds in the past but everything I've been prescribed has made me wake up feeling unrested and too drowsy the next day to function properly.
2945,"Tl;dr- 7 years of anxiety, meds suck, doctors suck, Fresh air and exercise are awesome,"
2946,"I feel like I need to find a medication or something because as much as I seem to understand this test when I'm in the library, I couldn't execute when I needed to."
2947,I was on medicine for a long time and I went back to the doctor and they upped my dose hoping that it would fix my issues but it hasn't.
2948,I have been (tentatively) diagnosed with GAD and am currently not taking any medications.
2949,I cannot afford go to therapy or get medication because I do not have health insurance and  cannot take advantage of any government assistance programs because of my income level.
2950,And I don't know if it's dangerous to drink while taking these types of medications?
2951,"I guess my question is, for those of you who are on meds, what are your thoughts?"
2952,This medicine is new to me so I just wanted to see if anyone out there had any good information to contribute.
2953,I was wanting to know if anyone has taken this medicine and what their experiences were.
2954,I'm working on a big exercise program in addition to medicine so I hope to see great improvements over the next few months.
2955,"The counseling was helpful but the feeling usually didn't last (catharsis has always felt temporary), but the medication helped so after several months, I stopped seeing the counselor and just stuck to the meds."
2956,"After a couple years and moving on to a better place in my life, I came off the medication and was doing great for about two years."
2957,"I want to take the other approach of seeking psychotherapy in addition to medication, but my previous experience with a college-provided mental health provider makes me doubt how helpful it would be."
2958,"Don't take any medication though, not for anxiety, not for stress."
2959,"They may offer some ""shut up"" medication, some on the spot calm your ass the fuck down pills."
2960,"What started this all really is I've been going to the doctor recently for the first time in a long time, and the first thing they did was remove moles from me and one had a chance of being something worse, which it didn't in the end, but this re activated my anxiety about things that could be wrong with me, and I just want it to stop, I am married with 2 kids, and I don't want to be the scared daddy, I finally feel somewhat better, but I don't wanna take meds."
2961,I don't have a prescription for any medications as they're pretty hard to obtain where I'm from unless you pay for therapy (which I can't afford).
2962,After a panic attack at work yesterday I scheduled an appointment to see my doctor about getting put on some more anti-anxiety meds.
2963,"Now I have my medication again, but it hasn't seemed to kick in yet."
2964,"I got things sorted, as far as I know, but I'm basically useless right now, and I don't know what to do until the meds kick in again."
2965,"I'm seeing a therapist, on medication, and have sought help from my university."
2966,"My family doctor, gave me a prescription for anti-depressant/anxiety medication (luvox) and refused to write me a referral, rather seeing if the med's would be the solution."
2967,I also have to take my anxiety meds then which I hate doing.
2968,Is it worth seeking councelling or new meds?
2969,Usually I would stray away from most medications but I think that taking an antidepressant will be more beneficial on my health than not taking any at all.
2970,"For reference, I haven't had a full blown attack since before I started my current medication for the unrelated issue, which is at this point nearly a full year."
2971,"I was put on medication (Lexipro) and I think it's working, but I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to feel."
2972,I decided to taper down and come off the medication as I was at odds with the mood stabilising aspect of the drug.
2973,I'm not on any medications.
2974,"When I am faced with the prospect of taking anxiolytic meds, I am always worried that I will lose my inspiration and just go through life pleasantly but unproductively, creating nothing new and existing as a cultural zero-sum."
2975,"I developed a huge fear of medication, mainly tablets and pills after having a seizure from taking a certain type of medication."
2976,"I never took the step to take antidepressants or anxiety medication, as I was fearful to even approach a doctor and talk about the subject."
2977,I tried to do it without any medication.
2978,"I was hoping to try the anti-anxiety / depression medication ""Wellbutrin""."
2979,"But alas, it is not approved for psychiatric medication in the UK."
2980,"Ive started seeing a therapist, and am not on any meds yet (see a doc on Mon.)."
2981,Im getting a ADHD diagnosis and i wish to go back to school but i'm sure i can't manage it without support and/or medication.
2982,I'm working with a professional trying to figure out medication and such and it seems like nothing is working.
2983,I'm just not sure how I am supposed to feel while taking medication.
2984,ive tried therapy and meds and im gonna try em again except my dads not really giving me much time to fix my problems at all.
2985,"If I try this medication for 3 weeks, is that a) enough time to feel the effects and b) a short enough amount of time not to experience withdrawal if I choose to stop it?"
2986,I've been having some trouble getting my meds refilled.
2987,"I might have a chance to see him on Saturday, but by then it will have been a week since I've taken my medication."
2988,"After starting Zoloft I do feel like I'm more at ease and I don't take shit so seriously, but I can't really discern if it's the medication or placebo, since the change in my mood was pretty subtle."
2989,"I've become convinced that, as much as I didn't want to have to turn for a drug to help, I probably do need a prescription for anti-anxiety meds to at least help me to begin to break the cycle of not being passionate about anything and being too nervous to get out and actually put my life together, but I'm not sure how to get a prescription, with my parents being convinced that it is unnecessary."
2990,"The problem is, I have been to 3 doctors now and not one will give me fucking anxiety medicine."
2991,"I have never been to a therapist before, so I don't know what is to be expected when you need help with something like general anxiety, or when the person you are seeking help from cannot prescribe medications."
2992,"need meds, can't get them."
2993,"So I take my prescribed anxiety medication (Klonopin 0.25 to 0.75 mg), and I calm down but can't focus anymore."
2994,"I've been to the doctor and they prescribed me with Buspar, but I have yet to take it because I feel like meds aren't the answer."
2995,"I'm not taking any medications that could be the cause of it, my diet is fairly healthy and I drink plenty of water."
2996,(I quit in 2011 when I thought I had a heart problem- turned out to be a side effect of the depression medication that I was on - thanks Citrolorapham!)
2997,I'm 22 years old and not on any medication for my anxiety but I've been to counseling about it before.
2998,"I can't sleep through the night at all and wake up terrified, and I can't take some anti-anxiety meds I was given because I think I'm developing a tolerance to them and don't want to risk worse withdrawal than what I'm pretty sure I'm going through right now."
2999,"Unfortunately I find myself in my late 20s and things have gotten out of control (at least a full panic attack per week, anxious non-stop) so my therapist suggested talking to a psychiatrist and perhaps taking some meds."
3000,"Now I was a psych major in college and have a *basic* understanding of how different meds work and the side effects, etc."
3001,so I'm also aware of the benefits of a combo of therapy and medication.
3002,"The pharmacist immediately looks at the medicine and asks, ""what's wrong with you?""."
3003,"He then starts lecturing me on mental illness and  declares that I don't need the meds because what's wrong with me is all in my head and I can ""get over it"" if I really want to."
3004,"Then just stick to your job, tell me about the meds, and keep your opinions to yourself."
3005,I don't know if I should try to get medication/therapy if in a couple months I won't even be living here anymore.
3006,"I won't link to the deleted thread or copy the text from it and paste it here out of respect to the user, but I figured I should still post my reply as a self-post in case the user is still here...and even if they aren't, hopefully it will be of some help to anyone else dealing with anxiety with questions about Clonazepam as a new medication."
3007,"First of all, I definitely share your fear and worry of taking a new, unknown medication."
3008,"I'm also ""hypersensitive"" to just about every medication/drug I've come in contact with...I've been on a ton of various medications over the years and every one has had an extreme effect on me, way more than is normal."
3009,"So again, I share your fear of taking new meds as well as freaking out easily by taking even slightly too much of something."
3010,"All that being said, of all of the medications I've tried (and there have been a lot), in my experience Clonazepam has been by far the ""least worrying"" medication I've taken...and I mean that literally."
3011,"I also have suffered from depression for many years and while plenty of other meds have worsened or caused depressive side effects for me, I have not had this experience with Clonazepam at all."
3012,"I'd err on the side of caution since everyone reacts differently and since you're starting it for the first time, but I'd rate the danger as very low...and if it did have any effect, it would most likely just be a strengthening of the anti-anxiety effects of the medication and all of the effects of the alcohol."
3013,"It's very long acting which is good because, unlike short acting meds, there's not as much of a rapid and sharp drop-off that fuels the ""I need to take more now, and again and again when each new dose wears off"" that shorter acting benzos have."
3014,"Does anyone take a medication that just gets them through the work hours, and then leaves them free to not be on a medication the rest of the day and on weekends?"
3015,It seems like a lot of what psychiatrists do is prescribe medication to take when one is experiencing an anxious state.
3016,"So they sent me home with no medicine but at this point I couldn't sleep much anymore, always grabbing my stomach and then I would wake up every two hours shaking and feeling fear."
3017,"Anyway, they gave me some medicine for the stomach to control the inflammation."
3018,"Even after the CT scan that time, they sent me to get an echo for my organs (pancreas, liver, gall bladder and so on), he said, all good (well, except my liver because I am fat but no medication required)."
3019,"I was expecting to go to the doctor and receive a prescription for some anti-anxiety medication, but nope."
3020,I hate medication.
3021,The medication did help.
3022,"I took medicine for a while, but I didn't like it, so I stopped."
3023,"That same week with the support of my amazing SO I made the decision to finally request to be put on meds, that was terrifying for me as I had never wanted to do it, I am very fearful of things like that and was pretty uneducated about it, but I got on 75mg of Effexor and despite a shaky and nauseous first week it had an amazing impact on my life."
3024,"I really haven't felt too much anxiety with the job either, my meds seem to keep everything in check and after the first week I knew what I was doing and can keep perfectly calm on the phones with people."
3025,I went to the doctor this morning (my Mom's suggestion) to see about medication to help me manage my anxiety better since school will be starting in about a month.
3026,I am now so worried about taking them that I am feeling like it was a big mistake to even go to the doctor in the first place and I am worried if these medications with make my symptoms worse as I had read that Zoloft in particular can cause anxiety.
3027,"So at this point, I am unsure if I am just freaking myself out for no reason (I definitely do that to myself) or if I am only going to make my currently situation harder on myself by taking these medications."
3028,I don’t want to be seen as someone who’s “just looking for medication”...
3029,"In fact, I don’t even want to be prescribed medication."
3030,"I don't want therapy, I don't want to be on medication."
3031,I took my meds (200mg of Zoloft) and am trying to calm down.
3032,For the first time since in two years Im actually considering of taking medication.
3033,I just want to know how everyone else is dealing with anxiety/ocd that mainly focus on breathing and how medication could help in improving these habits.
3034,I don't want to go on medication because it only happens once every few months.
3035,"Also, if anyone knows, a few months ago, I was prescribed medication for anxiety and depression."
3036,"It was starting to help, but my mother made me feel so horrible for taking any medication (she doesn't believe medication works or that I even have anxiety/depression), I stopped."
3037,I have a couple of questions regarding general anxiety and meds.
3038,"I live in a third world shithole that thankfully has most of the needed meds in pharmacies and doesn't have a big of a stigma on those in the society, still it's hard to be diagnosed because the psychologists have been schooled in Soviet Union and psychiatry kinda embraces leftovers of the punitive past."
3039,Like telling me to do a non-lethal OD on meds in my apartment.
3040,"I volunteer 3 days a week, I see a counselor, I'm on meds, I have a support worker."
3041,"I am currently seeing a psychotherapist, and am experimenting (with my physician) with different dosages/medicines."
3042,I'm always nervous when starting a new medication.
3043,I've been dealing with depression for the past couple years (I'm not taking medication) and recently I am having major anxiety(?)
3044,I take medication to prevent shaking so that isn't an issue.
3045,"I'm managing it okay though, and don't feel ""stuck"" like I did pre-medication."
3046,".. speaking in class

.. performing spoken word (even though i really want to)

.. asking the teacher questions when other people are in the room

.. taking ANY sort of exam -- i just freeze up

.. fucking up a technical interview, like i just did

.. anticipating being called on in class unexpectedly

it's like i can't think, all i can do is panic

(would medication help with this?)"
3047,"Also, I shouldn't be expecting results quite yet if I've just started the medication right?"
3048,"I have no money, no job (I am looking), no friends, no insurance, no car, no medication, have anxiety, depression, adhd and living under my mothers roof."
3049,After about 8 months of not needing medication i have now decided to go back.
3050,I have had anxiety since the 3rd grade and on medication on and off.
3051,I don't want to go on meds just for the the next month either because of ants.
3052,And thank you to the medication that makes me want to vomit my brains onto the floor so I can pick it apart in person rather than suffer through the confusing twists and turns in my head.
3053,About a year later I was done with college and thought I could handle no meds.
3054,"After about a month off meds, I went back on Lexapro for about another year."
3055,I am starting to think I'm just one of those people who needs medication and I am trying to be alright with that and not feel weak or broken.
3056,So my question to you all of this anxiety subreddit is... What are your experiences with meds?
3057,Which specific meds worked for you?
3058,I think what scares me the most is that I'll try a new medication and react horribly to it and gain even more weight on top of it all.
3059,"I'm planning on making another trip to my GP this week to discuss how I can better handle this (perhaps medication), but I don't know how to tell my supervisors what happened."
3060,I convinced myself it was the medicine and my psychiatrist immediately told me to stop taking it.
3061,The psychiatrist told me that she has never heard a symptom like this and that the medicine should have been outta my system after the first 5 hours of not taking it.
3062,"I have never taken medication for anxiety/stress, but I have taken something called Circadin that helps sleeping (take it as a soft sleeping pills)."
3063,"I'm already on about 6 other medications for my other health problems, and I feel like since this panic disorder is so mild compared to what most of you go through, maybe I shouldn't be on meds for it?"
3064,"*

I am mostly here to see if anyone else has experienced this - where the doctor either stopped or won't prescribe ADHD/ADD medication due to the presence of THC, and what choice they made when it came to smoking weed or taking meds."
3065,"Anyways, this got me thinking to mention this anxiety to my doctor and get her opinion on starting anti-anxiety meds."
3066,"** 

**TL;DR: Been taking Vyvanse for 2 years and was recently drug tested by doctor for anti-anxiety meds (which I hate and will discontinue taking due to side effects)."
3067,I've tried several different medications and this is the only combo that even *touches* the anxiety.
3068,"I take my medication, I work, and I try my hardest to make friends and be social...but it never seems to go anywhere."
3069,I am no longer on the meds that once saved my life.
3070,"And i really would like to not take drugs, i am worried about side effects and i am not very good at remembering to take medicine consistently, and I am a poor uni student and not sure if i can pay for it."
3071,I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for which I take medicine.
3072,"I see a therapist and take meds for my anxiety, but it's so hard."
3073,"25, M, General Anxiety Disorder (diagnosed), No medication."
3074,"My question is this: I've always been afraid to try medication, so much so that when I was actually holding the pills, it triggered a pretty good anxiety attack and I threw them down the sink."
3075,Is there a chance that taking medication can help me feel like I do in the mornings all of the time?
3076,"That gives me hope that, with work on anxiety through therapy (and probably meds soon), I will get back to that place of rational thought."
3077,I have refused to take medication but I'm thinking that might be the only choice I have left?
3078,I'm taking some medication for it.
3079,I was finally able to stay calm for a bit and I felt the medicine working in the back right of my skull.
3080,"I know there can be a transition period of getting used to a medication, but I experience severe agitation/irritability."
3081,It was kind of the agitation you get from ADHD meds such and adderall or vyvanse.
3082,"I'm interested if anyone who has discontinued their medication without the supervision of a doctor... or with, has had similar experiences?"
3083,"I used to tell myself I would never go on meds, but now I would take anything if it would just make this anxiety disorder go away."
3084,"The thought that the meds could make me that way scares the shit out of me and starts my negative thought cycle, but after working with a therapist I got better about that."
3085,Today I forgot to take my medication and got stuck running errands most of the day.
3086,September this year I got my exam results from last year and they weren't good; I wanted to go into veterinary medicine but failed chemistry and got very low grades in maths and biology.
3087,"Ever since I got on meds (Celexa and Abilify) I've had energy to do stuff, which is great."
3088,"I did an experiment the other night, and only took the Lamictal, instead of all my nightly meds."
3089,"Not that labels matter as long as the medication works but I'm curious.... well, it kind of does matter for me, because my insurance won't approve Saphris on the basis that I'm not bipolar, but yeah."
3090,"I didn't want to start a long term medication, it just feels so serious..."
3091,So after years of struggling with this problem I have finally decided to see the doctor about my symptoms and I'm hoping I can get some answers or medication.
3092,and what should I be wary (if there are any concerns) about medication if thats what the doc suggests?
3093,I'm sure a lot of you will recommend medication.
3094,And trying medication again really fucking scares me.
3095,Can you describe your experience with meds.
3096,"He's convinced it's something physiological, as am I to some extent, which is where medication should come in."
3097,The other psychiatrist barely listens to me and basically throws medicine at me.
3098,"It is now, at 24, that I am looking into getting back on some medication."
3099,My question: are there anti-anxiety medications that will help ease my 'symptoms' (?)
3100,"I told him that I had started medication recently for my anxiety (low-dose Prozac), and he became really argumentative about it."
3101,"I already knew that he wasn't a big believer in medication, but I wanted to let him know I had started on it just to keep him in the loop."
3102,He kept arguing against it and making me justify what was a very difficult decision for me initially (going on medication).
3103,"I was having a lot of difficulty cumming on my medication initially but now that I have been on it (escitalopram) for like three or four weeks, my ability to nut without huge effort is returning."
3104,"medication, I tried psychology but it didn't seem to help)
- NLP 
- Hypnosis

Would love to know anything that has worked for others!"
3105,"hello I a male and have had anxiety disorder for maybe 25 years, for the past 3 I have not on any meds except occasional diazepam."
3106,I know this is a huge factor in the level of my anxiety but I don't want to have to rely on medication.
3107,"It went pretty well, and he told me to come back Friday with a parent (I'm a minor) and meanwhile to do some research about possible medications."
3108,He did a wide variety of tests (including stroke and other neurological tests) but the meds he gave me (propranolol 20mg) only work for a short time before the vertigo comes back.
3109,I got help and eventually was able to stop all medication.
3110,I fear that I might have to go on meds in order to rectify this.
3111,- None of my friends/family take anxiety meds so I can't bum off anyone.
3112,None of my migraine medication (which are on the low end of severity) help with klonopin withdrawal.
3113,"I'm not on any medications because my insurance doesn't cover psychiatric and with my husband needing an adderall script every three months, there just isn't enough extra cash for it."
3114,I know I shouldn't feel like this but I really wanted to be prescribed anxiety meds or even beta blockers.
3115,"Being 18 years old I have numerous options and this is almost sickening to think of all the potential outcomes, Today I was researching going to university (The thought of university doesn't scare me as i'd be in a town full of strangers) when i discovered i'd have to go to my local college for a year to get an ATHE (Access to higher education qualification) I suddenly felt like I was trapped and a choking feeling completely took hold, my fear of never leaving my town or becoming something more hit me real hard and i had to take medication to calm me down...."
3116,"I don't take medication as I don't like the way it makes me feel (ironic, I know)."
3117,"I'm a twenty-two year old type 1 diabetic (since 5)

I was diagnosed only months into kindergarten with ADD and was prescribed ritalin after only a short doctor's visit, and have cycled through some twenty or thirty different medications, many of them stimulants, up until shortly after high school."
3118,"One particular doctor kept upping the dose and piling on more meds and I only got more depressed, anxious, and couldn't eat or focus, or even sleep."
3119,I somewhat recently (in September) switched medications from Zoloft (which I had been on for several years) to Lexapro.
3120,"I would love during one of these episodes to actually just pass out, because then I could be sent to the hospital and have a doctor tell me what's wrong, give me medication, and all is well."
3121,I turned to medication when I actively engaged in therapy last year and was put on Clonazepam (regular dosage and as needed for attacks) and run through the gauntlet for depression meds until I ended up with Wellbutrin.
3122,I had been on my medication for nearly a year when I decided to cut the Clonazepam out at the turn of the new year this January.
3123,"I am looking for an unbiased, outside perspective regarding... well, the title of this post: do the benefits of the meds outweigh the detriments?"
3124,I'm wondering if any of you have made the switch and if Wellbutrin has helped better than other meds?
3125,"So, I have been off my medication (Xanex .5 mg 1x daily) for about a month now."
3126,"TL;DR haven't had meds refilled in 2+ months.. doc lowered my dosage and insisted I make it last a month, now I'm worried she sees me as an addict and I'm not."
3127,"Background: 26years, had depression,anxiety attacks and panick attacks for more or less 3 years, took medication for 1 year, didn't worked."
3128,"If haven't picked up on it already, I am terrified of medication."
3129,I'd rather not go on any medication but I'll do whatever if it works.
3130,How does getting medication work if you are seeing a psychologist?
3131,I had no anxiety while dating her and for once in my life no meds and felt great.
3132,"I was put on Prozac for a bit, then decided I wanted to stop it just because I felt I didn't want anymore meds in me than I already had (I take Adderall frequently - prescribed ofc)."
3133,I’m most afraid my meds aren’t effective.
3134,"However, I vowed to get off my medication in time for starting university and the fear of going full circle and relapsing towards the end of next month terrifies me."
3135,"I do know that if I did not regularly take medicine to slow my intestines, I would be about 30-40 pounds lighter than I am now because I would have extreme diarrhea EVERY morning."
3136,"(I gained 60 pounds when I started the meds, within 2 months, but have dropped back down about 30.)"
3137,"Now with these meds, I have extreme bowel movements every couple days where I literally empty my entire intestinal tract into the toilet."
3138,"I've been on five different medications for it, and I'm not sure if any really work."
3139,"Well, I'm apparently immune / resistant to medicines like Xanax."
3140,So now were trying this Gabapentin and I was wondering if anyone else has heard of this being used for anxiety disorders / have any kind of experience with this medication?
3141,this is a dilemma for me because i take birth control in the morning and i would like to take all my meds at once but i think lexapro in the am might not be worth it.
3142,I can't help but believe the anti-psych people who say this medicine is toxic and killing me.
3143,"I want to be sure that it is the medicine though before I stop, because it is actually helping my depression and anxiety in the daytime."
3144,Do I need to stop taking the medication?
3145,* I always need to have someone by my side when I take a new medication in case I go into some sort of anaphylactic shock.
3146,"I'm sure it's done well for some people, and has been a nightmare for others like all of these medicines."
3147,"I've tried Vyvanse before the Prozac for a little trial period of a few month, and it was great, so I'm definitely going back to the ADHD meds."
3148,"I've seen psychiatrists and been in the psychiatric hospital twice because I was told it would make me more stable on my meds and therefore make them work better, but never really been in therapy."
3149,"I thought, maybe I can go to a therapist they won't push me to take meds and I can just figure out how to overcome this."
3150,"The first few visits were a lot of ""You should really see a psychiatrist and try medication."
3151,"Really really you just weren't trying hard enough before, you were just trying to be difficult and that's what made the medication not work."""
3152,"I was never taken to a doctor, never given medication."
3153,"I became pregnant last year at the age of 28, and had to quit my medication (xanax) cold turkey."
3154,"My mistake was not going back to my doc immediately, putting my kiddo on formula and getting back on anxiety meds."
3155,"Hi,
Recently discovered this subreddit, thought you could give me a bit of advice...

My Fiance has anxiety and she told me there is medicine for this i try encourage her to get it (any help is help)
we've recently just became parents and i feel i need to help her more now than ever 

What advice could you give on what to do and what to avoid"
3156,"I don't take medication any more, fyi"
3157,my medicine is also working wonders.
3158,"I'm curious if anyone has any reccomendations for a non-benzo, non-ssri medication for GAD and Panic Disorder."
3159,"In the past I've done CBT, counseling, I've tried exercising, eating healthy, but I'm finding it very difficult to get things under control without medication."
3160,Are any of you currently taking or aware of medications that aren't prone to abuse and won't give me a wet noodle?
3161,I have been to my doctor and he has prescribed me some anti-depressant medication which I feel like does nothing at all.
3162,"I have no prior history of mental illnesses, I don't use any medication, nor I smoke weed."
3163,I used to take meds for that (also for depression/bipolar 2).
3164,"She suggested Lexapro (which my psych also suggested 5 months ago, but I felt fine and chose to stay off meds)."
3165,"After being in a stressed out, bad place I started seeing a therapist, and tomorrow I'm seeing a psychiatrist to look into getting some form of meds."
3166,I'm worried that maybe I'm not actually having anxiety attacks and maybe I just have a low tolerance for stress or I'm subconsciously freaking out for attention or it isn't really bad enough to where I need meds.
3167,I'm not currently taking anxiety meds as they make me really drowsy.
3168,"26M, no meds, general anxiety and depression?"
3169,Do meds help you reconnect with the authentic you that's just covered with anxiety or do they simply cover the physical symptoms and make you feel less uncomfortable without changing your thought process?
3170,"Do meds help with any of the negative personality traits i've accumulated over the years due to constant anxiety, and can they help connect with the real you?"
3171,"(I'm not on meds and my mom will not let me, which is good because I'm getting stronger with my problems )"
3172,This is my first long term medication I've tried for my anxiety.
3173,"Also, can long term damage be done to myself by taking a medicine that is not compatible with me?"
3174,I can't tell if it's heat related or medication related?
3175,I came off abilify cold turkey because I lost my insurance and couldn't get my meds.
3176,Eventually I got back on my meds and for the most part everything went back to normal except this symptom.
3177,I can't afford to be on medication or see a doctor about it because my insurance sucks.
3178,"I have never tried medication, but I would be willing to, If I could convince someone that I needed it enough to take the time to care about me."
3179,I have recently been put on medicine and am seeing a counselor who is really helping me to gain perspective on things and has given great coping skills.
3180,I was off of my medication for a few weeks but recently went back on it and I've noticed that my baseline anxiety levels are raising.
3181,And did switching medication to something like adderall help?
3182,How do the anxiety levels of certain stimulant medications compare to each other?
3183,"Also, I am unable to function in my current school and work settings w/o my medication so I don't see living stimulant-free as a viable option at this point in my life."
3184,I've been on medication in the past but stopped after a year (Zoloft).
3185,Now I know just from doing my own research and talking with my doctor that its not always the first try with medications to have the right one.
3186,I have  a few friends I have talked with about them being on medications such as prozac and zolof and such.
3187,I guess what I am asking is what are some of your guys experiance with your medications.
3188,Did it scare you to feel like you would have to rely on a medication to stay alright with things?
3189,"I give him some cheese and bread so that he can take his medicine; a hefty mix of antidepressant, two antianxiolytics, beta blockers and various dietary supplements to minimise the side effects."
3190,"Oh btw, in terms of depression/anxiety I feel great, and feel better since getting off the meds."
3191,"TL;DR: I may have gotten off my meds too quickly, should I consider getting back on and weening off more slowly."
3192,"I went to see my doctor yesterday to have my meds adjusted, etc."
3193,"I've never taken another persons medication before, and this is something that I would never do in a rational state of mind, but I was freaking out so bad that she was concerned for me and she thought it would help."
3194,"I quit smoking a couple months ago and now I feel like the only thing (besides meds, which I don't have) that will calm me down is a cigarette and some booze."
3195,The other hope is medication...but I don't know where that could lead.
3196,I'm heading to the doctor today to hopefully be prescribed some anti-anxiety meds.
3197,"So, I'm REALLY REALLY hoping that medication will help with my inability to concentrate."
3198,"In 10th grade, I took a medication (believe it started wth a ""Z"")and it helped, but didn't fix all of it."
3199,and we are currently on a month trial of being off medication to see how it goes.
3200,And I am not one who is a huge fan of taking medication so I would like to deal with this on my own.
3201,I am taking my medicine correctly and consistently but sometimes it just...doesn't work.
3202,And there is no way I could ever live without some sort of drug; there are times in the past when I forgot to take my medicine for multiple days in a row.
3203,"I can just get by with my medicine, but without it, I might as well be dead."
3204,Has anyone had something like what I have temporary and was successful in beating it without meds?
3205,"I'm also scared of suggesting for her to talk to someone or get meds (I don't actually know the severity of it, she's had 2 panic attacks that she's told me about, and was hospitalized once for it, all in the span of 3 months)."
3206,I've been having bad health anxiety for the last couple of months and finally ended up getting meds to help.
3207,I just feel empty and I'm thinking of just stopping the meds.
3208,I'm not currently on any medication and I'm wondering what other people's experiences of this is?
3209,"And the ways to fix it are difficult (therapy, finding right meds, diet, exercise, meditation, socialization)."
3210,This medication evens out my moods but it makes me depressed when before I was angry and my anxiety is worse than ever.
3211,I want to stop the medication but I'm afraid of what I'll be like without it as college starts back soon.
3212,Should I wait on this new doctor and keep on with the medication and hope it gets better or stop the medication?
3213,I'm on the wrong medication and none of the other life style changes I've made are helping me.
3214,"I was on risperidone and vyvannse going into my junior year when I started fearing a nuclear war and had near panic attacks every time I heard an airplane (I may have went off my meds before that, but I can't remember)."
3215,"I'm not on any medication or drugs at the moment, but smoked weed pretty much every day from mid-senior year to a couple of months ago."
3216,Any comments or info on my new meds would be good.
3217,"I am not on any medication right now, but I used to."
3218,I booked a doctors appointment because I know I need meds.

3220,"They offered beta-blockers and some anti-anxiety meds, I said no."
3221,The medicine does help a bit.
3222,What are your experiences for each medication.
3223,"The meds helped me quite a bit during the summer, but now...they just aren't enough."
3224,I get up too early because I just can't sleep or can't find an allergy medicine to drug me.
3225,I am getting help for what is going on and I have meds that I can take when I break down like this.
3226,"All I know is I finally stopped shaking, I am at work, my meds finally kicked in and now I am no longer so tensed up I can't move."
3227,"General facts about me: I am a female, 24 years old, I don't know what type of anxiety I have, my trigger is eating and thinking of vomiting, I am not on medication, and I do have amazing insurance and an extremely supportive family and husband."
3228,I am very hesitant to go to a doctor because I really don't want to get on medication for the rest of my life.
3229,She was put on major meds and returned to work (we were also co-workers) a completely different person.
3230,Yes I've talked to my doctor and was put on a different medication (can't remember) but it didn't work out well.

But I feel like a failure."
3234,"She's been on medication for them for years and doesn't have them very often, but I'm always worried that she's going to have one that will be her last."
3235,"EDIT: Sorry, I didn't know how to tag this post as medication related."
3236,I'm taking medicine for anxiety and depression but I guess this is an aspect of my personality (like high sensitivity).
3237,Not on any medication at the moment but I'm looking into it...
3238,"Now the only medication I started using for it was cannabis, that was around 16.. Wasn't until late 16/early 17 that I really started smoking regularly (on and off)."
3239,Now I am... And I am going to ask for a new prescription for medication tomorrow.
3240,Are there any other medications I should ask my psychiatrist about?
3241,"I'm already considered a person with anxiety (thus meds), but I made the mistake and read news and worldnews while on vacation last week and it ruined a part of it until you good folk brought me to my senses!"
3242,"I've tried the anxiety exercises, cognitive behavioural therapy, but only anxiety medicine (clonazepam) calms me enough to function."
3243,It's really frustrating to have to depend on a medication just to feel sane.
3244,Any meds/tips that have helped you guys?
3245,"i've been off and on antidepressants for years now, but i've never once been prescribed with anti-anxiety medications."
3246,"Three years ago, I made the decision to get off my meds and life is so much better."
3247,"I have a history of anxiety issues that I used to take medication for, but I've been doing better with it lately, and i'm not sure if this is my anxiety kicking in again or what, but does anyone have any advice for me?"

3252,"I've been on so many different types of medicines (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.)"
3253,"Does anyone have any suggestions for a ""better"" anxiety medicine?"
3254,"I was thinking of going to a doctor for  medication but I heard that anxiety/depression medication is highly addictive, and basically once you go that route there's no getting off it."
3255,"For those of you taking anxiety medication, do you feel 'owned' by it, and what does it feel like?"
3256,I'm also too scared to start taking any medication or see someone about it.
3257,I've been off the medication for about 5years now.
3258,I want to find some way to mange this on my own without medication.
3259,Around 5 or 6 months ago my therapist sent me to a psychiatrist who ended up putting me on the medication train.
3260,"On one hand the medication is making everyday life easier and has brought down my anxiety levels a significant amount, on the other hand I don't feel like the person I was and emotionally numb."
3261,"I've been on medications that don't ever seem to help, Ive been told that exercise would help so I lost 40 pounds and still no progress... Im now learning to play the guitar because i was told that a new constructive hobby might help."
3262,"Hi I've got a question about medication for anxiety..
."
3263,"But I really struggle with social events, like going to parties, bars, concerts and I wouldn't dream of going anywhere like a club with everyone I know.. Was wondering if people have tried medication to help with dealing with social interaction and going to places with a lot of people and how these medicines helped or didn't help."
3264,"Anyways, I've been rather reluctant to get on medication as the side effects are rather disconcerting."
3265,I made a therapy appointment after I was prescribed anxiety medication a few weeks ago.

3270,"I don't know if it matters, but my anxiety is of the social variety and I don't take any medications presently."
3271,"Getting a hold of medications is impossible for me for a while, and I have found that repeating relaxing thoughts during panic attacks only work for so long."
3272,I've seen too many friends of mine zombified by overmedication.
3273,I made the mistake of reading the horror stories and feel like a more balanced perspective might encourage me to start taking my medication like a good boy.
3274,My last option I can think of is medication.
3275,I will also be put back on all medication I was previously on and most likely referred for therapy.
3276,I've yet to become medicated for my social anxiety for various reasons and I'm wondering how the medication makes you feel in social situations.
3277,"I want to be able to talk to people and feel normal...

 Also if anyone has any recommendations for medications that aren't prescriptions such as passion flower or any others please let me know you experiences with them."
3278,I know this story is long... but to anyone who took the time to hear me out... thanks... and if you can answer the question... will medicine really help?
3279,I'm really depressed thinking that the meds won't do anything and I'll be stuck like this forever.
3280,I saw my psychiatrist the other day and he is changing my meds... im currently on equetro (among other things)  but he told me he wants me off of it and switch to lamictal.
3281,I have been on so many meds im just desperate for something to work!!
3282,"Hi everyone, 

After trying everything that is not medication for my anxiety, I have turned to medication out of desperation."

3285,Taking some homeopathic anxiety medicine.
3286,NOTE:  im not talking about therapy or medicines.
3287,"Usually I've been in meaningless relationships or on my own and able to take the time to recover- just for myself, and slowly I always would, with a mix of medication, exercise and exposure."
3288,"In April of 2011, a half ass doctor prescribed him Chantix to quit smoking, not ever seeing my husband before and knowing nothing of his depression and medications."

3290,Is there anything that has actually helped you calm down other than meds?
3291,Anyone have any advice or felt like this on meds?
3292,Only in the past two years have I tried to seek help and was prescribed medication for anxiety and panic attacks.

3297,"I've been researching medications prescribed for anxiety, and I was considering discussing BuSpar with my psychiatrist."
3298,Was wondering if anyone's had any experience with this medication?
3299,Today I filled my prescription and finally took medication.
3300,Everyone keeps telling me to get meds for it but I really don't want to because of the side effects and the possible withdrawal process.
3301,I'm on medication for a few days and already feeling much better.
3302,He quit taking all meds about a month ago.
3303,He is open to taking meds again.
3304,"I'm on medication and will be going to therapy again soon, but haven't gone in almost ten years."
3305,"About a year ago I was prescribed to talk Citalopram to help with it, however reading about it online really scared me away from it..but now it's just gotten really affecting in my life and I feel like I need meds of some kind..
   My main anxiety problems come from social situations..pretty much if anybody that's not my 2 best friends talk to me I feel really terrified and inferior to the person that's talking to me, this makes it really hard to do any group work in school or get much social activity, as I'm usually solitary."
3306,"I suffer from alot of energy issues, as I can go from feeling like I had a sugar high to like I just ran a marathon and need to sleep within an hour..my fear is that anxiety meds will heighten this more.."
3307,I'm sorry if this is really dumb..but I need some recommendations as to which anxiety meds I should request?
3308,I'm starting to get over worried that I could now fail a drug test (and lose a job offer) for a legally prescribed medication.
3309,I'm not on meds (yet) because my insurance is all messed up and I haven't had much luck in the past with meds.
3310,I was vomitting so much I couldn't keep down meds - was hysterical.
3311,"Obviously every medication affects people differently, so I guess my title is more of a rhetorical question."
3312,I'm frustrated at the prospect of now trying a *6th* medication :/.
3313,I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced a lack of effectiveness after a few months on meds?
3314,"I'm going to talk to my doctor about either increasing my dosage, or possibly about whether the medication has done all it can and it's time for CBT, but I like to have a little bit of an idea what I'm talking about before I go in for the appointment."
3315,I've been on an anti-anxiety medication that normally works well but today I'm about to burst.
3316,I used to get very shaky and physically dishevled but my meds are keeping me together physically but I feel like I'm melting on the inside.
3317,"I saw the signs that I was headed for a bad place, but I've been trying to mask the symptoms with medication and declining therapy."
3318,"However, if I eat a big meal and don't take stomach meds....."
3319,"Anyway, I went on a short vacation last week and in my rush to pack I forgot my medication."
3320,"I got home on Tuesday and took my medication as soon as possible but it didn't seem to be working at all (I know for most people the drug takes a week or two to work, but for me it has **always worked within 2-3 hours**)."
3321,I have been on many different meds and have seen a therapist.
3322,I recognize that that's self-medication of sorts and I don't want to have to get drunk just to try to make friends.
3323,his recommendation was to try an anxiety medication and see how things go for the next couple of weeks.
3324,I've had pretty severe anxiety/depression since high school but my parents have been completely against medication.
3325,Any suggestions or medications that have worked for you?
3326,"Almost overnight it became overwhelming, I've bought some over the counter medication (which gives me relief for a few hours) but I still find myself crying everyday and it's nearly impossible to eat."
3327,"Just looking for hope I guess, does anyone ever overcome it without medication?"
3328,"My background: recently started seeing a counselor (doesn't specialize in anxiety issues), no meds yet, diagnosed anxiety since I was very young, mostly homebound (leave for PT job, but don't go elsewhere unless it's with my SO), trying to realize feeling this way is OK for now and that I won't always feel like this... it took me an hour to write/send this..."
3329,Has anyone else experienced this when they've switched meds?
3330,"I have ADHD and usually have more anxiety issues when I'm on meds, which can also cause jaw clenching so it could be more related to that I guess, I'm not on them right now but want to know for future."
3331,"So in short, what made her vomit blood and bleed internally was an ulcer in her stomach (now almost treated, it's fine) that was provoked by a strong medication that an inexperienced doctor gave her."
3332,I'm going to try medication.
3333,"By the time she got there, I was starting to feel my meds take effect and I probably looked a little loopy."
3334,"That is, unless my body feels a drunkish-lethargy, I will convince myself that the medication is merely a placebo."
3335,"However, just as someone with anxiety problems might be advised to take suitable medicine, I dont quite understand why I should not be advised to continue with my own medication since it has been only positive so far."
3336,Has anyone been on a medication and stopped with positive results?
3337,My anxiety medication helped for a while but the anxiety is creeping back in.
3338,Anxiety medication isn't helping as much as it used to.
3339,I'm wondering what people that have taken the medicine have had better luck with twice a day of a larger dosage or a smaller dosage three times a day?
3340,On and off meds and having panic attacks hourly.
3341,"I started feeling like there had to be something I could do to help myself with my anxiety, so I asked my therapist if I could try some kind of medication (at 13 years old)."
3342,"I was okay for a while, then I went off my meds after a year thinking I ""won"" anxiety, and I didn't, because at 16 I had to go back on both meds."
3343,I switched doctors and went back on my meds and stayed on them until I started college.
3344,So I went off my meds after two years and then wound up in the hospital because I passed out at my college.
3345,"I've tried meds, therapy, acupuncture, yoga, meditation, supplements, etc."
3346,"I have a good team of doctors who are willing and able to help me, I just feel really anxious all the time and I know it's going to take a few weeks for the doctors to sort out what meds I can be on with the Pain Management guy doing some nerve blocks and opiod prescriptions (as far as SSRI/SSNI's go but jesus I am feeling constantly nervous."
3347,"I know meds aren't the answer to everything, but I'm just really anxious all the time and it's semi crippling."
3348,"I didn't like the way medication made me feel, and I've been generally alright off of it."
3349,She just thought it was the Claritin medicine that I was taking and would not take me to the doctor.
3350,I stopped taking that medicine and after a few months I believed that I had conquered it.
3351,A few weeks ago i had a really bad panic attack at Football practice where I couldn't breathe and once again my mom blamed it on medication.
3352,I was taking medicine for the infection I had in my knee.
3353,Also do you have any examples of otc medicines or supplements that I could personally buy without my parents.
3354,She gave me a prescription for a low dosage of meds and told me to wait a month for them to kick in.
3355,AND that if I reacted positively to the medication then I could start seeing about a counselor.
3356,Here's hoping this medication works out so I can take the next step.
3357,"I'm in no way telling you to drop your prescriptions, and I'm sure results vary, but I am wondering if anyone else has had success with natural medicine?"
3358,"I've been avoiding medication, like SSRI's?"
3359,Is there anyone that takes anti anxiety medication that works?
3360,"I do have astma, and I am rather lazy on the medication thingy (never had issues unless I want to run or do other demanding activities for extended periods)."
3361,"I'm finding that negative thinking is still tripping me up when demands are exceptionally high, or my resources (sleep, food, medication) are low."
3362,"I do not take medication after my bad experience with Adderal, so that is not an option right now."
3363,My current medications have really helped me.
3364,I finally have my own insurance and was able to get some medication but the side effects are killing me.
3365,Should I keep trying with these medications or is there something better I can try like some success stories...I know I'm not alone but just the last few days have been really rough
3366,"I was wondering if anyone knows if I describe my symptoms to the doctor, if they would offer me medication for my anxiety, or will they just try more therapy?"
3367,"* Related to my bulimia, if I get very anxious I can't eat, and if I do, I'll binge and purge straight after :(

Thank you for any feedback, this worries me so much and I'm scared for myself after suffering for years..
What should I say to get medication?"
3368,"I don't like taking medication because I'm a firm believer that it actually doesn't help, it just helps me sleep sometimes."
3369,"To be clear, I am trying actively to keep it under control via meds, CBT and determination, and he knows this."
3370,"I'm already taking anxiety/depression medication, which I'm thinking about switching because it clearly doesn't work."
3371,"This doctor said I absolutely do need medication, but that he would not prescribe anything until/unless I had a doctor on the Western side."
3372,"Anyway, I never got out of the house to find another doctor when I went back West, and even though I need the medication, I still do not have it."
3373,"Diagnosed with a panic attack, got medication and a follow-up with a dr. Dr. Said I had esophageal spasms and was causing a health based anxiety."
3374,"Month later, symptons lessened (was having pressure on chest/ sternum, occasional warm feeling there as well) and told to stay on the medication, but down to once a day/ as needed."
3375,"I just upped my dose of meds, despite a long standing refusal to take the chemical way out."
3376,"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2yl0vn/going_to_be_out_of_meds_soon_sense_of_impending/) yesterday, about me possibly having to be off medication for a while."
3377,"Selfishly, I really don't want to really on pills to save me, I have been relying on Larazopam when things get really bad but I won't to try and face this without and medicinal help, how do you cope and do any of you try without medication?"
3378,"Sad lamp, Vitamin D, medications not working."
3379,"Therapy, medication, or both?"
3380,"If medication, anything I should steer clear of?"
3381,"I just took my first two doses of my medicine...

My Mother in law is with me, she is going to remind me every day to take my medicine and since this is my first time taking this medicine, she is being so sweet and sitting with me..."
3382,"Before people mention it, I have seen a psychologist, but since he vehemently told me to get on anti-depressants after my third session (2 of which with other doctors) I was put off; I went to a psychologist to avoid the psychiatrists, due to the concern they would prescribe me medication without addressing the actual issues in my life."
3383,The medication has also given me bowel problems and sleep problems.
3384,"I have been more outgoing, social, talkative, and even flirtatious since going on the medications."
3385,I still have a long way to go but I'm hopeful the combination of CBT and medications will help me get through it.
3386,"I'm so glad I finally found this sub 

I've had anxiety since I was really young, nobody knew what it was at the time though 

so my greatest phobia is of choking (and I'm sorry if this has been mentioned to death, please let me know if I should remove this) 

I'm on meds for OVD/anxiety/depression and have been in therapy since January (finally), but this big fear will just not go away :/ 

I know I'm not the only one...any tiles/comfort/advice/etc?"
3387,"So I made a post about how I wanted to deal with my anxiety without medication about a year ago, and I would love to keep doing that."
3388,I am 27F if medications affect age and gender differently.
3389,I have handled certain situations very well that would have normally thrown me into an episode; but it's only been 3 weeks since my diagnosis/since I started medication.
3390,"**

Is my anxiety bad enough on its own to get on medication?"
3391,"I just switched to a new medicine because the old one affected my sex drive too much  and I do enjoy the new meds, but I've never experienced this sort of anxiety as much as I do on these meds."
3392,"Again, these meds are new so I'm curious as to whether I should get a higher dosage or take up my doctors for quick relief meds (Xanex)."
3393,"http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2g9nrv/2_months_on_meds_for_depression_and_anxiety/.compact
That is my original post."
3394,I'd rather not turn to medication but I feel like I'm going to have to if something doesn't give.
3395,The anti-psychotic medication has helped in some ways to conquer my problem.
3396,So basically all the medication has done is taken away the stress because I don't have wet dreams anymore and have absolutely no need for sex.
3397,I went off of meds in 7th grade and had my mental health under control until about a year and a half ago.
3398,So my doctor who is not aptly suited for medicine (angry rant about that another time) is looking to ween me off of klonopin which I have needed and faithfully taken for close to 6 years now.
3399,"I am currently not taking an anti-depression medicine with it, but only because everything I've tried has left me super sick."
3400,"I have noticed that since it take it (yesterday) i have severe lightheadiness (also anxiety to faint or die), restlessness and worries that something really bad is going to happen (allergic reaction or so..)

I also take other meds like lamotrigin 200mg, blood pressure drug and seroquel xr 150mg."
3401,"You are dealing with highly addictive meds here, some even say more addictive than heroine."
3402,I just want to be stable but I'm reluctant to take meds and until I piss clean I can't smoke.
3403,fortunately i'm much better now after meds and gradually stopped having thoughts as much.
3404,* I am wondering why he prescribed me an antipsychotic compared to an anti-anxiety medication... or are these the same things?
3405,Are all anti-anxiety meds antipsychotics?
3406,"* If I decide against this medication, am I supposed to wait until my next visit and say, ""No I didn't take it, I found out it can cause TD."
3407,"Do you have anything else that is an anti-anxiety medication that *doesn't* cause TD?"""
3408,"* I'm scared because I want to try this medication because I think it could help, on the other hand, but I'm so afraid of TD."
3409,"She's bipolar and on a lot of medication, when she remembers to take it."
3410,"I'm 14 years old and the lack of sleep is really getting to me, anyway I was wondering if anyone had something simmaler and maybe knows a better way to describe it so I might be able to get help or medication or something."
3411,Thanks for any input about this medication.
3412,"I don't take meds for my anxiety because I thought I didn't need them, but now I'm rethinking that."
3413,She can't find her meds.
3414,She says that to get new meds she has to file a police report and they're going to want my contact info.
3415,"I've gone to the doctor and have been prescribed .5mg xanax about 3 months ago but have yet to ever take it, as I am reluctant to meds."
3416,"To me though, taking benzo-class medications slow me down cognitively (obviously), but I'm always afraid that I won't be able to do my job, or say/do something that is outright silly because I'm not thinking straight."
3417,Or could this dose/combination of medication possibly be my long sought after miracle combination/dosage?
3418,"She put me in a weekly therapy group, and told me that if my smyptoms are still there after 8 weeks to make another appointment with her, where she might reccomend that I take medication."
3419,"I'm afraid because while I feel meds would probably help me, I'm afraid to go on them."
3420,Has anyone had good (or bad) results with these meds?
3421,I'm not really interested in a therapist or in meds.
3422,"really, we never saw medication as an option."
3423,"ive heard a few bad things about anxiety meds, how they can.. change you?"
3424,Given that these didn't happen before I'm pretty sure this is the meds leaving my system but just wondered if you guys had been through anything similar?
3425,My doctor also keeps messing around with meds it's like they can't find the right thing to keep me stable in the meantime.
3426,He gave me a list of medications and told me to choose.
3427,"I'm hesitant to get into taking medicine because I don't want to become dependent, but need help getting over this."
3428,I've only taken the meds for the past day and a half but it doesn't seem to help too much so far.
3429,But because of my bad experience with doctors and their medicine I'm very sceptical.
3430,"Short of seeing a doctor about meds (which is on the table), does anyone have any good ""tricks"" or methods for breaking out of panic?"
3431,"Finally with the help of a counselor and some meds, I put a name to the fear that had followed me all my life and found some solutions."
3432,"Even if I take medication, it doesn't really help."
3433,"So after dealing with anxiety for about 5 years now, in different forms and from different causes, I was finally prescribed medication today by my GP (Paroxetine.)"
3434,"I've seen several doctors over the years, tried several meds (which didn't help), had tons of tests done, and they still don't know what's wrong."
3435,"I usually try to take some medication before getting too nauseous, but it doesn't seem to help too much."
3436,"For the past year I have had medication, but I didn't take it for whatever reason."
3437,That's one reason why'd I'd like to try meds but also because I read a few stories about how people tried meds for the first time and realised just how much anxiety was affecting them without them even knowing it.
3438,If meds would help at all it could change my life in a very positive way.
3439,"But like I wrote earlier my doctor said last time that he doesn't want to give me meds, so what should I do?"
3440,"I recently got a job at a vet clinic that involves me staying there overnight if/when pets stay overnight so I can give meds, take them for walks, etc."
3441,Curious for some information on meds from those who have experience with them.
3442,"Im afraid of anti anxiety meds keeping me from enjoying alcohol, or other things I must avoid/deal with because of the meds."
3443,"I dont know much about the various meds, I just know after a full year of heavy anxiety I need more help."
3444,Hoping for insight on anti anxiety meds.
3445,"I was on anti anxiety and depression meds, but took myself off of the depression meds a bit back because they left me feeling nothing at all, and am off the anxiety meds and run instead."
3446,"My friend made is sound almost to good to be true:)

Note: I didn't stop taking Prozac to start taking this medicine, I stopped because I could no longer take the side effects, and spoke to my doctor before doing so."
3447,"I've tried multiple meds (anti-depressants made me suicidal), therapy, and herbal supplements (L-Theanine, Lemon Balm, etc)."
3448,I currently am not on meds and am trying to avoid that route again - What are some non-medication remedies you've found helpful?
3449,No medications- I've had nothing but miserable experiences with almost every anti-anxiety med I've tried.
3450,"I want to experience all the emotional highs and lows of a relationship with the woman I love, but would it be unfair to ask her to try and get off the meds given her anxiety?"
3451,"Tl;Dr My girlfriend is an emotional zombie, and I think her anxiety meds are to blame."
3452,Is it out of bounds to ask her to consider getting off the meds given her anxiety problems.
3453,It has stared to make me feel empty now and Im liking the idea of stopping the medication.
3454,"I don't take any medication, so that makes it hard to overcome all of this."
3455,"This time it's different though, I'm kicking the meds in hopes of conceiving a child with my husband."
3456,"Even though the medication helped me get through my panic attacks a little, it was not enough for me to keep up with the material to graduate on time despite being only 3 classes short."
3457,I've been dealing with my anxiety my whole life and for the last four years I've managed it pretty well without medication.
3458,"I'm a 19 year old Male, I'm not taking any medication right now, and I've never been officially diagnosed."
3459,"I have had tests to rule out anything serious and everything has come back fine but I don't feel fine :(

I am not on any medication yet but am going to ask my GP for something as I feel I can't cope any more."
3460,Does anxiety get better with medication and do the IBS like symptoms gt better?
3461,"I've done therapy and medication, and I'm very capable of dating and setting something good up...but I can't afford do spiral down again if that happens."
3462,Was wondering what meds people have found most useful when dealing with anxiety?
3463,I was on medication off-and-on throughout undergrad (I've basically tried every SSRI &amp; also have depression) but it never really helped that much.
3464,"he's currently on two medications (clonapin and celexa), and i trust the doctor (met him yesterday) and recognize it's a long road for recovery."
3465,I'm scared to try meds because I don't want to feel dependent on something to get me through the day...but right now I'm at a loss.
3466,I've noticed since I began taking medication for my anxiety and depression that I am much less inclined to express myself in the creative ways I did before (i.e.
3467,I don't take any medication for it because my parents constantly give me shit about how much my current medicine (epilepsy) costs.
3468,Thinking of asking for more medication causes fear/stress.
3469,I was wondering about everyone else's experience with this drug/medicine?
3470,I do believe that medication has helped me over the last 15 years but it doesn't prevent those every once in a while bad days or bad few hours of anxiety.
3471,I've been on medicine for a month now.
3472,He put me on some medication.
3473,I got put onto new medication to help cope.
3474,It is a stronger medication and it had to shorten my work schedule a little bit.
3475,My doctor gave me a note saying to shorten my shifts because it was messing with my original medication.
3476,half the reason i feel like i'll never get medication is because ive already told her about all my coping mechanisms and how they work.
3477,if she doesn't bring it up when i see her on friday im going to ask her about medication.
3478,"i want to try medication, but im not sure if it's what i need."
3479,im having a crazy moral battle within myself because i don't want to jump on medication to solve all my problems and rely on that but i feel relying on other people has failed me and relying on myself causes a whole other bunch of problems.
3480,"I've been on a variety of medications, a bunch of different doctors and therapists."
3481,"I've been off my medications, successfully, for almost a year now."
3482,I had always wanted to try medication since I feel strongly that my reactions to public speaking are an autonomic nervous system response that I can't control.
3483,"However, the clinic associated with my university was a behavioral therapy and not a medication type place."
3484,I have an addictive personality and easily lose track of what I'm doing with psych/ anxiety meds- so I avoid them and can only receive relief via therapy.
3485,I've also experienced a dangerous adverse reaction to psyche meds leaving me recovering from a series of seizures as a result.
3486,So psyche meds are really just an absolute no for me at this point.
3487,"Also I've been looking into getting some meds, like Xanax."
3488,"Which meds, at low doses,  have worked for you guys with the least amount of side affects?"
3489,"I'm desperate for help, but therapy is pointless for me, and I'm not sure if any doctor can give me medication, since I'm a minor and it may make the situation worse."
3490,"Riding in the car with other people, traveling too far away from home, driving on the highway, drinking, taking any type of medicine."
3491,I have considered going to a psychiatrist to see about getting medication but the thought of that scares me too.
3492,"My Dad's extremely against medications, and everything."
3493,I'm a lot calmer now that I've taken my meds but the headache is messing with me and so are the symptoms I had earlier.
3494,I don't wanna try meds wanna try different types of therapy to see why I can't get over this condition.
3495,"I almost never need medication during the day, but I've come to rely on it at night, not much just .5 to 1mg of clonazepam a night, if I don't take it, even if I had a good day and worked my body to the point of exhaustion, my mind will start racing with anxious thoughts, then full blown anxiety, then panic attacks if I dint take something."
3496,I only have one 30 day prescription left and am aware doctors won't prescribe this kind of medication unless they are regularly seeing the patient because of the abuse potential.
3497,I don't feel comfortable or confident in getting off the medication at this point in time personally.
3498,"All I know is that I HAVE seen doctors, but I've never been on medication or received much professional help outside of my first few trips to see what was wrong with me."
3499,I stumbled out and yelled for my fiancé to get my meds.
3500,"He tells me to just take medication, but there are a lot of reasons I don't want to do that."
3501,Life has been so good since i started the meds and therapy.
3502,And now that I have a semblance of normality (without medication!
3503,I'm currently on day #4 of the medication.
3504,"If the medication is causing insomnia, is it safe to assume that I could take it in the morning rather than at night?"
3505,"And as a related question, I know I'm not far enough in for the medication to really make an impact yet, but does anyone have any similar experience where it seems like anxiety in the morning is worse than usual?"
3506,I have another meeting with the psychiatrist a few days before I'm going away and I'm wondering if it would be bad to ask him about putting me on short term medication for my month away.
3507,"Years of therapy, medication, introspection, and research have made me pretty familiar with anxiety issues in general and how I deal with them in particular."
3508,"And FYI, my current coping strategies include exercise, meditation, therapy, journaling, medication, and talking to friends/loved ones."
3509,"And on a different thought, my fiancée wants me to go back to the doctor to get anti-anxiety medication."
3510,"While I feel like I would benefit greatly from the meds, I am fighting with myself because another portion of my brain doesn't want to admit that I need the meds."
3511,"I was on meds from the VA for a while, but got off them because I thought I had gotten over it."
3512,Part of me really wants to get help but I don't want to take anxiety medication.
3513,"I am freaking out, yesterday I felt like I had a panic attack through the entire day and most of the night (it keeps me up at night) even through my medication which is a relatively high dose according to my psychiatrist."
3514,"How am I supposed to live with the fact that if my family could afford the $3k for more tests, longer hospital stays, and expensive medicine, she could possibly still be here."
3515,"I didn't even work the register my last shift, and I remember next to nothing about how to work it from two years ago, and I don't even kknow what I'm supposed to wear or what if I can't even get in because of the crowds, plus I forgot to take my medicine yestrday  so what if I have a panic attack while II'm there and I can'tt take a break...?"
3516,"I'm not sure what's causing it either, either the med change or the lack of specific anxiety medication."
3517,I can't afford medication or therapy.
3518,"I'm also on a long-acting beta blocker (Inderal - also used for performance anxiety) and another medication for blood pressure, which I also take at night."
3519,"I'm on anti anxiety meds, pretty much entirely because of all the horrible shit my brother has done in the past year, but they're starting to be less and less effective."
3520,i do not have any medication
3521,"I managed on my own for the most part, until I struggled with post-partum psychosis which put me on meds for the first time in my life."
3522,"I needed no medication, no therapy, and managed my symptoms amazingly."
3523,"It began in February, and by April I realized my symptoms were getting bad enough, I needed help, I needed to go on medication again."
3524,"EKG was normal, received some meds and luckily my wonderful GF was there to take me home."
3525,"I have meds for if I have an attack, and I will be seeing someone to talk to about this."
3526,Every once in a while I doubt that medication will work on me and hope everyday it won't make me worse in any way.
3527,"Now add to my overall anxiety two fears, 1) the fear of being without the meds, and 2) the fear of being dependent on them to get to sleep."
3528,"I've tried ADD meds like Adderall, but it gave me intense anxiety after a few days of use."
3529,"Realized I haven't included all of the general info, so here's the infodump: 22f, very specific anxiety that likes to get more general if it goes unaddressed (if I notice I'm actively fretting about climate change, something else is wrong that I'm not attending to), not very triggery (well, so far as I know), not on any meds yet, currently in Washington State, on Medicaid (better than nothing--I'm glad to have it)."
3530,seeking non-medication remedies and ways to *fix the underlying problem.
3531,"It is not nearly as good as a pam  anti anxiety medication, but it does the job for now."
3532,I recently started having panic attacks again after a while of thinking i was going to be ok. My parents are scheduling a doctor's appointment with intentions of getting me anti anxiety medication.
3533,The meds help to a certain extent.
3534,I'm currently on medication and going to therapy to get better.
3535,"My doctor prescribed it to go along with my current medicine, Lamictal."
3536,Not bad at all and I am practically stabilized on my meds.
3537,"To the point where she can feel like her body is ""on something"" - for that reason, she spoke to her doctor, who merely prescribed her anti-anxiety medication, which as you know, kind of just helps you ""get through"" a rough patch rather than working towards some kind of solution."
3538,He didn't suggest anything else but these meds.
3539,Is this a normal way for a doctor to react to with only medication for an anxiety disorder?
3540,"I'm not looking for life-changing shit like therapy or medicine -- that honestly sounds like too much for me right now, as stupid as that probably sounds -- I just want to get some ideas on things to make the day-to-day grind a little happier, more interesting, etc."
3541,During this time I started taking medication to help with my stress and anxiety.
3542,I think it was one of the medications I tried that caused my extreme mental breakdown to be as bad as it was.
3543,"I have been having bad anxiety lately and I really don't like the way medicine makes me feel, I'd much rather use kava or a natural alternative."
3544,"Now, I didn't ask for this medication, in fact I told my doctor that people I knew (that'd be y'all!)"
3545,had had adverse effects from this medication.
3546,Only losing one hour to medication every two days?
3547,"Most recently, now, I've gotten anxious about being on medication (lol.)"
3548,I was instructed to start taking my meds again.
3549,"Right now, I'm sitting in work, trying to debate on whether or not to take my medicine or to just fight this and keep telling myself."
3550,Nor do I want to go on more meds.
3551,"Did you continue taking the medicine that worked for you or did you find benefits in supplementing other anxiety controlling methods (exercise, meditation, diet, ect)?"
3552,The psychiatrist prescribed me Misar SR but I'm against any medications so I haven't taken any yet.
3553,"Bit of background, before I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on medication, my coping mechanism for when I was feeling separation from myself or overwhelmed was self harm... it went on for about seven years."
3554,"However, despite meds and meditation there are still instances when I start feeling as though I'm verging on a panic attack."
3555,I will then see him again on Monday to discuss stopping the medication altogether and the symptoms I experienced.
3556,"Then started a treatment with my shrink..
  First he prescripted me per day- 1mg Clona, 20mg Paroxetina ( Tiarix here, Paxil ) and 600mg Gabapentin at night for sleeping, because I also have insomnio; this was for 10 months.. then he changed me my meds, because it worked, but as I was a benzo addict, I took what I wanted always and I finished worse than when I started ( but not during the middle step in the treatment); remember being prescripted then when I told him was a drugaddict- Pregabaline 450mg 3 doses per day to discontinue clonazepam because its abstinence and still with Paxil 20 (Paroxetine)... 3 months later told him wanted to stop it because the suicide toughts it had gave me."
3557,And then he totally change meds again !!
3558,"Considering I still was taking Clonazepam and Xanax (Alplax here) , Lorazepan too (Trapax here), Bromazepam (Lexotanil here) and Valium maybe or Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) and Dormicum (midazolam), ass you see I'm a benzo addict and drug design.. so that happened to me, and it was happening until he prescripted me again a different medication- Olanzapine 5 (Midax) one at night and Pregabaline 150 2 doses (Lyrica, Neuristan) again :/... then I left and keep self-medicating until I almost die having an overdose because taking all that kind of pills I said, the prescripted ones and the other benzo I like."
3559,"While in school, I went to a psychiatrist a couple times and got meds."
3560,I hated them (the meds) and they didn't work for me.
3561,"**1)** Should I see a psychiatrist, even though I don't want to try meds again?"
3562,The chlopromazine caused nasal congestion and the decongestant clashed with one of the other meds and caused the week long panic attacks which brought back the phobia.
3563,I am on medication.
3564,I've been on medicine for my anxiety for a year and a half now.
3565,"After I withdrew from the last, 2 years ago, Paroxetine, my episodic depression (which is triggered by anxiety, eg can come when change in circs or am really excited about new things) has got more constant, and I'm worried medications are the cause, and that this will happen with Parnate."
3566,"Reading reviews, it seems to be a useful medication, but people seem to be on it for life, and for severe depression more than anxiety."
3567,"Has anyone withdrawn from it, and remained off medication."
3568,"My RX ran out and my car broke down in tandem, so Ive been out of my meds for 3 days now."
3569,Now I'm 19 days off the medicine but I've had a pressure headache for about two weeks and today I feel like I have the flu.
3570,I don't want my anxiety to stop me but short of taking lots of Atvian and possibly getting more anxiety meds I forsee my upcoming flights as horrible experiences in waiting.
3571,I have been diagnosed with ADHD and low level anxiety that may be amplified by my meds since they are stimulants.
3572,"eventually I told my SO (because I was concerned I might say mean things to him, or even hit him) and he reassured me that I hadn't said anything upsetting yet and he was ok with being patient until the meds settled down."
3573,"I recently posted here about what I thought was me having a weird reaction to a new medication (clonazepam), but my therapist helped me find the real catalyst, so that's no longer really an issue."
3574,"In a sense, I felt that I didn't *deserve* diagnosis, treatment, or medication for something that was essentially meaningless compared to people with ""real"" disorders."
3575,It will even give you anxiety about taking your anxiety meds.
3576,Is there any medicine for getting rid of blushing?
3577,I just bought my first bottle as a last ditch effort to quell my out of control anxiety before seeking medication.
3578,"I'm 17 years old and dropped out of school, I really feel like my life is going nowhere, every time I try to do something about my anxiety and depression I'm unable to, I don't take medicine and never have, and would prefer not too unless there is no other way."
3579,"The only things I haven't tried is therapy and medicine, I don't know what too say other than I need help, advice, and support............
(I pretty much stay in bed all day and pace a lot, I also have trouble sleeping [getting to sleep and oversleeping] and also feel that it is effecting my eating too)"
3580,"Hey, so I've dealt with a general anxiety disorder since I was 14 and am not on medication for it by choice."
3581,"I do have high blood pressure, and i feel like (but im not positive) that this bad anxiety all started when i switched to a new medication."
3582,"My mom ha encouraged me to seek help/medication if I need it, but even that would cost money I don't have."
3583,Are you on medication for it?
3584,"He said to me today ""I don't think medication is ever the answer with anxiety, the answer is in yourself""."
3585,My love ones sat me down and told me it was time to go back on medication.
3586,I hope the medicine doesn't change me.
3587,I hate medication.
3588,"Since then, I was in therapy until I was 15, and I've been on medication ever since."
3589,I wish I never switched my meds.
3590,"I get paranoid when I'm on this medication too, like I feel like people are hanging around outside my apartment and I'm just very wary of people."
3591,When I don't take this medication I feel pretty fine and I have basically no paranoia.
3592,"Problem is, I had a panic attack earlier tonight while coming home from a resturaunt (literally no idea what caused it) and at this point at 11:00 at night when I have to work at 10am, I can't take the medicine that she prescribed me without waking up in a sweat in 6 hours and not being able to calm back down to go to sleep."
3593,"Tl;dr:  Got stressed about missing seizure meds, few weeks later had chest and arm pain that ended me in the ER three times, and last night I could stop crying."
3594,"For reasons I won't get into here, I found myself without my seizure medication for 24 hours."
3595,"However, after I started taking my medication, the weird ""waves"" that washed over me didn't stop immediately as they usually do if I've forgotten to take my medication."
3596,"Did not like it, but assumed it would go away as my body readjusted itself after getting my seizure meds back into my system."
3597,"It almost feels like something ""broke"" in me on the day I missed my meds and it opened a floodgate to things I'm not prepared to handle."
3598,"I also have social anxiety that was persistent for years, never really letting up, until around the time I hit university, and then it only began to surface in extreme situations, or when I'd missed my meds."
3599,I'm not a person that strongly disagrees with medication for things FYI.
3600,I'm considering bringing some sort of medication to keep me calm if necessary (I've never taken meds for anxiety) for the plane ride.
3601,"As of right now, I'm trying to focus on my excitement, but any insight you guys could offer on keeping calm during plane rides (including any meds you take) and being in a foreign country would be much appreciated."
3602,I have a pretty bad clinical anxiety problem because of my perceptive disorder and over active nervous system so I've been contemplating getting medication.
3603,The medicine started with an S. Soloman or something like that?...
3604,Any other medicines you guys recommend?
3605,"I have been taking medication for years, and I have just recently gotten off it."
3606,"I'd thought it was 100% due to taking cold medicine, since that can raise blood pressure, but the anxiety persists when I nix those."
3607,I explain this and all she says is take medication...blah blah.
3608,I was on medication for 10 years and I have had side effects that I just don't like.
3609,I am currently off almost all my meds and doing pretty darn well.
3610,"It was my perfect medication: it allowed me to truly apply myself, to do well at things, to think clearly."
3611,"Either way, I stopped seeing the doctor and the therapist, and I stopped getting medicine."
3612,"I eventually managed to get a job, but without any kind of anxiety medication and my current depressive state, I became extremely suicidal after only a month of working."
3613,I think medicine should be a last resort.
3614,"I don't want to take medications, so please don't suggest that as a possible suggestion."
3615,I'm hoping to start some kind of medication because after today it has become glaringly obvious that I am not OK.
3616,"How much does your medication help, and does it hinder your social life (mixing alcohol and meds)?"
3617,My progress is faltering and I'm becoming nearly agoraphobic so I'd like to start taking medication.
3618,"**

26/F here, diagnosed with panic disorder 5 years ago, but things have been better and I haven't been on meds in a while."
3619,"My only reasoning is that they thought I was there to try to get meds, or if it my feelings were something bigger, they didn't want to deal with it."
3620,I have been very tempted to see someone about going back on meds though.
3621,I tried my best to avoid needing medication for my problems.
3622,"I just got put on medication on Friday but it may take weeks to provide any positive impact, if it does at all."
3623,I am not presently on anxiety medication.
3624,I have been off any sort of regular medication for a while now.
3625,"Now I have not taken the medicine route (except I did take B complex when I felt drained of energy which sustained my panic even further, but don't need to anymore), there was a point which I felt that if I have exhausted every other option possible then I would, so there is nothing wrong with it."
3626,Also I'm getting really worried about the hair-loss side effects these meds have.
3627,Not sure if it was caused by the meds or because thats how i'm feeling at the moment.
3628,Three weeks ago I decided my anxiety is too much to handle on my own so I went to psychiatrist who diagnosed me with recurrent depression/ anxiety disorder and immediately prescripted me meds.
3629,"I've taken the meds for 7 days and since the side effects kept only getting worse, I quit the pills."
3630,"Or is it just a problem in my head, maybe caused by how meds were demonized by people around me?"
3631,"I'm a 27yr old male, no medications but a self described night owl that probably doesn't get enough sleep."
3632,Is it reasonable to ask about other types of medicine?
3633,How should I go about taking these medications?
3634,I am new to all this... has anyone been able to stop taking meds and still feel this way?
3635,My anxiety has become so awful that I can't even visit my regular doctor and she refuses to refill my medicine over the phone..
3636,"My psychologist (only made it to one appointment this year) can't prescribe and the last time I saw her, she did tell me medicine might be beneficial, but was in a hurry because our session was running late and didn't refer me for the med doctor at the counseling center."
3637,"Since that happened, I figured I would go and see a professional about medication."
3638,"i'm prescribed .5mg KPin and i just recently ran out of them, i now realized they helped diminish my [visual snow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow)  but i really need a fast acting anxiety medication on top of that and from what ive heard alprazolam(xanax) is the best one."
3639,"New meds, went to bed at 11ish, sleeping in a place I know is safe."
3640,I don't want to turn to medication.
3641,"Also, there's no other real treatment for my hearing issues, but anti-anxiety meds are a common things for us."
3642,Not on any meds right now because my last psychiatrist was a quack.
3643,"And as a secondary question, which meds do YOU find the most useful besides Klonopin because they just do not work for me."
3644,My anxiety has been better since my initial panic attack after stop taking the meds but it still sucks.
3645,"I've agreed to stay on the fluoxetine for the month's duration, but I'm not so sure I can't do without it, given the right stomach medicine...ugh..."
3646,"The thought that if I had to be on a lifelong medication that would prevent me from drinking doesn’t upset me, oddly enough."
3647,"Got a survey through from the university I am about to start at asking me a bunch of health questions, I answered it and I put details I deem necessary and always tell HR departments like what medication I take."
3648,"For those who have ended the use of medication, does it get better or worse?"
3649,"Now, this time around, I've since been to the doc and I have some anti-anxiety meds to take along."
3650,"I'm 19 years old, female, not taking any medications for my anxiety."
3651,I get anxious/depressed then I use medicine from the psychiatrist.
3652,Too embarrassed to tell my family but I have been telling my councilor and doctor that I have trouble with taking the medicine correctly and I have a history of doing the same thing.
3653,This forum is rife with recommendations and discussions of medications and anecdotal stories about what people have said about what people think is happening to them when they have anxiety.
3654,"I'm sorry, but anyone who wants to get better needs to look into successful treatment and stop bullshitting around this forum with discussions of medication."
3655,Go to a psychiatrist for medication.
3656,And its not medication.
3657,Has anyone else had similar reactions to medication?
3658,I started on anxiety meds about 6 months ago and have been working to find the right combo of anxiety/depression meds but nothing feels like it's helping too much.
3659,Plus I was reluctant to start on medication in the first place and now going to two medications just makes me feel so... crazy.
3660,The other thing I've considered is medication.
3661,Take meds?
3662,"I suffer from ADHD and Social Anxiety, the SA isn't terrible, but it's definitely there, and is worsened by any ADHD medication I have tried."
3663,"Although he originally prescribed me Duloxetine, which I have read a LOT of bad things about, so I told him I did not want to take it; given my previous history with medications (they all affect me in very strange ways, so I have stopped taking most medications he prescribed me) he became slightly frustrated (for lack of a better work), and told me that there really wasn't many other options at this point."
3664,You can lead a normal life without meds
3665,"I can go for therapy, but not medication."
3666,I have been on various depression/anxiety meds in the past and they have all made me not care about anything really.
3667,So I explain to him that I have been sick for the past week and had a cough and I took some cough medicine that I had been prescribed earlier that year.
3668,Then goes on to say that opiates and benzos are far more dangerous than Cymbalta or any of those medications.
3669,for anxiety with out trying to fix the problem with other non-addictive meds first instead of just treating symptoms.
3670,I just kept telling him I wasn't asking for anything and that I just was trying to find help overcoming some of my fears and my fear of taking the medicine.
3671,He told me that therapy wouldn't work well for me and it would only help after I got on meds/for the long run.
3672,He also said he was typing a report of our meeting so that he could send it to my GP (I could understand him sending them a notification of medication changes but didn't think he could send a report of the entire session.).
3673,"I don't want to see a therapist and be put on meds, not to mention I don't even have the money."
3674,I've been on anti anxiety medication since I was in 6th grade.
3675,"I'm now 19, the medicine works well for me and I've changed my doses a few times but it's been steady for the past few years and I've been perfectly fine."
3676,"I'm already on medication and I've been in therapy, so those bases are covered."
3677,"It's possible I might be on the meds indefinitely, but I'm good with that."
3678,"Quick facts: 

-I'm 23 and shes 22
-We've been together almost 2 months now
-I don't take medicine or see a therapist
-I actually have health anxiety as well so I'm scared of taking medicine for my anxiety because of what it might do to me."
3679,-For those that are going to just go with the easy response and suggest meds or therapists please tell me about your experiences with it so I'm not as anxious about them.
3680,"I know I have to develop a better lifestyle and rely on the medication, but I've come a long way where I came from and I am headed down the right path...."
3681,I want to make it clear to whoever does my intake that I do not want medication.
3682,"I've been on medication for the better part of the past 16 years, and my first encounter with the mental health systems was 18 years ago, when I was only 10 years old."
3683,"I'm sick of the system, and I'm even more sick of medication."
3684,"The only medication I would consider would be for ADHD, because everything else tends to cloud my brain, and I have enough of that as it is."
3685,"It's frustrating me to no end, and I'd like to know what other meds I have a shot at."
3686,How should I go about doing this (I've heard of docs having a general reluctancy to prescribing heavy-duty anxiety meds)?
3687,"I've had about 18 months without much, and the last 8 months or so have been without any medication."
3688,"I'm on multiple medications, but I've been out of therapy for about a year and a half- I'm going to get into a domestic violence therapy thing to start up again."
3689,Most recently I discussed with her the possibility of trying medication.
3690,"I have avoided medication up until now, but now I am at the point where my fears about medication no longer outweigh my desire to try it in the hopes that it will help me function."
3691,"She referred me to a prescriber who I met with recently, and I was prescribed Zoloft, and Xanax to supplement the transition into medication (and, I think, to give me an “oh-shit button”, should I need one)."
3692,So far I’m only on day 2 of meds and hoping to feel a difference in the coming weeks.
3693,"But because of my lifestyle changes, I have gained 50 pounds since starting the medication... :-("
3694,I got these same kind of headaches when I was off my meds for a for a long period time (like when I was lazy in get my refills).
3695,So it's been four months since I've been off the meds and I'm curious if I'm still dealing with the withdrawals or if this is some thing that I'm dealing with that had been suppressed when I was on the medication.
3696,I am on anti anxiety/depression medication (im not depressed).
3697,I stopped taking the meds and still feel drained and fatigued!
3698,I dont feel anxious with the feeling of dread anymore (thanks to the meds) but constantly so dam tired!
3699,"I am on meds (Effexor, Xanax as needed, both of them pretty low doses), and I do see a therapist."
3700,"These meds have worked WONDERS for my daily symptoms, but I still frequently have panic attacks that I simply can't come down with, or I have bad days where I have several severe panic attacks throughout the entire day."
3701,"I've started taking anti anxiety/depression meds, and they've definitely helped, but I still don't feel 'right'."
3702,"I have since calmed down, and have not taken my medicine."
3703,"I have been seeing a counselor, but am currently having trouble trying to get medication through my insurance."
3704,I was on meds for a while but once I got a good handle on it I stopped and was feeling quite a bit better than I had.
3705,"I have a doctors appointment Friday to go back on my meds, which I never wanted to do because I was doing well channeling my anxieties and started doing things I love again."
3706,"I've struggled with depression for over 10 years and when I was younger (10-11 years old) I was regularly seeing a mental health professional and taking medication for it, but for certain reasons related to pressure from my family, I stopped."
3707,I told my manager I was having anxiety and I was really dizzy and almost fainted and he let me sit in the office til my meds kicked in and my other manager volunteered to take care of my food running that I was supposed to be doing.
3708,I still take my medication but it seems my anxiety has grown.
3709,"Is it something I should go to the doctor for, or is their any over-the-counter medicine I could be taking to help a little?"
3710,"I'm so afraid to get medication as many people tell me that it's ruined their life, and have made them more of a depressed person."
3711,Will I be prescribed medication right away?
3712,It has even helped me to get out of panic attacks without resorting to medication!
3713,I've tried 2 different medicines since then and now I'm on a beta blocker.
3714,I started the beta blocker because I started complaining about palpitations a month after I started taking blood pressure medicine (I quit the blood pressure medicine because it didnt work for me).
3715,I got medication for it.
3716,"I would not see doctors, consider medicine, etc."
3717,"However, I do not want to become dependent on medication."
3718,"I wanted to get a baseline of how I feel without meds, and then re-evauluate."
3719,"I've been thinking about seeing a doctor for anti-anxiety medication, but I don't want understand the medication enough."
3720,"I don't want know if I'd be on xanax everyday, or something like that, or other medications I have a history of substance abuse, and I don't know how that would go."
3721,Are there other medications besides things like that?.
3722,"Therapy didn't, help medication didn't help."
3723,"I was on that for about a year and a half but (stupidly) decided to quit cold turkey my sophmore year of college, partly because I genuinely thought I didn't need it any more and partly because more than anything I want to be normal and not have to depend on medication or combat anxiety."
3724,"The Prednisone actually fucked me up so bad that it messed up my stomach lining and I had gastritis for a month, and had to take an acid reflux medicine."
3725,It's been about three months since this all started and I'm feeling just about as anxious and depressed as I was before I got put on medication for the first time.
3726,What SSRI/medicine helped you the most?
3727,"I have seen a shrink, it helped a bit, but I never took any medication, and he agrees that I should'nt, he says I should be able to overcome it without them."
3728,"I don't have anything else, exercise or medication, that can help me get through it."
3729,But my real problem was I didn't want to feel like I NEEDED medication to function.
3730,I quit drinking (mostly) since being on meds since that's a big no-no.
3731,I was not on any meds and was living alone and supporting myself and doing a job I hated and compulsively binge eating all my feelings and hating myself and pretending everything was fine.
3732,"Take care of yourself, get into therapy, switch up your meds, etc, do YOU."""
3733,"So with my meds (or condition, or whatever I don't know) I was very very antsy and spirally uncontrollable thoughts plagued me and I became cyclically high and low."
3734,"I don't know if I should contact my doctor about it and seek medication, as I'm.worried about getting the headaches again...

My anxiety has always driven me so close to the edge of insanity that I constantly think about suicide."
3735,"I don't want medication that's going to make me feel like a zombie, but I don't like this and I'm tired of it."
3736,"I was once prescribed ativan along with some anti-nausea medicine for an international flight, and it didn't work, so I'm also afraid to try all these medications, spend money, and find out they don't work."
3737,"Now I'm not sure if it's the medication or the anxiety thats giving me these problems, like I know I've had sexual side effects in the past so now I'm so nervous I won't be able to perform that that anxiety creates sexual problems on its own."
3738,"I know my meds needed to be changed anyways, but it could have been handled way better without me having to suffer like this."
3739,"The only medication I have here is lorazepam and I can't think well enough after taking it to do any work, something I realized at a really inopportune time."
3740,I know medication and therapy should be long term solutions but what about short term?
3741,It felt like it took a lot of effort to ask him for the meds.
3742,I've been putting off going back to him for my regular physical because I'll have to tell him why I stopped taking the meds.
3743,I work very hard with the help of meditation and medication to remain a functional and loving parent.
3744,"My medication doesn't seem to help, and I'm almost afraid to get put on something stronger, or change meds."
3745,"I've started to double up my meds, because I feel like I need them, however, they aren't anything fast-acting, just celexa....so doubling up doesn't really do anything quickly."
3746,My family thinks I don't need medication for having anxiety/depression.
3747,Ive been unemployed for about a month while the meds side effects slowed down and am going to a therapist on the tenth.
3748,I don't want to mask the symptoms with a medication and while I know in my heart I will be successful I also know it will take longer.
3749,I would love it if she were willing to try an SSRI or some medicine other than xanax (which as I understand only treats the symptoms).
3750,"I have Panic Anxiety, and as I'm fairly new to the whole medication thing, I asked my doctor for a situational medication to try to ease myself into it a little first."
3751,"Growing up when I would have a panic attack I was always told things like ""if you don't calm down we'll have to get medicine for you"", so medication for me is always difficult because I've come to view it as a bad thing, or along the lines of admitting ""I'm weak, because I need medicine to help me"" for a better explanation I guess??"
3752,"Either way, my medicine (Buspirone) so far helps, but I always have anxiety over taking the thing that is supposed to REDUCE my anxiety so I end up either taking forever to swallow it, or dont take it at all, which doesn't help me in any way."
3753,"Does anyone have any tips on what I can do to help out with this, or would getting a daily medication be a better option?"
3754,I'm debating speaking to my doctor to see if he can increase my dose of meds(275mg of Effexor) because they aren't really helping me anymore.
3755,"Since I started on this new medication, the violent thoughts I have are becoming more prominent."
3756,"I spent time with some friends, helped them brew some beer, and was able to open up about why I am on meds."
3757,"I now have a better support system I feel but after realizing my anxiety was getting worse again and that it was affecting not only myself but also those around me, I decided it was time to go back on the meds."
3758,"I've tried everything that usually works-fresh air, drinking cold water, putting cold water on my face, fingertip touches, lying down, medication (Vistaril), calm music."
3759,"Vistaril has been a great medication for my ever day anxiety, but I haven't found any medication or alternative that can calm me down during an attack."
3760,"I don't know if anyone else does this, but I've spent the last hour on google searching high blood pressure and Straterra, as well as my other medications (Adderall, Depakote), and I'm still really scared."
3761,I'm in therapy and on light medication for the time being.
3762,"I was buckled in for some withdrawal -- I remember forgetting a pill once and having a very difficult time the next day, back when I started on the meds about a year ago."
3763,"**TL;DR** I went off my meds unintentionally, feel pretty good."
3764,"I take meds for my nausea sometimes, but not specifically anxiety."
3765,"I talked to my doctor a few months ago and he said that he doesn't think I need anxiety meds, and I agreed because I thought I was getting way better and I am( at one point boys period made me uncomfortable whether it was intimate or not."
3766,"I was diagnosed with GAD, Depression and Agoraphobia by my very trusted family doctor, and have been receiving medication, and ADHD by a different psychiatrist."
3767,Now the anxiety attacks are very scarce yet I feel like It doesn't matter me taking the meds if something is wrong with me.
3768,I have GAD and used to take medication for it.
3769,I don't want to get back on medication.
3770,"I used to take meds (citalopram), and it just didn't work for me."
3771,"I started getting anxious about taking the pill, because it was rarely on time and I was worried more for the sickening side effects rather than the curing properties of my meds."
3772,"So currently, I am off my meds, which I know will be bashed by a few of you, but I felt that if I could try and find non-medical alternatives to my anxiety, I would lead a happier/healthier life."
3773,"And since having met and moving in with my boyfriend, I have found that I have made some good steps in living with anxiety without being dependent on medications."
3774,"Planning to go to the docs tomorrow and get talking to them, i don't want to start and meds."
3775,My main concern about being on medication for anxiety is that if I get on it what would happen when I get off it.
3776,Please if anyone has been on medication and have gotten off it was is it like?
3777,If not medication do you have any suggestions on maybe naturally coping with this.
3778,"My medication helped at first but now, not so much."
3779,I've been on so many different medications to try and ease all of this.
3780,"I have been off meds for around 4 months and my anxiety is starting to creep back up on me, but I am tired of taking these every day."
3781,I've resorted to taking a small dose of Lorazepam to take the edge off but I'm fighting getting on meds.
3782,She knows I'm on medication that makes me feel bad and that I have generalised anxiety but she seems to think its her.
3783,"I finally went to the ER the second night, was given some meds, and instructed to go to my gp."
3784,We went to the doctor.. who straightaway said that it was all stress related; but still gave me medicines for a mild gastritis; and he also gave me anxit (.25 alprazolam) to be taken whenever I got those mild restless feelings.
3785,"I avoided taking them because i did not want to be on medications for my mental health.. i wanted to cure it out naturally, but did take them once in 4-5 days."
3786,"I've been to my GP several times, where they put me on different kinds of medication and I had at least four blood tests in the past year, but nothing came back and the medication only made things worse."
3787,I am thinking it is time to go off my medication but it makes me a little nervous because I don't want to end up where I started...
3788,I also have to fill out a form with all my medical history and any medications I'm taking...I don't want to have to lie so quitting cold turkey seems to be my only choice.
3789,I stopped taking it because I didn't feel like it was doing too much anymore and I'm still conflicted about relying on medicine.
3790,I would like to find a way to not be on medicine but therapy is expensive and the only therapist I've had a good experience with charges $200 per session.
3791,"I don't see my therapist until the 2nd, and I JUST started my medication (ambilify) for PTSD + BP + Anxiety (I was on meds for this but took myself off)."
3792,"However the pollen count is low, and asthma medication does not alleviate the symptoms whatsoever."
3793,Well... made an appointment with my PCP about medication.
3794,"I live alone and I'm afraid that this medicine could end up doing more harm than anything else, and I won't be able to get help."
3795,I just started my anxiety medication today probably two hours ago.
3796,Can I hear some awesome success stories after starting medication to help calm me down?
3797,I don't want to be dependent on meds again.
3798,what does medication actually do?
3799,"So, should I go on medication?"
3800,"I ***really*** am hesitant about taking medication, mainly because I don't want to be dependent on it and I don't want to be known as the pill-popper."
3801,I should also mention that I'm pretty anti prescription medication for the most part.
3802,"She has been pushing me more towards meds that you take everyday that have to build up in your system rather than the Xanax (that she describes as ""just a band-aid"")."
3803,I wanted others opinion on these type of anxiety meds.
3804,"My last panic attack I believe, along with my doctor, was a result of lowering the dosage on my medication."
3805,"I was great for most of that time, but the last 4 months have been progressively getting worse due to job stress, life stress, and probably just going so long without counseling/meds."
3806,Should I expect to be on medication?
3807,When I woke up I knew for sure that it was that I missed a dosage of meds.
3808,TL;DR: Make sure you take your meds as directed.
3809,I feel as if my anxiety is keeping e from being an independent person and I'm not sure how else to cope aside from taking my medication.
3810,I've also been reading a lot about this medication and people's experiences with it.
3811,"While I fully understand that everyone's reaction to a medication are completely different and there's no way to determine how its going to affect me until I take it, I'm really nervous."
3812,"I don't want this medication to make everything worse, and I'm really afraid of that happening."
3813,I'm kind of wondering if I should just try counseling first before taking the medication.
3814,Would medication even really help?
3815,I did my 12 hours and tried to sleep after taking the medication and I wasn't able to get to sleep for several hours.
3816,"She asked if I would be willing to try another medication, I told her possibly, but I was very leery after what had happened."
3817,She told me how proud the doctor was of me to be willing to consider trying another medication and how happy they were for me for seeking treatment.
3818,I seriously considered going to the ER to get some emergency anxiety medication so I can calm down and sleep.
3819,"I've seen bipolar disorder before and know for a fact I don't have it, and don't want to be given even more medication that will fuck me up even worse."
3820,This medication and treatment thing is all very new to me.
3821,I always get super nervous before taking new meds for the first time.
3822,Well I can't sleep because my mind is just racing and on top of that I'm having doubts about this medicine because I'm afraid to take it.
3823,im having all thee irrational thoughts like I'll have an allergic reaction to it or I'll fall asleep and die because the medicine is too strong.
3824,"I practice yoga almost everyday (which has been a huge stress relief) and adopted a vegan lifestyle a year ago, I still see my therapist, but don't need to as often as I used to, and I still take medication: Klonopin .625 mg a day."
3825,"I had a bad reaction to some medication about 3 months ago, steroid psychosis."
3826,"During the school year, I considered going on medication for depression."
3827,"What I want to know is, for anyone who took anxiety medication, did it help you cope with your relationships?"
3828,"In the end you just give up, and hope your daily dose of medication will start working soon, so that maybe you'll get something done today."
3829,They even doubled my meds!
3830,Is there any meds that can help me?
3831,I did *not* think that medication would help so much.
3832,*Don't* rely on meds to fix your problems.
3833,"However, it's been nearly 2 weeks since I've completely stopped taking it as I don't want to have to rely on medication."
3834,"I would like to know people's experience on switching medications, how it is done and what you experienced."
3835,I am currently on 150mg of Effexor XR (vanlafaxine) and would like to switch to another medication as my husband and I are trying to get pregnant.
3836,I suffer from panic disorder and am yet to see an psychiatrist to receive advice on what my options on other medications are.
3837,I have been on and off Effexor 3 times and haven't had much of a bad experience but I would like to stay on some sort of  safer medication during and after pregnancy.
3838,"First off, the bottom line: I want to try medication."
3839,What kind of anxiety relieving medication can I take which doesn't require a prescription?
3840,not on meds presently.

3852,I've never been on anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medication before and I'm not sure what to expect.
3853,"What I'm confused about is right after he told me he didn't think depression was much of an issue, he prescribed me 1 20mg tab of Paxil per day for 30 days, telling me that it would help with my anxiety and insomnia..according to my research, this is a medication used to treat severe depression, and the side effects are what happen to cause drowsiness and anxiety relief."
3854,"I tried to stay away from medication to help with this problem (foolish pride), but I realized that maybe this is more serious than I would like to admit."
3855,"Does anybody out there have experience with this medication, and is there any other methods I can use to help with this anxiety?"
3856,"I didn't take the other drugs but I figured I keep them around for when I really needed them - if I was in a really bad place and needed to feel better immediately and for some reason had run out of my medication (ativan) and/or needed something stronger or, more honestly - decided to kill myself."
3857,"It was explained to me that ALL SSRI's are ineffective or do the opposite of what antidepressants or anti anxiety medications are supposed to do, due to my null variant of this gene/(genotype)?"
3858,I have tried numerous medications and I don't like any of them due to the side affects or the non help that they give.
3859,Is there any way I could calm myself down enough to stop the shaking without medication( I don’t take medication now).

3863,"Dr recently prescribed me Zoloft for anxiety and stability, first time ever on medication."

3865,How many times did you have to switch medication until you go the right one?
3866,"I'm worried it's just going to keep compounding if I don't do something about it, but cannot afford therapy and want absolutely nothing to do with medication."
3867,"I'm very tempted to visit my doctor to ask for medication, but I'd love to know if anyone has any really good advice for tackling anxiety when you're living alone."
3868,Specific meds may be different here but I'm not sure.
3869,They've been supportive; I'm visiting with a psychiatrist next week to get a prescription for medication.
3870,I'm scared I'm going to be put on medication for the rest of my life.
3871,I'm scared that anxiety medications would end the hobby that has greatly enriched my life.

3878,"I do not have my father amongst my contacts, but I fear that if he hears word of me putting up a rainbow profile pic (I'm a staunch supporter of tolerance, having been almost completely shunned by my ""family""), he'll actually think I'm gay and cut all ties with me, including stopping providing the medication, which I cannot afford to finance."
3879,"Let me give you a bit of background: I am 27, male, no medications."
3880,I'm trying to go without medication but if I can't get this under control I'm going to go back to a new medication that my doctor prescribed me.
3881,I currently see a therapist once a week and have a doctor to help with medication.
3882,He refuses to prescribe new medications or see me in between appointments and won't set up any appointments sooner than 2 months apart.
3883,"Each time I recieve a new medication, I have fairly severe side-effects almost immediately and after a phone call, he will tell me to stop taking said medication but will not try anything else until I come back into his office 2 months later."
3884,After 8 months I have only been able to try 3 medications and after this next semester I will not be able to take another semester off for medical reasons.
3885,"I am desperate enough to want to try medication, though I'm the weird type of person who doesn't even like to take mild painkillers for headaches."
3886,And when did you decide enough was enough and that the embarassment of medication was worth a chance of improved quality of life?
3887,Has anybody regretted starting medication because they realized their medication wasnt that bad after all?
3888,"I thought the medicine would help me focus, and it did."
3889,"He has told me that when he was younger, about 11, his stepmom made him to go a Doctor and they put him on all sorts of meds that “zombiefied” him."
3890,"I do hope I get A job, I would like to go back to counseling and get off my meds (10mg paxil, ain't doin shit."
3891,"He dosn't know I went to counciling and am on meds, so he assumes it's just shyness."
3892,"heres the thing though, im already on meds."
3893,I don't want to try any prescription medications as I've heard that these can be very addicting and have bad side effects.
3894,I don't really want to mess it up and say something and have them put me on meds that I don't need...or don't give me meds I do need.
3895,Was on meds for the last 10 years but I don't think they really helped and may have made things worse.
3896,"Ideally, I'd like to get through the flight on my own -without meds, but I'm probably going to have to take something."
3897,I took daily medicine then I weaned myself off and have been anxiety free for about a year.
3898,"I know that the label says not to drink, but I've seen that on pretty much all medication and I've never had anything go wrong before."
3899,I wanted to ask those who are/were on medication for anxiety/depression related issues.
3900,"For example, I've heard many say that the initial onset of the medication taking hold feels quite awful with those experiencing a lot of lows, suicidal thoughts, lack of energy/motivation...etc."
3901,"I am not on any meds, I've only tried Citalopram for like 2 days and it made my jaw clench up so I stopped taking it."
3902,"Feel free to take some medication beforehand like Xanax, if you're prescribed."
3903,A quick google search indicates that extreme anxiety HAS been experienced by some people following this medication and it takes about 6 months for your body to fully rid itself of it.
3904,I know you aren't supposed to use Xanax regularly and I know different medication is required for general anxiety.
3905,Not sure if was due to medication or some other non-obvious reason.
3906,I know she's taken some kind of anxiety medication as long as I can remember.
3907,"Then, recently, it became known to me recently that my mother is also taking a low dose of medication for anxiety."
3908,"Also, are all anxiety meds 'take as needed'?"
3909,I don't take any medicine.
3910,I will not take medicine.
3911,I have too many bad experiences with friends and family on different psychology medicines.
3912,This is my personal choice but understand others do benefit from medicine.
3913,"I saw a psychiatrist, got medicine, and generally started feeling better until one of the medicines started causing me to imagine violent things (not hallucinate, just imagine)."
3914,I have been to counselling and CBT to help myself get through everyday life and for the most part it has really helped- I refuse to be on medication however due to a bad past experience and I personally believe I can work through the problems with enough brain power.
3915,"(That is not to say anyone who IS on medication doesn’t have the brain power, it is a personal thing for me."
3916,I would urge anyone to try medication if they believe they really want it and their doctors give them the option.)
3917,Edit: Not sure but I think it's because of my anti anxiety medication.
3918,"This is what I know though
- I forgot to take my thyroid medicine for a few days so may have gone hyperthyroid a bit
- I have had a lot of caffeine today
- I am exhausted from a long trip

My mind is worrying this is not going to end."
3919,"I have been looking for a new job while still doing my freelance work, I have enrolled in a local community college (I dropped out of the University that I had been going to 2 years ago because of severe anxiety), my boyfriend and I are looking for an apartment, and I have also started taking medication for my GAD."
3920,Not currently on any medications and have been on a waiting list for a publicly funded therapist for 8 weeks now.
3921,Wondering if any of you have any advice on how to overcome these feelings without therapy/medication as I am still waiting to get into therapy.
3922,"**

To be honest, and I know this is going to sound really stupid, I just want someone to talk to, and maybe some medication that'll make the dread go away and calm me down when I'm in panic mode."
3923,"First off, after reading posts online i have noticed the majority do not take above 200mg and still stopping their medication was a nightmare."
3924,"In fact, my armchair scientific speculation is that it might be a side effect of the meds lessening the intensity of recurrent OCD thoughts."
3925,I spoke to my counselor at the school and am going to be seeing a nurse practitioner to talk about possibly getting medications for test taking.
3926,They have this stigma that any medication is 'bad' and you should not be on it.
3927,While I respect their opinions I think exploring the option of anxiety medications would be a good start for me.
3928,Or can anyone tell me what it is like to take anxiety medications and how they have helped you?
3929,"I choose not to take medications for it, because I have been able to cope with it for this long and a friend of mine makes me feel guilty for even considering using them."
3930,TL;DR Has anyone else taken anti-anxiety medications for test taking?
3931,I am a 21 year old female in college who is going to see a nurse practitioner tomorrow about getting medications.
3932,"I need meds, and I am thinking about taking Zoloft."
3933,"Yes, he did prescribe medication, but he told me if I don't like the side effects he will help me back off the medication."
3934,"I don't do alcohol, drugs, caffeine, medications, nothing at all."
3935,I'd had fucking amazing results with meds.
3936,"Could i go on without meds (uh, no, not if i can help it), could i start making enough money online to leave my boyfriend (sure, after meds kicked in again, but then his ways won't upset me), am i hurting my kids by being distant (yes, but not as much as if i were not protecting them)."
3937,Hopefully it helps for as long as it takes for me to be able to buy my meds again.
3938,In the interim I have decided to try betablockers because they are the mildest anxiety medication and I would be adverse to trying anything stronger.
3939,"He diagnosed me with depression, which was accurate, and then prescribed meds (at my request)."
3940,And the meds are great.
3941,They don't know about the counseling or meds or any of it.
3942,I probably need to reevaluate my medication and go back to therapy if I found a new guy.
3943,For three years after this I was on a cocktail of medications (SSRI's and benzodiazepines).
3944,"I decided to come off of the medications and was successful in doing so, with few ""episodes"" for two years following."
3945,I've have had spurts of anxiety for about 2 years now and decided to go on meds just before starting my new job.
3946,I want to know if anyone has had luck with other medications or alternative treatments.
3947,Did you find another medication that helps more?
3948,"Hell, even if you guys come here and say ""ya you got control anxiety disorder, go to a shrink and get some meds, you aren't dying of some fatal disease, its anxiety manifesting physically"" it would do a world of wonders for me."
3949,I told my friend's mom about it and she told me to go tell a doctor and take meds; if I'm anxious for no reason its a chemical problem.
3950,We doubled my original dose of meds.
3951,"I've had an old doctor whom I swear is just pushing pills and the medication I've been on through them has always been a wrong dosage, and not only that but my scripts are always filled out wrongly than what the doctor says."
3952,"Father is an addict of pain meds, already had open heart surgery, can't eat healthy, probably bipolar."
3953,"I am currently on citalopram medication, but it is currently being changed to mirtazapine, I start on that next week."
3954,"After 6 months of denial, and an entire summer of pretending I could handle it myself, this morning I went to see a counselor and am being enrolled in a program which will have me put on medication (not sure which kind yet) combined with CBT."
3955,I will be back again once I have had my first session and start medication.
3956,"I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, but do not take medication for it."
3957,I don't necessarily want to take medication.
3958,"I have tried various therapies, and am currently not seeing anyone, although I am switching my medication from Effexor(187.5mg) to Celexa(10mg) and it seems to have no effect on my anxiety."
3959,A few months ago I started taking pain meds for a health issue.
3960,My anxiety before has always been short panic attacks sort of thing which I finally last year bit the bullet and got some medication that I take while I'm having an attack which helps me so much.
3961,side effects of medication.
3962,I'm scheduled for a doctor's appointment next week where I hope I can get some anti-anxiety meds prescribed to help me get this under control.
3963,"But it's so hard and at the end of the day, a couple of drinks is the absolute best medicine."
3964,How can I illustrate that these medications could help me without coming off as a benzo fiend or whatever?
3965,What if the meds dont work?
3966,I'd really like to be able to deal with anxiety without medication in the near future.
3967,"They hooked me up on an IV, gave me serum and meds and I started feeling better."
3968,My mom doesn't want me on meds either.
3969,"I AM on medications and go to therapy, but those only help so much."
3970,Have you had luck managing it with medication?
3971,I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and a doctor prescribed medication.
3972,When the psychologist handed me the letter to my doctor recommending medication I began crying and didn't stop until I was home.
3973,I couldn't cope with the idea that I would need medication in order to be happy.
3974,I saw medication as only for crazy people.
3975,I finally realised I needed medication.
3976,But I was still uncomfortable with taking meds and after my first two month course I decided I could go it alone.
3977,I now understand that right now I need medication in order to live anything resembling a life.
3978,I want to see a therapist and I really do not want to take medication.
3979,"So in your opinions, do you think I should hold off on the meds and continue with the CBT or start the meds?"
3980,In an ideal world is like to stay away from meds but my life is being severely impacted by these symptoms.
3981,I want to see a psychiatrist who specializes in psychotherapy along with medication but I don't even know where to begin to look and I'm not good at talking about my feelings so I know it will be tough.
3982,"My anxiety is pretty severe at the moment even with some medication I took this morning, but I have to do it."
3983,Is there a good way to take control of sleep without medication?
3984,"I've never had one, but whenever I take meds for my pain (Lyrica, Tramadol, Codeine, Buprenorphine patch) they give me side effects, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea and the typical side effects you get from opiates and that makes me think I'm close to a seizure."
3985,"Along with that, she also thinks I'm on the wrong meds, which is probably magnifying the lows."
3986,"Once the meds are changed and my moods are stable, she's going to re-evaluate the anxiety component."
3987,"I don't take any medication, usually I'm better when I'm very busy and don't have too much time to myself, but I feel completely drained and overwhelmed by the level of anxiety I've experienced throughout this moving process."
3988,I don't want this to affect my quality of life and don't want to have to be prescribed daily medication to cope with symptoms.
3989,Apparently he will decide if I need therapy or meds.
3990,But the meds might not of been the only thing that helped me.
3991,"I still have some anxiety meds (not ativan though) for in case, and I've managed to start getting better, but, things have been bad again the past two-ish months."
3992,"I am currently in a psychiatric private hospital getting treated for my anxiety, depression and personality disorder with therapy and medication and my girlfriend came to visit tonight."
3993,"TLDR: suffer from anxiety, had sex with my girlfriend of 1 year and 10 months and had a panic attack straight afterwards and had to take medication (valium) to calm down."
3994,"so i've forgotten to take my meds in the morning the last couple days, and i've noticed that my vertigo is very noticeably worse."
3995,"I checked she had taken her meds, had food etc."
3996,I initially tried medicine but didn't like the other affects.
3997,"I have medication for anxiety, .5mg of Clonazepam, but taking it hasn't been very effective, so I've been taking 2 daily instead."
3998,I don't take medication (other than the ocassional antacid).
3999,"Unfortunately, I lost my medication (fluoxitine) 2 days ago."
4000,"He then tells me ""if someone can proved they're depressed, we put them on medication."""
4001,"I keep a xanax in my wallet at all times, but i dont like relying on medicine and am flat out tired of avoiding public situations."
4002,"I thought I might be able to adjust to these, but the medication has also increased my anxiety to an unbearable level-- so much so that it has made my birth control pill stop working (I have bleeding and cramps where I should never have bleeding; it is a 365 day pill and I take it perfectly)."
4003,"I have never been on any medication other than some anti-depressant in my early life around middle school (I actually never thought of that being a potential trigger until just now, not sure if it is significant)."
4004,i am desperate to have CBT however (iam in the UK) the doctor said that services are too stretched to help me and offered me medication (sertraline) to stabalise me until therapy becomes available.
4005,"i am bummed out because i did not want meds and i have officially been diagnosed by a doctor with anxiety and depression, it was always an idea in my head and now it is a reality that i am not sure how to deal with."
4006,does anyone have any advice with my next steps or whether or not i should take the medication?
4007,"Also, I'm hoping the CBT my therapist is starting next week will help, she said she's gonna teach me a breathing exercise, but I have a feeling that CBT alone isn't going to be enough, and that I need some medication to really cope."
4008,"I'm also supposed to see my regular physician to get some blood tests done, and my therapist agrees that I should ask for some anxiety meds to help in the mean time, while I wait to see a psychiatrist, but I can't even get in to see my doctor, until next Thursday."
4009,I haven't taken any medication yet but I've been a long time user of alcohol which I believe put me where I'm at today.
4010,The only effect of the medication I've actually noticed is that when taking 2x/3x of the dose it makes going to sleep a lot easier (something that I don't really struggle with anyway).
4011,"I am only 23, and I am not, nor have I ever taken medication."
4012,"So over the weekend I was out at a restaurant/bar, and in my purse i had my makeup bag which had a bottle of Wellbutrin and Klonopin which are the two meds I take each day."
4013,Somebody swiped my entire makeup bag out of my purse at some point through the night and so not only did I lose all of my favorite makeup but my meds as well.
4014,"Granted I've never abused any medication, and I've been with my doctor for four years and I'm sure he'd believe me it just sounds so sketchy."
4015,"So here I am, sitting inside on this beautiful Memorial Day, freaking out about my lack of meds, how I'll ask my doctor to help me out with replacing what is left of the script for the month, and just going through all of the various scenarios about how terrible tomorrow is going to be at work."
4016,"I've been on this medication before in the past , but I always feel like such a zombie, yes my anxiety goes but I feel like my personality goes away with it."
4017,I've been taking 100mg of the Solaray brand and I'm not on any other medications.
4018,"I'm not interested in taking medication... rather, I would prefer to learn long-term coping strategies and gain insight into the source of my anxious thoughts and behaviors."
4019,I understand if I was hospitalized/prescribed medication I would include that.
4020,"(4-5 times a day maybe) 

I have never had anxiety, haven't been on any medication."
4021,"Hey All,

So I'm just starting medication for anxiety."
4022,I've only tried medication once before and I had sexual side effects before it helped with anxiety at all so I stopped that before seeing any effect.
4023,"I haven't told them for this exact reason and I heard them arguing of how ""everyone has stress"" and ""you're in school, you don't have real stress"" and ""your aunt had panic attacks and meds didn't work for her""."
4024,"I barely sleep more than 4 hours a night and she says the doctor gave them because I haven't slept **recently** (I have exams and pulled a couple all-nighters) but she doesn't believe it happens all the time (it does, that's why I got medication)."
4025,"About 3 days into the meds I started to get swelling in my hands, and one night I woke up with a bit of hives on my arms."
4026,"TL;DR
-I have a fear of choking and of having an anaphylactic reaction, top this off with a strep infection and a fear of taking the meds that will make it better, and you got one messed up guy."
4027,I have been throwing the idea around of going to see my PCP about it but I think the only thing he can do is prescribe me anxiety meds.
4028,My question is: If you have taken meds are they worth it?
4029,"Is there something outside of medication, exercise, and pretty clean eating that can help control anxiety that I am just not thinking of?"
4030,I had never been on anxiety meds before in my life and didn't know what to expect.
4031,I was off the trial medicine and NOT doing well.
4032,Does anyone have experience (success or failures) with Zoloft or any other meds?
4033,"I'm heavily ANTI benzos, and really want this medication to work."
4034,I have severe anxiety and am off medication at the moment.
4035,"My family are not really pro-medication and I guess growing up around the stigma of drug=bad, I am very nervous about the possibility of being prescribed medication."
4036,"Personally, I think medication is a wonderful tool in the process of self-healing, but you know... logic is not always equal to anxiety."
4037,Is there anything I should know about taking medications?
4038,"I tried a couple medications for the depression, and ultimately found that Zoloft helped, but nothing I tried helped my anxiety (except Lexapro, but that made me fall asleep constantly and it was completely counterproductive and embarrassing to pass out on a desk in class.)"
4039,"I stopped seeing a therapist after about six months, and stopped the medication then as I felt I was cheating, or not trying hard enough to deal with my problems without medicine."
4040,"It's been over 5 years since then, and after doing some soul searching and reading I've realized I need to deal with my anxiety with a therapist and possibly medication."
4041,"Obviously I can't tell you how much of it is the hypnotherapy, or the meds, but day to day life is so much easier now and I feel so much calmer, so I am able to tackle uncomfortable situations."
4042,"I've been desperately trying to get help and get on some anxiety meds but I'm on a 3 month waiting list for the psychiatrist, and I've called a few therapists and all are atleast a 1 month waiting list!"
4043,What can I possibly do to get help/medication?
4044,"If it helps: I'm an adult male, have 20/20 vision, some history of anxiety/depression, am not taking any medication, and do not drink/use drugs."
4045,"I've tried therapy and medicine, but nothing helps."
4046,She's recently started medicine and that is helping her a little bit more each day.
4047,"Trying to make a long story short, but I have been through everything possible when it comes to anxiety and have tried everything I could to help it (therapy, medication, meditation, reflexology, reike, homeopathy, chiropractic specialist, hypno therapy, breathing techniques etc)."
4048,"So all my tests said I was ok, and it's still anxiety...well I thought I could do it with no medication but I have come to terms with the fact that some people just have it so extreme that medication is just something I may have to take for the rest of my life, and at this point, if it works, I am ok with taking it."
4049,I can't stand having this problem and I am wondering if therapy/ medicine can help.
4050,I live with medication.
4051,"He told them that I tried to overdose on pain medicine, which he shouldn't have said; I'm pretty sure we had a doctor-patient confidentiality."
4052,"I've tried getting therapy, tried medication for a while, but some rocks came along in the road and those things had to stop for a while."
4053,"And now that they've stopped I am unable to get help from a doctor or psychiatrist, and I desperately need medication or some kind of help."
4054,Got treated for anxiety the next week after and been taking meds till August of last year where I slowly winged myself off of them.
4055,So I'm finally going to doctors AGAIN to get back on medication hopefully.......but the thing is I'm scared to leave the house I'm afraid of having a huge panic attack while I'm in the office and even in the car.
4056,I want to give you hope too - go to a psychiatrist and don't be afraid to try medication if they recommend it.
4057,I currently take the Levlen contraception pill (for four years and have never experienced problems with it) and no other prescription medication.
4058,"I've been at this for decades, have taken 9 different meds, seen unknown numbers of doctors, tried all the non-drug therapies I could get myself to try, CBT, ACT, mindfulness, yoga, meditation."
4059,"General doctor, tell him my symptoms, tell him what meds I've taken and get blood work."
4060,Is it normal when first starting this medication to go back and forth on feeling better?
4061,I've never been a huge fan of meds.
4062,"After having a plethora of anxiety attacks over the last 2 weeks in regards to medicines, concussions, health issues..."
4063,I found the same issue when I was in a psychiatric hospital and they got me on the right meds... My anxiety came down and it was like I was exposed.
4064,"I guess it would be nice to know if anyone else here gets actual pain from their anxiety, I'm so confused, medication doesn't help because I don't think there's anything wrong with me but it feels real!"
4065,I had been on Citalopram medication for almost all 10 of those years until perhaps 2/3 months ago when I forced myself to come off them after being sick and tired of drugging myself to no real gain.
4066,So here I am 2/3 months later with maybe only a 10% increase in the depression and anxiety I had whilst on medication.
4067,"I can't emphasise enough how anxious I am about doctors surgeries and hospitals, when I was on meds I had to go to the doctors and the 1 hr it would take to get there, see the doctor and leave would exhaust me mentally and physically."
4068,"I had taken a stock pile of my medication with me, and whilst in Japan it ran out, it didn't have a massive effect on me, I continued my journey with Kyoto as my goal."
4069,"(That's another thing about coming off these meds; on the meds I felt nothing couldn't cry about anything, couldn't give a rat's ass if your grandmother died."
4070,"I am sorry I have written so much


TLDR; 10 years of anxiety relating to health issues, been on meds most of them, just come off them, going to Japan in 4 months."
4071,EDIT: I should probably mention that in Japan a lot of SSRI's (and what we may term normal anxiety and depression medication) are banned so this was a big part of why I came off the meds.
4072,So there is the added anxiety of what could I do if I did 'need' meds whilst I'm in Japan?
4073,I'm not under any medical care or receiving medication.
4074,I am always weary to take new meds and was wondering if anyone has experience with it?
4075,"So unfortunately, the doctors thought the meds were working when they weren't, and they called me to justify myself in front of a jury of five doctors why I wanted to ""stop complying with the treatment."""
4076,"(I got off the meds after I left the facility)

Fast forward 6 years, I'm finally in my last semester of uni, and struggling hard."
4077,I realized I need to try meds again in addition to therapy by last October.
4078,I'm actually really scared of taking meds again so I wanted a doc that is as empathetic and competent as possible.
4079,I made the appointment because I recently relocated and needed to get my performance anxiety medicine filled.
4080,The medicine box has been filling up quite a lot these years.
4081,"medication is out of the question, and i really struggle with the techniques ppl tell me."
4082,"I couldn't remember all of the medications I've tried, which frustrated her."
4083,Im not on any meds btw
4084,I was going to the doctors in a couple of weeks anyway to ask to be put onto medication for my depression (tried a year without and it just wasn't working with CBT alone) is this something I should bring up?
4085,He has been given medications now.
4086,"I FINALLY got myself on medication - the first one worked, it's called Celexa (citalopram)."
4087,Took about 3 weeks for my body to start reacting to the medicine.
4088,I am a HUGE advocate for medication.
4089,"Just don't stop taking the medicine, even after you feel normal again."
4090,I am on medication  for it but it takes a while to kick in.
4091,Are meds the answer or can I beat this without it?
4092,I've been tapering off of pain medication I've been on for 7 years over the last year and a half and i finally completely discontinued it 2 weeks ago.
4093,"I have a very long history with anxiety and other mental health issues, but have not had to deal with them over the period of time on the pain medication as it kind of ""fixed"" me."
4094,I missed a medication check with my psychiatrist and won't be able to get a refill (if he authorizes it) until later in the week.
4095,I came home once we were done with studying and I told my mom that I panicked and (after more than just this situation occurring in the past) and she just told me that I need to cope better when I am sure that I need some form of medication.
4096,I've talked to my therapist about it and he is very so so about giving it to a 17 year old as he isn't sure of what would happen based on the fact that the medication is tested on adults and not teenagers or children.
4097,"In some ways I can't even tell if my anxiety is better or worse since stopping medication, all I know is some days are good and some are terrible."
4098,"My question was, is there any meds that have a similar effect on anxiety that alcohol does?"
4099,"You were forced to sit on a couch all day, and could not move aside from walking to get your medication which was like, 5 steps away, walking to the dining hall, or walking to bed/bathroom."
4100,"I have a doctor(psychologist)  but they do not help only prescribe more meds (seroquil,busiprone,abilify,lexapro) nothing seems to help i only get the side effects."
4101,"So he ups my Wellbutrin to 150mg, but won't give me any anxiety medication."
4102,"I go to see my psychiatrist on Monday, and I'm terrified he still won't give me any medication for my anxiety."
4103,How do I get him to see that I need some medicine?
4104,Is it normal for doctors to not prescribe anxiety medicine until the second visit?
4105,"I was on *way too many* medications, yadda yadda, nothing worked, I began smoking marijuana, nothing has helped me quite like marijuana has."
4106,"One medicine for each and every issue, it's incredible."
4107,I currently take depression medicine and am going to talk to my Doctor for anxiety medicine.
4108,I've been told by several doctors that I should be on medication to control my anxiety.
4109,"Unfortunately for me, one of the big sources of anxiety for me is my health, and I know that prescription medications are detrimental to your health."
4110,"Another big source of anxiety for me is my weight, and I've heard that lots of anxiety medications cause people to gain weight for some reason."
4111,Has anybody had success with anxiety medication (either natural/alternative or prescription) WITHOUT gaining weight or having any other negative health-related side-effects?
4112,"But with the level and extremity of my anxiety, I know that I need help in the form of medication."
4113,"Edit: I'm 102lbs, female, 18, 5ft5in, and on no medication."
4114,Been on the meds consistently for many years.
4115,I have an appointment with my new doctor next week and I am wondering if he will continue my medication.
4116,"I have to scrape money just for an appt, which runs me around $50 for a medication visit."
4117,We both agree I probably need more expensive meds but he knows I have an extremely limited budget.
4118,"The most recent meds in that regard did not work and I had to stop taking them because they were making me worse, which I didn't think was possible."
4119,So I am not on any meds for depression because it's a waste of money.
4120,"It makes it to where the terrible feelings don't even come across my mind, but it would be nice if I didn't have to rely on any medicine."
4121,Was this medication related or not?
4122,"She up-ed her meds, but nothing seems to be helping."
4123,I take medications for my anxiety but sometimes it's just too much.
4124,"I think I should probably have been put on an anti-anxiety medication rather than an antidepressant, but I was too fucking anxious while talking to the psyche to speak up about it."
4125,"I don't know if it's the meds or just a coincidence, but I'm scared to up my dosage like I'm supposed to, because if it is the meds I don't want to make it worse."
4126,I am going to a GP tomorrow to talk about medication options.
4127,"I started taking some meds, and it took a while but I found some that worked for me."
4128,"Still taking meds, though a lower dosage, and my wife has been amazingly supportive, even though I'm sure she can't totally understand what I'm going through."
4129,"No medication has worked and we have never found the ""right"" therapist."
4130,"I had been wanting to stop taking my meds because I was doing so well, and when I couldn't reschedule my doctors appointment within my work schedule I decided to self wean myself off."
4131,I've been on meds since age 22 and they seem to really keep it at bay.
4132,I don't want to go on medication if I can help it.
4133,"Should I tough it out until it ""kicks in"" or get a medicine change?"
4134,"My goal was to get a referral to a psychiatrist and ultimately get medicated, as I was convinced id need medicine."
4135,"I have the atarax (primarily an allergy medicine, I've discovered) a fair chance, but it does nothing for me whatsoever but knock me out and cure my runny nose that leaks all winter."
4136,"I've seen a therapist and will see her today as well, and I'll be transferred to her psychiatrist in a week or two and she will have authority over my medication."
4137,I'm a scientist and know/read/watch a lot about biology and medicine.
4138,"How many ""there is nothing wrong"" diagnoses can you get, despite real, physical, constant problems before your doctor (who prescribes your psych meds) thinks you have an issue?"
4139,"How do you deal with what might be a real issue with a doctor who ""understands how you feel"" and ups your anxiety meds?"
4140,I want to ask for meds but my mom has Depression and feels very upset that I might be sick like her.
4141,"I was started on medication (Paxil) almost a week ago to cope with my anxiety, but it really hasn't made a huge impact yet."
4142,"I [f] have suffered from severe anxiety and depression for five years, and have been on a few different medications for it."
4143,I started taking these meds late 2011 and stopped on my own last December.
4144,I miss the carefree days and disneyfied state of mind when I was on meds.
4145,One thing I was told in CBT is meds target your emotions and physical symptoms but not the thoughts and behavior.
4146,I'd rather not puke every morning until my body gets used to the medication.
4147,Im under the impression i can go in tell them all i know and bam they diagnose me and i get some medication all in one session.
4148,So far he hasn't had too many panic attacks since we've gotten together and apparently he is supposed to start weening off of medication (according to him and his psychiatrist).
4149,"I support him in whatever he chooses to do, and he's talk to me about weening off of medication since he hasn't had panic attacks or bad anxiety in a very long time."
4150,"After surviving on applesauce for 5 days, I told the doctor I couldn't hold out anymore, and we agreed no more meds for now."
4151,"To clarify, I never had attacks this randomly or this frequently before the meds; the ones I had were uncomfortable, but milder, and they had a *purpose*, like not wanting to go to a job interview or not wanting to do a math test."
4152,"I was only on the meds for 10 days, but they've haunted me ever since."
4153,"I don't WANT to try meds again, it's too scary and I don't want to be dependent on them."
4154,"I don't want to blame anyone, but in a way, I feel wronged, like someone should have led me toward therapy first and meds should have waited."
4155,"I really don't want to take medication for anything, especially after seeing a friends life almost end over constant medicating, but having a xanax was the greatest feeling ever."
4156,"Or do I need medication (I hate drugs and side effects and not being myself, so I hope that is not an option) 
  I just don't know what to do, but something isn't right."
4157,The medication has helped a little.
4158,"But they're making more and more inhalant medications these days, so surely they could work out something relatively fool proof."
4159,I have also scheduled an appointment with my psychiatrist for Monday to discuss this incident with him and adjust my medications.
4160,I visited the ER and they informed me that it's highly unlikely the medication had anything to do with that feeling.
4161,My only experience with not taking my meds is that about a year ago I had a seven day Rx for something that interacted with Celexa and the pharmacist told me to just skip my Celexa for that week.
4162,"I can tell the medication has helped, especially as of recently."
4163,Then last night I had an epiphany: *what if it's actually a sudden reaction to one of my medications?
4164,He said that meloxicam (the medication I thought was causing the trouble) can aggravate asthma (I have excercise and heat/cold induced asthma).
4165,"I was taking my meds right before work so by the time I got there, they were starting to work and hence I thought I was reacting to something in the air."
4166,"Since then, I've been on and off with meds."
4167,"In october I started seeing a CBT therapist and after a couple of months stepping down with the meds, I today decided to stop with them."
4168,I finally got a PCP and have spoken to her about it and she will be seeking me a therapist and spoke about anxiety medication.
4169,I'm not currently taking any other meds or supplements except glucosamine for my joints.
4170,"I started a therapy and have a second meeting with my doctor for medication in a week, but I highly doubt I'll ever be fine again, or that I'll ever get excited, or get attached to anything, because I know it will be gone."
4171,"I've never taken medication, nor have I spoke to any doctors or sought any help with this."
4172,"No medications, never diagnosed, etc."
4173,I am not on any meds.
4174,My meds make my stomach hurt.
4175,"I do have epilepsy however, and I'm on medication for that, and that's probably part of the reason why I've never moved out before now."
4176,"She has had multiple counseling sessions, and a number of medications including Prozac, Zoloft, Xanax, Vibryd, Propanolol and Buspar but nothing seems to work."
4177,I'm not 100% cured but there is a clear way to get over this nasty thing without meds and therapy.
4178,"I don't think meds are an option since I'm still nursing and we're trying for another baby (I would take Xanax before I was pregnant, but haven't had them since)."
4179,I have some good medication but this is still a possibility.
4180,"Having an alcoholic drink is not an option, but I do have 'as needed' medication that has a similar relaxing effect (I'll probably take one right before)."
4181,"Also, I've never liked the therapy portions of treatment, and I'd rather just try medication, and I know anyone I go to will recommend therapy in conjunction with medication."
4182,Well one day before she came over I decided enough was enough went to the medicine cabinet and took one of my dads 100mg viagra.
4183,I have to take anti anxiety meds for.
4184,Recently diagnosed with ADHD I can't start taking the medication because I get a panic attack and make myself throw it up.
4185,I get a panic attack when I take my anti anxiety medication.
4186,"I get a panic attack when I take any medication at all now...

TL;DR - took viagra can no longer take medication without either intentionally throwing them up from fear or just not take them."
4187,I also have been given anxiety meds before but i ran out and forgot to replace them then i was to scared to go ask for more.
4188,"LONG POST AHEAD lol

Well after years of anxiety I have finally made an appointment with my general doctor to either recommend a psychiatrist/medicine that will help."
4189,I know and have been lectured by family as to how foolish it is to take prescription medication without a doctor writing the prescription and finally decided to make an appointment.
4190,"I left school and transferred to CC

I talked to a psychologist for a few weeks but never pursued medication."
4191,I have been prescribed medicine for years but I believe I function pretty normal without them therefore I don't take them most of the time.
4192,The prescribed me a medicine and sent me home with orders to see my doctor Monday.
4193,Since then the medicine hasn't done much for me..
4194,"I'm willing to try anything, even constant medicine at this point."
4195,"Part of me wants to wean off the medication, because I don't like the idea of relying on it."
4196,"How can I tell whether its the medication helping me, or if I have actually developed the coping skills?"
4197,"Before I was eager to discontinue the medication, but now that it's time, I'm scared."
4198,I can't take medication because I'm afraid meds will affect my body in a harmful way.
4199,"I really want to ask a psychiatrist about medication, but when I mentioned this to my mom she started freaking out at me and yelling that ""we should just go back home if coming here is going to make us go crazy""."
4200,For anyone who is on meds for anxiety; does it help?
4201,"I've lived with derealization and depersonalization for a few years now, since withdrawing from benzos and other psych meds."
4202,She's 16 years old and on anxiety medication and she has panic attacks because of her mother.
4203,What I would really like is some opinions on self-medication: what has worked for you?
4204,Which medication has the fewest side-effects?
4205,"I will either source the medication myself, or attend one or two sessions with a psychologist (which is ridiculously expensive) and obtain them legally."
4206,"I haven't dealt with it in a long time, as meds have definitely gotten rid of it, but here it is creeping back again - quite badly today."
4207,Or should I just stick to the meds?
4208,"For myself, however, I don't like the idea of being on antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications."
4209,I am on meds that seem to have no effect.
4210,"Hi all,

For the last week I've been stressed, and I run on meds that help with anxiety."
4211,I got given a script for medication to try help with my anxiety today.
4212,"I take medicine for it, smoking mj helps a ton but only for temporary relief, im going to college soon, and I feel like I can't do this, im so pissed off at my disorder."
4213,I don't take medication (besides valarien root) ever since Ativan turned me into an angry vomiting monster.
4214,"I should start off with saying I get help professionally, I've been prescribed medication which I take, and I've also been diagnosed with ADHD (which I also have medication for) and bi-polar disorder."
4215,"My medication seemed to really help with anxiety, in just taking the edge off of everything and making life more manageable."
4216,"For the average person with a common textbook medical condition it's all good, they take their medication as prescribed and they go on their way."
4217,About 6 years ago I had an episode where my ability to breath was greatly reduced and the standard allergy meds weren't doing it for me.
4218,I don't know if getting off meds completely will put things back to normal but it's worth a shot.
4219,"I think I need medication, not sure what kind is right for me."
4220,It's a check up appointment but I was hoping that I could talk to him about the depression/anxiety I've been experiencing and get myself on some meds.
4221,"I've been seeing a therapist for about two months now and he hasn't recommended that I try medication yet, and I was hesitant to go that route for a long time but I'm just sick of this."
4222,"I'm unmedicated, because the thought of having to find a doctor, tell him my problems, and go through the trial-and-error process of getting on medication freaks me out."
4223,"Can't take meds cause they make me have an anxiety attack, and if I had to take them night, forget that, I'd force myself to throw them back up."
4224,"I started going to see my university counselor, and after a few sessions she set me up with an appointment to see a psychiatrist and said medication may be beneficial."
4225,"about starting anxiety medication because I've heard it is really addictive, but I also really can't stand constantly being at battle with my anxiety."
4226,"Links about the drug:

[Wikipedia - Propranolol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propranolol)

[Patient.co.uk - Propranolol](http://www.patient.co.uk/medicine/Propranolol.htm)"
4227,"Now I am sitting at home without any anxiety meds, and found out my favorite Doctor is on vacay for 2 weeks."
4228,I don't want to be on meds the rest of my life.
4229,I decided to try other medications because I didn't like how Venlafaxine ruined my libido.
4230,After those two failings he gave me a prescription for lorazepam as needed and I am taking time to let my body get of all the medications and take stock of where my anxiety and depression are now.
4231,"I do not want to go back on SSRI's personally at this point in my life, I'd like to work through my anxiety and use exercise/yoga and meditation and have some time to learn about myself when I'm not on medication."
4232,For the first couple days off medication last week I felt really good but I think I'm just having bad reaction to the lorazepam or something.
4233,Any advice on what to ask doctors about so I can get medication of specific assistance related to the nausea?
4234,"eventually, i got put on meds, and I'm thinking of increasing my dose once i see my therapist."
4235,"the meds have helped a little, but not all that much."
4236,"I'm not as freaked out, i guess, and going to school is a little easier, but i know meds take time and stuff."
4237,"In the ER they started giving me some pain meds through an IV and I was starting to notice my heart pound, I thought that it was due to whatever it was they were giving me and started to panic (not being able to get up and leave can be a major trigger for me as well as medical stuff in general)."
4238,I'm on meds.
4239,"Anyway, currently, my daily medications are 300mg Effexor XR (yes 300mg), Wellbutrin 300mg, 2-6mg Xanax as needed, and 30-60mg Adderall as needed."
4240,"At that time, my mom was obviously still in control of my medical affairs, so she recommended that I opt out of any medication and seek natural remedies and/or therapy."
4241,"My doctor told me that while there's no treatment for DPD alone, anxiety medications could help with the symptoms."
4242,"Again, I was hesitant to take any medication, as psychiatric drugs have always been a fear of mine."
4243,"She prescribed me with a medication that I was only to take on an as-needed basis... On the ""bad days"" 

So, we're just about caught up to now, the medication has helped the episodes some, and I feel as though the meds in combination with self-help techniques are really helping me work through some issues."
4244,"Every doctor I've ever seen has refused to comment on the tics, aside from the occasional ""it might be a medication side effect."""
4245,"No sorts of therapy or medication are of any help whatsoever, aside from the benzos every now and then and only for a few minutes after they've kicked in."
4246,She immediately suggested I meet with a psychologist who can prescribe me anti-anxiety medication.
4247,"So for anyone who has come off the medication, have you had any experience with this?"
4248,"Is it my mind trying to cope with issues that were ""brushed under the rug"" by my medication?"
4249,Or is there something in my neuro-chemstry of my brain that has fundamentally snapped and I'll always need the medication?
4250,I'd prob get more fine if it look a couple of minutes for me to sleepy then I fall asleep but it sounds like you'll be forced to shut your eyes from the medicine.
4251,I am in therapy and on medication.
4252,I self harm and abuse medication.
4253,I've suffered from anxiety and depression ever since high school and have been on medication for it about 5 years (on &amp; off).
4254,I noticed that when I'm feeling my best I will start becoming very laxed about taking my medicine.
4255,I have had a pattern of doing this ever since I first was prescribed any medication.
4256,"I know its not good, and that the levels of medication in my system can never stay consistent because I do this, but its like I cannot help myself."
4257,I'm wondering if medication would help any?
4258,"I've had anxiety all my life, and have never taken any meds for a prolonged period of time (ativan for a week one time)."
4259,Recently my doctor made some adjustments to my medicine as my depression is getting out of control.
4260,"I was originally on a small dose of Ritalin (5mg) in addition to my other meds, but he is trying me on Concerta (18 mg)."
4261,"Im 22 now and it comes and goes, I have been on meds and I have tried Ativan which helps but I would like something without drugs."
4262,Also I will be consulting with my doctor in Canada and likely be purchasing my medication through an online Canadian pharmacy to have it mailed here.
4263,"My counselor and doctor (for medication) had both mentioned looking into it, and today it was made official."
4264,This explains why no medication ever made the anxiety completely better.
4265,I've stupidly let myself run out of medication because the past few months I've been too nervous to make a phone call.
4266,"I called to leave a message and ask for a prescription refill, called to schedule an appointment, called back because I realized I needed to reschedule, and then just now answered a call from the medication nurse, who told me she's calling in my prescription now."
4267,I found a way to deal with the panic attacks without medication.
4268,"I hadn't noticed any significant changes in my anxiety, and though it hasn't been a long enough period to make a definite decision about if the meds work for me, it has been long enough that there should've been some progress... in fact, I was experiencing heightened anxiety before falling asleep that made it more difficult to fall/stay asleep."
4269,"I guess my question is: is anyone else taking Buspar or a Prozac/Buspar combo, and does anyone have any suggestions for how I could improve my sleeping with these meds?"
4270,"](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/35aqke/if_youre_thinking_that_youre_wanting_to_quit_your/)

That was a month ago, and since then I have been slowly weaned off my meds."
4271,"So remember people, if you're thinking about quitting your meds or thinking you don't need them any more, please please PLEASE do yourself a favor and talk to your doctor first."
4272,"I was also having anxiety over taking the medication to help my anxiety (stupid, I know) so I stopped taking it."
4273,"I thought at first it was because I was taking my meds at night, so I've been taking it in the morning instead."
4274,"I'm going to schedule another session for next semester, and I want to at least open the possibility of medication, but I don't want to get shut down or treated like some kind of drug addict."
4275,"I haven't been takings meds like I should, and school has always been the biggest trigger."
4276,"I've tried taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication, but the anti-depressants never seemed to work, and the anti-anxiety meds (xanax and klonopin) led me to abuse the medicine, so I stopped taking prescription medicine altogether--the only time I take medicine now is if it's an antibiotic or something."
4277,I fear talking to a counselor and I fear taking medication.
4278,"I was on meds, it helped and I stopped taking the meds after a couple years and I have been ""fine"" since, for the last 6 or 7 years."
4279,I considered seeing a doc for some more meds to help keep be balanced but I didn't and my anxiety just went away.
4280,"Either way I am unable to take medicine for the time being, since I am pregnant."
4281,I'm just wondering if there are other solutions to anxiety without medicine.
4282,Can anyone recommend a solution or a medication I can take to calm myself down?
4283,I'm someone who doesn't want to rely on meds but I know I should probably start seeing someone.
4284,"bottom line, these meds take time to work."
4285,Also no I am not on any meds.
4286,She took the place of medication.
4287,I stopped taking my medication because I never remembered to take it on time.
4288,I got into an argument with my mom about taking my medication and ended up throwing it all away.
4289,I can't afford more expensive doctors to keep trying all kinds of medications that might not even help.
4290,I have been feeling really uncomfortable around people and my medication for SPD seems like it isn't working anymore.
4291,Going to see the psych nurse tomorrow so hopefully she can adjust my meds or tell me something to make me feel better or whatever.
4292,"I'm back on medication for anxiety and a tic disorder (20 mg Citalopram and valium as needed)

4302,"I'm a little nervous about taking the medication because of side affects and such, but I'm trying to be hopeful that it will help."
4303,"Which makes it confusing to me, because he was on medication for similar issues, a few years ago."
4304,"I know everyone responds to medications differently, but what were your experiences with Zoloft?"
4305,"The meds seem to be working, but there are some side effects that are fairly minor, but I am concerned none the less."
4306,I don't think that these issues are interfering with my life enough to justify going on medication.
4307,"Even without knowing that she kept bringing up medications, and I kept telling her I didn't want to do them."
4308,"I'm kind of worried that the new therapist will try to convince me to go on meds like the other one did, but I'm better at communicating now than I was when I was a kid so I don't think she will do that."
4309,Does anyone have success stories without using medication?
4310,"I'm not on any medication, and have only ever been under a general anaesthetic for dental work so I was completely passed out."
4311,"She's had this for about two years, and her previous medications worked fine until she waned herself off the medications without telling her doctor."
4312,"She ended up in the emergency room and, to make a long story short, her psychiatrist prescribed her new medications including Buspar to prevent anxiety and Xanax to deal with anxiety attacks when she gets them."
4313,I've never experienced it before and don't really know what derealization feels like... but I do know that it's a withdrawal symptom of SSRI meds and I've been experiencing that withdrawal effects a lot the past few weeks.
4314,"I don't want to go back right now, they won't find anything, they won't give me the medicine I need."
4315,I was on meds that I liked and starting seeing a therapist a little under a month ago.
4316,"*I'm not on any kind of medication (used to be on Zoloft, but quit because I didn't like how it affected my sex-life, now I just meditate daily), I'm a 25 year old male, and I have social anxiety disorder, and maybe some self-loathing issues."
4317,"I've tried (I think) 3 types of medication early on but all 3 made me vomit constantly, and one made me hallucinate (all of this I think is probably linked to the anx' rather than the meds)."
4318,I was afraid to start taking my medication for months because my anxiety revolves around health problems.
4319,"So if you are sitting on medication like I was, you have nothing to lose."
4320,I was so afraid of being on meds my whole life but now I feel like it's only a temporary thing and I'll get better on my own and be able to cope without getting into my deep depressive state.
4321,Is there anything else as awesome as this medication?
4322,So im wondering if anyone here has taken cold medicine and had any bad reactions?
4323,**edit**  We have an appointment for 10am tomorrow morning to get his medication changed.
4324,"I'm not on medication for my depression, which I need but can't afford due to this fear that if I get on it, he'll fall apart and I'll have wasted money we need to survive, I don't have a car despite desperately needing one in order to get out of the house on a normal basis (he'd stay home 24/7 if he could; I'd be out 10 hours a day if I was able to be), and even though I hate my job I feel like I can't even start looking for another one right now."
4325,"Although I seem to have overcome most of my depression on my own, I still haven't beat it, and my anxiety has only worsened, which is why I decided to go on medication."
4326,"I'll see whether he thinks I should continue with the medication, or if I should try a new SSRI or possibly an SNRI."
4327,"I'm not just going to rely on meds, but I would like to know what would be a good med I could suggest to my doctor if I still don't feel any benefit from the Lexapro when I see him."
4328,"as she still hasn't really found a way to deal with her condition (no meds, and currently no therapy - she has tried a couple of therapists but they weren't the ""right fit"")."
4329,I am wondering if taking the medication at night will help?
4330,hey guys im gona be talking to a doctor tommorow about meds.
4331,I don't pay for treatment or medication and I've never had the same psychiatrist for more than 2 appointments.
4332,"I've been officially diagnosed, but I'm not on any medication and have just been doing CBT."

What I've done so far:
Googled anxiety, came out with webmd.com."
4339,I have not started any medication nor have I gotten any professional help with anything yet.
4340,I feel like I would stop trying to get better once the meds make me feel better.
4341,"I have been on a variety of meds, for a variety of disorders I was thought to have had (bipolar, depression, briefly ADD), all of which ended up being contradicted by different professionals."
4342,"Looking forward to your thoughts and experience on this... 

Just wanted to add, I have tried:

Depression meds

Bipolar meds

ADD (just vyvanse)

CBT and/or DBT (works a little bit)

Exercise (it helps some, but only temporarily)

Vedic meditation (helps a little, but is very time consuming - 40 minutes a day)

Psychotherapy"
4343,I'm curious to hear how this medication helped others with their physical symptoms.
4344,"I faild at that and I have failed at life and all I want to do is kill myself , but I would probably fail at that to because im a coward im getting therapy and im on mood stabalizer pills but I stopped taking all my meds in hopes that I have a serious break down and just get shot by the cops."
4345,I've been on various anxiety/depression meds since I was 23.
4346,Has anyone ever gotten off their meds?
4347,"Hey guys, I'm here asking about what you guys might be taking for meds and if you drink, how you are working with that."
4348,"It would be nice to have some meds around to level it out, and although I do keep a Xanax or two around for emergency reasons, there's a bit of an issue."
4349,"However, there are other meds out there."
4350,I was working with a fantastic therapist at the time who suggested I may need medication because all the work we were doing together wasn't helping my anxiety.
4351,"](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-km8O6sY5Rmo/T4oLwpZb_YI/AAAAAAAAS0U/wLeYbqHx3zU/s400/loveisnotenough.jpg) I think many people can feel like a failure if they have to resort to medication when they shouldn't, especially when people suggest they just ""try harder"" to feel better."
4352,Now I'm just kicking myself for not seeking meds out sooner!
4353,I finally made the decision to talk to a doctor about getting medication.
4354,I've tried so many non-medicine routes and nothing has helped.
4355,I just read up on anti-anxiety meds and how they work.
4356,What has been your experience with meds?
4357,I'm nervous the meds will make me feel this way.
4358,I started taking medication this year to stop it and everything was fine.
4359,I got better and stupidly stopped taking my medication.
4360,I'm back on my meds and I want to take two pills rather than one but I'm guessing that is a terrible idea.
4361,"and if so, how has it helped you compared to other medicines you have been on."
4362,"Fast forward to my 20's, I got on meds, went to therapy and gained weight..too much (5' 1"" and 153 lbs.)"
4363,"I take medication for depression and anxiety - I have been diagnosed with both, however I was not on medication last year and only went back on it after I had my daughter."
4364,"I honestly have no idea what is in my medical record, really, I see my GP once a year and the depression and anxiety are well managed with medication (Wellbutrin for depression, BuSpar for anxiety, a very small dose)."
4365,"If it would make a big difference, I'd just wait it out a year or so (I'm planning to go off the medication, I just haven't been to see my doctor since January as I have a really hard time getting off work, etc.)"
4366,"I am on anti deppressants and anti-anxiety medication, but they didn't really seem to help last year."
4367,"I've never been to a psychiatrist, knowing they would put me on countless medications that probably won't even work."
4368,My therapist offered me medication for unrelated anxiety and I turned it down and I really regret that right now.
4369,"I have no idea why, but I have been through situations since then that would normally make me have monster panic attacks and need meds, but this time they had virtually no effect."
4370,Has anyone else been on this combo of meds?
4371,There is no improvement outside of taking the meds.
4372,"I'm trying meditation/mindfulness, exercise/yoga and have been on several meds (right now 1 mg of Klonopin and 15 mg of Lexapro) and nothing seems to help."
4373,"I am NOT on ADD/ADHD meds (nor have I ever been tested/diagnosed as such), and don't really want to at this point in my life (I have a bit of an irrational fear that if I do go on meds, I'll just like it too much...sort of like an exhaulted Red Bull OMG I FEEL AWESOME kind of high...which I am aware doesn't really make sense)."
4374,"I always thought it would go away on it's own, so I didn't seek therapy or meds for years."
4375,I've been working with therapists and medication(s) over the past couple years to come to terms with my depression and anxiety with varying levels of success.
4376,(Bonus points for really bad fear of failure) I've got an appointment with my meds doc tomorrow morning and a therapist appt.
4377,"* don't want to have to take medication for my entire life just to feel ""normal""."
4378,Should I try this for a month before diving into medication?
4379,I've since switched medications (I'm on Lexapro now) but I'm just curious.
4380,"From what he and his mother have told me, before he started on the meds, he would cut and burn himself, as well as become even more withdrawn and irritable with those around him."
4381,"I don't want to force un needed meds on him, but I'm getting worried."
4382,I'm not meds because they don't work.
4383,This was not like this before I started on this medication.
4384,I don't want to change medications altogether because effexor works for me and I've tinkered around with ssri's and ssnri's since I was 13...not about to start that up again.
4385,"I mean, I've been taking these meds since I'm 12 and I'll probably die because of liver failure by 40, so why bother right?"
4386,"I can't afford a therapist (not even with a sliding scale payment) and medication doesn't help me, so I'm pretty much on my own."
4387,I was prescribed a anti anxiety medication but the problem with it is that it made my stomach burn.
4388,"I started Cipralex a few days ago and I've been getting massive headaches which are causing me even more anxiety because I didn't want to be on the medication in the first thing place...basically I'm not sure if I'm causing myself all this anxiety and thus these headaches because I keep telling myself that this medication causes headaches but after researching it,  it mihht be the actual medication that does cause headaches so I'm really confused in all..."
4389,"Any advice on how to deal with these side effects would be realllly appreciated or how to deal with headaches in general without taking advil cause I Dont want the medications to interfere 

PM me if you prefer it please and sorry for this text that most probably doesn't make sense."
4390,"I also don't want to be get diagnose and prescribed meds and have frequent appointments, because my parents are guaranteed to find out since I'm on their insurance."
4391,Even with ED meds.
4392,"I'm at the point now where I'm going to ask to be referred to a psychiatrist to get medication, because I'd rather be totally sedated than deal with this for even a second longer."
4393,"I had that prescription refilled at the start of January (my second refill) and since then I've been feeling a lot of the side effects I felt when I first started the medication (indigestion, strange dreams/trouble sleeping, slight disconnect with reality at times) although maybe a little less severely than before."
4394,I also have been feeling anxious which had really been helped by the medication before.
4395,Has anything like this happened to anyone else here (even with a different medication).
4396,Does anyone else have anxiety about taking medication?
4397,I do not presently take any medications for my anxiety though previously I have taken zoloft (3 years) and wellbutrin/trazodone (about 5 months).
4398,I feel negatively towards medication and resentful of the idea that I might be better off with it since I do not see why I should have to rely on medications while other people get to walk around enjoying life without them.
4399,"First night of a new medication, but it is supposed to make me drowsy."
4400,"I did half heartedly try some medications, I was pretty much against though, because my mother has abused and has been addicted to these types of medications for as long as I can remember."
4401,"He always wanted and pressured me to take all these different sorts of meds( mainly for depression, he was convinced I was suffering from depression as well as the anxiety, but I don't believe I was/am) and I hated them, none of the ones I tried helped me at all, granted I didn't stick to any of them that long (besides the adivan because I didn't have to take that one daily, but since moving 8 months ago I haven't even had any of those) for fear of becoming addicted/abusing meds like my mother."
4402,"I guess my question is, do any of you survive this without meds?"
4403,"I don't like the idea of going on new medications, but I am definitely open to therapy."
4404,"**About me** 

27, male, agoraphobia (at least thats what they said years ago), no medication anymore, germany

**What happened**

Almost eight years ago when I was about to finish my apprenticeship as an IT guy, I just passed out in the garden of my (ex)girlfriend for no real reason."
4405,"Tried so much (serveral therapies, medication), failed so often."
4406,My question to you Redditors is what medications and treatments do you use to help you function and make it through the day.
4407,"I've had some medical issues due to getting my gallbladder out a couple years ago, which I'm on medication for and its helping."
4408,I'm about to start taking Lexapro and i'm vaguely aware that the first month or so is when the medication can cause some nasty side effects.
4409,I'm trying to be as prepared as possible so if I start feeling nauseated or something i'll know its most likely the meds and not something more sinister.
4410,Within 3 days of taking his medication I saw a severe change in how he was treatin me.
4411,I'm wondering if anyone one here has been on and off a similar medication with similar side effects and how your life was affected.
4412,I take the medicines that I NEED to balance out the chemical deficiencies in my brain.
4413,"I'm willing to try everything, except paying or medicine."
4414,"I've seen a doctor who has prescribed some low dose medicine, but I've been reluctant to take it as I haven't been a person to take medicine for much of anything."
4415,"breathing techniques, thoughts, meds...
Also, if you didn't have any of these and you stayed in the area when you were having the symptoms(panic attack) what happened to you?"
4416,I have ativan for panic attacks and I've tried taking other meds but they make me too sick.
4417,TLDR:Mixed messages and emotions about my meds.
4418,"Things I have tried (believe me I am proactive at trying to conquer this fucking shit)

- Zoloft (Currently taking)
- Celexa
- Effexor
- Therapy
- Putting myself outside of my comfort zone/""out there""
- Never making excuses to not do something social

None of these medications have seemed to do anything and I have a strong suspicion they're probably more or less placebos."
4419,Is this an indication that maybe her medication is too low dose?
4420,"He was my medicine, and the sheer idea of losing that, and then it happening, sent me over to the realm of the unfeeling."
4421,"I tried to branch out relationship-wise, thinking that was the solution, and that maybe I could find another medicine."
4422,"I'm hoping one day to completely stop taking any medication, (Still the lowest prescription of Lexapro) but I know I will always be affected in some ways."
4423,I'm not on any medication currently and I'm on a waiting list for therapy.
4424,The ER doc gave me meds - Ativan and Buspirone.
4425,"I saw a psychologist, and will continue that, but it is really hard to find a psychiatrist to help get my meds sorted out - they all have waiting lists for literally months out."
4426,"I don't take medication because I want to get pregnant again (strangely -- I do LOVE being a mom and caring for my son, and I want more kids)."
4427,"Since we've been on the medicine, his sex drive has certainly decreased somewhat but mine has become nonexistent."
4428,So I guess I don't know how much of our lack of passion can be attributed to the meds since I felt something with that other guy.
4429,"Lately my anxiety and panic have been acting up, I have a substance use therapist that helps a lot and am in the process of getting a dedicated anxiety therapist but I don’t want to go on medication."
4430,"The insert it came with listed a bunch of medicines I've never heard of as well as ibuprofen, St Johns Wort and ""some cold medications."""
4431,"But due to money, I treated with my meds at home (tons of benedryls, Xanax, Gax-X, 2 halves of Vicodin over 8 hrs, plus ice bags and breathing bag for hyperventilation) — it was HELL from 5mt after I ate some of the yogurt (lunchtime) until about 11pm last night."
4432,"They called back, and I'd called them a few weeks ago with similar issues, only I said it was panic and maybe crazy drugs (as doc was giving me various crazy meds over last few months, but I just wanted stability, as before I got sick with c-dif)."
4433,"So you do exposure therapy and face your fear, letting yourself be afraid without anxiety medication or alcohol, and then that fear goes away."
4434,So yesterday I forgot to take my AM and PM medications.
4435,I've always had performance anxiety with sex which I know exacerbates my sexual dysfunction but I'm getting so frustrated with the additional side effects of these medications.
4436,I'm withdrawing off Lexapro for the third time and I was wondering how people managed to live life off meds.
4437,"Then I got a job and a new apartment and I thought ""Oh life will be good now, I can totally get off these meds."""
4438,What I'm more concerned about is how people manage to stay off medication long-term.
4439,":(

So, I'm going for a good ol' clean start with medication."
4440,Met my current gf during my hardest year and was prescribed Lexapro 10 MG to go along with my stimulant medication.
4441,feel like a failure because i told my mom everything was fine and the medication was working fine.
4442,"* After seeing her, she suggested putting me on Zoloft starting at 0.25mg, but I wanted therapy sessions before I started taking medication."
4443,"You go to the doctor, they get you on some new medicine."
4444,Maybe the medicine doesn't work.
4445,Maybe you got to try a different medicine.
4446,"My hands have been shaking all day (despite taking anti-anxiety meds), and the adrenaline surges will not stop."
4447,I have taken medication in the past (last time maybe 6 mos ago) but had to stop because the side effects were kicking my ass.
4448,"I've honestly avoided taking anti-anxiety meds and anti-depressants, because they make me feel so tired throughout the day."
4449,"I've been to counseling, I'm afraid of actual medications, and my dad is my only soothing savior because he is a licensed mental health practitioner and knows how to handle the craziest of crazies."
4450,Is there any sort of emergency action that anxiety patients are able to take to get more medication even before they are eligible for a refill?
4451,"it started in 2011 and i got on meds ( 25mg of amitriptyline) in early 2012 and it was good for a while, I had my life back but it gets worse then gets slightly better then worse then slightly better... sometimes I leak a tiny bit."
4452,"I took medication to try and calm down, but nothing works."
4453,Going to try one last time to beat this thing without meds.
4454,Could it be because of my meds(Sertraline/Zoloft)?
4455,"Before I started taking medication for my depression and anxiety, I started becoming absolutely fearful everyday I was going to have to go to the doctor or hospital and get some sort of surgery."
4456,"Last week, 1 or 2 years of feeling pretty good on my meds, I found out I had to get an operation."
4457,"He is not on any medication btw and, until recently, has refused to even see a doctor."
4458,He is suppose to be seeing a doctor this Monday who will prescribe medication.
4459,"I'm not against medication in any sense, I just think maybe I haven't found the right one."
4460,"Got on new medication then taken off it, now can't eat at all, slowly going to starve to death....oh boy...so much fun."
4461,I refused to take Lexipro because I don't want to depend on medication like that.
4462,"Uh, not really sure where else to put this, but I just took an extra 50mg of my zoloft medication that I use for my anxiety."
4463,This round of exams in particular is pretty difficult because I *need* to pass everything to keep my provisional place in a graduate medicine program.
4464,How do you guys keep your head about you when you don't know if you are really messing up or if it is just the meds?
4465,"I was recently treated for depression with medication, and one of the side effects is anxiety, which I usually don't have to deal with very often."
4466,Fed up with how my life has only become worse on the medications after 2 straight years on clonezapam and almost 2 on celexa I stopped them cold turkey.
4467,Until last week its about 3 full months off the medicine and I had a serious panic attack that wound me up in the hospital.
4468,"Long story short, I have been off my meds for a few months now and am having a full on meltdown."
4469,"I am already in danger of losing my job due to my ""attitude"" lately and taking unscheduled time off will be the final straw.I need to get this doctor to put me on short-term disability while I get on some meds and get myself stabilized."
4470,Was wondering what you do that may help me other than the medications I'm on.
4471,I don't know how to communicate that my medication might need to be changed.
4472,I said OK and got the medication.
4473,"Has anyone experienced anything like this, on those meds or otherwise?"
4474,"I'm hoping to try some medicine for anxiety in late August, and I really hope that helps."
4475,A year ago when I started seeing a therapist I was again told I had GAD and mild OCD with regards to intrusive thoughts and also a panic disorder that developed since trying to go through this medication free.
4476,But if I do that wouldn't it be possible that my body may develop some resistance to it and make the medicine not work ?
4477,Would someone on anxiety meds just not even have a care about it?
4478,It is very frustrating and it feels like my meds aren't helping at all when before they were.
4479,"There will be guest speakers for relevant topics: medication, relationships, fitness, mindfulness, finances, etc."
4480,"With support, 1:1 counseling, independent learning and (in the past) multiple medications, I am now confident and getting up in front of groups like a rock-star nurse!"
4481,I'm less stressed already and the medicine hasn't even kicked in.
4482,"The thing is, when I was getting my prescription, shrink asked if I thought I needed some antidepressants too and I decided to try just xanax first, see if it helps and if it does, avoid additional ""unecessary"" medications."
4483,"and as a result.... just stay inside as long you can?~ What worked for you medication-wise because I feel like I've tried everything?~





(It might not help that I cancelled my last 3 appointments too.)"
4484,Uhhhh feel a little bit lightheaded... kinda woozy... maybe it was those meds I took... maybe it was my breakfast... maybe its low blood sugar... maybe its high blood pressure... maybe it's a stroke... maybe it's a heart attacks... my mind and heart start to race.
4485,Is there another way to get medication without a blood test?
4486,"i often worry (even post meds) that the chefs in a restaurant will mess with my food, or that certain food isnt cooked properly, or that some people are out to get me (not to an extreme but to a nuisance degree)"
4487,"For the past few months I have been getting weird spurts of anxiety and depression, when previously I have been fine for about 3 or 4 years on my medicine."
4488,"I've been to the doctor, she raised my meds for now, but is going to get me into a psych therapist to better prescribe."
4489,"I'm taking medicine: alprazolam and propranolol for my anxiety, to be taken when I need to perform academic tasks that require me to talk."
4490,"It's/I'm not as severe as some of what I've read here, and I'm kind of doubting my diagnosis in retrospect but I'm glad I have the option for the medicine, I guess."
4491,I don't take medication.
4492,"Despite meds and therapy I keep sliding down to where I am, unable to function at work and so afraid of failing little things that I always fail the big things."
4493,My doctor has really been encouraging me to try medication but it's never been something I've wanted to try.
4494,I have had a few friends who've reacted terribly to medications &amp; it's really put me off of the concept...
4495,So I'm basically crowdsourcing experiences with medications as treatment for anxiety and/or depression.
4496,"I have medicine, but try to head off these attacks before they occur!"
4497,I've been on medication but would like extra tips for calming myself down when i have one.
4498,"The gist of it is that I was laid of from my job and lost my medical insurance and thus lost my ability to get prescription meds, specifically Prozac."
4499,I've been off them for about two weeks and have noticed I've been experiencing [brain zaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome) and am just wondering if there's any way to cope with this as well as possibly deal with onset of increased anxiety which was the reason I was taking these meds in the first place.
4500,As for medications I'm not sure what I can do.
4501,":)

Tl;dr: Have to go w/o benzo meds for a few days bc doctor is on vacation."
4502,"During this time, I have been taking my medication (clonazepam, generic for klonopin) nearly daily, maybe having an odd good day in between where I didn't need it."
4503,"So, after a week of taking the meds almost every day, I'm now trying not to take it, and feeling fairly awful."
4504,Time to get some meds
4505,Am considering (putting off) going back on medication again because I am frightened of the negative side effects I experienced last time.
4506,Would appreciate some insight into other's experiences on medication :3
4507,I have meds to assist me (propranolol and lorazepam).
4508,I did have some meds on board to help though.
4509,Not sure what's happening but I get soft easy now (I'm usually always rock hard) and I know it's the medicine.
4510,"Girlfriend stuff, work, medicine issues... and I don't 100% know what's actual stress and stress from the klonopin."
4511,I'm really not sure if I want to start taking this medicine.
4512,"*""  ""*I can't go back to my old psychiatrist or my GP for my meds because they will be utterly convinced that I am a drug-seeker."
4513,"*""  ""*The doctors that say they want to help me refuse to give me the only meds that I have found that actually help me."
4514,"If I went to the doctors with a broken arm, I would expect them to set it, put it in a cast, give me pain meds and show me the door."
4515,"There is no need for them to agitate the injury or for me to **explain** why I need to have my arm reset, or need pain meds to make the agony more bearable."
4516,"**

**At first i just wanted to ask about medication....but when i was finishing writing this, I decided that i was going to call the doctor to ask for some soft benzodiazepines for my exam period."
4517,"I plan on seeing a school counselor or psychiatrist and from what I've read on various sites online, it seems to me that I'll probably end up getting medicine for my GAD."
4518,"Hopefully I don't need the medicine, but just in case I do I figured I'd reddit."
4519,What medications have you taken?
4520,"So, I've been dianosed with the anxiety and panic for a few years, and I'm doing alright with all of that, still on meds."
4521,"I'm sitting here typing this, subdued by the meds, and still thinking ""you fucking idiot, now shit's always going to be awkward with her, why even talk to her?""."
4522,"Don't wait as long as I did to get help, whether it be therapy/medication/or something else."
4523,"I've tried seeing therapists (no luck), I've tried medications (no luck)..."
4524,I was reading about heart related stuff in regards to a medication I may start and then they started a couple of days ago.
4525,I'm not much into medications but I do have some small valium on hand.
4526,"As ridiculous as it seems, I am very anti-medication (I was on some for five years, which helped form my opinion), so I haven't considered the option just yet."
4527,"I've been considering asking my psychiatrist for some anti-anxiety meds to help for when I get really anxious, although usually it manifests as nausea, pooping a lot [TMI, I know], and insomnia."
4528,"In the morning, my mom got my meds (Ativan) and gave them to me before she left to do errands."
4529,I needed my medicine.
4530,I have tried CBT and SSRI medicine.
4531,"I just started treatment (meds + therapy) for depression and GAD, and a new major source of anxiety for me is that my health care providers don't believe me -- I worry that I'm just whiny, it's just first world problems, I'm somehow faking it, I'm not sick enough, it's all in my head, etc."
4532,"It's making me not want to continue treatment, but rationally I know that at least my prescribing doc thought the issues were serious enough for meds."
4533,"I'm not sure about about others on here, but I would at some point, like to live a life not taking these meds... 

You can PM me or respond on here, but you are highly appreciate for your thoughts, feedback, or similar experience."
4534,I came off meds because of the seemingly unstoppable and slow weight gain.
4535,I was great on the meds and I'm afraid I made a mistake.
4536,"Plus, I want to see if I can get through this without medication."
4537,"As I've been through many medications now, I thought it might be interesting to list my experiences and I'd like to compare them to yours if you'd like to share."
4538,"I've since always felt the burning sensations after taking this medication, it's become a part of my anxiety now."
4539,"I'm a slim build so this isn't usual, definitely something with the medication."
4540,I have had something happen on my current medication but it's very rare.
4541,However I feel that I may be interested in trying to fix this problem with medication suited for it I guess?
4542,"The CBT I feel helped but I finished that at the end of October and I feel my anxiety may just be returning to normal again due to life stress (baby on the way, work, etc....)

I guess my questions are: what medications are usually prescribed?"
4543,"I've heard people say until you feel better, but if the meds make me feel better, why stop?"
4544,I never tried anti-depressants since my father has been taking medicine for so long and now he can't live without them.
4545,"From the medicine all I experienced was dizziness and low energy, and partially helped for my sleep problem."
4546,I finished the medicine a week or less before Christmas with no results.
4547,Is this because I'm off my medication?
4548,"Im only 22 and have meds and regular therapy, but still this waking panic is such a shit way to start the day."
4549,"I have a long history of dealing with severe anxiety without medication, not that successfully, but I never was diagnosed in the past despite suffering for decades."
4550,She's already on anxiety medication but is basically non-functional at school and will probably have to leave entirely in the next few months.
4551,"She has seen my meds, but I have just downplayed it until she didn't even worry about it."
4552,"I started going to therapy, but she cannot prescribe medication."
4553,What was the first medication you were prescribed and how did it affect you?
4554,"I felt it necessary to share with you all here, that with the right support and treatment, **you can improve your way of life**, and quite possibly without relying on medication."
4555,"I had to stop seeing my therapist, stop taking my meds and stop seeing my doctor."
4556,He doesn't even seem to care how hard it is for me off my meds.
4557,"Before I start I just want to say I am not on any meds, and haven't been told I have anxiety, but sometimes you just know."
4558,"Is this a ""hey powertape33 grow some balls and nut up"" kind of thing, a ""you're just a little insecure, go exercise"" kind of thing,  or is this a ""hey, you should see a therapist or consider anxiety medication"" kind of thing?"
4559,"And to top it off I can't believe that exercising, having a good diet, doing some 5htp/omega 3/ therapy/ meds can stop these thoughts or this identification with anxiety."
4560,Any tips or maybe some herb or relaxing medication?
4561,"I know all the ways that should fix it - exposure, CBT, meds - and in some ways, I have improved."
4562,"Here's the link: http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/54028-treating-anxiety-safely-effectively/

It breaks down the pharmacological MOAs of all the more common (and many more obscure) anxiety medicines and why they are or aren't feasible as a safe and effective long-term solution, with references to relevant scientific studies and intelligent discussion in the following pages of the thread."
4563,"Naturally this isn't the be-all-end-all of what you should and shouldn't be taking - many of you will have had great luck with some of the less-recommended meds, and horrible reactions to the ones that get the ""okay""."
4564,"He gave me another
medication to control the extra beats, It has been helping."
4565,For others who have OCD - are there any meds that help with it?
4566,I took daily medications for anxiety.
4567,"I guess what I am trying to say is, do you think I need medication for this trip?"
4568,On the other hand I have never wanted to take medication for this and have never asked for any from my doctor.
4569,"Any advice on how to cope with this type of anxiety, or options to seek medication would be really helpful."
4570,"I did a behavior therapy (which was actually about talking a lot about my exactly fears and the consequences) and since my symptoms were so strong, I was send to a psychologist, who was responsible for my medication."
4571,I can say the medications combined with the therapy helped me to come out of that fucked up situations.
4572,"** Well, I can't tell 100% for sure, but I guess the therapy combined with the medications, which I still take today, helped a lot, it did the start-up."
4573,"I still take Venlafaxine (pls google it up, it's too complex to explain it here for me) and I almost got none side-effects, it's a very good medication for me(!)."
4574,"I took meds, I went to counseling, I did the homework."
4575,"Crying all the time, having to take more Xanax as rescue medication more frequently."
4576,These mostly happen when I am hearing or learning about what medication does to your body.
4577,"With the help of (very weak) meds, a therapist and a lot of sports I got rid of them (hadnt had one in two/three weeks) which I am very happy about."
4578,"Clonazepam worked, but after a while he started abusing his medication and taking high doses every day."
4579,"*

I asked him last night if he would consider going to a psychiatrist again and do therapy/go on meds again."
4580,"I've tried virtually all of the ADHD medicines, and they never helped."
4581,But I've read that ADHD medicines not working is often a good indication that ADHD is not the problem.
4582,I was prescribed anxiety/depression medicine and it didn't help.
4583,"I was so frusterated that I started looking into alternative medicine (acupuncture, etc."
4584,"I am happy I started the meds, not sure if I would have been able to get through last semester without them."
4585,"(This doctor failed me big time, I laid down all of the meds I was on in front of him and asked him if it could be from any of them."
4586,It wasn´t until I finally saw another doctor right before christmas in my home country who realised what it was and switched my meds.
4587,This experience and switching meds made me realise how much they affect me.
4588,"I feel like I view the world differently, some of my behaviour is very un-me and the carefree feeling the meds give me have gotten me into trouble a few times."
4589,I´m scared that these changes and others I haven´t even noticed might be irreversible and the chance of that happening increases the longer I stay on the meds.
4590,I´m scared that I might have to stay on these meds forever cause I won´t be able to function without them.
4591,I feel like the people I´ve gotten to know since I started the meds aren´t getting to know the real me.
4592,I think it´s the easiest way to stop my anxiety about them and much more logical than upping my dose of anxiety medication to kill my anxiety about anxiety medication.
4593,"I needed meds to help when I just couldn´t handle my anxiety, when nothing went right, they helped me not to crash when everything was falling apart around me."
4594,Although that might just be the meds talking.
4595,But he did say he was exited about getting to know meds free me.
4596,I had to assure him that I know I am ultimately in this alone and that I am very independent on and off meds.
4597,So Now I´m anxious about continuing my meds and about quitting them.
4598,"I´ve heard about people not getting support in seeking help, getting meds and are instead just told to just tough it out but I seem to have the opposite problem."
4599,"tl;dr 
I´m anxious about being on my meds
I´m anxious about quitting my meds"
4600,"I have never taken medication and I have mostly learned to use the relentless energy to my advantage, forging a fast paced career for myself at 23 years old."
4601,medicine = take as directed.
4602,"So, first off, I know this is all centered around my medication."
4603,The nausea from my medication plus the nausea from my concussion was too much for me so I stopped taking my medication (I know!!!).
4604,"Actually, the not taking my medication part wasn't that bad."
4605,Nothing seems to be working to calm me down because it's the medication giving me my anxiety.
4606,"Don't mess with your meds, folks."
4607,"I don't know if it was because of my 2 day break, or because I took it at noon or completely my imagination,  but I really realized I need to adjust my meds."
4608,Edit: Just mentioning that I'm not on any medications.
4609,"I've been to therapy and that didn't help, every psychiatrist I see usually ends up messing up medicines because of mistakes they make somewhere i the process."
4610,"My mom was prescribed anti-anxiety meds herself just a few months ago, but I don't want my parents to pay for a therapist we can't afford if it's not a serious issue."
4611,When I am on my meds I just don't feel like myself.
4612,I feel guilt about taking meds too.
4613,"Then maybe you can get off some of those medicines you are taking."""
4614,She refuses to even entertain the notion that these medicines I am taking are for mental illness not just because I am depressed.
4615,I just want to know that at some point I am going to have this great revelation and be fine with having to take meds and not have to feel like a drug addict or a zombie.
4616,"My grandma and my mum are on anxiety medication, Diazepam."
4617,Nowadays she still takes medicine for this especially pre and post menstruation.
4618,"I've been on some natural medication, but I don't feel like its doing much for me."
4619,I finally found the right medicine and the right therapist to transform my incorrect and irrational thought processes through psycho therapy.
4620,"Friends, it took me 6 years of therapy and medicine experimentation to find the most fitting treatment."
4621,I gave up countless times and was non compliant with medicine at times.
4622,I've been on many medications and have been through some tough times so don't hesitate to ask for advice.
4623,"I realize psychiatrists just deal with medicine, but I can't stand having one with no sort of compassion."
4624,"So anyway, hoping he will have some idea of a Med/meds that could work for me, he gives me a script for .5 mg Xanax taken every 4 hours."
4625,"Because of this, I'm not willing to go on medication."
4626,Finally my meds are ready..
4627,The only time I felt really free of all of this was btw when I got medication.
4628,"But my doc (not a psychiatrist, normal doc) told me I'm too healthy for meds."
4629,"I plan to go talk to my doctor and ask for some medication to make it easier, but I don't really know what to say."
4630,"My mother recently took all of my meds away (even the ones I don't take)
Because she heard from my psychiatrist that I am suicidal."
4631,"I can't think of anything else I was exposed to that is different than normal, so it's most likely the meds."
4632,What meds do you take now?
4633,"I don't take medication, I only went to three psych sessions, and I can barely control them when they do occur."
4634,"Last night, I had another breakdown because I had gotten irritable with my SO and it has happened a couple times lately and I had already gone to bed, but was up crying mostly just to myself, and he came and I just said I'm sorry and broke down, he comforted me and we talked and he said I don't want you just to turn to meds because that's what is solving everyone's problems, but I want you to try, with my help, working through it."
4635,"We do have resources locally that can help people who need free or low cost therapy/meds/etc, but the last time I went through them I had a really terrible experience and stopped, which is also a source of great shame and guilt and anxiety and depression."
4636,I'm wondering if this medication is supposed to work by giving depressed and anxious people delusions that everything is going to be okay when it is not.
4637,"I used to take Paxil, but stopped after 3 weeks because I wasn't responding well to the medications."
4638,"I was put on medication for over a year and it didn't seem to get rid of my stomach pain, but it did help somewhat."
4639,"i started seeking treatment only 2 years ago and was first diagnosed with ""Neurosis"" and was prescribed an antidepressant (ecitalopram) which i took for 10 months, i noticed a slight improvement in mood, then i was able to go back to school and hold a job, after 10 months i stopped taking the med gradually for 3 months as i thought my depression was gone.. unfortunately it didn't last that long and i had a hysterical episode that got me to the hospital, i got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was prescribed medications for it, it improved sleep and appetite but i was still severely depressed and things got worse after i lost my job so i saw another psychiatrist who dismissed the bipolar diagnoses and replaced it with a mix of depression and anxiety with obsessional thinking, he prescribed an SSRI, now i am not so depressed but my anxiety is often uncontrollable and sometimes i fear i would lose my mind at anytime!"
4640,"](http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Way-Calm-Aid-Softgels/dp/B007TYY2JA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425647195&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=lavendar+pills) I've been taking them once a day (intermittently because I'm fucking terrible at remembering to take medicine), and their use has been augmented with my paroxetine, therefore I know it's hard to be objective, but I feel like I notice a bigger improvement with the lavender pills than the paroxetine."
4641,"I drank too much, got on anti-anxiety meds and abused them, hung out with the wrong people, and fucked my life up for a while until things got too bad."
4642,-Why am I not on meds?
4643,"I don't want to have to resort to taking meds, but I don't know if I really need them."
4644,"The ""crutch"" is a stigma I bought into... and undermined the medical need of this medication to keep my usually positive attitude and calm alive."
4645,Or tough it out and do what I am afraid of - stay this way and forget it can all be better with a little medication...
4646,"My leadership encouraged me to see a doctor, and see if they could prescribe me meds."
4647,Do I have to be diagnosed in order to receive medication?
4648,"Are there medications you take only when you need them, or are they usually an every day thing?"
4649,Are there any kind of over-the-counter meds to help?
4650,"I wish I had medication or SOMETHING to help me cope but I have nothing except for self injury, which is how I used to cope, but my therapist doesn't want me doing that anymore."
4651,"I've never tried any antidepressants or anxiety medications before, so I'm not really sure what to expect and I'm kind of terrified."
4652,I have taken my medicine once.
4653,"So for general anxiety I noticed a big change and for social I noticed a slight change, I am still going to therapy and he knows I still need work with the social aspect of it but I think the meds helped me by 70-80% and that is huge to me and should be for other people too."
4654,So I know the meds route can be scary for some for many reasons but I think it's a great tool to help people with anxiety and depression.
4655,I've never had anxiety so bad that medicine wouldn't even help the slightest.
4656,I have been off medication since September.
4657,"I'm interested to try new helpful herbs, but people I know who suffer from anxiety, tend to take chemical meds."
4658,Especially when I take my medication and it makes me feel normal I'll panic.
4659,"i am currently 19 but i was diagnosed when i was like... 14 or 15. yes, i was one of those growing up... been to hospital after hospital on medicines i couldn't even spell at the time and had more therapists and psychs than i have fingers to count them on."
4660,"I went to my doctor yesterday; I'm working on my medication, going to a new psychologist, I don't need more doctors visits."
4661,"I dont know what to do, I have medication but it doesnt really help the attacks."
4662,What I wanna know is if people ever go from the way I am to being able to stand in front of a class and teach without the use of medication?
4663,"After shakily explaining my symptoms to my GP, he determined that I was suffering from acid reflux disease and prescribed medication to help."
4664,I've been through therapy/meds/partial hospitalization etc.
4665,"No longer on meds, but trying to manage regardless."
4666,My doctor said there's no way of knowing for sure what's going on (if this is part of the rebalancing or if I'm just this anxious without medication) and I understand that fully.
4667,I'm so scared that I can't do it I know I'm going to be mentally exhausted from it all and I don't want that I have been doing great since I've been in therapy and am off my medication now.
4668,"I've been to therapy, I've been taking my meds, but I can't shake this feeling."
4669,"I've mentioned this to my Psych and Therapist, but I don't want to play ""medication bingo' again with all the side effects it entails, and my therapist, while well meaning is no match for the anxiety and pessimism in my head."
4670,It's ruined my life &amp; I have been on medication for ever!
4671,Anything I can do during the work day to calm down without my medication?
4672,"None of my medications seem to be helping, nor does distracting myself."
4673,"My mother won't let me get on medication as she tried that when she was sick, but it didn't help."
4674,I believe that many people with anxiety can get through it without these medications.
4675,I don't like the feeling of being on medication and I think especially kpin and xanax are crutches and don't actually treat the problem.
4676,Has treating your anxiety (meds/therapy) helped this at all?
4677,"However, I am nearly out of options and I am looking to try  another prescribed medication for situational anxiety induced insomnia to get over this hump."
4678,"When I was fifteen my mom asked me to go into my sister's room and get out her advil, while in the process of trying to find the medication I found a small case and I opened it."
4679,"I'm reading so much about medication that I didn't know about recently, and I'm wondering."
4680,"These medications aren't like antibiotics that'll kill our anxiety, they just mask what we're feeling."
4681,"I'm just wondering why we poison ourselves with these medications, (some of which are very addictive and require weening off of) when doctors have no idea what is really going on in our brains, at least not enough to deem anything a ""chemical imbalance""."
4682,I don't even want to go anymore but I have to do this visit to get my meds.
4683,I've suffered from paranoia and *severe* social and general anxiety for years (unable to be in a social situation with *anyone* other than my gf without meds or alcohol).
4684,"I am however a freelance game developer so my career is going ok.

My family are very bohemian and for years warned me against western meds, I tried absolutely **every** alternative medicine you can think of, and only got worse and worse as the years went by."
4685,"Some alternative medicine does work/help, but when it comes to my issues, which are quite serious, it's not enough."
4686,"But I still feel like *something's* wrong, something the medication is not addressing."
4687,"I feel my anxiety is under control now with the medication, but there's something else and it's getting worse."
4688,"Therapy, medication, hospitalization."
4689,"My mom took me to the doctor, and the doctor told me it was most likely an anxiety problem &amp; gave me some medicine to take whenever I started to feel that way."
4690,"I don't remember what the medicine was called, but I didn't have to take it daily - it was a situational type thing."
4691,What if I'm on daily medication?
4692,"I'm on medication and seeing a therapist, and I'm actually doing fairly well except for a pervasive fear that I'm going to have a stroke and/or die."
4693,I take Celexa and Lisinopril (for blood pressure) and I really don't want to take more meds.
4694,"I have always been weary of anxiety meds - as I am already succesptable to tiredness, but the meds my doctor has previously given me (Vistaril) have only made me fall asleep - with no actual relieving anxiety."
4695,"-sigh- any help would be appreciated, any medications you take that seem to help...(my doctor recently prescribed me effexor xr but my anxiety is so situational that I don't want to be taking something every day that changes my brain chemistry)."
4696,I am taking GERD medication and follow a diet but this wait has drained me mentally.
4697,"I went to the doctor and she said that physically i'm in great condition, i exercise 6 days a week and I eat the best i can, and that my symptoms are more or less caused by anxiety and said she wouldn't recommend me any medication as I'm not physically suffering."
4698,I have tried so many strategies and meds and it feels so hopeless.
4699,He's tried several medicines since then but most have made it worse or he just threw it up.
4700,"I'm considering looking for medication, but I don't even know how to go about that."
4701,"I figured it was a fluke, but at some point since then I stopped taking my meds."
4702,"I have already gone to a psychiatrist and been on medication since then, It has helped but even know I feel horrible."
4703,I want to become a neurologist at some point in life and my uni allows retakes for medicine so it's like everyone's giving me a chance but I'm ruining it for myself.
4704,Anyone have problems with dehydration causing anxiety while on (or off) meds?
4705,Has anyone else had issues with dehydration and anxiety or has the medicine just suddenly actually started working for me around the same time I started to drink more water?
4706,"I don't know where this sudden outburst came from, maybe because I haven't had my meds in two weeks and my mood is swinging like a hormonal pregnant teenage chimp."
4707,"So, I went home to my parents' place for Christmas holidays for the next three weeks and left all my anxiety meds at my apartment."
4708,"I have no way of getting them and also can't get my hands on the prescription, which basically means I accidentally forced myself to go off my meds until the 3rd or so."
4709,"So far her CBT counseller, and phychiatrist have just gone the route of meds, and CBT is just not something she feels works at all."
4710,"A few notes that may or may not be helpful:

-I have depression but it is pretty much under control and I have been off meds for about a year now

-my mother suffers from anxiety and depression 

-I recently started smoking marijuana."
4711,I'm not sure if it's my medication (Lexapro) or if I'm just having an off day.
4712,I'm already a quiet/anxious guy but these meds just make me not feel bothered to socialize.
4713,"I have some familiarity with the subject, as my SO has gone through a long process of taming her own beast (GAD) with a combination of therapy and meds."
4714,I was on a few medications in college for anxiety.
4715,"Before I started having problems my meds were working great....now, not so much."
4716,"""...except for some reason the deflector shields(meds) aren't working."
4717,Anyone think it's time to switch anxiety meds and try something different?
4718,I'm not on an medication at this time
4719,The only option I can see left now is anti-anxiety medication but I can't see them being strong enough to prevent my panic attacks.
4720,"I then proceeded to drink heavily to calm myself down, since I currently am not on any medication."
4721,One of my hangups these days is I am looking for a job and trying to be productive because I'm working towards applying to medschool.
4722,It wasn't until after I got on meds that I had the contrast to compare against and realize I had been miserable for over a decade.
4723,I never took the medication out of fear and my parents being very against me taking them.
4724,I guess I am just lost and I am looking for some advice on therapy and medication or just some comforting words.
4725,"still, though, i have another waitressing job and my hands are so incredibly obviously shaky as fuck when i'm handling plates around people and stuff

i'm sorry this is kind of all over the place, thanks for keeping up... i can clarify anything if need be

so anyway i haven't been on meds for about two years now, and i guess it was a combination of anxiety and nerves in general and the heat and my general not-feeling-well, but i fainted."
4726,"and i just generally don't feel comfortable wasting time with meds again if they don't work

again i can clarify anything if you need me to; i'm a mess right now i apologize but i don't expect everything in this to be perfect

thank you very much, i hope you're at least having a great day"
4727,TLDR: I'm very sensitive to medication and I took a small amount of Serax daily for 2 and a half weeks 5 months ago.
4728,"I really need meds, my life has pretty much fallen apart..."
4729,"Throughout the years they tried me on different medications, but none seemed to work."
4730,"Skip to present day, I take my (useless) medication and smoke on top of it to hinder the effects of anxiety and OCD."
4731,"I know some people use weed as a medication, but it's still in debate."
4732,"Perhaps, but aren't you just describing all medicine?"
4733,"I tried a couple medications throughout the year, and explaining to my mother that some just won't work well with me."
4734,"I went through a whirlwind of medications, therapists, good and bad times."
4735,"Eventually, I began to use marijuana daily, since it had less side effects than the other medications, was socially acceptable, and helped me make friends."
4736,"I'm on medication, I meditate I have been working towards 'normal' for a long time."
4737,Then suddenly I take anxiety medication and it calms down a bit so I'm curious do any of you get this symptom?
4738,i would like to know if anyone could recommend medication that would fit me.
4739,"I'm afraid to see a professional because of what he may say, I'm also afraid of getting put on medication, I don't want to rely on drugs to feel normal, and I don't want to be taking 20 pills a day in 10 years."
4740,"Today I sit here medication free for years now (not that there is anything wrong with medication, but if you feel like you don't need it than why bother)."
4741,I was put on meds to help with both with the anxiety and the depression.
4742,Now I've come off my meds and I'm trying to see if I can cope without them.
4743,Since it takes a long time apparently to get an appointment to see one (almost three months apparently) I opted to have my doctor prescribe me medication (50mg of Zoloft).
4744,"Once coming back to school and starting therapy at the counseling center I asked my therapist if I could get an appointment with a psychiatrist on campus, just for a consultation to be sure I was on the right medicine and what not."
4745,"I have been in therapy for social anxiety for almost 6 months now, and I have about reached the point where I am seriously considering psychotropic medication."
4746,Part of me feels like I am giving up by trying medication because I feel like I should be able to be happy without having to rely on meds.
4747,"If anyone cares to share about their experience with medication, I would be greatly appreciative, especially if your story is similar to mine."
4748,- Do people discriminate differently against those taking medications for anxiety vs. those pursuing exclusively non-pharmaceutical therapy?
4749,"Whether it be a medicine, stuffed animal, person, etc."
4750,"He hit all the questions you're supposed to ask when giving care to someone who may lose consciousness, questions to ask while you're waiting for the ambulance to arrive:  *are you taking any medication right now?"
4751,"Then we start talking my meds, which include Lexapro, Xanax, and Neurotin, and she mentions that I should try Welbutrin as well, which I was up for."
4752,"I am really wary about going on meds, because I'm a nursing student so I've basically seen/learned about every terrible thing that can go wrong while taking every kind of antidepressant."
4753,My anxiety has been relatively manageable recently but I just finally got a prescription for nuvigil after years of being lucky to get occasional samples of the medication.
4754,I have been on the medication for about 5 weeks after constant depression and the occational tantrum leaving me in a sometimes (more often than I'd like to admit) crying state.
4755,"A few weeks before I recieved medication After 2 weeks I was upped from 5 to 10mg a day, although I have been led to believe that escitalopram is a really weak anit-depressant(?)."
4756,"Google tells me the medication ""supposedly"" works, followed by a full page of side-effects."
4757,To be completely honest I don't feel anything from the medication.
4758,"I don't think my psychiatrist is going to take me off my current medicine (100 mg Amitriptyline each night), but I was wondering if anyone else had suffered from a vitamin D deficiency and if the supplements helped you."
4759,"He's done a great job up to now, but I see him so rarely that I would like to think someone else who gets to know my needs a little better could prescribe more efficient medications."
4760,"However, I hadn't had good luck at finding a psychiatrist who is good at both the therapy side as well as the medication side."
4761,"However, they specifically mention they would make medication recommendations."
4762,"(Also, I'm not an any medication except Xanax, which I take as needed.)"
4763,"However, these past few years have put me through countless trails of failed medications, ever-evolving anxiety symptoms, eating disorders, and a psychological and/or physical addiction to Lorazepam (Ativan)."
4764,"I'm not currently on any medication, as I've become far too over-sensitized to handle any of the initial side effects."
4765,"Since stopping medication, my panic attacks significantly decreased."
4766,"I have IBS too and sometimes my antispasmodic medicine helps, but it isnt great."
4767,Maybe for some of you therapy or medication hasnt been working and isnt the answer.
4768,"I feel that I have it pretty well under control with medication and coping strategies, but one thing that still triggers anxiety flair ups is having to sleep in new places."
4769,"Even though the medication worked to some effect, i still felt the increasing urge to escape my reality and i turned to drugs."
4770,"If there is nothing medically wrong, than trying out medication or seeking therapy can really help."
4771,*can* prescribe and manage medication on a regular basis).
4772,"It's progressively gotten worse, and I finally made the decision after a few months of counselling to start medication."
4773,"TL,DR, I occasionally mix my Meds with Alcohol after really bad (2-3 hour long) attacks and it works but I wonder if I should get a different medication."
4774,"Back story: diagnosed with GAD about 3 years ago, refuse medication and just trying to handle it myself."
4775,I was up till 6am and finally got to sleep after a heavy dose of medication.
4776,"I've researched enough and the Doc has gotten great reviews, my question is, is it okay to talk to a regular physician and possibly get medication for this?"
4777,"I know there's no easy answer to that question, but I'm interested to hear why those of you who take medication decided to do so."
4778,"It's caused me to seek therapy, get on medication, read self-help books, surf this subreddit, read others' stories..."
4779,"I'm assuming I have some genetic mutation or biochemical imbalance that leaves me predisposed to this illness, because medication has helped significantly."
4780,I have never really taken any kind of medication before.
4781,"I'm considering seeing a doctor soon, however I don't have insurance and am wary of beginning new medications, although I have done some light research into CBT and am considering that option."
4782,"I don't take medication, because I never believed that I needed it, but this event is making me think otherwise... F 19"
4783,"My psychiatrist said that the worst of it should be today, tomorrow, and the next day, so I want to try to continue the meds but I'm finding it hard to keep motivated when I know that if I quit I would go back to 'normal' in a day or two."
4784,I went to see my GP thinking he may want me to switch meds.
4785,He also said it typically takes 3-4 weeks at theraputic dose for the side effects to go away and 6-8 weeks for the meds to start working.
4786,"I didn’t tell her that every night when I took my medication, I would pour out all of the pills into my hand and wonder if this was the night they’d go down my throat instead of back into the bottle."
4787,"So, this is my first post on /r/anxiety, I was up until 4am last night jumping out of my skin, worrying I was going to jump out of my house or die in my sleep from halving my anti-anxiety meds that I've been on for (no joke) FIFTEEN years."
4788,"There's a tornado watch in my area, I have no medicine (besides alcohol) and I am alone and really scared."
4789,Are my meds not working?
4790,I think that is because I have fairly vivid and intense dreams due to the medication I am on (30mg Mirtazapine) and sometimes even waking up with sleep paralysis which isnt pleasant.
4791,I gave up on therapy because finding the right mg of my medication seemed to reduce my problems to the point that I could have a normal life.
4792,I've been dealing with very bad anxiety that has almost made me completely house-ridden for about 7 years now and have never taken medication for it and try to avoid taking medicine as much as possible.
4793,Im getting counseling and they suggested I try medicine considering how debilitating it is so I decided to see a psychiatrist to see if medicine would help.
4794,"I guess I just want to hear other people's experiences with lorazepam for an anti-anxiety medicine, good or bad."
4795,"My hugest stressors right now are: Work, anxiety, discomfort (generally speaking), money, medication, sleep (or lack thereof), and it all originates from my god damn head."
4796,I've tried prescription medications and they all give me really bad side effects and make me sick.
4797,I want to avoid medication if possible.
4798,"I'm a 24 year old male with a history of shaky relationships were I had problems with commitment (especially my current one), self destructive behavior, was on medication from the ages of 12-15 for depression and high levels of anxiety, and I believe it's all from the loss of my father at the age of 12."
4799,I don't take any medications nor have I tried any.
4800,"So far, had changed medications from SSRI [Escitalopram] to Agomelatine [Valdoxan]."
4801,"Right before he left, I had a full blown migraine (which required a trip to the ER for meds) which resulted in feeling anxious for nearly the whole month he was gone."
4802,"I wasn't on any meds, just dealing with it through a little therapy (that was pretty useless)."
4803,"When I became incredibly depressed and suicidal (with no intentions of following through) in the first couple weeks of my medication, I called my doctor and ended up getting his assistant."
4804,Is it the smoking causing this or the medication?
4805,"I feel like if the medication was actually working, I wouldn't have panic attacks no matter what the situation was."
4806,My doctor upped the dosage of my medication the other day.
4807,I saw my doctor last Monday for a refill on my anxiety meds (Clonazepam) and she said I need to see a mental healthcare professional so I can talk about the stuff that is out of control.
4808,"(no medications, prefferably)."
4809,I explained the situation to her and she prescribed some medication to help me get over my anxiety issues.
4810,"The medication is called Cipralex and after doing some research, I decided against taking the medication as I believe that the anxiety issue in my case is not so strong that I must take the medication to help me cope with it."
4811,"I'm on meds, but they can't help me get past my base fears of negative change."
4812,"Now that I'm on medication, I almost never want sex."
4813,"I don't know how to fix this, but without the medication I'm a nervous wreck."
4814,"I have noticed that the anxiety gets a lot better when I take some of my leftover hyperthyroid meds, such as atenolol or trazodone."
4815,"Gallbladder is fine, stomach is fine, acid issue is being dealt with by the meds."
4816,In an ideal world (ha) I would be on NO medication but I don't know how to not have panic all the time without it.
4817,"My counselor suggested I might be a person who has to be on medication forever which makes me want to say ""no thanks""."
4818,"Original post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1wu2d9/meds_klonopin_has_turned_my_anxiety_around/

I wish I had never started on benzos."
4819,"Some backround: I'm 28 years old, didn't have the greatest of childhoods and I've dealt with some depression in the past (which I didn't see anyone or get any meds for)."
4820,"In 2013, I started seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed me SSRIs/antipsychotics over a period of a year to try and find out what would help me best (Lexapro, Luvox, Paxil, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Risperdal, Xanax XR, etc...) At the end of the year, ultimately I felt highly cognitively impaired, put on insane weight, and felt completely lucid and decided to quit cold turkey because it was entirely too much of a social burden to continue to see him or anyone in public for that matter and ween off the medication."
4821,So I just now decided to try meds yet again and am reluctant.
4822,"This time around, the psychiatrist I am seeing has unexpectedly theorized that I might have untreated ADHD that when treated with meds, may also inadvertently cure my other issues."
4823,I am still not adapting to a functioning life and NEED advice on common and easy to access coping mechanisms so I can continue making progress and not be so reliant on medication.
4824,"I've always had terrible anxiety, and for the past four or five years I've tried to stay completely off medication for it."
4825,"I've taken biology and psychology, I know a little about medications, how they work, and most importantly I can identify my symptoms as abnormal and seek help."
4826,"So, after a week of being zonked out on this medication, it's finally begun to kick in."
4827,Around 2 weeks or so of the medication I started to notice less loving feelings and it progressed to numbness to all things at the 75mg dose.
4828,Is it normal for medicine to cause some anxiety attacks before it starts working?
4829,"I'm anxious (ha ha) to start taking some type of meds, but I'm married and my anxiety has taken a toll on my relationship and general life and I'm starting to think it might be worth it."
4830,"I'm concerned about side effects, addiction and other issues with the meds."
4831,Should I continue taking this medicine- is it normal to have increased attacks in the beginning?
4832,I am on no medication and have yet to consult a doctor as I don't think I have enough information to give to a professional in order for them to help.
4833,"Part of me was really excited to finally have some relief from anxiety, but the other part was concerned because I've never taken any kind of prescription medication before (except very mild pain-killers after I got my wisdom teeth out)."
4834,"My mom is very against prescription medication because she's very wary of side effects, and was really concerned when I told her it was something I've been considering."
4835,"I was told my thyroid levels were really low (I have Graves Disease and was already on levothyroxine), and they changed my medicine and put me on a low-level beta blocker."
4836,My doctor put me on a blood pressure medicine with a diuretic (I don't have any idea why) and it dehydrated me and made me sicker within 4 days time.
4837,Did you take meds?
4838,I want to point out that my GP said my Anxiety MAY have been caused by medication I had taken earlier Christmas day for bronchial irritation that I was prescribed.
4839,She said it may take up to 6 months for the medicine to fully leave my system.
4840,"This is the medicine I took right here FYI: 

http://www.drugs.com/sfx/azithromycin-side-effects.html

&gt; Psychiatric side effects have included aggressive reaction and anxiety during postmarketing experience."
4841,"Or should I try to go all out and tackle my anxiety to the fullest and try to stop it before it picks up any steam via medicine, therapy, etc?"
4842,"But - if I move, I won't have insurance to cover the meds I take for my anxiety."
4843,"He said I can live with him rent free till I find a job, I'd just need money for food and personal expenses,  but meds are expensive without insurance."
4844,"I walked the dog, gave her all her medicine, got dressed (not as extravagantly as yesterday), fed the cat, and cleaned the cat litter pan all within the first hour of waking up."
4845,"The things my therapist suggested doing to block out the racing thoughts aren't working, my new meds haven't started working yet so I'm having a drink to shut my head up."
4846,"I was hoping this day would  come because being with him causes as much anxiety as being without him, but I was hoping it would happen once I got on the right meds and got them working."
4847,"I've never taken any psychiatric medication before, and I was told this one could have a sedative effect."
4848,"And then went to the doctor for new meds to help with my ""can't breathe problem""."
4849,"She claims that she doesn't want to be a ""zombie"" on medication (she gets mad ad me for even suggesting this route), and that talking her issues out to some sort of therapist or counselor is ""stupid"" and ""pointless""."
4850,"i have been taking meds for anxiety for a couple years now, a few times on and off thinking i could deal without them."
4851,"I started taking meds for depression at first, and the problem went away (i could not focus on my breathing for long enough, meds luckily brought on their own form of a.d.d.)."
4852,"Stopped taking the meds after a year, breathing problem came back."
4853,"Went back to school, needed meds again but now properly dosed towards anxiety, problem went away again."
4854,i want to get off the meds for good.
4855,Recently my therapist suggested seeing a psychiatrist to evaluate possible medication and he urged me to try as he thought my problems had lasted for too long while only getting worse instead of better.
4856,"I was wondering how you dealt with starting medication, when it wouldn't work for you or when the side effect were very severe."
4857,"The medication I've been perscribed is Lexapro, or escitalopram."
4858,- did you switch meds or how did you fix the situation?
4859,I was previously on celexa for about 3 years but it stopped being effective and I went off of meds completely for a while.
4860,Now I'm on meds and therapy but I soil have really bad days.
4861,I think I'd be a wreck without meds.
4862,I hear about people getting off meds.
4863,I started taking medication for anxiety 2 weeks and I haven't really noticed a difference.
4864,"I know there are over the counter anxiety medications, but I'm hesitant to try them."
4865,"Lately I have been having panic attacks in the mornings.I refused they were panic attacks and thought I was just getting nauseous.There were other symptoms I just linked to nauseua that I later read were linked to panic wttacks.Anyeay,im finally accelting these as panic attacks because 1) my primary care provider said it was ""above him"" when I went into an appointment and experienced an attack.I suppose it was because I paced to keep my mind off of ythe subje...And 2)I experienced it in the afternoon during a weekend.This is a sign to me the issue is getting worse.Heres the backstory:
Im in my first year of high school,and did not experience this until near the beginning of september.I wake up and feel nauseous,like having to throw up.I get shortness of breath and feel like I cant breathe.Ive tried to take deep breaths but this turned to be counter productive because it dried out my throat.There is constantly ""flem"" in my throat,presumably due to allergies as diagnosed by my doctor but allergy meds nevef worked,I simpy cope.This made me feel like I was choking on the flem bassically.Other symptoms include my fingertipz,feet,and teeth starting to go numb and burping.I have no conclusive link as to why it happened during the weekend,but I assume it is because I was in an area that reminded me of the school.I was in a store,and mainly it was the cold temlerature."
4866,"I am asking for help here because I do not want to use medication,and need sel help tips."
4867,I have a lifetime history of mental disorders and medication starting with PTSD and Zoloft at 16.
4868,When I was 21 I had a depressive episode and was misdiagnosed as bipolar2 and put on heavy meds Seroquel and Effexor for 1yr.
4869,I changed states and changed mental health providers and after 6months they believed I was misdiagnosed and I was withdrawn from meds.
4870,The medication was amazing and my anxiety was gone.
4871,After 18months on medication I spoke with my GP and I decided I was better and could handle myself without medication now.
4872,I started slowly weaning off meds and now I am 2 months free from Paroxetine.
4873,I feel like a failure and I feel like I don't want to be on medication for the rest of my life.
4874,Are there other people here who just function better on medication and are resigned to taking it for the long haul?
4875,How do I control these without medications!
4876,He has spoken to several doctors who have each given him a different medication.
4877,He refuses to take any of these meds because he looks them up online and sees the possible side effects and becomes afraid of them.
4878,"I try to understand so I haven't nagged him to take the meds, I am trying to help him cope without medicine."
4879,"I have begged him to take his meds, or to go see a therapist because of all this but he refuses."
4880,"There are certain days he tells me he's ready to take his meds and get better, but he never follows through with it."
4881,"So for the short term, what meds would you guys recommend?"
4882,"Around the time this started up for me, my bipolar girlfriend was yanked off of a medication and is now extremely unstable."
4883,"I also have horrible year round allergies and now that I know to control my anxiety and triggers, I've noticed most allergy meds trigger it for me."
4884,So to anyone who may be put off by the medication at first please comminicate with your dr. regarding any concerns typically things do get better.
4885,"Current meds I'm on are Venlafaxine (225mg/day), Quetiapine (300mg/day) and Gabapentin (900mg/day)."
4886,That didn’t help at all and the meds they put me on made me very moody and even more depressed than I already was.
4887,"A few years ago, I tried it, and it helped, but I was paranoid I would become dependent on medication, so I tapered off and returned to my normal state of anxiety."
4888,I've just briefly mentioned anxiety to my doctor but she is against putting me on medication.
4889,"I lost 65 pounds, cleaned up my act, got on meds for my bipolar, feeling pretty good."
4890,I'm considering biting the bullet and getting some meds.
4891,"As soon as I can, I'm going to get on meds."
4892,"Last week, we took a medication math test."
4893,Am I doomed to be on meds forever and have to send my husband to the store because I'm scared?
4894,"Either way, it was annoying that I was on meds to help out with those random social anxiety episodes and it was still going on."
4895,"It seems as though with the meds, I was able to keep my mind at least in control, I did get anxious some times, however I don't remember it being as annoying as this."
4896,"Because I believe that the meds have essentially out of my system the first two weeks, I will remain off them to see if this wave of anxiety passes, or if I can control it."
4897,"If within a month I am feeling worse, or this anxiety remains at this level I will go back onto meds."
4898,I'm not on any medication but I do take melatonin occasionaly because it usually helps but this is the first time it isn't helping and it's making me freak out more.
4899,I had medication for a week and my anxiety went away so I got off of it but then it came back the next time I started my period and its been only at night since then.
4900,Does anyone have experience with going off of their meds?
4901,"Should I try medicine, or should I just give up?"
4902,I don't know if my meds are not working anymore or if I'm just going NUTS.
4903,"I feel like the walls are closing in, my mind is racing a million miles an hour and I left my medication at home, a 30 minute commute."
4904,"Hello, I'd really just appreciate any opinions in terms of my current medications."
4905,"A tiny bit of info, i am currently off work as directed by my dr for 16 weeks (currently in the middle) to figure out what medications can help."
4906,I am currently waiting to see a psychiatrist to be diagnosed from her and see if she has any recommendations for different medications.
4907,"The psychiatrist i am waiting to see specializes in PTSD, and my counselor feels confident this will be a good match for me and figuring out meds."
4908,But basically i am wondering if anyone is on / has been on the current medication im on or similar dose and how they were feeling?
4909,"So, i am curious since i see my dr in about a week if we should increase either of my meds until i see the psychiatrist, or keep things the way they are until then?"
4910,Either way I want to go to the doctor and get medication.
4911,I was wondering if I should go to the GP and in your experiences do they put you on meds immediately or no?
4912,I feel more in control than I did as a zombie on the meds.
4913,"I am currently taking a new medicine for my anxiety disorder (just started Bupropion SR 150 mg, twice daily) after taking Venlafaxine for over a year."
4914,"Anyway, I’m a senior in college and I have been having libido problems with previous medication, hence the switching."
4915,"In hopes to get me better by the time break was over, I took the Venlafaxine every other day for a week while taking the new Bupropion, and then completely stopped the Venlafaxine and switched to my new medication."
4916,"Thank you

TL:DR Basically stopped Venlafaxine (an Effexor) cold turkey and switched to a new medication (Bupropion)."
4917,That would get me on the plane without medication.
4918,I'm just getting back from the psychiatrist and I was inspired to write a quick few notes to people who are thinking about trying to get medication or are maybe a bit scared of taking it and are looking for others' opinions.
4919,"An important thing to notice is that **the sample you're** (partially) **basing your medication ideas off of is biased** (being /r/anxiety and /r/depression or related subreddits):

* People are more likely to post about something if it has affected them negatively."
4920,"A small (but very real) percentage does worsen from medications, but this is not representative of the population."
4921,"* People still browsing/subscribed to this subreddit (and related) are likely to still be afflicted by these conditions, and thus have less-than-favorable experiences with medication."
4922,I just want to try and help people who may be unsure about medication (like me before I started taking it).
4923,"I don't want to go on medication, and I don't use any sort of substance (like marijuana)."
4924,"I am not on medication or in therapy right now because I have no health insurance whatsoever, am poor, and live in a country far from my family or other people who could help."
4925,I noticed huge improvements a week in on the meds and have had only a few minor side effects.
4926,Most notably stomach pains in the morning if I do not eat anything with my meds.
4927,"Lately, I have been noticing that I am very antsy, even though I don't feel any real ""anxiety"" symptoms like I was prior to taking the meds."
4928,"I feel like it might be a combination of the meds, and my constant seeking of information that never lets my brain stop."
4929,"I'm seeing a psychiatrist, and we found a good medication for my mood swings... but it doesn't appear to be helping the constant feeling of dread."
4930,"I have another appointment coming up soon, but I really don't like being on medications if I can avoid it."
4931,Is it possible to overcome or should I just resign to living high on meds for the rest of my life ?
4932,I've been doing exceptionally well on my medicine the past few months and just noticed this small regression lately.
4933,"This year was very bad for me, because it took almost all year for me to get on the right medicine and stop having panic attacks and depression."
4934,"He flat out told me that it sounds like I did and that he doesn't know what to do since I'm on the highest levels of medication(1mg Alprazolam, 150mg Effexor) but to change my medication and see him often."
4935,"I have read that this is a common side effect of the medicine, but I am wondering if this is actually causing any real damage to my body."
4936,The medicine is great otherwise.
4937,"Someone already suggested L-Theanine, and I'm just wondering what other meds exist and what your experience has been."
4938,"I'm going to start seeing a new therapist and want to talk to him/her about medication options, and I want to be informed."
4939,"My new doctor, who I saw for the first time ever today, was really great though and told me what I needed to look for and said I'd probably be a little nauseous for the first 5-7 days of starting the meds."
4940,This is my very first medication to treat anxiety so I'm pretty nervous.
4941,"Since then, I've been able to manage my anxiety through medication (Paxil, once a day) and therapy, which I still attend sometimes."
4942,My question is directed at those who also take medication to control symptoms.
4943,"I am aware that the drug is probably still in my body, but I am experiencing psychological symptoms and cannot access my medication right now."
4944,So far it hasn't been SO bad with proper medication and breathing exercises I am getting through it.
4945,"I am also at this dilemma now, because I just drank, and if anything would still happen, I cannot resource to my helpful anxiety medication."
4946,He's tried therapy and medication in the past and is resistant to trying them again because he believes they won't work.
4947,I'm gonna try to distract myself for a little bit and then take my sleeping aid medication.
4948,So I did the only thing besides medication that's been helping: I went into the bathroom and cried.
4949,I go to therapy but don't take meds.
4950,"female, not on meds, really horrible anxiety and OCD problems according to a therapist I had once."
4951,For all I know is the difference between the last two is the ability to prescribe medication.
4952,"Besides medication, that is."
4953,"I have anxiety and depression, and just recently started taking medicine for it (roughly three weeks ago)."
4954,"The medicine was helping a lot, but I now I'm feeling crazy again."
4955,"However, when I started the medicine, I began to feel so much better (generic Lexapro, 10mg)."
4956,"The anxiety is tough - the medicine is still working, so it flares up and then goes away, but I just hate the medicine, and the anxiety too."
4957,"After a summer of hell I finally sought help, and today I was supposed to meet with my therapist for our first session where we would begin CBT and medication."
4958,I'm currently not seeing a therapist or talking meds because I'm too nervous to.
4959,"Furthermore,  his depression went on, eventually got into therapy and on meds, which has made him more of an asshole now than normal."
4960,They stopped me from leaving home for a week until I started a medication called Sertraline.
4961,"No meds for anxiety, as my shrink has believed for the past 6 years that treating my bipolar will also treat my anxiety."
4962,"This is the second round of medications I'm on, the former being Paxil, Topamax [had to stop because of bad side effects], and Klonopin [didn't work at all]."
4963,It turned out that my medication (paxil 20mg) wasn't working anymore.
4964,I took a lorazapam 1mg about 10 minutes ago to try to suppress the attack but I need a way to control it without resorting to cutting or meds.
4965,I can't tell if the medication isn't working or if it's just all this stress.
4966,"I'm a year and a bit into this now, medication free."
4967,"History: I have had anxiety to some degree for as long as I can remember, but only about a year ago decided to seek medication."
4968,"I'm always leery of new medication, and I don't like stimulant effects like energy drinks or caffein."
4969,"They've gotten worse but whatever, I'm extremely happy to be off of medication."
4970,"Since I want to stay far away from meds, I was wondering what natural or homeopathic products or any techniques or resources you guys have in your arsenal."
4971,"I've been on regular medication for anxiety/depression about 8-9 years (alternating between Effexor and Pristiq, with varying doses)."
4972,"After having several breakdowns last semester, I finally accepted that these medications were not working for me (if they ever really were)."
4973,"I'm also scared of being prescribed medication, because my father has been prescribed a ton, and he's pretty much a zombie."
4974,I've never been on any medication for anxiety but it just dawned on me that I might have a mild case.
4975,The bigger problem is that I'm not sure my medication is helping the actual problem.
4976,"Does this sound like a medication problem, or something else?"
4977,I'm not sure if there are any other anti-anxiety meds I'm interested in testing.
4978,I absolutely hate meds.
4979,"TL;DR: After a successful month of reducing anxiety and panic attacks, without meds just changing diet, positive thinking, and talking it out to many support resources, catastrophic thinking comes back the day after seeing the psychiatrist and I'm having trouble sleeping, staying calm, and focusing."
4980,"Many say medication may not work for everyone, and it's true."
4981,"Even though I've been taking my meds, and took them before surgery, and went in feeling just slightly nervous (a miracle, I thought!)"
4982,"I was off my meds for a couple days ( due to being broke and not being able to pay for my prescription) and I didnt grind my teeth or clench my jaw 90% of the time, and my joints barely hurt..I didn't have any anxiety and I was fine aside from the withdrawl symptoms of dizziness and  my eyes spazzing out."
4983,Put on anxiety medication.
4984,"But when i'm mid-anxiety attack (right now), or curiously, when I'm taking anti-anxiety medication (the worst for it was buspirone) I have just... insane dreams."
4985,"I have never been diagnosed with anxiety disorder, nor taken any medication for it."
4986,Was on several meds up until I was about 15 and my therapist and psych weaned me off of them over time.
4987,"Which brings me to the medication issue: I used to take Lunesta, but when I switched pain meds (now Dilaudid and Methadone) I had to stop taking anything of the sort."
4988,"I see a therapist and psychiatrist, and take antianxiety meds."
4989,"I see a therapist, I take medications, I meditate and although I really should be calling my therapist, I just need to write this out and see if anyone has any similar experiences."
4990,I'm not on any anxiety meds btw.
4991,"So after years without feeling any abnormal anxiety without medication, i experienced some of the horrors again."
4992,Glad that I'm okay now and don't need any meds while staying at home.
4993,"The past two years have been filled with psychiatric visits and trials of more medication than I can count, before two months ago, when I decided to go off all of my meds and fight this with my own power."
4994,Is there any safe short term meds I can get that will calm me down but not make me obviously drugged?
4995,"So I started my first round of medication,  20mg fluoxetine."
4996,"Im paranoid about this medication now, im not sure if I want to take any more"
4997,I'm just very new to the meds world (only nearly two months) and I appreciate all of the feedback that I can get from experienced people.
4998,I was about 2-3 hours late for taking my meds but I don't think that caused it?
4999,I take medication to help control my anxiety/depression.
5000,"I have started the process of trying different medications about 3 months ago, after having my second child."
5001,"However, being laid off has shattered my confidence, and I have changed medications and/or dosages 3 times now in 3 months...and this week has just been really hard."
5002,"With how long it takes for medication to work, will the medication even help me before the end of the semester, anyway?"
5003,"I haven’t gone to my last two therapy appointments because I just don’t feel that I can leave the house (thank goodness my school offers some of their classes online) and I have cancelled on my psychiatrist (just gives me meds) twice, as well."
5004,"As for medicine, I currently have a few .5 mg Ativan from a previous doctor that I take in extreme emergencies and I have .5 mg of Klonopin and Celexa from my psychiatrist."
5005,I have been on it for three days now and it's my first time taking a medication like this.
5006,The topic of meds comes up between my therapist and I once in a while.
5007,"To paraphrase her: I take daily multivitamins, the majority of which likely won't even be absorbed into my body, but I won't consider meds which could help me a great deal."
5008,I realize that reading up on individuals' experiences with the meds themselves won't help much since our chemistries are all so darn different.
5009,"I really don't want to go on long-term medicine, because I already take a lot of pills for my physical health."
5010,"I've been doing my research and saw that switching medications can help curb this, but in the meantime I've decided to add exercise into my daily routine (I eat pretty clean as it is...which is why the weight gain is so infuriating)."
5011,"So, my question is this: has anyone managed to beat the weight gain WITHOUT changing medication?"
5012,"I feel like going to my doctor and saying I want to change medicine because I gained some weight sounds weak, but if it comes to that I'm willing."
5013,"I'm supposed to be starting medication, Wellbutrin, to be exact, but the first day I took it I was so nauseous all day that I haven't taken it since."
5014,I am soon to be 28 have been on meds since about 22.
5015,First zoloft and klonopin which ultimately side effects were too much went through a-z different meds and ultimately was on lexapro 20mg and 1mg xanax for attacks for about 4-5 years.
5016,I weaned myself off my medication at the beginning of highschool and didn't have any major attacks till I left for college.
5017,"With medication, it's really a flip of the coin."
5018,Who else is going through this without medication?
5019,"I'm a little nervous about taking it, as I have never been on medication before."
5020,I'm always blown away when I hear about things like this knowing if I hadn't gone in I would never have been told or realized that maybe my out of control anxiety is being worsened by the very medicine I take to make it better.
5021,He is going to have me try out zoloft in addition to other medicine and I'll stop taking Xanax and see how it goes.
5022,"Since then, it generally only got bad enough to require medication once or twice a month, though it's been kinda bad these last couple days."
5023,"So, I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and have been on medication and coping with it for about 5 years now."
5024,"Her senior year in high school, we had a heart-to-heart about how she was struggling to feel motivated and appreciate life, and I shared how my own experiences led me to believe that medication wasn't a bad thing in situations like this."
5025,"My mom is taking her to the doctor to get another opinion and look into medication options, based on the school counselor's recommendation."
5026,I found out that he was given medication at a doctors appointment that day...I guess he decided there wasn't enough time for it to work.
5027,Luckily a doctor gave me medicine and it worked for me.
5028,"I'm afraid of meds, but so far calming exercises aren't working."
5029,"It is as simple as believing you are okay
If you are scared of something do not let that stop you from doing it, FEAR IS NOT REAL, Most fear that stems from anxiety comes from a fear of the unknown or the nonphysical so why worry about something that is essentially nothing
It does go away, and you don't need to tell yourself it won't, that's extremely counter-productive

Anxiety is something we as ALL humans have evolved to have, it helps us when the situation arises, right now your brain is just fritzing and stressing about every little thought ""would a crazy person think this"" ""Why am I acting this way"" ""will I ever go back to normal"" Guess what guys, you are already normal, you don't need meds or even a therapist."
5030,"My doctor also told me to get a new job, as my current job is the main source of my anxiety and depression and told me ""there's medication... medication that can help you out, but you don't want to take these things just to make your boss' and coworkers' behaviour more tolerable..."" and then I realised it..."
5031,"I don't want to feel nuts every day, I don't want to end up taking medication just cause somebody else is treating me bad, I just can avoid it by quitting there and I bet I'd be more happier washing toilets somewhere without constant stress and being treated like crap even though I have an important office job."
5032,"I've been lurking in this subreddit for quite a while and i wanted to share my experiences with all the people who have tried medication and it didn't work, people who are skeptical about meds or just all the people who are considering taking them."
5033,"I thought it had something to do with high blood pressure, which runs in the family, so i just got a stronger medication for that."
5034,My doctor said that i should try medication to help me with the anxiety.
5035,At the time i was still skeptical about taking medication.
5036,For some reason i had the stupid opinion that medication that helps with anxiety/depression and related issues turns you into a grinning zombie version of yourself and just changes who you are.
5037,"So, after some reluctance i agreed to try some meds for a few weeks."
5038,"My doctor reassured me that this could happen and that there are more medications out there, so he gave me 20mg Citalopram, which i take to this day."
5039,"A few days into taking my meds i felt a huge panic attack coming on, so i took one of them and they helped me within a minute."
5040,"He even said that we might be able to get me off the meds in 2014, if the positive progress continues like that, but we'll see."
5041,I just wanted to share my story with all the people who may still be on the fence about taking medication.
5042,Don't be like me and just flat out think that meds are terrible and refuse them.
5043,"If that person suggests that you should try some meds, then do it!"
5044,I'm not as anxious as usual but I feel that the side effects of these medications are not worth the slight lowering of anxiety.
5045,"But when you're taking meds, getting pregnant is a risk you shouldn't take."
5046,"So if you're taking psychotropic meds, and you're getting a little frisky, wrap it up!"
5047,"If you do want to get pregnant, or just plain don't want to use a rubber, let your psychiatrist know so s/he can put you on one of the meds that doesn't cause birth defects."
5048,"I won't go into detail on my anxiety issues, but this is the first anti anxiety medicine I've ever been prescribed."
5049,"I guess Tramadol doesn't mix well with a ton of different anti anxiety meds, so he said we'd start here."
5050,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently going off all my meds for depression and anxiety on the advice of my doctor."
5051,"I've tried a cocktail of medications, some of which make it worse and others have had little to no effect."
5052,I dont want to take medicine because I know it is not good to take antidepressants.
5053,"So, I was really afraid to take a medication prescribed to me by a doctor I am not so trusting of."
5054,"I saw my psychologist yesterday and he basically said that yes, side effects are scary with any medication."
5055,"He said that my fear was rational based on my personal history with medications either not working or giving me really bad side effects, that this one sounded super scary."
5056,Update #1: It's been 48 hours and I'm tolerating the medicine.
5057,"My questions are:

Has anyone experienced anxiety spikes after the effects of their ADD medication wears off?"

5065,"I have noticed that my anxiety, even with medication and therapy, has been higher than it's been in well over a decade."
5066,Does it make you feel fantastic to know that i'm 20 years old and already on medication because of the anxiety i've developed because of you?
5067,"It was starting to get really bad, and about a month and a half ago i started my medication."
5068,I'm worried since I've tried anxiety medication and antidepressants that this could be the end of my quest to get better.
5069,":( But my brother stole them all when he was on his idiotic ""Let's swallow everyone's medication for my own special high"" phase."
5070,"Don't really want to take an SSRI either.. tbh, I don't like taking meds."
5071,"Taking a new medication has always been a massive trigger for me, especially ones that have noticeable effects."
5072,A big trigger for me is not feeling like myself which is why I stopped doing all drugs and am wary of new medication since I developed anxiety.
5073,I have even been thinking to take medications but I do not know what to take :( What are your tips?
5074,I read that Propranolol would be a good medication that would solve this issue?

5076,Is this common for this type of medication?
5077,I don't know what kind(s) of medication to ask for though.

5084,"I have been off of my meds (300mg Wellbutrin XL + .25mg generic Xanax) for almost a year due to a very supportive boyfriend and normal, healthy relationship."
5085,"if i take medication, i will become dependent and won't be able to control it myself."
5086,what about other anti-anxiety medications?
5087,"please give me your stories about any anxiety medications, and anything about hypochondria as well."
5088,I was put on a mix of the two medications.
5089,I would just like some more insight to these medications.
5090,I don't know if its just a side effect from the paxil or is it a combination of quitting smoking on top of the medication and just generally trying to be healthy.
5091,Are there other medications I could try?
5092,"My point is this: whether it be the medicine or the techniques or something else, looking forward to something really helps."

5094,"It should only take a couple days until my medication is in my hands, and subsequently, in my system."
5095,"One of my cousins tried meds, and they just didn't really work for her."
5096,"4 blood tests, 1 urine test, 3 MRIs, about 14 X-rays, 1 bladder function analysis, 2 sleep oximeter tests, a neurologist appointment, an ophthalmologist appointment, a neuro-ophthalmologist appointment, 3 internal medicine appointments, a consult with endocrinology, a consult with rheumatology and a 6 hour blood pressure test all in one week."
5097,So i diagnosed myself with minor GAD (haven't been to a doctor yet and honestly i don't want to (i've read so much about pills people can't get away from that i really dont see that taking medicine is an option)).
5098,"Not currently taking any medications, but have been on antidepressants and mild anti-anxiety meds in the past."

5101,Anyone have experience with medication (SSRI's) that do not cause weight gain?

5113,"I tried to avoid the meds, I even started having sessions (once per week) with a psychologist but 2 months later, yeah I could cope with some stuff but not everything and well, it got to the point where my therapist said ""You anxiety is out of control""."
5114,Because I really know meds are only part of the solution.
5115,This is more related to the medicine than to sex itself which is why I posted here.

5120,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEU97niHvjk

I NEVER thought I could deal with my anxiety without medication."
5121,I'm not sure I need medication as it doesn't affect me regularly- just when I get an ache and I think 'oh that's the HIV' I have had a few symptoms that could be linked to seroconversion- but in any normal person I think they would be passed off as normal.
5122,"we can just go get diagnosed, get seizure meds, and everything will be better!"

5124,medication?

5131,"I may be able to afford different help besides just medication in the future, but right now I can't."
5132,"I'm not comfortable with increasing my medication dose, because right now it causes me to occasionally become overly excited."
5133,"I've had pretty bad anxiety for quite a while, and finally got put on medication over the summer (mostly thanks to the support of my family and my wonderful boyfriend)."
5134,I'm very hesitant to tell my family or what friends I have about getting medication (started on Escitalopram).
5135,"i had anxiety for years, and it would last for days and weeks, tried every pill on the market, all didn't work, until a decent doctor prescribed Anafranil sr 75 for me, its a tricyclic antidepressants, really old, the patent has long ran out, so big companies and doctors don't publicizes it cause they don't make money on it, its been years and haven't had a single panic attack, here is a good website to look at what patients think about different medications:

5137,I've seen a therapist and a psychiatrist once for a consult about medication.
5138,"My concern is that I won't be able to drink as much, or if I do drink as much as I normally do, I'll be doing more harm than good with the meds."
5139,And really the worst part if I'm on meds that are supposed to help.
5140,"I really think I need some medication or something to help me out, but I have no idea how I could get that."

5142,I've been on meds when my anxiety was REALLY affecting my life.
5143,"My anxiety was gone and I was having the time of my life, fast forward to last week and I came to realize that these two drugs are fucking my life up (I'm usually a B+ A- kind of student and now I'm failing 2 classes) I was suffering from memory problems that i found out was related to the klonopin so I threw the medicine away and quit cold turkey."
5144,"However, I feel like I need to start treating my social anxiety disorder first because I'm starting university in less than a month (where I'll start by pursuing a bachelor's degree in biomedicine) and even the thought of having to meet new people and having to give presentations (etc) in the future freaks me out so much a part of my brain tells me to not go to university at all."
5145,When the medication started to work I felt really bubbly and confident.
5146,I do not like the way this medication makes me feel.
5147,I've searched and read all over this sub wherein people have said that you have to stick with it and give it a month to see if it's the right medicine.
5148,I don't think I have the wherewithal to keep going through these crappy side effects with the hope that this medicine may work out for me.

5161,"(I know it's a big cocktail which sucks, and I try to take as few pain meds as possible)

I'm only 3 doses in with the slightly higher K-pin dosage and the BusPar, but I think I'm doing better."
5162,"I DO feel like I currently need it on a daily basis, as demonstrated by the fact that I avoided going to a psych for medication for YEARS before finally agreeing with my therapist it was probably needed."
5163,"ETA: I am posting primarily because it took me a long time to accept I need meds, and now I feel like the internet is telling me I'm using the wrong one, even though it's currently helping me greatly."
5164,They want me to go from once a week to once every other week and they wonder when I can get off my medication.
5165,My therapist wants me to continue making progress and wants to see me once a week while staying on my medication (a small dose anti-depressant which has really helped with my anxiety).
5166,"I hate being dependent on medication, but my own weakness combined with a major lack of support (both personal and psychiatric) makes this feel impossible to overcome."
5167,Has anyone else experienced a change in side effects after restarting meds?
5168,How do you know when to take something - obviously it'll look odd if you mid-speech reach out for meds?
5169,"How do you decide when it's the right time, and aren't you afraid of getting hooked on the meds?"

5180,I feel like all I can do is to take medication that will make me tired so I can sleep the rest of the day away.

I have suffered from severe generalized anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember and have been taking medication and receiving therapy for a few years now."
5185,What medications are available to treat anxiety besides the standard antidepressants and benzodiazepines?
5186,"I've tried many of the non-prescription medications, but the only ones that had much success were the more dangerous (e.g., phenibut and etizolam) or cost-prohibitive (selank and N-acetyl selank) and those still turned out to be less effective than Klonopin."
5187,"they told me I'm required to continue counseling to stay on my meds, and I have to go to a monthly med check to stay on them, but the counseling centers are closed during the summer."

5189,"I've been on so many different medications over the past 14 years, but nothing really helps."

5210,"And I hate always bringing up that she needs to see a therapist or medication, because it was leads to her saying, I can’t take that medicine because it gives you parkinsons, and I can’t take that one it has this side effect and that one."
5211,Does anyone have any recommendations for a good medication that wont make me a zombie?
5212,"I live in a state with atrocious mental health care, and after a nervous breakdown and insurance mess ups that left me without my medication I finally got everything headed in the right direction (or so I thought)."
5213,"I'm back on my meds, and waited three months to see my therapist."

5215,I have an irrational fear of overdosing on medication so even taking Ativan makes me anxious and it's a fight within to take it.

5217,I opted for medication at this point due to my problem with social anxiety.
5218,"First time posting on here, I'm 21/F, have had anxiety forever but recently it's been unbearable so for the first time I'm considering medication."
5219,"Problem is, I don't have a usual doctor, so I don't even know where to go, and even if I do, I'm broke as hell so I'm not even positive I could afford any meds or whatever else."
5220,"By mid-May I was feeling a LOT better, I continued CBT, and continued taking my medicine and whatnot and it was awesome, I had a great May-June, towards the end of June I started feeling a bit sad/depressed but it turned around one day and I felt even better than before, it literally felt like I was pretty much over my major panic attacks and anxiety!"
5221,I explained this to my parents and they're contacting my doctor at home to see about my meds and whatnot.
5222,"After I stopped taking them, the withdrawals made me realize the extent to which the medication was affecting me, and I was terrified."
5223,"This year has been the worst I've had, and it's making me consider medication again."
5224,"I know my bad experience in the past was just because that wasn't the right pill for me, but I can't help but worry that medication will turn me into a different person."
5225,"So, what made you decide to/not to take medication?"
5226,I've never been on medication or seen a therapist.
5227,"I'm starting to feel like I can really benefit from returning to therapy and medication, but being untreated, I'm very, very anxious about returning, largely because I left without notice last time."
5228,Hey guys I need help my little sister started texting me tonight from her room which in itself was weird she called me in and talked about how she was not feeling right and didn't know what to do and that she thought she may need medication.
5229,"I am on 80mg, and for the last few months I have had the WORST heartburn after taking my meds."
5230,"I was trying to take them in the morning after brushing my teeth, cause I forget if I don't, but a half hour later, I am suffering re-flux and tasting the medication."
5231,"Other than the heartburn, the meds are working well - so I would hate to change..."
5232,But I also don't want to be dependent on this medication... What would one of you do in this situation?
5233,"Also trying to figure out meds for hypothyroidism (might be a contributing factor, we'll see)."
5234,I'm skeptical about the relation however since I only experienced immediate physical anxiety symptoms (in absence of any anxious thoughts) for a day or two after beginning meds.
5235,I am considering medication and trying to figure out how to fix this.
5236,"I should say that I do have medication: I take 150mg venlafaxine daily for depression, and I do have prescriptions for 25mg hydroxyzine and 0.5mg clonazepam that I take as needed for my anxiety."
5237,"Talk to a psych doctor at the hospital, wanted me to start medication but also wanted me to come to the mental health clinic for in-house help (7-10 days)."
5238,"I have gone to see my primary care doctor and she put me on some new medication about 3 weeks ago, and told me to just wait it out."
5239,"I was very hesitant to get on medication, I'm on Prozac and I take hydroxyzine as needed."
5240,"Today I told a friend how I've been on meds for a month and they said ""yeah they work now but good luck functioning without them in the future""."
5241,I don't want to be on medication forever and I don't want to have horrible withdrawal symptoms when I get off it.
5242,"He was able to stabilise through therapy and medication, and has been developing coping strategies since."
5243,"About a year ago, he stopped taking medication (it made him feel dissociative all the time) and has been controlling his anxiety mainly through exercise and thoughts strategies he picked up during therapy."
5244,"Arguments with my husband, a new medication that I'm trying to adjust to, prescribed time off of work with lost wages, water damage, one of the worst panic attacks I've ever experienced."
5245,"**

Lastly, I have the option of medicine."
5246,"She had a friend who went on medication for depression, and it decreased her efficiency at work, and changed her personality."
5247,"She also has a sister who went on medication for depression, too, and says that her sister is dependent on the medication, and slower because of it."
5248,**Should I not take medicine?
5249,I don't want to fucking go on medication!
5250,I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for a few years now I was able to handle up until I finished university during my final year I just seemed to have had a melt down and ended up having to go to the doctors for medication and then ended up having counselling as well.
5251,"I started learning to drive when I was a teenager, but a lot of awful things happened and I developed full-blown symptoms of PTSD, which took me off the road for a few years due to medication side effects and so on."
5252,For the majority of my life I've had my medications prescribed by my general medical practitioner.
5253,"Currently I'm towards the higher level of medication that my doctor normally prescribes, and I'm doing my best to practice the things I've learned in therapy, but I'm still having some anxiety, and now depression."
5254,Just calmed myself down from a panic attack without my medicine.
5255,Just wanted to share because I'm proud of myself for not having to take my meds to calm me down.
5256,"I am back on my *own* meds, and the oxy is now in another room to avoid future mistakes, but it was interesting getting a taste of cold turkey."
5257,"- If you were able to conquer this with the assistance of medication, what are you taking, and why specifically (what is it used to combat)?"
5258,"I'm cutting again, I've stopped taking my meds..."
5259,"I got my meds and immediately i panicked about taking them, even though I've done it plenty of times before and everything turned out okay."
5260,I feel like this when I take medicine of any kind actually.
5261,"my medicine, i forgot yesterday and chose not to take today."
5262,Should I look into medication?
5263,"I was fine at first, but good lawd, hell hath no fury like a body without its usual meds."
5264,"The doctors didn't actually put me on any medication until after the surgery, (lexapro and xanax) for long standing ""anticipatory anxiety"", meaning that even now almost 4 years later I still have problems eating, or even looking at food."
5265,"I can't afford to see a shrink, I can barely afford the medication."
5266,"Im wondering If anyone on here has tried exercise regularly with medication to help there anxiety and or depression, and im wondering how its worked for you."
5267,My friends believe I have anxiety and could benefit from meds and/or therapy.
5268,I've been diagnosed with bad anxiety disorder and have been in and out of therapy and on meds for years.
5269,I'm seeing my doctor at some point this week because my current anti anxiety medication isn't effective.
5270,"I know anti anxiety meds tend to make you drowsy as a side effect, so the less drowsy the medication the better for me (I do a lot of physical stuff and work requires me to be alert)."
5271,"I know one of the major meds known as Xanax is supposed to be less drowsy, which is a plus."
5272,Has anyone else experienced this during an anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medication switch?
5273,"I found out quickly I failed to do my vocabulary, and went to a place that only dealt with medication and not a place where I could sit and talk my problems out."
5274,"I was called in after taking my drug test and was in front of a woman who asked me a list of questions and the whole time I was doing my best to be 100% honest because I didn't want to be that guy who faked it, I was so afraid I would get medication and not actually need it because I really was just a pansy on the inside."
5275,This was completely opposite from what I had expected (ADHD) but I guess the medication is the same for both.
5276,"I began getting tired again about 3 months into my medication and was upped to 3 pills a day, and have felt no effects."
5277,"I did however run out for about a week, and for the first time felt the difference the medication made for my Anxiety, I literally teared up in my car and begged my insurance company to allow me to get some meds due to the attack I was having."
5278,"At this point, stopping the attacks is all the meds are doing, which is enough for me to want to keep taking it, but I miss the energy, I was happy for 3 months and it has faded and I don't know how to get it back."
5279,"This is the main reason I can't go to any psychiatrists/psychologists or get medication or anything of that sort, because my parents refuse to believe I have an issues."
5280,My meds don't do squat for anxiety or obsessive thoughts.
5281,"I was diagnosed, but never took any meds for it."
5282,"I went out of state a few ays ago and brought my wellbutrin with me, i took it as directed every single day and had only mild anxiety, but when i got back I discovered they lost my baggage, which had my medication (and only debit card) in it."
5283,"Hello there, I suffer from Anxiety but I don't think it is so bad that I need to be put on medications so I heard about Herbal Supplements, I was wondering if any of you has used it?"
5284,"I'm bipolar, and recently just got taken off all my medicines for health reasons, but they kept me on an anxiety medication since that has been a huge problem for me, and it's not working."
5285,So over the last few weeks I've been coming off my of anti-depressants and anxiety medication.
5286,"I was in the middle of changing medications as well during all this, so I've been a complete and total wreck."
5287,"I manage to deal with my random dizzy spells, throat tightness, or panic attacks pretty well and am currently not on meds."
5288,or should I try going on some sort of anxiety medication?
5289,I've been on and off anti-anxiety medication.
5290,I'm just curious as to anyone else out there.....were you able to take medication during the pregnancy?
5291,Maybe without meds or talking with a therapist.
5292,I would love to be able to have meds to cure it and make me more relaxed so I can make it to the interviews but it's not possible right now.
5293,"On the thyroid medication, I felt apathetic and very very relaxed."
5294,I finally reduced my dosage of thyroid medication on doctor's advice.
5295,Between the slowing thyroid meds and now the hyper anxiety I find it almost impossible to do the process properly.
5296,"), but not if the medication stalls or worsens the weight."
5297,I'm starting to work myself up into fearing my panic disorder returning or the medication not working any more.
5298,"** I've tried Celexa, Effexor, Wellbutrin, and a whole lot of everything else, and I'm more or less convinced meds aren't my answer."
5299,No way in hell do I want to end up on meds when I'm older.
5300,I never had an issue with this before taking the medicine.
5301,Does anyone have any experience with this side effect and does anybody know if it will go away once I get used to the medicine?
5302,Ive made massive improvement and had just 2 days where 1 was i changed medication and got to experience the lovely side effects.
5303,"What i didn't do (But can still work for you):

* Meditate 
* Take meds (Saw the stories)
* Therapy

It was pretty bad i would wake up thinking ""oh i'm not anxious hopfully i'm not later"" Then i would cling on to that thought so hard that it made me anxious if i thought anything else then panic sets in."
5304,Never been on any meds.
5305,"Everyone tells her to take antianxiety meds, including her therapist, but she is incredibly against taking meds."
5306,What are medications that are safe to take while one is trying to conceive?
5307,"Ladies with anxiety, how did getting pregnant or being pregnant work with or without meds?"
5308,"Someone recently asked me what the relief from anxiety felt like, getting to have medication."
5309,Taking my meds is like the prison finally letting me out into the courtyard.
5310,Was waiting for my medicine to kick in.
5311,"I've only ever had two panic attacks, one about a year and a half ago and one a month or so ago and I was like 'surely I don't have anxiety, it's just fresher nerves' but it's got to the point where I have been back to my doctor several times about it and been put on the waiting list for therapy and been prescribed meds and I'm scared."
5312,I'm not on any medications however i used to take Xanax recreationally and had a pretty bad time when i stopped.
5313,"I have no way of getting any medication because I haven't needed it in a long time, so I didn't stock up."
5314,Let me preface this with the fact that my medication regimen has kind of been messed up so I am having high anxiety.
5315,"Whenever I see posts on this sub regarding anxiety attacks, medication and seriously crippling conditions, I just feel bad for wanting to talk about myself on here."
5316,"These are side effects I don't want to experience, so I have not began taking the meds."
5317,I am at my wit's end because nothing seems to help and I really don't want to be on medication that could possibly make my anxiety worse.
5318,TL;DR **I'm posting to ask for advice on my situation (if you were patient enough to read my post) as well as your opinions on anti-anxiety meds.
5319,How did you get used to the medication and how has it affected your life?
5320,They said that the other adult is there to talk about what they have seen as far as my behavior and to be there in case any medicine is prescribed.
5321,He knows that I've been on medicine before and a lot of the not-so-great details of my past treatment but there are still some things I'd like to keep to myself.
5322,Cue new meds for him.
5323,"It's frustrating because I have had so much time to get over this, and I've been doing all the right things (therapy, meds, exercise, diet, work, etc), but I feel like I'm exactly where I was when I was with him."
5324,Would prefer those not we requiring medication :)
5325,.The doctor is lowering me from 112 mcg of medication to 100mcg.
5326,"TL;DR How will .5mg, possibly 1mg of Lorazepam affect a 21 year-old male, currently not on any medication, that has to give 4 class presentations, but gets very anxious?"
5327,"Even if I'm sick with just a common cold, I can't take any cold medication."
5328,So no more medicine ever again unless administered by a doctor.
5329,Another reason for my nervous breakdown was that I was put on medication and my doctor didn't tell me what the sideffects were.
5330,"I spoke to my doctor about my anxiety nearly a year ago, and she prescribed me some medication for my condition (cipralex, 10mg/day)."
5331,"I'm also on anti-anxiety meds, so this is just one other step I've taken to help my anxiety"
5332,"I'm on a medication that took away all the severe symptoms like that, but everything just seems like it's too much and I can't do it."
5333,At what point do I ask for an up-dose of meds?
5334,Now physiatrist have put me on meds and I’ve been going on Zoloft for about four weeks.
5335,"I’m getting worse and while I know it can take longer for the meds to kick in, I’m starting to feel discouraged."
5336,"The fact that darkness does depress me is why I started on meds in the first place, and I’m scared we won’t have time to start another medicine before I’m practically unable to get out of bed."
5337,"When I first started therapy we briefly touched on the subject of some medications, nothing in particular just basically that it can affect libido but that it sometimes is a necessary boost to important chemicals within the brain."
5338,I have an appointment with my therapist on Thursday and I think we are going to explore some options for medication.
5339,"Anyways I just was hoping to hear from some people who have been using medication, both positive and negative experiences would be appreciated."
5340,"I wasn't keen on taking any medication, so I declined.)"
5341,"I hate meds, I tried to take celexa and some other meds."
5342,"I haven't done anything about it either, I've been introverted because it's all related to university, I don't want meds that will go on my record..."
5343,"Everything kind of turned black (im sure you guys know what im talking about) and while it seems like that could be because of 1)new meds 2)not much eating and 3)headphones, it freaked me out and gave me a panic attack."
5344,I've taken medications before but they make me feel detached and emotionless so I am not taking them at the moment.
5345,"Other than that, I do not take medication and don't plan to because I am sure that I can control this with a bit of reluctant therapy."
5346,I've tried so many medications and I'm bad at therapy.
5347,"He was insensitive, and made me feel pressured to stop taking the medication, despite my recent self-harm and thoughts of suicide."
5348,"I'm almost afraid that my brain is simply refusing to be ""fooled"" by the medication if that makes sense."
5349,That and social anxiety mixed in makes me wonder what kind of medication might actually work for me...(Oh and apparently I can't take antidepressants because I likely have low-level bipolar?)
5350,No meds needed.
5351,She has always suffered from depression and been on medication from it.
5352,She has stopped taking her medications several times recently and I have noticed how badly it has affected her mental health.
5353,Not sure if Zoloft or any medication at all is right for me since the common side-effects scare me shitless.
5354,"I told her I wasn't sure if I wanted to commit to medication on the long term, like you're meant to do with this drug, which she understood."
5355,"It's not very difficult for me to speak openly about my issues, but my therapist said it would probably be beneficial for me to start taking some kind of medication so I could get a break from the anxiety while I start sorting through my issues in therapy."
5356,Should I try and overcome my fear of SSRI side-effects and take the drug; rely on therapy alone; or discuss other types of medication with my doctor?
5357,"I didn't change anything as far as medications (besides increasing my xanax dose, which helped to an extent) around the time I noticed an increase in anxiety symptoms, frequency, and severity."
5358,"Since then, I have changed my medication regimen almost entirely."
5359,"Currently, I am taking the following meds:
Dextroamphetamine - 40mg every morning and 20mg at noon
Effexor XR - 37.5mg (In the process of discontinuing)
Xanax - 4-6mg/day (usually in doses of 2mg at a time)
Remeron - 15mg (Although I'm not sure if I want to stay on this)

I was wondering if anyone has had any luck with medications that affect glutamate activity."
5360,"I also don't like taking meds, they helped but they made me so sleepy and lazy that it's almost the same as being dead."
5361,"I've always been resistant to medication, I was prescribed some anti-depressants (SSRIs) in the summer of 2012 but never took them."
5362,So I've decided I have to stop resisting it and go on medication.
5363,"I don't know how to tell them I'm not better, I want to go back into therapy this summer, and go on medication, and continue to work on my mental health."
5364,I'm on meds and usually feel fine.
5365,"I know meds should be a last resort, and I'm not even sure if medication can help with something so weird, but I'm looking for anything to help me get rid of this - even if it's for an hour or two."
5366,"She's too afraid of medication to take anything to knock her out to sleep (nyquil used to help), and I just don't know what to do."
5367,"After that I saw several therapists, was put on medication (Xanax and several others), and was generally miserable."
5368,During the time I was on medication I had many angry outbursts and was very unstable emotionally.
5369,After a year of the medication I refused to take it any longer because I felt as if I was not in control of myself anymore.
5370,A few months after I went off the medication my parents did something that made me never trust them again.
5371,I guess it is a side effect of the medicine I've never had but I just can't control it anymore.
5372,Even now after the meds are over I am focusing on something odd I feel in my tooth and wondering if it's a piece of food that is going to get infected despite it being there for at least a week or two or who knows how long.
5373,"I am open to the idea of medication, though that frightens me too."
5374,"We sought help for her together, as far as the meds part of it."
5375,But I saw her progression and how the meds helped her stabilize.
5376,I've always had anxiety issues and was diagnosed with PTSD at a pretty young age and I was taking meds for it before my mother stopped me (she saw somewhere that someone committed suicide while taking them and she took the liberty of making the decision to stop me).
5377,"I'm almost out of medication and need to go to the doctors to get some more, and my dad usually rings to make the appointment for me, but this time he wants me to do it."
5378,What if they don't have any appointments before my medication runs out?
5379,"Last appointment the doctor said come back after [something mumbled] month/s and I've left it two months because that is how much medication I've had, what if he actually said one month?"
5380,"But my anxiety has gotten bad enough I need medication again, and while this worked with some obvious side effects, I wasn't sure if anyone else had any luck with it, maybe at a different dose or anything."
5381,"The most recent psychiatrist I saw told me ""it's okay that you sometimes don't want to get out of bed, you don't need medication"" and I've been pill-free for about 7 years now."
5382,"But a few years ago, I decided to stop taking medication."
5383,if they're any medications that he can take and so on and fourth.
5384,"Currently I'm on my parents insurance (full time student with part time job) and they believe I dont need medication, despite what I have been told by professionals."
5385,I do take medication but it does not help much.
5386,"I don't smoke, drink or take drugs and I'm not on any prescription medication."
5387,Plus I can't take anti-anxiety medications.
5388,"I stopped using my medication, as well as exercising and because I was up all night asleep all day my schedule fell apart."
5389,"Finally after a month I quit, but I feel like a let my Mom down who has been paying for my meds and therapy."
5390,I'v just been look blankly at my meds wondering to myself what's the point of even trying again?
5391,"i went to a shrink once a month, occasionally took meds."
5392,"She continues to suffer from depression among other things, although she will not allow herself to get help or medication."
5393,"However, I was diagnosed on several occasions growing up as having social anxiety disorder and/or moderate GAD, which can become rather severe due to hormonal fluctuations, and I cannot afford my medication anymore."
5394,"So I'm going to ask my doctor to prescribe me a Benzo, it's the only medication I think is going to have an effect on my anxiety."
5395,And if you want to share about any other medication for anxiety that has worked for you I'd love to hear about it.
5396,"I'm on the verge of getting myself a knife to protect myself (that's so absurd, I know) or getting off my medication."
5397,I really need some advice on this issue because I don't want this new medication to affect my ability to hang out with my friends on the weekends.
5398,"I am in therapy, but am not on any medications."
5399,"I have gone through the a-z in therapists and therapy, i've done bio and nuero feedback I take medication and finally landed my first job."
5400,I had Monday-Tuesday off was suppose to go in yesterday but called out and went to my doctors and he proscribed me medicine.
5401,Tried the medications (9 of them) when this all started and was admitted to a hospital from all of the fucked up thoughts i endured from the medications.
5402,I've talk to a few therapists and tell them about the horrible experiences i've had with the medications and that i refuse to take them.
5403,"At first, they were all fine with just talking to me, but they all ended up at the same place which was ""i want you to see my psychiatrist to get a low dose of medicine."""
5404,"I have been managing this for all my life, I was always and anxious child, but I have personally not been open to trying medication as a treatment."
5405,No medication or professional help.
5406,"I keep it fairly under control most of the time now, thanks to therapy and medication, but there are moments of intense anxiety that I still experience."
5407,"im running out of my meds, plus i wanted to change a second medication im taking."
5408,looks like im gonna go back on benzos as thats the only thing my GP(s) (yes i have two cause i was hoping one would understand mental health medication) want to give me.
5409,i am not on any other medication.
5410,Not sure if I want medications like pills.
5411,I have been in therapy and on medication for a long time and thought I had it pretty well under control.
5412,Started taking medication for it (~6mo ago) which have really helped with the panic attacks.
5413,Have been on medication twice for brief periods of time (Buspirone &amp; Lexapro.)
5414,Vomited and took meds because I was so worked up.
5415,Is there anything I can do besides meds to help this?
5416,I eventually took myself off of the medication in college because It was so reliable that I could cope pretty easily by just forcing myself to make it through the really rough days.
5417,During my first pregnancy I asked to be put back on the medication because I was having problems.
5418,"I waited a long time to talk to my doctor about it, thinking that I really couldn't possibly be depressed because I was already on medication."
5419,"Again, like the time before, I hesitated to discuss it with my doctor because I was already on a medication."
5420,I frequently tell people that being on the wrong medication (or the wrong dose) is worse than being on nothing at all.
5421,I had severe anxiety that the medication did not seem to be touching.
5422,"I was also breastfeeding, meaning I was not able to take any kind of medication to assist with the short term symptoms when the attacks came on."
5423,But I'm totally freaked out about starting different meds.
5424,tl;dr: I don't think I'm on the right medication but trying to find the right medication/dose can be torture and I'm not sure I'm ready to go through that again.
5425,"After being on Celexa for almost a year, I think I'm ready to try and be off meds for a little while -- or at least try a new/better anti-anxiety med."
5426,My doctor is very... conservative and didn't want me on two medications so she told me to stop both (cold turkey- she said my dose is low enough) and started me on trazodone to help both issues.
5427,"I have found myself in a bit of a catch-22: My anxiety is so high that my therapist strongly recommends medication so that I can effectively engage in therapy, however my anxiety is so high that I'm afraid of starting a new medication."
5428,"My side effects were so bad that I didn't make it through the first week (constant nausea and diarrhea, with increased anxiety) and I am absolutely terrified that this new medication (Zoloft generic) will make me feel the same way I felt on Prozac."
5429,"Pros of going on medication:
-It fixes the problem
-Maybe I really need it
-The reason why they invented medication is to help people like me

Cons of going on medication:
-Dependent on them for the rest of my life?"
5430,"-It's just a quick fix
-I'll be an unemotional zombie
-There is a chance they could make the disorder worse

Here's my dilemma, Reddit:
Do I go on medication and accept that I need them forever?"
5431,I know mixing medicine with alcohol isn't the best thing but I feel like if I take the half pill at 10 then skip the 7oclock pill then go out to drink around 9 then I should be fine.
5432,"I cry constantly, I sleep more than I ever have, I've been missing work, I even got my medication adjusted because I was scaring myself with how upset I've been."
5433,So after trying to face down my anxiety mano el mano for 2 months I've decided to start taking my medication.
5434,"I'm scared that these medications will turn me into someone I don't want to be, I'm honestly kind of afraid to confront my non-anxious self after 2 months (of what feels like) transformative anxiety."
5435,"I know that to get better I need to actually take the steps I need to, but what if once I'm on medication I realize that I don't want to be in this relationship???"
5436,This is my first time taking medication so any advice/support/love would be much appreciated.
5437,**TL;DR I'm going on medication for the first time.
5438,Scared medication will change me/make me fall out of love with my fiance.
5439,i went on medication and the next few years were actually some of the best years of my life.
5440,i knew the meds changed my life but i thought i was in control now.
5441,I went of the medication.
5442,the few months after going off the meds were smooth sailing.
5443,I went back on my meds ASAP.
5444,I am not on any medication and I am worried to tell my mom to let me see someone.
5445,I have a bad past with anxiety/depression and medication.
5446,I don't know if I should get a stronger acid reflux medicine or try an anxiety medicine.
5447,"There's a lot of different things I guess it could be, but I'm just worried that the alcohol might be having an adverse effect with my medication."
5448,Can it be myself or the meds changing my perspective on life?
5449,"It’s driving me insane…

I’m currently on a few medications: lamictal 100mg, 30mg Adderall, 10mg viibyrd (just started a few days ago) and was prescribed klonopin on Thursday (today is Monday) .5mg."
5450,"I’m trying to keep the dose low &amp; take it only as needed since I don’t want to build a tolerance because I need this medication to work when attempting to socialize…
Can anyone give me their experiences with klonopin &amp; how they handle their anxiety/social anxiety?"
5451,"I take 2 antidepressants, I have taken several anxiety medications that don't help and I am currently taking propanol."
5452,"He doesn't deserve that kind of responsibility, and I'm doing CBT to help, but I still kind of need the crutch of meds."
5453,recently went off my meds due to my docs advice.
5454,I constantly feel the physical symptoms of GAD and I am actively trying therapy and medicine however I'm wondering what it is doing for my health.
5455,"I'm waiting on an appointment to see a psychiatrist to potentially get on some meds, but until then, I feel like i'm losing all hope."
5456,"I'm asking because I used to take only ssri's for a combo of anxiety and depression, then went off them for a couple years when I was doing well, but now my anxiety is becoming a problem again, but I don't feel like I'm slipping back into depression, so I'm thinking of trying just anti-anxiety meds, but I don't have any experience with them."
5457,"Through therapy and meds I got through that, began to believe I was invincible and over the next 4 years I went to college and then University, my life was on the up, I made great friends and fell in love."
5458,"I got meds, Citalopram and Propranonol, and within days I was feeling better, the feelings of dread and panic were subsiding, although I still didn't venture from the house except for doctor appointments, things were somehow looking up."
5459,She asked me what meds I was taking.
5460,I told I would happily tame meds except every therapist so far has said no.
5461,I really don't want to take the meds.
5462,I also get very panicky on meds (afraid of side effects - yay OCD).
5463,I'm not taking any meds for anxiety but I have Inositol (which I've been forgetting to take the past few months).
5464,I have been struggling now for 10 years and am finally ready to take a step towards medication.
5465,I use to hate the thought of meds and was 100% against them but now my body is damaged and I need to heal it.
5466,"I am asking for help because my fear stems from throwing up, I would like to try and find a medication with minimal side effects especially minimal nausea."
5467,"I also know everyone is different, so what was your experience like on meds?"
5468,"He's gotten a lot better and is only on one medication, plus his monthly therapist visits."
5469,I want these episodes to stop so I can function normally but I fear seeing a doctor will immediately mean he prescribes me medication and write me off.
5470,And medication of any sort is no substitute for therapy or making changes to current thinking patterns/behavioral patterns.
5471,I was crying out of fear that anxiety gives you and I decided to go to my primary care doctor to maybe get an increase on my Clomipramine (my primary took over my medication management since the psychiatrist was getting expensive).
5472,"That is, before I take my daily medication, I am in a fog of anxiety."
5473,"Once I take them, I can feel as the meds hit my head and the anxiety dissipates like a massive wave of relaxation."
5474,Last year she started having bad anxiety and depression and her GP took her off Lexapro and tried several different meds.
5475,"Update: called my doctor, was advised to stop taking the meds and drink lots of water to get it out of my system."
5476,"I'm not on medication yet but I soon might be, so any advice for dealing with the first week or so?"
5477,"(Also, I'm not an any medication except Xanax, which I take as needed.)"
5478,My mom brought me to the hospital and I was prescribed some anti nausea medicine (wish I would remember the name) and a benzodiazepine.
5479,Throughout this time I was seeing many different counselors/psychiatrists and I also tried different medicines and stuff like that.
5480,"As a side note I am taking medications and seeing a therapist, and they are helping me wonderfully."
5481,"In the 3 days before this one, I will be blunt when I say this: I wanted to die so badly, I was in no risk of killing myself, I was afraid of living but also afraid of dying even more and now every morning as soon as I wake up I'm anxious, I take my Prozac and anti-anxiety medication, my anti anxiety medication sedates me and makes me so tired that I could pass out if I wanted to, but its better than driving myself up the wall with my anxiety."
5482,"Even with my medication in me, I still feel so scared, scared that I will want to end it all one day, or that I won't survive another anxiety attack and I know my fears are irrational, I know that these mental illnesses lie through their teeth and I am still so scared that I will break again, so in my junior year of high school after I couldn't take the pressure anymore after I was stressing myself, I just stopped going and my mom agreed, if I could tell you my whole story behind all this: all you have to do is ask."
5483,"I've been on meds for around two years now, taking prozac, lexapro, and now currently taking zoloft - all low doses."
5484,"I'm not depressed, never had any anxiety, or taken any medication for mental health."
5485,"I have been off the therapist's couch for years now, and off my meds for the same - I thought I was better."
5486,I am not yet on medication.
5487,I've been avoiding the medication route for a while and I've been thinking of going back to therapy but I just find it odd that I can feel fine for an hour or so and all of a sudden I'm flooded with a few seconds of anxiety and panic.
5488,EDIT: Sounds like not unethical but probably too weird-alternative-medicine-y and not normal-medicine-y enough for me.
5489,I've been avoiding medication because I'm afraid it will impact my performance running or exercising.
5490,I scheduled an appointment with my doctor for Monday because I may just give in and start medication and therapy like he suggested.
5491,You might need meds If you are so worked up (like I was) that you can't function or think straight you got to get your anxiety to a point were you can function so you can help yourself.
5492,I have tried all kinds to cure my anxiety and get off meds you name it I probably tried it.
5493,"It cost me over $100 to go see her, I just got a bill in the mail for 88 for the labs and my remaining balance, AND I have the emergency room bill to deal with from when I took the meds she prescribed me and (of course) had a panic attack because I felt weird after taking them."
5494,My psychologist says that medicine and therapy are not needed anymore in my case which I am thankful for.
5495,"If anything, it seems as though the medications make the anxiety worse."
5496,I am constantly worried about the meds that I am taking.
5497,"I know a lot of you will suggest ""take different meds,""  maybe ""find a new therapist,"" and of course, I will stop taking these things safely and under supervision... 

What I am really looking for are ways/techniques you might have for lessening severe anxiety?"
5498,"For some, medication is a great way to get a handle on it, for others, it may be some sort of therapy."
5499,im not taking any meds nor am i seeing any kind of doctor.
5500,"On a note I never looked for doctor's help, not on meds either."
5501,"I read this subreddit, depression and getmotivated daily, that is my medication."
5502,I will be taking sleeping medication tonight so tomorrow I will feel slightly better but at this point in time I feel like I'm going to puke.
5503,Am I going to have to increase my meds?
5504,I wish I had known this before I started medication.
5505,"For the past couple of days my tongue has been going numb, usually right after taking my meds."
5506,"I'm not interested in medication, but I've wanted to start mediating with my roommate."
5507,"Latuda is also a very new (last two years) medication on the market, so I just think its a strange route to take for just anxiety."
5508,I've been on a ton of meds and none of them have ever done anything to help.
5509,I switched up my medication a few months ago from 3 meds to 2 because I didn't want to be on so many prescriptions.
5510,I have had many fears and now been on different meds.
5511,I want to start journaling my medication usage since it is as needed.
5512,"Background: I've been doing the anxiety/depression tango for about 10 years, with meds &amp; therapy &amp; the whole shebang, &amp; as of about a year ago I felt like I got to a good place."
5513,"I've taken meds for it that have only put me into a fake, hazy life which leaves me feeling empty and has ruined relationships."
5514,I have quit all meds and my depression (also been dealing with since childhood wtf?)
5515,So I am now almost 2 months off Pristiq (100mg each day for 2 years) and completely off all Anti-Anxiety meds for almost the same amount of time.
5516,None of my doctors or the Psychiatrists ever suggested this could be a side-effect and it was always treated with additional medication or therapy.
5517,"Not that I didnt feel like I needed help, but for me the side effects ended up more harmful than not taking the meds."
5518,"I dont think it will ever go away or be cured, but I want to learn to live without needing to rely or meds to survive."
5519,"I had a really bad allergic reaction to some of the medication a few days ago which labored my breathing, but now it's all good."
5520,I was on meds for anxiety for a year.
5521,"As you all or most of you probably know, medications have withdrawals."
5522,i've never been on meds for my anxiety/depression before but with full time uni and work i don't have the time or the energy to do all the stuff my last shrink wanted me to do.
5523,i'm hoping with anti anxiety meds or sedatives the trich will subside.
5524,any advice on if this is a good idea or if any meds are better than others?
5525,"I took Sertraline, 2 anti psych meds and a sleeping medication for 3 years."
5526,"Even my mother (a nurse), couldn't find anything in her reading that really supported using this medicine for something as severe as what I'm experiencing."
5527,"That being said (and since knowledge exists beyond our two brains), I've done the Googling and only found a few in depth accounts of people using this medication to aid their anxiety."
5528,"How should I handle this, when I don't want to take any medication?"
5529,Is there a difference to how someone with ADHD would respond to the meds?
5530,I don't want to switch meds since this is working so well but I can't live with the stomach ache.
5531,"I have always had problems with anxiety but decide to try to hide them and subdue them as best as possible, in order to avoid any medication or my mother forcing some other weird juju on me."
5532,I've gotten medication but it works here and there and want to try something different.
5533,"I heard medication should be the last choice but at this point, I feel like I need the help to be able to function in society."
5534,So she switched my meds.
5535,I wanted off all my meds.
5536,"My SO told me something along the lines of ""You need those meds to function, you can never get off of them, you need them""."
5537,"(which of course didn't help any of the neurological symptoms, because its NOT anxiety)

I'm starting to not even want to tell these doctors that I'm on an anti-anxiety medication, every time I do they automatically blame things on my anxiety."
5538,She takes medication for both.
5539,"I've mostly been able to deal with, if not control my anxiety without medication since I left its grip in my 20s."
5540,"I'm starting to wonder, is it time I seek medication?"
5541,"I don't want to be on Zoloft, I don't need another medication that if I don't take it I'll be a nervous wreck."
5542,"(GF is on Zoloft, when she misses her meds she gets in horrible moods.)"
5543,"Yet I remember her just 6/7 years ago when she was *perfectly fine* and since there was no major trigger, it's obvious the problem is biological (heavy history for that on one side of her family, with a trend of issues popping up mid-20s) and that the meds aren't getting the work done."
5544,"It can't be behavioral therapy because frankly that option has been exhausted, just as commonly prescribed medication has been."
5545,"I've been on anti-depressants before, which is why we decided against trying that route but maybe it'll be different now that I'm on other meds as well?"
5546,A few years ago I had a seizure from Tramadol and so now I'm going to be seeing a neurologist on Thursday to see if I have siezure issues and it wasn't the medication.
5547,"Current Medications:

Minocycline 100mg

Clindamycin benzoyl peroxide gel

Sertraline HCL 200mg

Clonasepan .5 mg

Citalopram 20mg-am

Hydroxyzine hcl 50mg x2/day

All of the meds because of my stomach / anxiety issues."
5548,pyschiatrists/GI specialist have given me tons of medications over the years I honestly haven't even noticed much of a difference.
5549,"I know this sounds silly, but I worry that the doctor will think I am making everything up and won't help me or consider putting me on medication."
5550,"I've tried all the depression medications... Zoloft, Wellbutrin, you name it."
5551,I go to regular therapy and take daily medication for all of this but I'm still just overwhelmed.
5552,I'm diagnosed bipolar but in between meds.
5553,"I get a thought... usually about my ex or like an intrusive thought and my heart races and my chest is tight and something feels so very very wrong and I just can't handle anything anymore

I'm seeing a counselor, but I have to see her for like 6 weeks before I can see a psychiatrist for medication, and I'm only on like week 3... fuck

None of my usual coping mechanisms are working, I can't afford cigarettes, I can't sleep..."
5554,"I’ve been on medication for my anxiety before, but I've learnt that all anxiety medication achieves is what's called the “band-aid” effect."
5555,"As long as you take it, it might work for you, but go off it and your anxiety will just start right up again, most often even worse than before you went on the meds."
5556,Coming off my medication caused the worst withdrawal symptoms and it’s not something I will ever put myself through again.
5557,"I told my doctor that I didn't want an SSRI medication, because I didn't want to take something every day."
5558,Where you're looking for somewhat of a longer term anxiety medication that you can take as needed?
5559,That's something that I can't change with medication; I'm going to just have to deal with having trouble with processing for the rest of my life.
5560,"I've recently been switched to new medication (long story short, old psychiatrist pushed a lot of supplements that weren't doing anything rather than taking me off Lexapro) so I really don't know what to expect of myself."
5561,I feel like I need to take that first big step and speak to my GP about medication.
5562,Do you suggest I should see a psychiatrist to potentially get medication?
5563,"I would like to try medication but I'm too afraid to even make an appointment with my doctor, I feel like as soon as I tell them I've been having panic attacks I'm going to trigger one."
5564,Thought this might be of some use to those of you considering/starting medication.
5565,I went about a year with no medicine but then a lot of change happened all at once and I found myself slipping back into a bad anxiety/depression state.
5566,"Granted, it takes time for meds to balance out and become effective."
5567,Any suggestions on medication or therapy?
5568,"I don't have any personal or family history of mental health conditions, other than maybe some very minor attention deficit which I've been able to motivate myself through without medication or therapy."
5569,I'm not opposed to taking medication; in fact I think that short term anxiety prescriptions might be exactly what I need as I think my case is relatively mild compared to what others are experiencing.
5570,How was the first few hours/ days on your meds for the first time?
5571,"I was on three different meds and I felt ok, but I think the thing that made me happiest was my summer trip to the mountains."
5572,Sometime between freshmen and end of sophomore year I had stopped going to the doctor and I stopped taking my meds.
5573,"I was still off meds and therapy, but surprisingly it didn't effect me like it should have."
5574,I couldn't stand taking the meds so I stopped going and taking them all together.
5575,"Thanks to Google, I have read that a few people feel a ""faux"" anxiety attack after taking decongestant medication due to the levels of caffeine and other, for lack of a better word, heart-racing drugs."
5576,"Does anyone else feel this way after they take certain medications for cold/flu/sinus and any advice on how to feel better without feeling ""worse""?"
5577,"I suppose this can go under meds or help, but it's a bit of a rant too."
5578,"I've been constantly nauseous for the last four months or so, and have tried multiple medications for that which haven't worked."
5579,"The nausea has basically been in my chest and throat, which makes me think it might be anxiety related instead of a GERD, but I'd still hope that the anti-nausea medication would help."
5580,i refuse pills/ medications due to trying to overdose a few times because it gets to the point where i feel thats i all have as a choice!
5581,I've never taken any medication.
5582,Are you on medication?
5583,i've finally realized i can't control my anxiety through willpower any longer and i want to pursue medication.
5584,or should i just see my GP and tell him about my issues and my desire to start medication?
5585,"Now, I am not taking any medication for it."
5586,Anyway I'm very averse to using medication and try to do things in a more natural way.
5587,Can this be used as a long term medication?
5588,I don't know why but I just stopped taking all my meds and lived my life as a somewhat normal kid.
5589,Can I go about without the medication?
5590,"I tried a different medicine, and after taking it for around a month, it's really kicked in and today I actually went to the store and bought myself something and had no anxiety!"
5591,"It did take 3-4 weeks for the medicine to really kick in though, but it was worth it."
5592,He does have some beta blockers (very low dosage) that he takes every day and also some type of medication that is very similar to xanex that they gave him 10 of that is supposed to last 4 months.
5593,I'm majorly concerned about starting such a medication.
5594,I'm no way doubting my Dr. but why wouldn't therapy be recommended first over medication?
5595,"I was always really against meds, I avoided them at all costs, so I went to see a mindfulness coach."
5596,I got talking on break one day at work about mental illness and one of my co-workers confessed that she suffered and was on meds.
5597,She said that through meditation and prayer she came to peace that medication was the right move for her.
5598,After that day I thought about meds all the time.
5599,"Anyway it's been a week now on the meds and they haven't kicked in, which is expected, but I really feel as if I am finally going to get better."
5600,"Thing is, I want to get the hell off these meds."
5601,"I really want to know what its like to not be on drugs, maybe trying some holistic medicine."
5602,I am starting meds in the next week to help with my anxiety and phobia...so Anxiety and obsessive thoughts is what Im hearing I'll be treated with.
5603,"I ended up taking medication, worked with a psychologist to understand the anxiety instead of just fear it, and can now after a long hard journey say I'm proud and thankful to be for the most part on the other side of the most difficult experience of my life."
5604,Changing meds to target my anxiety problems as opposed to the depression issues.
5605,After being too afraid to try any new meds (in fear that it would trigger more panic) I finally decided to switch to Lexapro...slowly.
5606,"For instance Right now we are currently fighting again, and tonight after i had the first anxiety attack in my life, i had her tell me the only people in her life she wants to stay in her life are her kids, and the reason was because the doctor prescribed her a medicine that is only going to make things worse, and she is fearful she will never get better."
5607,I was diagnosed with social phobia/social anxiety disorder a while back and the anxiety medication only helps to a certain extent.
5608,Is this not a semi quantifiable way to show your improvement (albiet without medication) in your anxiety and depression?
5609,"My girlfriend and her mom really think that I should be on some sort of medication (Xanax or something of the like, my girlfriend has ADHD and takes Concerta for it and she said it changed her life), and my parents don't really want that to happen and they don't really seem to fully understand my problem."
5610,"All I want right now is a game plan, specifically to get some meds to calm down this long-duration panic attack, but since this had to happen on Christmas Eve/Christmas day, there's not any way to even contact someone to begin getting help."
5611,"The side effects however, became more and more pronounced as the months wore on -- excessive sweating and debilitated short-term memory being the two most exasperating ones, which almost could not justify taking medication long term."
5612,"After about two years on Zoloft and Lexapro at any one time, I consulted another psychologist, this time a more therapy-oriented one than the previous doctor who told me that because anxiety/depression is caused by chemical imbalances, it should be rectified using medication."
5613,"I've been on a really low dose these past few months (25mg a day, was 50mg a day for awhile), since I've been pretty intent on stopping medication altogether in the near future."
5614,"Ever since I started medication three years ago, I never really had much problems with nausea if I were on a steady dose."
5615,I know very little about the side effects or success rates of a variety of anxiety medications.
5616,with anxiety medications.
5617,I am not sure if my anxiety is coming from my work procrastination (I've always had a degree of ADD and struggle to concentrate on things) and I need to resort to a ADD medication such as Adderall to keep myself on task or if my anxiety is causing my procrastination and I need to seek help professionally.
5618,"[Help] I've been on medication before, but of course once things start working I think all's well and go cold turkey on everything (I know this is a bad idea but have never suffered withdrawal symptoms)."
5619,The last time I was on medication was a little over 2 years ago.
5620,Can anyone shed some light on your experiences with medications (basically any benzodiazepines) and how I should really be using them?
5621,"BTW: I refuse to take meds, I took prozac for 2 days and felt completely fucked."
5622,I had also gotten a single pill of..some anti-anxiety medicine from my uncle xylo..zensi something I don't remember.
5623,"I know medicines effect people differently but, does anyone have anything good to say about Zoloft?"
5624,I was on a medication for it for a while but my symptoms regressed for a while and I stopped taking it.
5625,"I never took any medication for it, but I do take a ton other medication for Crohn's that I was diagnosed with last year."
5626,I'm just wondering if there is anyone else like me who doesn't want to take meds for their anxiety?
5627,"After months of taking it, the symptoms all seemed to go away but I couldn't decide if it was just a coincidence and or the medicine really worked."
5628,Well there are some anxiety meds that won't do that.
5629,So I stopped the medicine and three days after stopping I felt great for two days!
5630,I am now three weeks without Cymbalta or any meds at all.
5631,I figured if i went long enough with out the meds and just ignoring what is happening that it will all go away...
5632,"All the doctors say I am fine and healthy... Why do I have to choose between a happy sex life or feeling asolutley miserable.... Why can't I feel good and have a good sex life... Now i am just rambling and I apologize...

Has anyone found a combination of medicines that work where you can still have a decent sex life and feel normal?"
5633,"Including food, drink and medication."
5634,"My Fiance has an anxiety problem and she takes medication for it, but she still suffers a great deal."
5635,i just toke my meds 10 mins ago.
5636,"The show even has this man committed to a 1 month stay in a mental facility and suspended from his job because his ""anxiety"" caused a severe psychotic break when he went off his meds."
5637,I have been seeing a counselor and I have also seen a doctor who has prescribed me Cipralex starting at 5 mg a day for a week and then 10 mg after that a day- I'm only on day 3 of the medication.
5638,I'm on a huge waiting list for a therapist and tomorrow I'm going to call my doctor and try to get an appointment so he can put me on some meds but that's all I can do and all I want to do is talk to someone but I have no one I can talk to.
5639,I have already tried everything except therapy and medication.
5640,Take medication only if you're considering retraining your mind through CBT/meditation/exposure therapy.
5641,Would medication be of use in such a situation?
5642,"My boyfriend helps me out a lot when things like this happen, but I don’t want to have to rely on him and I don’t want to be prescribed any sort of medication either, which is why I haven’t tried to see a therapist."
5643,"I told them I really was afraid I'd have a bad reaction again and pretty much said I would really like to have some type of straight anti-anxiety medication in case I had another bad reaction, so I could sleep and to take things down a notch if necessary(I've taken valium and xanax before some minor surgeries, and it helped a ton)."
5644,"That appointment isn't for another six weeks though, and the psychiatrist thinks it'd be best to stay off all medications until after the sleep study."
5645,I started working out and eating clean and weaned myself off of all of the medications.
5646,"No meds, no therapist to talk to, obviously going to a friend is not an option, but I am still upset and crying."
5647,"Also, i'm still very afraid that its [Serotonin Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome), since i upped medication (Venlafaxine 37.5 to 75) three weeks ago."
5648,"Yes, I'm on medication."
5649,Has anyone had success with the same issue and switching to another medication?
5650,My anxiety is not to the point where I feel that I need to see a therapist or take meds.
5651,I'm abroad for the next few months and will run out of my medication before I return home.
5652,"I've already tired alternating days of not taking my medication to ween myself off of it, but I end up feeling very blue and emotional when I don't take my pill."
5653,"I would give anything in the world not to have to feel like this, the constant worrying &amp; indecision is driving me nuts but at the same time I feel like a counselor wouldn't be able to help and medication would just mask the problem."
5654,"This is hopefully the start of a good thing, with a medication that will actually help."
5655,I guess I'd just love some advice from others who have had to switch medication and if I'm honest a little bit of comfort.
5656,"I'm on antidepressants but no anti-anxiety medicines, I live in the US and I have insurance."
5657,"I've gotten a lot better dealing with my anxiety since it caused me to basically drop out of school two years ago, but now I'm on the right medication and have a lot going for me."
5658,Does anyone have experience with swapping meds and the side effects?
5659,"Final question: I have a decent amount of anxiety with taking medication, especially new medication."
5660,I have ADHD and I'm on medication again but my OCD and other problems have been coming into play.
5661,I do take medication at the moment (I don't remember what it is called though :P) but it seems to be doing diddly-squat in my opinion.
5662,He's saying that he wants to kill himself and threatening that he's going to kill himself by overdosing on medication.
5663,"She refuses to take medication, but at this point Reddit, I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this."
5664,"I'm not on medication, and have had these feelings since I was 11 (I'm 16), but this is a whole new beast."
5665,I'm not taking any other cold medicine so I'm not concerned about interactions.
5666,"I guess worst case, he could tell me what cold medication I could take that won't interact with my vyvanse and lexapro..."
5667,I have put off getting on anxiety/depression meds up to this point because I was scared to try.
5668,"I have had little to no success with pharmaceuticals like benzos or anti-depression medication (although I believe it's possible that it's because the doctors didn't really pay attention to me and just kinda threw pills at me; they have given me zoloft in the past and it affected my mood negatively, making me anger easily.)"
5669,"tldr; No luck with doctors or meds in the past, are there any other things I can try?"
5670,"My girlfriend has expressed her sadness that I ""walk around like a zombie and don't feel anything"", so I'm quitting my meds (Lexapro 20mg)."
5671,I now take medication (20mg of Prozac) and go to therapy every two weeks.
5672,"In fact, it's a worse feeling BEFORE I got into therapy and medication."
5673,"I understand its normal to have side effects from new medication, like insomnia and dizziness and nauseas (which I do have as well), but is it normal for your anxiety to increase?"
5674,"I have a lot of things depending on my ability to behave normally right now, and I simply wont be able to deal with a lot of the side effects of medications right now."
5675,Im going to be trying to gain weight and I cant have medication mess with this.
5676,"In addition, like I said, im going to college and cant have medication screwing with my ability to behave normally in class, or change my sleeping schedule."
5677,"I dont know what a doctor will recommend, maybe if anybody knows of specific medications that can help without weight effecting side effects or wont impair my ability to focus in class."
5678,We are going to be getting some money soon for doing renovations to my mom's place and I am thinking about sucking it up and paying my $50 copay and going to my doctor to get some anxiety medicine.
5679,"Normally it's totally under control,i don't need medication i can just get on with life and basically ignore it."
5680,I was wondering if anyone had any experience with ways to help ease anxiety without taking any type of medication or if there are any exercises that anyone has practiced that can help.
5681,"As some one who has shied away from medication for ANYTHING all my life, I feel vulnerable and have no idea what to expect."
5682,"While I do have the medication to stop it before it gets extremely bad (mine are crippling), it just sucks as a college student to feel kind of ostracized when I choose not to drink because I know how fucking bad it's going to be the next day."
5683,"So I told them that I wanted to wake up, but I had taken the anxiety medicine, and it made me tired and groggy, and I wanted to sleep for a while longer (not at 3pm, but the times before then)."
5684,"She told me if it was 7am, I could have woken her up to keep me company, rather than take the medicine."
5685,"She then suggested that if the medicine makes me that tired, to take it before bed every night to help me sleep."
5686,"And making me feel bad throughout the day for sleeping, or telling me I shouldn't have taken the medicine, and then snarkily telling me to take it every night when I said it makes me tired, makes me angry."
5687,"I lived with my parents for the better part of 6 months, went and talked to a counselor regularly, was prescribed meds, and basically pulled my shit together."
5688,I don't think my depression or anxiety are unmanageable without medication so it shouldn't be an issue)
5689,"Anxiety medication definitely helps, but I don't want to be drugged out on benzo's my entire time."
5690,"I have been on medication such as propanalol but it doesn't help, and been to group therapy which hasn't done anything either."
5691,"And I can't shake the thought that I should be able to deal with this on my own, without doctors or meds or emergency rooms."
5692,Yet they took my medication away and isolated me till my mum came to pick me up and told me not to come to school for at least two months.
5693,I just feel like they're punishing me for something that is out of my control and something I'm getting medication and proper help for.
5694,"He has been trying to find the right anxiety medicine this semester, and is currently on his third medication."
5695,I have a vomiting phobia and hate being dizzy/feeling like I'm not in control (so sleeping meds don't feel nice to me).
5696,At the time I didn't understand what it meant and it never directly affected our relationship until he decided to stop his meds overnight.
5697,I am not sure if stopping his meds played a role in what happened next but within a week he started having panic attacks with me.
5698,"I've been dealing with anxiety for a couple years now, and probably one of the worst things for me is that any sort of medication, even ""safe"" OTC stuff, I need to take makes me have a huge panic attack because I think I'll have side effects associated with it."
5699,"It seems like every medication has ""trouble breathing"" in the side effects or ""heart attack and stroke"" and that's about all I need to see to set me off."
5700,"This happens with just about everything, and it is the main reason I decided not to take the meds my doctor prescribed me for anxiety."
5701,I'm currently in my second week of zoloft and I'm wondering whether anyone has had bladder issues taking the medication.
5702,The only thing I could think causing this problem is the medication.
5703,"(29/Male/USA/United Healthcare/No meds currently)

I'm doing some research on therapists in my area (NW Chicago 'burbs) as I've finally reached the point at which I feel it is necessary to address some matters causing me extreme amounts of distress."
5704,"-Whatever meds I may or may not end up on, I would use as a backup plan while focusing on CBT to try to overcome it as best I can."
5705,I don't have any medication as i haven't found a new psychiatrist in this state yet.
5706,"I know it is common while your body adjusts to the medication, but it is getting annoying."
5707,"Ive had many anxiety attacks, Ive taken medication and talked to therapists."
5708,"I went to a doctor, she put me on my medications and gave me a prescription for Xanax in case I had more panic attacks."
5709,"):
______________________
--------------------------------------

I haven't had a good childhood (physical abuse by dad and emotional abuse by foster parents)
I became severely depressed last year (and still am although I'm taking steps to becoming better) - I'm on SSRI medication (citalopram) and receiving counselling sessions from university (on my third one currently)

I have a lot of anxiety - I feel like I am going to be sick every single day, a feeling in my chest and throat - should I try to force myself to be sick?"
5710,"It's amazing what medicines are out there that can help...Be careful with it though, it will be hell to taper off my Rx, it's super addictive."
5711,"My past experiences have mixed my panic with actual, very real, medical problems -- so it's just so difficult for me to separate reality from anxiety, from medication side effects."
5712,"I know it takes close to a month for the ssri's to kick in, but will talk therapy and the meds help make me normal?"
5713,So the last couple days have been a little stressful and I ended up missing meds a couple days.
5714,I never feel anything when I'm in this medicine.
5715,":(


Now because I skipped meds I feel like shit and my birth control is all messed up I have had like a 3 week long period."
5716,"I feel so trapped in my body, trapped by my gender, by my meds."
5717,If you are finding your medication unhelpful or you can't get a benzo script for emergencies for whatever reason perhaps you could bring up Mirtazapine with your doctor and see what they think.
5718,I feel like meds are my best option to have normal levels of anxiety and not freak out and go back into that hole.
5719,"I was diagnosed with all kinds of clinical shit at 14, but was never on any meds."
5720,Is it possible to completely treat it with meds within a month.
5721,"I know that with anxiety and depression meds, you can sometimes feel numb."
5722,I am currently seeking another therapist and was just prescribed new medications.
5723,I talked to my doctor about coming off of my meds to see where I am without them (always consult your doctor before coming off your meds).
5724,"I mean there's one when going on medication, why wouldn't there be one coming off?"
5725,"If anyone has any kind of experience with going off medications, could you share your experience?"
5726,"We all react differently to meds, but having some kind of insight may be helpful for me."
5727,I was on medication for a few months.
5728,"Study: A Comparison of the Exercise Response in Anxiety States and Normal Controls

http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/8/3/180.full.pdf+html?sid=f65ed012-2c6e-477e-8e9f-07f064706808"
5729,"And I do take meds, but I'm running out and I can't even make an appointment to get more until I get my insurance card."
5730,"Oh yeah, meds."
5731,"Pretty sure he can prescribe the pain meds that I need as well, which is going to be pretty fantastic."
5732,"So I made a chart that covers 4 major categories related to my anxiety: Sleep, care, medicine, and overall outcomes."
5733,"I note:

Sleep

* Wake time
* Bed time
* Whether I had nightmares (since I have night terrors)

Care

* Meditation (# of minutes)
* Cardio exercise (# of minutes)
* Alcohol (# servings)
* Caffeine (# servings)

Medicine

* Morning medicine (whether I took it, y/n)
* Evening medicine (whether I took it, y/n)
* Ativan (whether I needed it, # taken)

Overall outcomes

* Whether I had any panic attacks (y/n)
* My level of productivity, 1-10
* General overall feelings about the day, 1-10
* Any notes (e.g., if I changed my prescription dosage)

This system is working really well for me right now for a few reasons."
5734,"And when my psych says, ""So how is the new medication working?"""
5735,"Stupidly, I have stopped taking my 2 anxiety medications."
5736,"I have 2 new medications that I started last night, they are chlordiazepoxide hcl and citalopram hbr."
5737,Anybody have those medications before and did you find it helpful?
5738,"After my third, my leadership encouraged me to see a doctor, and get meds."
5739,What are some of the repercussions of taking anxiety medication?
5740,Are anxiety meds an every day regimen or can they be taken as needed?
5741,I started medication and restarted my therapy sessions back in August.
5742,"As a kid I must have tried no less than 20 different medications for anxiety, depression, bi-polar etc."
5743,"Finally, if everything checks out and I'm just an anxious mess, are there any medications you recommend trying first?"
5744,"I'd much rather fix myself without medication, but I haven't been doing so well without it so far."
5745,"I take medication for it, albeit, not very strong medicine."
5746,"i can't afford meds or therapy, and i would appreciate any words of wisdom."
5747,***tl;dr*** I finally saw that my medication is working with my anxiety when I didn't freak out over dishes not being put away how I was used to.
5748,"I go to talk therapy every 2 weeks and am on meds, to include Xanax for emergencies."
5749,I eventually came to after my gp told me that the medicines the er and another nurse practitioner I had seen were way too strong (seroquel) .
5750,"My husband has an appointment with his MD next week, and he is open, after many conversations, to medication to manage or reduce his anxiety."
5751,"I am reaching out to you all, to gather opinions on medication for anxiety."
5752,"I mean, it's a good thing if the symptoms won't come back as soon as I stop taking the meds, but then I'll probably get stuck in a loop of taking medication until I get to see a therapist and then not being able to talk about anything etc."
5753,"I've tried meditation, yoga, acupuncture, keeping active, positive self-talk, cognitive behavioral therapy, regular therapy, and medication, among things."
5754,I've probably tried lots of different medication.
5755,"Anxiety disorder (and depression, since the two are linked- you'd be depressed if you had an anxiety disorder) often get treated with strong medication, and strong medication has side-effects."
5756,"When I am trying new medications I might be ""off"" and irrational."
5757,"Please forgive me, it's not me, it's the meds."
5758,"Also, some meds make me extra tired or dizzy or any number of other things that aren't my normal or desired state."
5759,"Most medication used to treat anxiety is something the body becomes immune to over time, so the dosage must be increased."
5760,She completely believes it would be more helpful if I ate a piece of tree bark than try some medicine.
5761,"She self diagnosed herself through a combination of Google and WebMD, and won't take medicine for it because that hurts her as well."
5762,"While crying, she begins to say that my anxiety is only because I won't let God and love into my heart, that there is nothing but just the devil trying to trick me into taking meds."
5763,He also suggested what I'm experiencing could be GERD and prescribed a medication to deal with that.
5764,I was in a bad place a few months ago I was constatly going to the bathroom every 15-20 mins but some meds ( amitriptyline) has helped me take control of my life kinda.
5765,I have heard complete horror stories about withdraws from this medication.
5766,In general I've wanted to avoid medication to deal with anxiety right now.
5767,"I'm going to address this question with my therapist next week but for the time being I'd like to ask you because I am desperate for good sleep:

**Tl;dr: Have you taken medication to aid in sleep?"
5768,"I've tried other meds, such as Cymbalta, and they only worked short-term and then made me nutty."
5769,"So, I was wondering if I could ask my doctor at my physical today for my old good meds again."
5770,"I've been off-meds for about a year since they were making me feel numb, and had almost *no* anxiety."
5771,My friend has been on medication for a while and it seems to have helped him.
5772,"I had my medication on me most of the night (it's prescribed twice a day so I took it at the end of dinner) and just having it in my pocket made me feel better because I knew if I felt anxious at any time I had some relief to look forward to 
4."
5773,"I went to a doctor and was offered medications (ativan, i think), but turned them down because I was told it was dangerous to drink on them and generally didn't want to be on meds."
5774,I'm now considering giving meds a shot.
5775,* Does anyone have any experience drinking on meds?
5776,"I understand this subreddit might be reluctant to provide information regarding meds for ethical reasons, but please know that I'll be consulting a doctor should I decide to take this route, and that I'm just asking for insight into personal experiences to help make this decision."
5777,"Is there anyone out there with severe anxiety that got onto meds, then dealt with their issues in therapy and were able to return to a normal lifestyle?"
5778,"ie, no meds, no therapy."
5779,"I already have a good few health problems and I don't want something else to be wrong with me, and I definitely don't want to be on medication."
5780,"Seeing a doctor, psychiatrist, and being on 2 meds (Celexa, Xanax) allowed me to barely get by."
5781,"Its been 6 months since the move and I am off all meds, not currently seeing a counselor, and started my own business to keep me focused."
5782,"I know there are other anti-anxiety medications available, but if I'm correct, the ones I know of are all long-acting and take weeks to build up, which I really don't want to do."
5783,The last time I tried a long-acting medication (Intuniv) it was awful and gave me very bad headaches all day.
5784,I know not all would be like that but I'm still turned off by the idea of the medicine being built up in my brain permanently.
5785,"I like being able to know exactly what medication is doing to me, which requires comparing how I feel without it with how I feel on it frequently."
5786,"I have been pushed, and pushed myself to avoid treatment and medication for a very long time, part of that is due to guilt."
5787,I am not on any medications that would cause this either.
5788,"For a short time, I was on prescribed medication, which helped."
5789,"for one, my anxiety makes my stomach hurt really bad, so when i leave the house, i take a bunch of diarrhea medicine out of fear of having bathroom problems, and then i take 2 klonopin pills."
5790,"ive also tried depression meds too, like all the basic ones and nothing worked."
5791,I'm going to ask my psychiatrist for a stronger anti-anxiety medicine.
5792,She is very weary to prescribe me any because people with depression tend to abuse anxiety medication.
5793,What medicine or technique do you think would help me get through this?
5794,Is taking medication giving up?
5795,"I don’t medicate myself, because all of the meds leave me extremely drowsy."
5796,"I worry about my Mom, because she has GAD, and has similar allergies to meds too."
5797,i got back on correct medications and i started feeling better.
5798,"I've been thinking about going to see someone, maybe trying medication.. but I'm afraid because I don't know what to expect."
5799,"I was on medication when I was younger, but my parents took me off it because it made things worse."
5800,I don't want to take any medicine again because of it.
5801,And to see if I can get better allergy medicine.
5802,"I'll be going to my psychiatrist next week to discuss but I would love to hear from you if you experienced similar side effects, or any side effects at all when first starting a medication that then stopped."
5803,"As far as medications are concerned, I have been on Lexepro for just over a year now, and am in the middle of a transition to a dosage of 15 mg, up from 10 mg. 

My anxiety started with a panic attack of sorts that I had regarding my mom."
5804,"I REALLY want to try medication but the last time i did, it sent my anxiety through the roof, almost to the point of suicide so i dont really want to take that route again...

thanks"
5805,"Anyway, I'm starting my first meds tomorrow."
5806,"I've done all of the ""normal"" stuff... medication, therapy, etc and while it's definitely helped, I'd still constantly have anxiety and panic attacks, although not as severe."
5807,"Since it's ""as needed"" I figured it would be the type of medication that is supposed to help me when I need it."
5808,I'm specifically interested in daily medications.
5809,"fuck, when i first went off the meds after withdrawals i was scared to sit in the living room."
5810,"anyways if you trying to figure out if xanax or medication is for you, please for the love of anything, do research or try and tough it out!"
5811,I am in between changing medications and am having serious anxiety attacks.
5812,"I know I would like to see a therapist, but should I get any sort of medication?"
5813,"I don't take any medication whatsoever for anything and I've never seen a therapist, but I'm heavily considering it."
5814,I think I'm just too embarrassed to tell her it's because of medication I'm taking.
5815,"I have tried 10 medications (all of which didnt help, and caused me to be sleepy, or unmotivated)."
5816,The medication I take makes me anxious on top of my already bad anxiety.
5817,Like stronger than i've ever had before taking the medication.
5818,I wanna get off the meds and just looking for people with similar symptoms to hear there ways of coping.
5819,IT also has some sexual and shakyness side effects that are making me consider switching but I don't know how to explain why I want to try a new medication to my parents or my doctor.
5820,I've recently started taking anti depressants and anxiety medication though I don't think it's working.
5821,"I stopped taking medication for a while, and now I am going to try it once more as a last-ditch effort."
5822,What meds have you tried?
5823,I've tried most everything but ADD meds/stimulants and I'm curious if they would work for me.
5824,"My brain reacts differently to stimulants, for example cold medicine with sudafed makes me sleepy."
5825,I'll probably see a doctor about it again soon and see if this new information can help him/her figure out what's wrong or I might just straight up ask to give meds a shot and stop if they don't work.
5826,"I experienced some withdraw effects that really turned me off the idea of returning to medication-based treatment, so the past 5 years I've done a lot of self management."
5827,"I've already spoken with my Doctor about the concerns I have with medications again, but their opinion is that there needs to be continual, long-term management in place."
5828,"I've been on and off medications (Effexor for 9+ years, Wellbutrin and Trazadone for about 6 months, another round of Effexor after that for a month before I stopped medicating all together) enough to know that when (not if) I come off the next script I'm most likely going to experience side effects."
5829,"The last time had been awful enough, my opinion was it outweighed any benefit I found from taking the meds in the first place."
5830,"When I look at the most recent 3 weeks of oral treatment and the 6+ months of ""brain zap"" insanity, I seriously questioned the decision to go for oral meds at that time, or for any time in the subsequent future."
5831,"I know not everyone reacts the same to medications, but there seems to be a rift on the matter."
5832,"I'm fearful that I'll need to change out to something else in the next couple of weeks and I'll have to deal with withdraw for trial and error, or that life is going to up and give me double deuces again and I'll have to pick between meds or rent."
5833,"And I don't want to be on a medication, though I've never tried it."
5834,I tell myself that I should be strong enough to fix this inside my own mind and meds are cheating.
5835,"I've been on and off meds for a while, pretty low dose."
5836,I've been able to overcome a lot and now it's time for me to ween off of the medication.
5837,I went to the doctor the next morning because I was feeling the same and all they gave me was medicine to lower blood pressure and sent me on my way.
5838,"The medicine helped bring everything down, but i still had slight chest pains and a dazed feeling."
5839,"Later that night, I was laying down and all of a sudden I had more intense chest pains and my heart rate spiked up, even though I had just taken medication."
5840,when i go outside with my mum i am so ashamed i feel like everyone can tell that she abuses meds and is laughing at her.
5841,Is there anything I should remember to mention or check/ask for when talking about medication?
5842,"No other medications have helped in the past and I've been on Prozac, Zoloft, celexa, a few more and I felt nothing."
5843,My doctor is against prescribing medication.
5844,Last night i took 2 instead of 3 because i don't have many pills left and i need to get off this medication because i can't afford to get more.
5845,"Gal just totally made me feel brushed off and ""too sensitive"") or misdiagnose me or offer medication without actually putting their full critical thought into it (so basically I fear them just being on auto-pilot or otherwise not caring or thinking that I am just being dramatic and being lazy with me as a result) or just seeing me as a inconvenient set of boxes to check off."
5846,"I've tried some medication for anxiety and depression (Zoloft, Celexa, Lamictal) but it barely helps."
5847,"I think she was taking some medicines for it, but she said she stopped taking them because they were getting really expensive."
5848,"Also, this is the first Christmas party I've attended that I've actually been on medication for my anxiety and panic - I'm on 20mg of Cipralex and I've been told to take two 0.5mg of Clonazepam a day."
5849,I know that alcohol isn't supposed to be good for mixing medication and anxiety... but is it safe?
5850,"I stopped for awhile, out of sheer willpower, but it's started up again recently because of life changes/situations and my medication starting to lose effectiveness."
5851,"My psychiatrist had me up the dosage of the medication (buspirone), which seems to be helping but now the skin biting is back in full force."
5852,"I take a drug that has a rare side effect
	They tell me it will help me sleep through the night
	They tell me that it will calm me down
	They tell me that it will all be okay
		Just take your medicine
	I walk when I am feeling low
	Just to a park around the corner
		It doesn't attract a lot of people
			There are corners I can hide in
				I write there."
5853,"I have tried various forms of self medication and nothing works, Iwould like your advice on what to do so that I may accomplish this task."
5854,"We agreed to try therapy alone first, and that if it wasn't helping she would refer me to someone to talk about medication."
5855,I mention this because I've seen some people here are often worried that getting help means you are going to be put on meds.
5856,"Meds are incredibly helpful for some people, but the worry about having to take meds should not keep you from asking for help!"
5857,"I've taken meds, I've had therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and who knows what else."
5858,anyone ever increase their dose on their meds and have it work for 2 weeks then feel like you are slipping back to your anxiety/depression?
5859,"I believe these drugs like SSRIs are VERY serious medications that should only be used if you're forced into a mental health hospital, literally on the verge of suicide, or after all other forms of healthier treatments have been tried."
5860,"In fact, why are general practitioners allowed to prescribe psych meds?"
5861,I don't like that name for these medications.
5862,I wonder how many of them really were depressed or anxious enough to get on medication.
5863,Its like some people on these medications don't realize whats happened to them and the meds have made it to where they don't really care.
5864,"Its like these medications are being so over prescribed, that the world may one day be like a dystopian sci-fi novel such as The Giver or the movie Equilibrium."
5865,"Except at least in a move like Equilibrium, once people stopped the medication they got their emotions back."
5866,"And when I was prescribed an SSRI, I should have read up on the it first before taking it, but I believed my doctor when she told me it was a mild medication that takes weeks to notice any effects."
5867,I'm wondering if I should write a letter to the FDA requesting that they put more warnings on SSRI medication.
5868,These meds should not be available to the public from general practitioners and only be available from psychiatrists.
5869,I expect that pharma companies will not like this and probably pay off the right people to make sure these meds will always be easily accessible for anyone who wants them.
5870,And they will continue to tell doctors and the world that these meds are safe and relatively side effect free.
5871,Try any of the methods mentioned above first before any medication.
5872,"Also, ask a doctor for things you can try before resorting to medication."
5873,I stopped and it took about a week for the meds to wear off and I felt fine.
5874,"We've been spending a lot more time together since I've been on the meds, mostly because I am texting/calling her much more often."
5875,"I hate the idea of going on long-term medication, especially since my depression originally started as situational depression that was made infinitely worse with no reprieve over the course of several months, and became more permanent."
5876,"I was given medication in early middle school, but that's about it."
5877,I was in the hospital for nearly a month on a host of medications including Morphine drips and Coumadin injections.
5878,This is also when I ran out of my last prescription of pain medications and it had finally dawned on me what had occurred.
5879,I am also battling a cold so perhaps the cold medicine has an interference?
5880,Bupropion is the ONLY medication out of several that I've tried that have helped me in any way.
5881,"I am on medications, venlafaxine and two pills relating to high blood pressure partially because I like to eat and partially because it's one of the many family curses plaguing my family."
5882,"Having been on a number of meds for anxiety and depression I can say with a lot of certainty that for me the best I'm likely to get is something that'll take the edge off, and this current one seems to do that much."
5883,I take Zoloft but am not quite sure if I should up my medicine.
5884,"But vicoding makes me think clear, no ache, have motivation, pleasant to be around, I talk to people and smile, I can control food impulses, I can exercise, my mind is CLEAR not FOGGY like other meds, and i actually have a desire to be around people, and my legs dont feel like lead."
5885,Why cant there be an APPROVED medication that does what vicodin does.
5886,I was prescribed medication but I refuse to take it because of its horrible side effects.
5887,The medication prescribed was clonazepam and it has terrible side effects and horrible withdrawal effects.
5888,"Even though it has great ratings, I just spent a year and a half on meds and I don't want to be on them anymore."
5889,I'm still on the meds but almost off them and I can only consume the natural alternative once I no longer take any meds.
5890,"Note; About Kava, I have seem to have a liver problem that the medications have caused over a year and a half but there is still some bloodwork to be done."
5891,"I started medication a few months ago, and I'm still working on finding what's right for me."
5892,"I have had trouble with OCD symptoms and anxiety for my entire life, but I went off my meds in August and things have gotten much worse."
5893,"I started taking my meds again in October, but I'm still having more trouble with my OCD and anxiety than I've had since before I started taking meds 11 years ago."
5894,I've been taking the new meds for almost a month and haven't noticed a change in my sleep patterns.
5895,Don't be afraid of medication.
5896,"I have no medications left,, I am worried."
5897,"I'm not on any medication, but now I wish I was."
5898,"My mom called the doctors and scheduled  an appointment to look into some medication, but I'm not sure how much i can get considering I'm 17.

so all of this leads me to my question, does it get better?"
5899,Has medication helped manage the anxiety.
5900,"I had taken some pain medication, because my back was hurting."
5901,"My dog and I each just started anxiety medication - Zoloft for me, Prozac for him."
5902,"I want to see a doctor about it and maybe get put on some sort of medication to help prevent attacks, but my mother believes that anxiety is just a call for attention."
5903,"She also thinks that no one needs to be put on medication because ""medication is the government trying to turn the country into zombies."""
5904,"I'd go myself, but being 17, I'd need parental consent for any medication the doctor would want to put me on."
5905,**TL;DR: WoW addicted mother thinks anxiety is for attention whores and medication is actually government mind control.
5906,I'd like to start by giving you an example of what happens to me when it comes to my anxiety issues and what medication I have been given by the doctor.
5907,I was wondering if anyone out there takes medication for their Depression and/or Anxiety and how it made them feel and whether they had to be placed on a stronger or weaker dosage?
5908,This one prompted me to go to the ER and finally have been diagnosed and been given medicine (Clonazepam and Paxil).
5909,"I thought I was doing well...I've only been on meds since September and I thought I was improving, I really did."
5910,I thought I'd be fine with the meds.
5911,My wife thinks it's her fault even though I've sat down and explained to her it's the meds not her but I digress.
5912,"Also is there another medication for Anxiety besides benzos that won't cause sexual dysfunction like SSRI's

Thanks in advance guys and gals."
5913,I have read about medication for those with social anxiety.
5914,"If I could see a doctor, do you think they would prescribe me medication?"
5915,Has anyone with social anxiety taken medication and has it worked for them?
5916,The only thing that has ever worked was medication [SSRI] that keep my serotonin amount on a  more or less 'normal' level.
5917,"I know that the first 6-8 weeks can be hard and I will kill myself if I can't get my life back, and I'm trying to stay on this medication for at least two months to see if this helps."
5918,I guess this medication is the right fit for me and maybe I don't need any other kind of pill ... but is it really okay for me to just be okay?
5919,"it's almost like I want to fight this ""being okay facade"" i guess i'd like to call it .. and stop taking the meds again to feel the panic ... but thats just crazy right?"
5920,"I take medication everyday, and I also take Klonopin as needed."
5921,I'm also really scared that I'll be trapped somewhere without my medication and end up doing something harmful.
5922,"I remember that before I was on my medication I would be paranoid all the time, and every time I would enter a dark room, I would be worried that the moment I turned the lights on, something bad would happen."
5923,I am on medication now and I no longer think those things.
5924,"I am really scared, and this still scares me now even though I am on medication and am doing better."
5925,"**  

So throughout high school and much of college, I tried various medications:  SSRI's, mood stabilizers, benzos, and tranquilizers."
5926,Has anyone found any other forms of coping with their anxiety that worked and didn't involve medication?
5927,I'm looking to avoid taking medications if I can.
5928,The antianxiety part of the meds isnt enough to counteract the drowsiness it causes.
5929,My mom is the one paying for my meds and that makes me even more anxious.
5930,"It's been closer to two years of trying different medications, a lot of bad ideas of course imo...mostly antidepressants, an antihistamine, and buspirone which helped until I got so used to it that it lost it's anxiolytic effects."
5931,"I've tried therapy (CBT - really didn't work for me, considering ACT/mindfulness) medication (on lamictal which usually for bipolar, and has helped the depression but not the anxiety), meditation, exercise, diet, reframing etc etc."
5932,I don't have access to medication because I dont have insurance yet.
5933,No medications.
5934,"What's worse is I have medicine ""for emergencies"" but I'm too afraid to take it."
5935,"I want to live with a clear head, and without medication."
5936,I plan on bringing this up with my doctor soon but I just didn't know if it was 'normal' for feelings to start up again after taking medication.
5937,and the experiences I had with different therapies and meds.
5938,Just wondering if anyone else here is on blood pressure medicine because of whenever they go to the dr. when they take the blood pressure reading it is really high because of the anxiety.
5939,"**NOTE: This phobia developed when I was 12, and actually had an allergic reaction to a medication and had to go to the ER - even though the reaction was very mild, one of the symptoms was my throat feeling tight**"
5940,"But I've been learning how to manage it without meds, but recently had a relapse and feel the need to take a small dosage -- 25mg or even half that -- of my meds (Zoloft)."
5941,"I don't like to rely on meds, but it sure does take the edge off and makes me a happier person (quality of life)."
5942,But this is medicine.
5943,"I know it would be best to be off of the meds, but if I'm mentally dealing with anxiety and panic attacks then I might have trouble getting pregnant."
5944,"I've been medication-free for 4 months now, but have to deal with my constant anxiety."
5945,"My medication takes care of it day to day, but it's still there."
5946,So I've had a complete meltdown about 2 months ago and I've since started taking meds to get better.
5947,I am very afraid to take the medication.
5948,"EDIT: I'm a 26 year old male, no medications, have insurance."
5949,"Oh, they're 16, androgynous (gender neutral), they don't know what type of anxiety (or even aknowledge it,) no meds, Aus."
5950,"""Successfully"" meaning getting off the medication and finding your anxiety level to be much more manageable."
5951,I'm really trying to do my homework on the medication before starting it.
5952,The idea of taking medication indefinitely scares the hell out of me.
5953,I'm not on meds or in therapy but I do have valium.
5954,I'm on meds and in therapy and everything but none of it seems to be working.
5955,"I'm on different meds for anxiety and insomnia, before I could get to bed the other night I had a mild attack thinking about work and life."
5956,When my sleep meds finally kicked in I was out and slept through two alarms.
5957,I was just put on these meds about two weeks ago because I developed anxiety from this job.
5958,Fast forward 9 years and +80 lbs (just wonderful...) I finally want to tackle this weight issue the medication has brought upon me since it has proved to be virtually impossible for me to lose weight while taking this drug and I want to try to handle my anxiety and serotonin defficiency without medication.
5959,"I feel like things have been getting better though, I've never taken meds before."
5960,"I was on medication for depression and anxiety during high school, but eventually got to a place where I did not feel that medication was the best choice for me."
5961,"I haven't been on medication in about three years, now."
5962,"Over a year of therapy, both individual and group, psychiatrist, medications, a week in the mental ward, and I'm still not going anywhere."
5963,"My doctor agreed with my choice and both my doctor and therapist agreed that maybe meds were not the treatment for me, as my anxiety and depression are highly situational and at a second glance, aren't the type of thing you want to treat with medication first."
5964,The meds should technically be out of my system now but I'm still so anxious.
5965,Last year I failed two classes because I had medication and health problems and failed the classes solely because of poor attendance.
5966,"And on top of all that I just had my meds bumped from 20mg to 40mg because I was starting to have all my old symptoms (heart palpitations, adrenaline rushes, dizziness, etc), but now I am falling asleep standing up and anytime I'm not at work I am laying down wherever I can and closing my eyes."
5967,They are switching meds and they two (cymbalta and prozac) are interacting to cause some awful anxiety.
5968,I don't want medication.
5969,I can't pay for therapy right now so I want some type of medication to help lift it a bit.
5970,I was on medication before but not long to where it could kick in and help do it's job.
5971,I avoid medication and stick to herbal tea and self-therapy.
5972,I have been off and on medications since I was 11.
5973,I am on meds now that don't help as much as they should.
5974,I've descended deep into agoraphobia (no outside for 1 year+) and would like to get on some meds.
5975,"I went from 50 mg of generic Zoloft (sertraline) to 100 mg, and all the awful side effects I was feeling when I first started the medication came back except worse."
5976,I feel like my psychiatrist doesn't fully understand the effects of the medicine on me and he isn't listening when I said that I really felt the side effects when I started taking the meds.
5977,"However, I have never been diagnosed because my mum has basically said ""You're not allowed to go on medication and they won't do shit else for you""."
5978,"No matter what I do, no motivation, no strategy, medicine, therapy can do to stop the other me's."
5979,"I've been suffering with anxiety for about 10 years, most of my life I've been able to handle it pretty fine without medicine."
5980,"I've suffered from mild social anxiety ever since high school, and other than a few panic attacks and avoiding many social situations, I was just fine, no meds or anything."
5981,"The pediatrician I saw prescribed me celexa once, but uhh it made my butthole bleed so after we found out that was the culprit, my mom has been hesitant to put me on any medication, and I didn't really feel I needed it anyway."
5982,I am not on any daily meds but do have an as needed benzodiazepine to take in low doses.
5983,I have nothing against medication and have seen it work well for others.
5984,"Every once and awhile I contemplate getting off of my medication to live a more ""natural"" lifestyle, then I remember how terrible life was."
5985,"I visited my psychologist (who I saw before starting the meds) to discuss my thoughts about coming off, and she was completely against it."
5986,I've been dating my boyfriend now for 6 months and I've been an open book about my medication and past anxiety throughout our relationship.
5987,Someone who didn't know me before the medication really doesn't understand or see what the function is and how it positively affects my life.
5988,How do you explain to someone the importance of a medication when they have not seen your quality of life prior?
5989,"I asked them if they wanted my medical doctor, who prescribes me my meds, or my psychologist, who makes my mental health diagnoses."
5990,I now take a daily medication and given beta blockers for performing if I need them.
5991,"However,  I feel like the medicine has to be a secret."
5992,It just gets difficult when in the giant sea of colleagues it is almost like a dark mark to take these medicines.
5993,"I emailed my doctor and she said we can talk about medication changes, and I'm going to up my trips to the talk therapy."
5994,Do you guys think based on your experience medication could help this?
5995,"I don't want medications for anxiety, I have a friend that takes meds for it and is a complete zombie without a personality."
5996,"I received my prescription for Wellbutrin SR today, and I'd like to probe those that have taken it or similar medications for things I need to be on the lookout for."
5997,"I'm hoping this medication can help me sort of balance out, I'm looking forward to supporting a better daily life."
5998,"I've run the gamut of doctors and medications so I have a very long paper trail, so to speak, of varied diagnoses."
5999,"I'm pretty sure this is not just the placebo effect because I've never felt this way before in my life, and I've already been through two other medicines that I can compare it to."
6000,"Therapy (I have an amazing therapist) and meds (Zoloft, 25 mg starting dose and now 50mg) have brought me from point A to point B:

Point A: Crying for sometimes 6+ hours, couldn't eat, cried in the bathroom at work, stopped working altogether, relationship with fiance severely strained, losing weight, sleeping for 2 - 4 hours per night, constant fog and depersonalization, intense depression and hopelessness, feelings of dread/phobia regarding work, constantly triggered by almost everything


Point B: Able to attend social events, returned to work and ended the year on a great note (I am a teacher), went to the bar with colleagues, excited to plan my wedding and day trips with fiance/friends, eating full meals and no anxiety about food, sleeping 8+ hours nightly, hope for the future, desire to help others and excitement for my upcoming school year, very few triggers and able to calm down when I am triggered."
6001,This all changed in a matter of weeks due to therapy and meds.
6002,"Seek therapy, possibly meds, don't let yourself needlessly suffer."
6003,This was because I went to the hospital for endometroisis pain and I had a bad reaction to a medication they gave me for the pain.
6004,"Anxious about the future, starting new meds, and coming to terms with my diagnosis."
6005,I would like to eventually be independent of SSRIs and other meds and I think that this device seems to be the most promising way.
6006,"I don't know what to try next, but I have an appointment today to discuss next steps for medication."
6007,I also deal with severe hypochondria (which is somewhat justified as I have a chronic illness and was a very sick child) so over thanksgiving break I asked my psychiatrist to increase my meds.
6008,"I have no issue with medication, just terrified of gaining weight."
6009,"I'm fed up with trying to get better, fed up with switching medications in order to feel better, so fed up that I would rather give in to depression than fight it."
6010,"I'm trying to figure out if I have it or not, so I can consider moving forward with some form of medication if possible."
6011,"Doctors keep trying medicine on me that ""may or may not work"" or ""takes months to be effective"" and I feel like I don't have control over anything in my life anymore."
6012,I was prescribed citalopram teva for a few years in my youth but stopped taking it because somehow i thought i could power through this and that i was weak if i needed medication for it.
6013,"She does not know i have been on medication or anything, except she knows im very  shy in social settings but i doubt she knows the full extent of this."
6014,The last time i had like a 10 min talk with my doctor and he just prescribed some meds but i feel like that didnt work very well.
6015,"Also discussed it with my mom, who I recently found out is on medicine for anxiety and is fairly against me being medicated."
6016,Have there been any medications you've taken that help?
6017,"I got stressed that I wouldn't be able to get medication, but called the doctor, he immediately sent in a new script, and everything was fine....

Two days ago I went back, on day 14 of the newest cycle, to refill...."
6018,I will have gone 48+ hours with zero medication...
6019,"What if she's right, and I really have to start taking several-day lapses in medication before they'll refill?"
6020,"While this medicine relieved the attacks, I feel like I was a zombie for those two years."
6021,I'm still just as anxious as I was before the medication.
6022,"My mom told me the psychiatrist doesn't prescribe medication on the first visit, but thats really the reason I am visiting."
6023,"My question is, if anxiety is a chemical imbalance which isn't really testable is there anything you can just say to get them to prescribe the medication faster?"
6024,And in that case can't anyone go see the doctor and say the right thing to get medication since they don't know what happens in your private life outside of what you tell them?
6025,The last couple of nights I've taken meds to sleep which normally work but my anxiety is running so high I've just lay there for hours panicking and not being able to sleep.
6026,TL;DR: Would like suggested meds similar to/or benzodiazepines which work very quickly and are quite strong.
6027,I went to my doctor yestarday after 3 months of bad anxiety and I was finally able to get some medication.
6028,"As I'm only 17, the only meds I could get were fluoxetine."
6029,"I know the best course of action would be to encourage her to go see a therapist and/or get medications, but due to her experiences with them far in the past (before I knew her) there is no way I can get her to do so."
6030,"I have visited several health professionals and have tried different meds for the past 2-3 years (I'm currently on [Strattera](http://www.rxlist.com/strattera-drug.htm) 40mg), but nothing seems to work for me so far."
6031,"I'm 17, male, and what I want to get out of this is some sort of medication, something I can step off onto and go into the right direction."
6032,"-.-'

What are the chances I'll be prescribed any medication?"
6033,"Hey Reddit, my dad has pretty bad anxiety and was prescribed meds for it but doesn't take it so it could run in the family."
6034,Could a doctor prescribe me a non-psychiatric medication to deal with this physical symptom of tightness in the chest?
6035,Im already on AD's and anxiety medications  but i dont want to take a lorezepam or alprazolam every time my chest gets all tight.
6036,But id love a non psychiatric medication to make my chest tightness go away!
6037,Charlie already has end of life problems and requires medication for the remainder of his life.
6038,The most common seems to be combined therapy and medication.
6039,My issue is that prescriptive medication is a trigger for me.
6040,"I am fearful all the time I'm gone, even with medicine."
6041,"I've always wondered if I ever took medicine if it would help me and my moods or thoughts at all, I used to see a counselor that has known me since I was 8, and has said I might need medicine but didn't see if there was any push for it yet."
6042,The brain fog is probably one of the main reasons why I started medication because it was starting to really impede on my success in school and in life in general.
6043,I think this is a concern that many people who start medication have: am I going to be a totally different person if this is effective?
6044,"The trick is - most of my anxiety and sadness is connected with physical appearance, and these medications have a reputation of making people weight more."
6045,"*EDIT: BTW, I'm on meds, seen doctors, etc"
6046,"From the beginning of my history of anxiety and panic attacks, I have always held firm to not taking medication and trying to beat it naturally."
6047,When I went to my doctor to discuss medication he was adamant I should be trying Citalopram.
6048,Within 20 minutes of talking to the psychiatrist she was already talking medication and offering to prescribe it to me.
6049,(i was taken aback about how quickly she'd offered medication as a solution) but i guess that's what doctors do?
6050,an anti-depressant.. she advised however that it can be used as an antianxiety medication.
6051,gabapentin on the other hand is a seizure medicine that also treats restless leg syndrome...
6052,-what is your experience on this medication?
6053,"I call bullshit, these meds are incredibly addictive."
6054,I was prescribed xanax and ended up abusing them for a few months so medication isn't something I'm comfortable with.
6055,"I had a girlfriend, who actually was on anti-anxiety medication herself, but that was years ago."
6056,"I do not take medication, have never taken drugs, and I do not have PTSD (I'm fortunate in that nothing that bad has happened to me)."
6057,I've decided to see how I feel without medication for the first time in 5 years.
6058,"I've tried a bunch of different meds but always experienced intolerable digestive side effects, which seem to negate any positive emotional benefit I may have gotten from them."
6059,Anyway-- I'm curious to hear how others who have tried medication and gone off of it have dealt with it.
6060,Have you found that it's possible to manage your anxiety without the aid of meds?
6061,I've been taking my anxiety medication but I don't want to overdo it.
6062,"Even girls laugh at me idk why, Why people laugh at me and give me verbal abuses, i go insane thinking about it, can't sleep at night, I've only dated one girl and even that relationship was difficult, I've been to a shrink he listened to my problems and put me on meds but he couldn't tell why People laugh at me, why girls are mean to my face, I hate myself for even being alive."
6063,After several therapists and several medications things got a little better.
6064,I haven't needed to be on regular meds in a while so all I have to help is some low dose ativan.
6065,"The problem is that resorting to treating though medication  feels like losing to it, as if it's giving up in a sense."
6066,I'd just like to know your experiences with starting medication and which drug is more effective when using it PRN.
6067,So I am curious: what do some of you personally do to manage your anxiety without prescription medication?
6068,"I'm also going back to school in a few weeks, and I want to start some treatment (medication, therapy, or something) before I go back."
6069,"I took my medication maybe an hour ago or so, and I'm feeling nauseous."
6070,I don't want to be on this medication for the rest of my life as a crutch.
6071,I scared myself by looking up what happens if you vomit right after taking your medication.
6072,What I found instead were the withdrawal symptoms from this medication.
6073,"I am on medication for Bipolar Disorder [type 1, rapid-cycling], I was diagnosed a couple of years ago."
6074,"I just started a new medication a couple of weeks ago, so far things are going fine with that."
6075,"I'll try to make a long story short here:

-Anxiety like crazy since 2005ish, worsening pains in neck
-Stubborn about going to docs, finally went years later after it got bad
-Many medications tried, lorezepam, xanax, stuff that felt nauseating and weird
-Eventually go to new doctor, get a neck adjustment like chiropractors do, given muscle relaxers and steroid for a week
-Feel ok for around 2 months, symptoms return in full, return to new doc
-Another adjustment, after 5 days things feel even worse
-Get prescribed a weeks worth of Valium."
6076,I'm pretty paranoid about pills and I barely even take aspirin but I never had such success with any other medication as with valium.
6077,"I am on zoloft 50 mg a day, I will be starting xanax or one of the drugs in that family soon, my question is, with all those medications, would this interfer with my ability to properly do CBT?"
6078,"What they do,besides medication, that has helps them with anxiety."
6079,"After that episode, I got back on the meds, but after 2 months, I think they've stopped working for me."
6080,I have already made the appointment with my doc to discuss the next step as far as meds go.
6081,"I'm in the process of meeting with a psychologist, but finding the right one for me will take time as well as finding a medication that works, so any tips and tricks that aren't the same thing I'd find with a simple google search?"
6082,"I had gone off of Celexa by myself about six months ago, so it wasn't a wean off/wean on of meds."
6083,"I have been suffering from very bad health anxiety ever since  my father died last year and have been to therapy which didn't help an awful lot, but I have decided to engage in the process again possibly in combination with a medication."
6084,I have always been scared of taking meds.
6085,I am also scared of missing out on some aspects of the college experience due to being on medication.
6086,Can you give some advice to a person that needs medication but to scared to take it.
6087,"I feel like I'll never get better (can barely afford seeing a doctor and buying meds, can't afford to see a therapist at the moment)."
6088,"Thinking I had flu symptoms, I go into RiteAid and buy some Theraflu, again struggling to even walk around without shaking really badly and breathing hard, but I made it home, took the medicine and laid down for an hour."
6089,This includes behavior modifying medicine.
6090,My stepfather has been diagnosed with depression and is regularly seeing a psychologist and is taking medication.
6091,"I'm also afraid to take the medicine perscribed me, paroxin."
6092,"I'm worried that this is going to lead to becoming dependent on alcohol, so I'm starting to consider going to a doctor and getting medication for my anxiety."
6093,"Is it okay for me to tell them I think I may have anxiety/OCD and think medicine may help, or will this make it look like I'm just drug seeking?"
6094,"The medication made me very lethargic, made me gain weight, and made me feel emotionless."
6095,"yeah so the past week or so i've been feeling great but i've had intermittant periods of feeling awful, how do i go about telling my new therapist my symptoms and how resistant should i be to medication?"
6096,I barely know anyone and today is my first day after all summer I've taken my meds for ADHD.
6097,When I finally forced myself to go to the doctor and admit I needed help I was put on medication that gave me WILD mood swings and seriously messed up my thinking.
6098,I took myself off the medication and went back to the doctor only to almost be committed to a hospital.
6099,I went to a different doctor and was given a mild medication for depression.
6100,In August I was off the medication and doing well.
6101,"The last few months, I've been working with my physician to try to find a medication that will work for me."
6102,I'm very sensitive to these medications and they all ended up making me feel physically very uncomfortable.
6103,"Xanax has been the best medication I've tried so far for controlling the feeling of an oncoming panic attack, although it always felt like it didn't do much for my 'mental' anxiety."
6104,Can someone recommend me medication I could take for this?
6105,"When I was 18, with the help of medication and some cbt, I realised I wanted to go to university so I needed to get myself there, and made massive progress."
6106,"I'm nowhere near cured yet, I'm still on high dose medication but I'm getting there for myself."
6107,"I see a therapist, take meds, and exercise, but I'm finding it difficult to resolve these negativities, or at least make progress up the hill which at times feels like Mt."
6108,She's seen a doctor and she's starting counselling and probably going to start taking meds.
6109,I'm hesitant to get on medication because of a lack of understanding by my family (i'm on their insurance) and a fear of addiction.
6110,I was on meds like Clonazepam but it made me drowsy.
6111,"I wasn't panicky, I wasn't obsessing about stuff, I felt normal, and I was so proud of myself for bring able to feel good without medication."
6112,I guess I'm wondering if I should go back on my meds.
6113,I was so afraid of getting on medication (what if there are horrible side effects?
6114,I'm not on any meds by the way but I'm seeing a psychiatrist on friday
6115,"So for 2 years now, I've been trying several anxiety medications off and on, and for about a year now, I've been getting progressively worse electric shocks in my head."
6116,"Unfortunately, regardless of medicine, the progression of the shocks in my head are only getting worse."
6117,"Now reading about this withdrawal symptom, it sounded like the medicine should at least have an effect on it, which it doesn't for me."
6118,I'm guessing I have a mild sort of anxiety and I'm not taking any meds.
6119,"Anyways, I was going to a doctor and was on a waiting list for a therapist, I’ve been through plenty of meds for depression and anxiety, my last prescription I’ve taken was a generic clonazepam, or k-pin."
6120,I’ve never driven in my life and I’ve only had one job in my life and that was through college when I was going and taking my medication.
6121,"The thing is, they are psychologists and not medical doctors so they will not be able to prescribe me any medication."
6122,"I have pretty bad anxiety &amp; even though I'm on medication for it, I'm super super jittery &amp; scared &amp; jumpy right now."
6123,Is there any other useful medications or things I can do to combat any of this?
6124,"Recently though I've been taking medication, and been using a bi-pap to combat narcolepsy, and sleep apnea."
6125,i just want to be normal and get rid of my anxiety by a more natural way without medication.
6126,"Let me mention I'm 4'11 and 96 pounds so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with how my body takes meds...anyways...I've been suffering with anxiety/ mostly social anxiety, paranoia and depression for years but progressively got worse these past few months."
6127,The medications I take currently alongside Zoloft is Biotin pills for my hair and Ortho Tri cyclen Birth control.
6128,"I have had a lot of anxiety over the years, I was diagnosed with GAD, depression, and PTSD and have been managing it with meds, RCBT, and stuff like that, and I feel bad for putting this on here because there are people with real problems."
6129,"I spent some time doing nothing, sulking, and then I lost my health insurance and had to stop the anti-anxiety meds cold turkey."
6130,"I know I still have a long way to go because my triggers still scare me and I want to avoid them, but I think meds are working for me so far and getting me out of crisis mode of non-stop panic/depression."
6131,I'm not currently on any medication and I really don't feel comfortable starting.
6132,Did you find meds that worked for you?
6133,"I haven't been in therapy for almost 15 years, and I'm terrified to go back (I had a bad experience with one in my teens, and it's just compounded in my mind that they're all going to be like that), but I know that I'm at the point with my anxiety/depression/ED that I need professional help other than medication."
6134,"That made me loss nearly every bit of self-confidence I had and I was regressed back to the level of a child, receiving medicine on a schedule from my father as I cried on my parents' sofa about how afraid I was and what a failure I was."
6135,I don't want to see a therapist because i know all they are going to do is recommend some sort of medication and i'd rather not become addicted to pills.
6136,"We don't talk about those things where I'm from, and we respect people less who need or think they need meds."
6137,"My anxiety and panic attacks started last November, I've tried different medications, only switching to the current one about a month ago."
6138,"Since then, I've gained almost 20lbs due partly to the meds and partly to me feeling like shit and eating to cover it up."
6139,"Take a good sugarless multi-vitamin every day (if you have phobias of new medicines or foods, take half and sit outside the hospital or at the doctors)

2."
6140,"I take meds for my stress, seen psychologists my whole life, but as much as I'd like to deny it, I feel like I'm at a dead end."
6141,I haven't taken any anti-anxiety medications such as Ativan for almost 2 years.
6142,I saw my primary care physician about my current issues and they said it is just anxiety and that I could go and see a psychiatrist to get my medications tweaked.
6143,I'm having trouble agreeing with my doctor that my issue is just anxiety but since I don't have a medical degree I figured I should ask if anyone has had similar problems with anxiety or their medications?
6144,I heard that Paxil has some really bad side affects when you try to get off of the medication.
6145,"Recently, I've thought about going to the doctor to try to get some type of medication for the anxiety, but I just don't have the guts to speak up for myself every time I go to the doctor."
6146,"My doc has highlighted two medications, Prozac and Inderal as possible treatment options."
6147,Right now I'm not sure if either of these medications are right for me and I'm open to exploring alternative medications.
6148,"I realise everyone benefits from different treatments, but what are some recommend meds for GAD and social anxiety?"
6149,"Bear with me, it's long:

There were no refills left on my anti-anxiety medication so I had the pharmacy contact my doctor for more refills."
6150,I made it very clear to her that I was completely out of medication and needed it immediately.
6151,"This is of course the medication that kicks out extremely quickly out of the 3 I'm on so I'm already having withdrawal symptoms-- headache, tired, irritable, nausea, diarrhea, and if this goes on longer I know I'll have other symptoms too because this happened once before."
6152,I'm also planning on making another appointment with my psychiatrist to see if maybe any medications need to be changed as well.
6153,"I've been trying to take it one step at a time and get better, go to therapy, take my meds, try to breath."
6154,"It's getting to the point where I need to do something about it, and I think I can greatly benefit from medication."
6155,"I'm a generally logical, optimistic person, I just can't control my fear sometimes, and that occasional overwhelming sense of fear can be best controlled by medication I think."
6156,"I am more willing to try using cannabis as a treatment alternative to prescription medications, which I know can have severe side effects."
6157,"I am on Zoloft, and I stepped down from the 200 mg to 150 mg dosage a few months back (this medicine has been impact my memory to an extent, and I have been trying to scale it back to regain some of it)."
6158,"I really want to explore some alternatives to upping my medication, because it has really depleted my short term memory for some reason (it use to be airtight years ago, now I am forgetting things (I am not sure if it is anxiety/depression/OCD invisibly manifesting in the time prior to working at the theatre, or due to long term use of Zoloft))."
6159,"Before anyone asks, Yes I'm on medicine (Celexa), yes I'm going to see a therapist."
6160,"I don't even know and I'm trying to think it through and these meds are making me feel weird as fuck and I just don't know, just as I get a bit of happiness in my life I doubt it."
6161,I was on meds for over a year and after seeing significant improvement my doctor recommended we stop the treatment and see how i would do without them.
6162,"I want somebody who I can talk to long enough to get a proper diagnosis (where a GP failed a few years ago), but I also want them to be able to prescribe medication."
6163,"on meds, off meds, in therapy, out of therapy."
6164,I feel like utter shit and I don't want to do a 4 hour round trip for my meds.
6165,"I struggled at the beginning but with medication, meditation and help from some friends I have made it until now."
6166,"So now naturally I'm just sitting here, worried that I have cancer or kidney disease or a terminal illness that i could have caught in time if I had gotten blood work before but now it is terminal..

Also I have had high blood pressure for about 3 years, so am afraid that i have an underlying disorder like diabetes or something else that is making it high, especially since my medication has had to be raised recently."
6167,"I've done it all to stop being so anxious-- medication, mindful meditation, therapy (found an amazing therapist through the International OCD Foundation that knows what he's talking about!"
6168,I'm scared to death that they might give me the wrong medicine because I read that bipolar disorder and depression are usually diagnosed wrong and if someone with bipolar disorder takes antidepressants it gets worst...
6169,It was amazing to see the change in her just adding a medication.
6170,"My question is to those of you on meds now or have been on meds, what do you recommend?"
6171,"I have pretty bad anxiety when it comes to social interactions, occasionally panic attacks as well, and I know that if I see someone about it, there's some medications out there to make it better."
6172,"I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with GAD and tried several medicines, many of which did not work and were antidepressants (some were lexapro, wellbutrin, paxil, and even hydroxyzine)."
6173,I am pretty scared of medications which is partially why I haven't taken some of the ones prescribed to me for long periods of time.
6174,"I can't go to bars or clubs and talk to and meet people because of the anxiety (and that was true even before the last 15 months), not that I could drink anyway with the anxiety medication, and I have no idea how else to meet people (I've looked at meetup.com, nothing interesting by me)."
6175,I'm looking for some alternatives to daily medications for my anxiety.
6176,"I felt none of my doctors really cared or were helping much, especially when I mentioned repeatedly that I did not feel well on any of these meds."
6177,"My doctor was kind enough to call in refills every two months since then and CVS has a plan where both my meds are only $40 per month total, but I ran out of Klonopin on Tuesday and I'm going insane."
6178,"I've fallen back into drinking on my meds (did it last time I was on meds, five years ago, and it ruined me)."
6179,Does anyone else have experience with these two meds?
6180,What's been a good combination of meds that's worked for you?
6181,"I take 3 kinds of medication, morning: Fluoxetin 60 mg and Lyrica 100 mg (I should be taking 75 mg, but doc said I should try to see if I feel any effects from the meds when I raise/lower the dosage, as I've been complaining that they don't feel like they help any more *inhale*), evening: Mirtazapin 45 mg and Lyrica 75 mg."
6182,I'm also guessing it's related to medication as it's happened more often since I increased Lyrica with 25 mg.
6183,I'm really freaked out about what all this medication does to my brain.
6184,"Since then, I haven't had any appetite, even after being on meds."
6185,I've been on anti-depressants and other medication to manage severe panic attacks since it happened a year ago.
6186,"I'm not on medication right now, I was for about five or six years and slowly got off it."
6187,"I have the panic attacks under control, and am off meds."
6188,What worries me most is the feeling of being alone and undersupported by my fellow doctors (I am a pathologist and teacher in this branch of medicine).
6189,I've tried medicine and stuff like that but it doesn't seem to work.
6190,":/

I haven't had therapy or taken any medications."
6191,Amy has been on multiple medications and seen many different therapists over her life.
6192,"I'm not on any medication at all and I don't have a bad/unusual medical history, no abusive childhood, nor have I done drugs or had alcohol."
6193,I went off my medication due to feeling like a robot for 2 years straight.
6194,Cuz at this point I want to stop taking the medication
6195,"I was under the impression that I would simply be talking to a psychiatrist, getting some medication for my panic, and going home."
6196,Ps it is not the cause of medications.
6197,"Stomach meds were switched to generic Protonix (proton pump inhibitor, acid blockers didn't work)."
6198,"Recently I decided to finally get help and today I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Lexapro and Valium

I've been advised to take both before going to bed which should be now but all I've been doing for the last hour is sitting up comtemplating actually taking my medication or not."
6199,Should I take this medication or not?
6200,"So I've been on Cipralex for about 2 1/2 years now, and I'm worried that I might be having more serious side effects from the medication."
6201,"I'm hoping that it's something else, as this medication has been working great for me in treating my anxiety and I haven't had a serious anxiety attack since I started taking it."
6202,I really don't want to ruin my progress by having to switch to another medication which may be worse for me.
6203,Did I get a bad batch of meds or accidentally given the generic brand?
6204,I decided to make a note to take my meds in the morning.
6205,"Also in case you need to know, I am not on any medications."
6206,"Would a medication be useful, and worth it?"
6207,"I have a psychiatrist so it would be easy to get medication, but I take adderall daily and wouldn't want anything to interfere with it (I should mention that the adderall doesn't make me jittery, if anything it makes me less jittery unless I take a high dose)."
6208,"I'm afraid the doctor'll judge and think my cries and pleas are just an excuse to obtain *'dem meds'*, which is all kinds of stupid, as my doctor knows just as well as I do that I'm no drug seeker, but still: I cannot shake the feeling of impending doom."
6209,I personally decided to go with the first option and forgo any form of medication.
6210,There is by no means anything wrong with taking medication for anxiety (I eventually went that route after about 2 years) I just felt at the time that the best course of action for myself personally was therapy on it's own to see how that had an effect on getting my anxiety under control.
6211,"Just give me meds, or pretend to jot down some notes and then tell me to go home and lay down?"
6212,Well even the sleep meds don't work because my sleep schedule is MESSED up now.
6213,"- **Cognitive behavioural therapy**

- **The right medication**

- **Support from those close to me**

I cannot stress enough the importance of these."
6214,The medication is also immensely helpful.
6215,"Without CBT or medication, I would not be where I am today."
6216,"Medication is not a great solution since I already spend quite a sum for my asthma, allergy and psoriasis medication."
6217,"has anyone who has been on meds for a while ever had to adjust their med dosage for short term, situational anxiety, like job stress or death of a loved one?"
6218,"I did therapy, took medication, learned meditation (ADHD, so no real results there), and started the gym (3 years in, still attending)."
6219,I lost an insane amount of weight...to the part I was frightfully skinny.....Flash forward I'm 26 on a great set of meds and I see a counselor regularly....However when I have a extended period of stress or anxiety I stop eating.....the mere sight of food makes me sick.....
6220,"Just four days ago, I started taking Welbutrin, along with some other meds my medical doctor put me on, including a water pill for blood pressure and Pepcid for reflux."
6221,"It's only 150 mg, but I've never taken any kind of anti-anxiety meds before, so I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is normal."
6222,Even if I get meds do you think that would be enough?
6223,"For other medications, I was on Effexor for a while and it was awful."
6224,"She doesn't think I need to consider medication right now, and that was a relief."
6225,"You don't have to be a total mess before you go (I actually worried that I wasn't anxious enough to warrant a therapist) you don't have to go on meds (if you don't want to), and you don't even have to commit to more than one session."
6226,"age: 23

Hi everyone!"
6227,I'm worried about going on medications because new things like that scare me.
6228,"The class of people that experience these extremely strong physical symptoms, often get diagnosed with ""panic disorder"" and are offered CBT or various anti-anxiety medication."
6229,Will this be looked back on in 50 years as one of the most embarrassing episodes of modern medicine that a large subset of people went misdiagnosed/undiagnosed due to apathy.
6230,"I left the school, and although I haven't been medicated, I'm on my way to recovery through lifestyle changes (I don't want medication due to family members having issues with it, and because I didn't have any anxiety before that year, I'm hoping my anxiety problems will get better over time)."
6231,"This time I couldn't hide it, Because now I had developed full blown panic disorder (Random panic attacks for absolutely no reason, Different to Free floating Anxiety) My parents knew everything, They brought me to the doctor who put me on medication (Zoloft) - Worst thing to ever have happened to me."
6232,"See, As I told in a mental hospital (Will get to this part of the story in a minute), Anti-depressants should be prescribed very very carefully to someone with hypochondria, As the extreme side-effects can make things worse, As can they very medication itself cause panic attacks to get worse."
6233,I rang my doctor every day asking what the hell this medication was doing to me.
6234,"They put needles in you, they give you medicine that causes horrible side effects, they put a tube down your throat or up your ass, they drug you and they cut you up."
6235,"I have been on two medications so far, and on my last visit when I attempted to explain that the risperidone wasn't working, she didn't actually listen to a word I said."
6236,"After that, she seemed confused and asked me, a child with no medical training, what she should do, as if her knowledge didn't exist outside of two anxiety medications."
6237,"The doctor mentioned cognitive behavioural therapy, medication, exercise, etc."
6238,"but she has suffered depression in the past but is very, very against medication and the thought of therapy quite literally scares her."
6239,"BTW: M 18 have Socialized Anxiety Disorder and Generalzied Anxiety Disorder, currently have no meds."
6240,"A note about meds/supplements: while I appreciate the suggestions, I've tried lots of different meds over the years, and sometimes they help, and sometimes they don't, and sometimes I can't take them because of the side effects."
6241,"I am not on any kind of medication for my anxiety, I have been before but then I moved to another country and have yet to go see a new therapist/doctor."
6242,"Normally I wouldn't dream of going down such a potentially shady rout, but I'm an expat in a country where my medication--Zoloft--often isn't in stock, and my prescription is running low."
6243,Not to mention my doctor has recently prescribed me medication which has an (All be it rare) chance of making asthma worse.
6244,I've finally realized that I should see a therapist and see if there is any medication I should be taking.
6245,"I was on medication for so long, but I hated all the side effects and really felt like it took away from my personality."
6246,I don't want to take medication and I don't like going to psychiatrists because they just throw pills at me.
6247,I started seeing a new doctors closer to my school last month and she put me on a new medication that's really been helping me.
6248,I left for winter break soon after and I ran out of my meds this week.
6249,I'm really nervous about all this stuff and I've only been off the meds for a couple of days and I'm already starting to feel overwhelmed.
6250,I can't take my ADHD medication without the anxiety pills so I'm not going to be able to focus on anything.
6251,"I am currently taking medication, but I still do suffer from shakiness."
6252,I'm on medication and I see a counselor once a week.
6253,They don't believe in getting therapy or medication to fix anxiety.
6254,"My boyfriend has told me that he will talk to them for me, but again, I'm too worried it'll upset them and then end up going down the road of telling me I need to grow out of this problem and there's really no medication for me to take that will help me because it's not real."
6255,Appointments were basically all about medication and that was it.
6256,I had been forgetting to take my medication and was a little crazy.
6257,"I have been on anxiety meds, but I refused to take them as I thought I could handle this on my own, but I have finally realized with everything being so new to me, that I cannot handle this on my own and my boyfriend, well, I don't wanna have him stress over it too because he worries when I am like this."
6258,"I think it's well-known that medication use alone for anxiety isn't sustainable in the long run (tolerance, side effects, etc)."
6259,"I first went to the doctor to get help for my anxiety at age 17 which I'm almost certain came from all the stay's in juvenile hall mixed in with daily wellbutrin dosing some ""kind"" doctor thinking it would help my ""depression"" which I didn't have, I just didn't know the difference between anxiety and depression when I was that young so instead of getting anxiety meds he gave me depression meds."
6260,"I don't want some form of depression medication because I'm not depressed, I need anxiety medication for the attacks I'm going to get in public once I start to open my self up to the real world again."
6261,"I liked the medication I was on before, but since then I know these drugs have been in the public a lot and I don't want to come across as some guy looking to work the doctor over."
6262,Should I talk to the GP about going on medication for my anxiety?
6263,Therapy didn't help - in the past ... is it time to go back on medication?
6264,"I  keep my meds in my purse , just incase I need it at work."
6265,"I know how many I had taken , I keep track of my meds."
6266,Why the fuck would anyone take someone's anxiety meds?
6267,"The other two I eliminated from the list of possible suspects, are friends of mine that I know really well and they know that my meds is what keeps me from being a basket case."
6268,"Hi, I'm a freshman at my university studying medicine."
6269,I suffer from social anxiety and mild depression and have decided to give medicine a try.
6270,Today it seems like I've almost come back down and I had an anxiety attack for the first time since taking the meds.
6271,"oh yeah, I was put on medication for anxiety around 2 years ago (sorry I don't remember the name but I'm sure it was for mild cases of anxiety) but it really didn't help at all so I basically stopped taking it."
6272,"**Edit 2 (sorry):** I also took an alprazolam when I picked up my meds on my lunch, so hopefully it helps."
6273,"I did a ton of things for us including seeing my doctor, getting my medication increased/adjusted, and scheduled to start seeing a therapist."
6274,I just feel like I should be able to get through my anxiety and depression without medications.
6275,I'm so scared to take any type of medicine.
6276,How do you help someone who is terrified of taking medicine..
6277,"I’m hoping the meds will help me somewhat, and I’m waiting for an appointment with a psychiatrist."
6278,"So far, countless medications, therapy and psychiatry haven't been able to fix me."
6279,The only thing making me weary is that I've suspected for years that I might need medication to help manage my anxiety.
6280,So I'm also wondering if I should just bite the bullet and go to a psychiatrist or someone who can otherwise prescribe meds.
6281,"For the past 8-10 months I've been suffering from anxiety and taking a whole bunch of meds and stuff (you get the deal) and I've recently found that i find it extremely hard to talk to girls even if I've known them before and used to speak to them frequently, I'm really not sure why this has happened or what makes me so nervous about talking to them either in person or through texting/messaging I mean I'm not nervous because I'm attracted to the girls or anything like that and it even happens with girls I don't know."
6282,"8 months ago he had a catalyzing event that led to a big breakdown, a hospital stay, and finally getting some needed treatment and medicine."
6283,He's been off his meds for a month.
6284,I didn't say much but had him take his meds and told him I wasn't going anywhere.
6285,"So I went to the doctor, told him my boyfriend thought I was bipolar because [insert checklist here] and he prescribed some meds for it, just like that."
6286,I told my therapist what medications I was on (Effexor and Lamictal) and she asked what I was put on those for.
6287,He takes medicine 3 times a day.
6288,Went through tons of medications.
6289,"My mother suffers from it, and has been on several different medications over the years."
6290,"It is also important to note that my girlfriend has been out of the country for 2 weeks and wont be back for anothee week, and I miss her tremendously, and my mind just wanders.......

My question really is, how do I control this without medication?"
6291,I wanted to see if anyone has similar experiences and has found a way to cope - either through medication or some other method.
6292,**tl;dr** I get nervous when performing in social settings and want to find possible medications or methods to get over it.
6293,I havent been on any medication since.
6294,I know on basically every medication for anxiety drinking is a big no no.
6295,Anyone having good results with medications?
6296,about how long after taking the medicine can i know that there isn't going to be a negative side effect?
6297,I am up for taking meds if need be.
6298,"I tried it last night and it definitely helped, but I hate taking medicine and don't want to take it forever."
6299,The first medication she gave me was Celexa (citalopram) at 20mg for depression and anxiety at the same time.
6300,"However, I have had issues with health insurance for the last year so I ran out in mid-June, I did not fill my script for a while, thinking the meds would cost me quite a bit because one pharmacy said it would be more."
6301,Will these medicines help?
6302,So has anyone else tried this medication?
6303,"I can't stand my current one--last time I brought up anxiety to him, he basically shrugged me off, told me to breathe deeply, and that he refused to give me any sort of medicine (I never even asked for anything of course) because it would ruin my life."
6304,"I understand some of the meds can be habit forming, but I felt very judged and brushed off and not taken seriously."
6305,Please don't suggest seeing someone or getting medication because that isn't an option.
6306,I do not recall the name of the meds at this moment.
6307,"After a few visits to the psych emergency center, which resulted in a very bad reaction between the medication they prescribed me and medications they never asked me about, I've finally managed to get myself 30 xanax XR."
6308,I'm just feeling so happy that I'm FINALLY on a medication that helps me feel normal and able to function.
6309,My psychiatrist urged me to email my professors about it and to go to the school directly and seek accomodations for my problem and that I should tell them I'm on medication and am seeing someone about my problem and that it's actually gotten me hospitalized in the past year but I'm afraid I won't be taken seriously.
6310,"I don't really have time to see a psychiatrist, so I'm hoping my visit with our family doctor will be successful in either starting a medicine or pointing me in the right direction."
6311,I've decided that I want to see a psychiatrist for medication.
6312,"When I went to see the doctor (walk-in) he was sure it was a sinus infection and gave me a Z-pack, however my heart rate skyrocketed the next day after taking it which made me more nervous about taking medications."
6313,6 wks later he suggests trying Vibryd because I had been on the citalopram awhile and he thought this was a worthwhile medicine to try.
6314,The medication does help my anxiety but I am quite upset about the weight gain.
6315,Have any of you guys noticed any weight gain on this medication?
6316,while on this medication?
6317,"If any of you stopped taking the medication due to weight gain, how long did it take for you to come back to your pre-medication weight?"
6318,"Have any of you guys ever been afraid to take meds, what are some things that helped you get over it?"
6319,What can I do if I have a bad reaction to my meds?
6320,When i was first on the medication I avoided drinking completely as is advised on the bottle and by my doctor.
6321,"In saying that, my mom only wants me to take natural meds like Neurolink for my anxiety."
6322,"I'm open to the herbal medicine route if there's any chance it will work, but I'd much rather stay away from prescription meds if there's any alternative.. those side effects sounds nasty."
6323,I understood that the medicine needed to run its course and it didn't occur to me until later that the medicine could have been causing those episodes.
6324,See how I feel without any meds then maybe go back on it or try another.
6325,I flipped out and started crying so bad and begged them not to make me take any medicine...
6326,"At first I was completely against any more medicine, but now I'm very happy to have them."
6327,"I am on medication which helps, but it's not a perfect fix of course."
6328,I had anxiety my whole life but never thought it was enough for medication.
6329,My psych today brought up the conversation I've been avoiding; trying to bring down my dosage of my adhd medicine to a smaller amount or even ween off completely.
6330,I never really experienced anxiety until going off my meds.
6331,I'm stuck in a rut right now so I feel that meds might be my only option towards sanity but feeling that I'm throwing in the towel too soon.
6332,She prescribed me some medication (escitalopram) and honestly it's been the best month+ in my entire life.
6333,"I have been diagnosed with GERD, but don't take much medicine for it."
6334,"I was desperate for relief, alcohol makes it worse in the long run, and I currently have no medication."
6335,Is this because of the medication switch or just the food I ate?
6336,I am currently not on any meds I was on Paxil two years ago but stopped cold turkey.
6337,I was wondering if anyone here takes these medications and how they work.
6338,"I was asked to make a list of pros and cons and this is what I came up with, by the way:

pros:
 - might help me feel better


cons: 
 - need to learn to take pills
 
 - need to take medicine every day

 - need to commit to whatever it will do to me for however long it will last

 - probably have to try multiple different medications to find one

 - possible side effects

 - possible withdrawals

 - feels like a crutch"
6339,"The last stuff I was on (cipralax) made me manic apparently, couldn't really sleep but at least I felt good (motivated, energetic), it just seems like any medicine I take is going to have side-effects that mess me up more than what I'm being treated for in the first place."
6340,He even asked about my medication regimen and spoke about his wife's.
6341,"I have suffered anxiety for many years now, I've been able to manage it pretty well without meds."
6342,i cannot get prescribed medication because of my history.
6343,They suggested that I try switching medications since Paxil has been the only one I've taken.
6344,"As of tomorrow, I will be on medication for my anxiety."
6345,I have a dual diagnosis of anxiety and ADD and the psychiatrist I just started seeing wants to medicate me for the anxiety first and then add other medication in a few months.
6346,"I'm in a therapy group for it and seeing a psychiatrist - however, he put me on two medications."
6347,"I am very uncomfortable with taking any sort of meds, but he said they were necessary."
6348,"It is supposed to be a short-term medication but it is the only thing I have found that has worked while also offering me enough clarity to function, so my Dr. and I made a conscious decision to keep me on it for as long as is necessary and then do a controlled withdrawal."
6349,I come here today to ask if maybe trying medicine to overcome or numb anxiety is helpful.
6350,so which medicine should I ask from my doc?
6351,"I do take anxiety medication (I take Zoloft everyday, and have Xanax that I use maybe once a week, if that…I try to avoid it unless I really need it…I’m wondering if I need to start taking a tiny bit ~30mins before I drive or if that would be dangerous)."
6352,I do not take medicine as it scares me.
6353,She says to hold off on going back on meds until I've pushed through.
6354,"Other than those few months when I was beginning recovery from anorexia but wasn't yet on meds, I haven't had any experience of coping without meds or the eating disorder."
6355,Or do I take the easy route and go back on meds?
6356,"I don't want to be on meds forever, so I'd eventually have to come back off them."
6357,"I've tried medication, but the first pill they gave me (mirtazapine) possibly made my symptoms worse, and i was puking every morning."
6358,I haven't been able to get myself to stick with any medication since.
6359,"Part of me wants to get medication, even though there could be side effects... it can't be worse than losing her."
6360,I only have a month of medication left and I can't decide if I should start weening myself off of it?
6361,"The medication itself is dirt cheap, but where can I find a doctor who will prescribe it to me?"
6362,I'm hesitant to take medication because I rely heavily on my brain to do my job (software development) and I don't want to take anything that could dull my ability to do my job properly - I'm doing pretty well just now and I would hate to compromise that.
6363,"Anyways, I was on the meds for about 8 months or so and when I felt strong enough and talked to my doctor about it, I weaned off and have been off meds ever since."
6364,I'm about a week and a half into taking the meds and I've only gotten worse.
6365,I know the side effects are amplified the first few weeks and it takes a minimum of 2 weeks-month for the meds to do their job but I'm at the point now where I can't sleep and can't eat without gagging.
6366,Basically I just need some encouragement that the medicine takes time and to stick with it and I will get past this terrible in between period.
6367,"I tried different meds, meditation, forcing myself into more social situations but nothing is helping."
6368,"Dad gets very annoyed by this , says it's blaming him
 
6) Going back to the ex things went to shit after coming off my meds, I started obsessing over her guy friend, the significance of his nickname 'Superman' (as in is he the ultimate Alpha Male?"
6369,"I really want to try anxiety medication but since my insurance is about to switch, I don't know where to start."
6370,"I have tried medication, meditation, CT scans, therapy, acupuncture, exercise, aromatherapy, and while a few showed limited success, nothing substantially helped."
6371,Its better to take less meds than to take more if theyre unnecessary.
6372,"I've experienced weight gain, sexual side effects, and lethargy/apathy, so I went to the doctor to get my meds adjusted or to add Wellbutrin."
6373,I went to my GP today and all he offered was medication.
6374,"I've recently started the medication shuffle and right now I'm on 112.5 mg effexor and 100 mg zoloft nightly, with the effexor scheduled to go up and the zoloft down at my next psych appointment."
6375,"I've always been reluctant to take medication, but I was really trying to crazy-proof myself for work, so I got a prescription for Ativan and Buspar."
6376,"I've done extensive research on anxiety - medications, alternate treatments, nutrition and exercise therapy -- but with all of these constant physical systems, I don't feel well enough to start anything."
6377,"I've had anxiety since I was young, and I've made huge strides with the help of medication but not even a month ago, I had a full blown panic attack."
6378,"I've also been kind of avoiding seeing a doctor because that's also not very *me*, and also because I don't want to be put on medication."
6379,I recommend 5-htp it to all anxiety sufferers and those who have problems with rumination that don't want to take prescription medications and/or can't afford traditional therapy (I know I can't as of right now).
6380,"While Xanax helps me, it also makes me sad in retrospect because I know I'll probably never feel like that without the medication."
6381,"Please, anyone - I'm alone traveling right now, without my meds or the people I love who help me end the cycle of negative thoughts."
6382,This was all fallowed by a feeling of depression I have not had to endure since starting meds.
6383,A type of medication?
6384,"I guess the next thing to do is to try medication again, but last january I had such a bad reaction to Zoloft I don't know if I can do it again."
6385,I'm so freaked out by medication.
6386,"**Background**
I've never taken medicine for my anxiety."
6387,I've already seen 3 therapists in the past and have been on all medications.
6388,"I feel like I should taper off the medication and deal with my anxiety in a natural way (meditation, working out, eating right again, etc.)"
6389,"That is what I wanted to do in the first place, but my mom insisted on the medication."
6390,"I'm too nervous to tell her about the suicidal thoughts, but I really just feel like I shouldn't take this medication anymore."
6391,"I am untreated (no meds), and have no access to doctors or other people due to my living situation."
6392,"Don't really want to start on meds for the panic attacks, since I got a friend and she has 5 different personalities depending on if she is sober, drunk or meds."
6393,"He is unwilling to see a new therapist, try new medication, etc, basically anything that'll allow him to cope with this."
6394,"I am not currently on any anti-anxiety medication, or anti-depression."
6395,Its killing me to wait but I don't want to be dependent on medication.
6396,A little backstory- I had been trying to ween off my medication since June with my doctor and that night was my 3rd night with no medication in my body (I have been on medication for 5 years) I wanted to stop relying on a pill to make me happy and to see what I really am without help.
6397,I hate that I need medication.
6398,But my doctor said that the panic attacks was a withdrawal symptom from my medication...didn't let me now beforehand that this would happen to me though.....
6399,So I was put back on my meds as my body is now reliant on it and she gave me another type of medication incase I get another panic attack.
6400,"And if I did get one, could I take my medication to calm me down?"
6401,Would something like anti-anxiety meds help this?
6402,My question to you guys is how do I talk to my dr about this without coming off as a nut job or seeming like I'm looking to score some anxiety meds?
6403,"Plus, I'm sleep deprived and forgot my anxiety meds at home."
6404,"I finished therapy a few weeks ago, and I've been on some medication, and I'm feeling so much better."
6405,Can your dog really sense you emotions and respond (like getting you to take medication when in panic)?
6406,Do they remind you to take your meds everyday at the same time?
6407,"So my question is, has anyone experienced the anxiety meds not working due to the anti-depressants?"
6408,My mum convinced me I needed to go to the GP and specifically request for medication seeing as therapy had done nothing for me.
6409,"I was scared to speak to her, but my then counselor had written a note explaining the problems I was dealing with and seconding my request for meds."
6410,Maybe I am just anxious about the medication or maybe it is a true side effect.
6411,"I was on two medications for depression and anxiety for years, but in detox they put me on two more."
6412,The medications and sobriety helped a lot so I stuck with the program.
6413,But then I stopped taking one of my medications (with doc approval).
6414,"I do not want to go back on more medication and am convinced that I can handle this with exercise, but so far haven't taken those steps."
6415,I drank a couple nights ago but it was after I had taken my medicine 12 hours prior.
6416,Today I was wanting to have a lunch margarita but usually take my medicine at about 10.
6417,"I told her everything: how I've felt alone since I started school, how I started medication but had since stopped taking it because it wasn't helping, how I was falling behind with my work but that I still wanted to be in the program."
6418,I guess when I go back I'll do that since it seems like the only thing new that doesn't involve medication.
6419,"I went to partial hospitalization two months ago, and got on a new medication."
6420,Since then I saw a second psychiatrist who agreed that I could come off meds slowly with regular checkups.
6421,"I have been completely off medication now for three months and am struggling, I am more productive at work and making far more progress with my masters and other duties but I am having such trouble sleeping, nightmares and anxieties that seem to come up the minute I lay down at night."
6422,I know I must see the psychiatrist but I so much want to be able to cope with this without going back on medication.
6423,"I do not think I am bipolar, I think I may have anxiety problems but as it is now I am wary to speak to the psychiatrist again in case she just re-diagnoses me and puts me back on the medication."
6424,I posted this here because I did not want to trigger any bipolar people to come off their medication.
6425,"I got an eeg and it was negative, they continued.I was put on a litany of medications from anti depressants which hurt my stomach, to anti anxiety meds."
6426,It seemed that my only choice was to use medication to treat my symptoms.
6427,And then I remembered Chinese medicine.
6428,"Chinese medicine isn't a cure all, but then again, nothing really is."
6429,I understand and am fully aware that medication is  necessary for some people (I prefer you to be alive &amp; medicated than be all dead).
6430,If my symptoms weren't improved or if they worsened I definitively would have taken medication.
6431,I wanted to share my story since I know a lot of us are apprehensive about taking medication.
6432,"I am on Day 5 of taking the meds and feel worse for longer, but not as elevated during an attack."
6433,I spend a lot of time walking/running on my own to combat the symptoms or side effects of the meds.
6434,"Do I stay on this medication, and for how long?"
6435,I only take meds for ADD
6436,I'm confident that I can somehow beat this without resorting to medication.
6437,"So I'm kinda sitting here without any particular desire to do something productive and no fear of the consequences if I don't, and am curious if anyone else has dealt with the same thing and how they overcame it or if it goes away as my brain gets more used to the medication."
6438,"Between seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, and taking medication, I'm doing pretty well with my anxiety."
6439,"Since I freeze up, I can't get up and take my medication, or get a drink of water, or anything."
6440,My medication was in the SAME ROOM.
6441,"Other meds I am on: 

Propranolol 10mg 3x daily as needed (to address physical symtoms of anxiety)
Vyvanse 60mg daily (pre 11 AM, to address the massive lethargy of depression, and elevate mood) 

Recently stopped taking Abilify 5mg daily (took for a month) 

Also today is the 22nd day of sobriety from weed."
6442,"this might be a dumb question, but is there a definitive moment when i can truly know the meds are working ?"
6443,ive never taken meds before so im not sure what to expect.
6444,I am using medication to do it.
6445,"For instance, it has happened many times since I started the medication that a bee has flown around my head."
6446,My one concern that remains is that I will lose these effects when I taper off of the medication.
6447,"The dose of my medication hasn’t changed, but I continue to improve."
6448,My meds seem to wear off as soon as I get home and I usually end up doing little to no homework.
6449,I've never taken any kind of medication because I'm too scared of what they'll do to me.
6450,I have tried all sorts of therapy and I think I may have exhausted all medication options.
6451,[Bonus question: what about when I'm not able to go in to work because I'm having issues with my anxiety or meds?]
6452,"- For the past 3 weeks I have been on a new SSRI (no prior medications for anxiety and depression aside from klonopin) and am currently ""interviewing"" therapists."
6453,"Just take your medicine, see a therapist, and get the dream job later!"""
6454,If any of you are on bc does it help your keep your pms from making your other meds for anxiety/depression working or not working?
6455,"I wanted to see if being put on a mild bc would help with those times, but I don't know if it conflicts with antidepressants or anti-anxiety medicines."
6456,I do not want to take anti-anxiety medication for fear of what negative changes daily medication may bring about.
6457,I have seen firsthand the disgusting consequences of the daily use of mind-altering prescription medication and do not want that to be me.
6458,I lost my medication while traveling this weekend.
6459,"I'm home now and I'm starting to feel it, what do I do to get my medication back."
6460,I've been on and off medications in the past but it's been quite a few years and my memory of those times isn't too good.
6461,I stopped taking the medicine because I felt it didn't work and I didn't want to be someone who took a pill for the rest of their lives.
6462,"I've starting taking medication to curb my anxiety, but that will take a while to kick in (if it works)."
6463,My physc has put me on a different sleep med and has suggested anti-craving medication.
6464,My SO has been diagnosed with anxiety and is on medication for it (not sure on the name) and is doing Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT).
6465,"I am also a little scared they are going to try and put me on some sort of medication :/    
  
I would really like some advice on helping myself not be so stressed out; natural remedies, exercises, etc."
6466,The meds were helping but today I've had to double breath for the entire day.
6467,I took my meds to try and calm down and tried meditating/breathing/muscle relaxing exercises which helped while I was doing it.
6468,The meds did nothing except maybe relieve the shaking a little.
6469,"I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in high school, have taken medication and am currently in counseling offered through my University."
6470,Im not on any medication.
6471,But I have meds and I think I already know how to manage.
6472,I explained to her that even at the height of my panic disorder prior to medication I was not experiencing these types of headaches - I felt like my brain was itchy or stuffed with cotton balls and my eyes constantly felt crossed.
6473,I hate medication and feeling like a fucking guinea pig.
6474,So I'm looking like an idiot asking what's the difference between dental and medical insurance and why dental isn't part of medical since dental is a part of medicine.
6475,yes im taking medication and even seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist.
6476,"At the same time, I am afraid that my anxiety will become unmanageable if I'm not on medication."
6477,"I am considering talking with my primary care doctor about a nausea medication, but I feel like she's JUST going to blame it on my anxiety -- that's what my previous PCP did."
6478,I am on medications now (specifically Vyvanse and Brintellix) and am working on tackling my mental health.
6479,"I've tried medication, and I've tried cousneling, and do not have positive experiences with either."
6480,"But tensions are high on the occasion, because my dad has back problems and is on medication for seizures (I'm still traumatized, I'll explain momentarily) so he's constantly stressed out."
6481,"I fear of being put on medication and I have heard that most anxiety/depression medication can cause thoughts of suicide, or make anxiety worse, nausea, and all the other symptoms that I am trying to solve."
6482,Is there any medication that has worked for you?
6483,"It rules my life, I try my best to left it not, I go to therapy, I take medications as needed, I have cbt therapy work books I use, I've even turned to religion."
6484,"In the past few weeks, I elected to try medication for my anxiety."
6485,"Anyway, the night before taking the first dose of the medication, I had the worst panic attack of my life."
6486,"My anxiety: low = almost no problem very high = almost non functional

Heart rate - low
Dizziness - high
Fatigue - high
Poor sleep - medium/high
Anxious Discomfort - medium
Loss of appetite - high
Emotional flatness - medium/low
Number of ""shaking"" attacks with low heart rate - 2 ever
Number of ""traditional"" anxiety attacks - 1 during spring

Tried medications
lexapro 5mg for 2 days."
6487,A friend has been having some problems with one of her medications and I offered to post this for her on here.
6488,"I've been taking this medicine for awhile now, but I've begun to notice that I stutter more often than usual."
6489,"I used to be highly proficient in reading, but now I mess up on reading words aloud and the only reason I can think of this being an issue is because of the medicine."
6490,"I'm also considering taking short-term anxiety meds, but I'm absolutely terrified of that option."
6491,My mother ingrained in me to stay way from medication and I'm scared of the side effects.
6492,"My anxiety has been getting steadily worse since I graduated from college (this whole 40-hour-work-week and being-an-adult stuff is really draining), and I recently realized that I definitely need medication, because I'm miserable way more often than I ought to be."
6493,"There's not much for me to do but wait, and I'm pissed, because even once I get an appointment I expect I'll need to try a bunch of different meds till I find a good one."
6494,And this means I need outside help in the form of medication.
6495,"Thanks for reading :)

TLDR: Want meds now."
6496,"I told her my mom is against medication, but I'm allowed to take it."
6497,"The doctor told me it would take a few weeks for the meds to kick in, so my question is, is the Sertraline  actually working, or could I just  be experiencing a placebo effect?"
6498,"Ever since I have gone back on my meds back in winter (20mg Celexa and 180mg Propranolol ER) back in winter I feel like my sleep has been shitty, but as of a few months ago it's started getting worse."
6499,"Anyway, has anyone had any kind of problems like this from their meds?"
6500,"I'll start by saying I'm not on any medication, and I can't afford any."
6501,"I turned 14 and things got bad again, mom was having a hard time finding stability with her medications and in general for quite some time at that point, so I ventured off to a city to find work."
6502,I told him to go to his therapist tomorrow but he doesn't like medications because it makes him angry.
6503,"Now I'm wondering if you guys think I'd be taking meds for the right reason, to basically not have to dedicate my life to preventing anxiety anymore (also hopefully subsiding the OCD.)"
6504,I think I should try another medication but I'm really worried about the withdrawals from Effexor xr.
6505,Plus worried about any side effects I might get from a new medication.
6506,I'm really afraid of meds.
6507,Are there any meds that can help with feelings like these or is it all down to some sort of psychological magic?
6508,"Just curious if anyone knows what is up, I just don't want to have the anxiety come back even while I'm on meds as then I'd really feel hopeless."
6509,I am not on any medication as I had a bad experience with it before but if this carries on I will have no choice.
6510,"I start having panic attacks and coughing fits, even while on my meds."
6511,"Then I got angry, I wanted to go up to him, get the antidepressants, my other medication and my stressball that I have to carry round with me and say ""I'm glad you find it entertaining pretending to have a mental illness and showing us all to be crazy and psychotic."
6512,"TL;DR
I just had a panic attack after several months without one
Think sudafed triggered it but I might just be paranoid
Lost all faith in medication."
6513,"(cost is also an issue, my insurance isn't great)

I guess I am hoping for a resource that can help me push through it so I can get the professional help I need rather than self medication and avoidance."
6514,How do you respond to someone when they say they feel hopeless and ruled by anxiety and medications?
6515,"I'm scared to take meds, but it's coming to the last resort now."
6516,"When you say some meds made you worse, I'm scared of how much worse if they affect me negatively that it will make me."
6517,"I'm doing my best to try and accept that death is a mandatory phase in life and that I can't always know the answer to all these questions, but I want to know if there's any way I can calm down about these topics in addition to meds and therapy."
6518,How harmful is missing a few days of your medication?
6519,I'm one of those people that feel the full side effects of anxiety and depression medications.
6520,"I really want to try meds again because I find when I'm on them, I am less irritable and less sensitive."
6521,Is anyone else really sensitive to medication?
6522,I did start feeling worse without my meds.
6523,"So long story short, I had a really bad week last week anxiety and depression wise thankfully I saw my therapist/doctor on Tuesday and she changed up my meds."
6524,I had taken Cymbalta before with great results  I made the mistake of googling the two meds being taken together and I saw that taking them together can lead Serotonin Syndrome.
6525,"I know medication effect everyone differently, but I havent really found anything online about anyone taking both of them at the same time."
6526,"I have been on various prescription medications for anxiety and depression, which I feel has had little beneficial effect, some even detrimental."
6527,I  have been on anxiety meds for 6 yrs and sometimes it's not enough but I have found that if I sip on a cheap energy drink like Full Throttle or Rip It is helps curb the anxiety.
6528,I'm afraid of the medicine controlling me and that I could possibly be addicted to it and I don't know what to do
6529,"I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease at 18 and although it was really bad for a year, I was put on meds and it stabilized and jumped right back to normal."
6530,"Before April of this year I forgot what it was like to experience anxiety, and had a lot of interest in medicine."
6531,"I know more about my condition, what tests results mean, what side effects medications have, risk factors -- the knowledge has fueled the fire for my anxiety, and I can longer just be ignorant."
6532,"I am not on meds because I had a little bit of an incident this January and now I am not allowed to have them, or own a gun."
6533,"Part of me wants to be on meds because they take away all the feels and I almost prefer that at this point, but I am also scared of that happening again, just to clarify I’m good now."
6534,"Good thing is I'm getting new meds, though?"
6535,I'm not on any medication and I ate what I usually eat.
6536,"I've been on all sorts of medications, I'm no stranger to my doctor."
6537,"I've smoked cannabis for the past year, it was the only thing that worked after my meds stopped working."
6538,I was freaking out so I stopped the medications with out asking the psychiatrist.
6539,"The reason I am asking is not for reddit to prescribe me medication, but because of the quality of the family doctor that I am seeing."
6540,What is a good medication to stop intrusive self-defeating thoughts?
6541,"I do suffer from anxiety in social situations but it's not bad (meaning I'm not seeking therapy or medication, i just lack social skills and talking to people makes me very nervous)."
6542,"He doesn't leave the house, he feels terrible all the time, has manic episodes (rarely, he just started a new medication), and can barely sleep."
6543,"His new medication helps in some ways, but makes other aspects of his problem worse."
6544,"I'm worried because I read palinopsia is permanent :/

I don't do drugs or take any medications beside mineral tablets for my vitreous."
6545,"I am not on any anxiety medication at the moment, and maybe I will get back on it soon, but I wanted to know: short term, what do you guys do to calm yourselves down so you can be kinda productive?"
6546,I've been stable on my current meds since this summer but recently my panic attacks have come back full force.
6547,"Mom who is just batshit insane, and hopped up on meds."
6548,"I don't use meds, because they don't help me, only one can of beer can help me."
6549,"**[Rant] no TLDR sorry**

I have been trying to deal with my anxiety without medication for about 6 months."
6550,"I'm tired of living in constant fear of the unknown, but I'm also afraid that getting prescribed a medication will change my personality."
6551,I have seizures due to anxiety and my seizure threshold is really low and she gives me pain meds instead of my anxiety ones and says its not a big deal strait to my face.
6552,I don't know if I should take my medication tomorrow.
6553,"I used to take anxiety medication but found I didn't really need them anymore, but now I feel like I do just out of anticipation?"
6554,Feel free to tell me of your exciting success stories with meds and fighting your anxities!
6555,"Because my parents are always bailing him out of shit he caused, when I've needed help with paying for therapy and medication they've had to tell me no because they gave all their money to fucking Kevin and they can't afford to help me."
6556,"I was really expecting xanax or something similar, but I guess Paxil is more for constant anxiety where as xanax is a ""take when needed"" medicine.."
6557,Also a Side Effect to my medication is nausea and I am still scared I'll puke everywhere.
6558,I've seen her a couple times and she seems to understand what I'm trying to achieve with medication.
6559,"The thing is, I've had bad experiences with other meds in the past so taking this makes me nervous."
6560,"I've been using lorazepam as a rescue medication and that's been fine, but I feel a slight bit of a constant undercurrent of anxiety/depression."
6561,"I took the meds the first day and they seemed to help, but after than they don't seem to be working."
6562,"It may also be a program created from habits you subconsciously picked up from your parents (very common), siblings, schoolmates, etc ...

All that being said (and this may already be obvious) for those who are trying to avoid taking medications or get off medications you need to look into and clear the root cause of your anxiety (the malevolent program) in order to properly eliminate it permanently."
6563,"If you have the money, go to a psychiatrist and get medication."
6564,Consider yourself lucky: you were born in a time when methods and medication exist to treat mental problems.
6565,"INFO of GF:

* age: Mid Teens
* gender: F
* type of anxiety: Social
* medications(if any): Fluoxetine
* country: UK

EDIT: Anti Depressant is Fluoxetine

Will delete this thread in 24 hours."
6566,"Not really interested in meds because surprise, surprise I have a fear of medications."
6567,"When I see people comment on how a particular medication has been a huge help, I get bummed out because I've never really experienced that relief."
6568,"All these medications, and at this point in my life my anxiety, depression, and OCD are worse than they were ten years ago when I started this game."
6569,"But so far, all these medications have seemed to do is cause side effects and keep me from drinking."
6570,"I was reluctant to start on medication because I really want to try to use coping strategies to deal with my anxiety like exercising and eating healthy, focusing on positive thought processes, etc."
6571,"At this point, I'm not sure what is the medication and what is the anxiety morphing into depression (typically the cycle for me)."
6572,I have to force myself to take my meds to sleep and its usually so damn late the little sleep I get is not REM and I get up and I am even more tired to face the day.
6573,I'm not taking any meds currently and I'm almost certain that I'm using sex in a similar way I could use medication.
6574,Most under the mind set that I didn't want to be dependent on a medication to feel normal.
6575,"I'm not on meds currently, having got off of them in October."
6576,"I was hesitant about taking any medications after that and i agreed i would only take ones with the least amount of side effects, my new psych doc put me on wellbutrin, neurontin, and buspar."
6577,i can't decide if it's the severe anxiety or the meds that is causing the brain fog.
6578,A day after coming home I went to my GP and he put me on sinus medication.
6579,(with the hopes of getting medication).
6580,Any advice welcome and how did medication affect your anxiety?
6581,"I haven't had anxiety this bad in months, so I don't have any meds for it."
6582,"The obvious answer is immediate-acting anti-anxiety meds (benzodiazepines) such as Klonopin, Xanax etc but I’ve found I still have problems with anxiety even after taking the benzo I’m prescribed (Klonopin), even if it does somewhat diminish my anxiety and take the edge off of things."
6583,"I was taken off of all of medications when I began treatment, which was my choice."
6584,This feeling in particular is what I'm hoping medication can help with.
6585,So I'm asking about medication because it's all new to me.
6586,I realize medication is perhaps too easy a solution but I think with some of my issues it could be just the help I need.
6587,Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor and am in no way suggesting the use of cannabis as a replacement for proper medication.
6588,If the doctor does decide that I need medication etc.
6589,"It looks like 6 months of medication, life changes and therapy is finally starting to pay off..."
6590,"The only thing remaining is the yawning all the time, sexual problems (I pretty much have no libido anymore) and I think I may have sleeping issues due to the meds."
6591,Do the meds help?
6592,Going to the doc soon to see if I need to up my dosage or possibly switch medication (oh boy...).
6593,"So to summarize: The meds probably aren't working as intended, and I'm not sure my therapist is the right guy for me."
6594,"Luckily, the meds seem to stabilize my mood or I'm pretty sure I'd be in another big low."
6595,"I don't want to take medication, either due to how I will feel when I have to stop taking them in the long run, or that I will become dependent on them."
6596,"I've seen numerous therapists and am currently taking Lamictal and Abilify in unison to quell my mood swings and general anxiety, as well as a panic medication for when the panic attacks start to set in."
6597,"I couldn't do it on my own and I hated it, I caved in and got medication and it worked, at least for me."
6598,"With the help of medication and dedication, I was able to make something of my life and start to conquer my demons."
6599,He prescribed an anti-anxiety medication (don't remember the name but it was 7.5mg) and told me to take half every night.
6600,"Technically the only one I drink is Seagrams ginger Ale, but that's only so I can take my medicine without gagging."
6601,"I am unsure what to do...I know I should just take my anxiety medicine and disregard such thoughts, but it hurts."
6602,I attempted to make an appointment with a psychiatrist to discuss anxiety treatment options with medication but without insurance I'm looking at ~$300 for a new patient evaluation and revisits being roughly $150.
6603,I'm however eager to explore medication options for the first time but the price tag seems nasty for a broke college kid.
6604,"What did you do, as a penniless individual, to take the first steps to seeking medication treatment?"
6605,(I do not want to take medication.
6606,"So they refuse doctor visits and medication, even after my doctor and another neurologist ordered a MRI of my head..she said yeah sure!"
6607,"I finally got to telling him that the doc prescribed me the meds, and that I was still trying to decide whether to fill them or not."
6608,""", which was closely followed by ""I think you are strong enough to deal with this without meds""."
6609,"We talked about it more, and eventually he explained that he has loved the person I have been throughout the relationship, and doesn't want that to change due to the meds."
6610,"While I understand his concern, after the experience I had today (finally trying to open up to someone about my anxiety, crying in front of a stranger for the first time, being prescribed medication for a disorder I have actively tried to hide from everyone, etc, etc, etc) it was not what I wanted or needed to hear."
6611,"Now I feel like if I fill the rx and start the meds, he will think I'm weak, or that I failed somehow, and eventually start to resent me."
6612,"Don't get me wrong, I have my own concerns about starting medication."
6613,"But at the same time, I live with this crushing anxiety constantly....something's gotta give eventually, and if the medication can help with that, what is the big deal?"
6614,"I don't mind that he wanted to share his opinion, but later on in the conversation I brought it back up and said that I was worried that he would think I wasn't strong enough if I decided to take the meds due to his prior comments."
6615,i've been on medication/therapy off and on (90% on) for 15 years.
6616,"I've tried medication, and therapy and neither worked."
6617,I am looking for any alternatives to traditional meds..
6618,"Due to my classes for the semester, I cannot be on medication that completely numbs me and kills my creativity (faced this with Zoloft) -- I will fail -- and I would rather put up with the crazy than flunking a class in my major."
6619,I have finally been getting treatment for the past few months for my GAD and depression but the only attempt my doctors have made to help my anxiety and depression has been medication.
6620,I would like to not use medication and focus more on natural ways of handling my anxiety/panic attacks.
6621,"I am very nervous about talking to my doctor about having a therapy cat, i don't want to feel silly for it, especially when I tell him I don't want to use medication to treat my anxiety."
6622,I've never taken meds and doing so could negatively impact my status at work.
6623,"I've been dealing with anxiety, intrusive thoughts, obsessive thoughts for years, and I've been self medicating myself through it, and I've never had a help, or medications or anything."
6624,I have very bad anxiety and compulsive thoughts which I take regular meds for and currently get CBT therapy.
6625,"I would like to find someone (doctor, counselor) that can give me counseling and also give me good advice on medication."
6626,I have noticed my MD has no problem prescribing me medication but does not know much about anxiety and previous counselors/psychologists know about counseling but hate that I take medication.
6627,"I've for the most part been able to control other anxiety with distraction, medication or weed, but this particular brand has a hold over me."
6628,"I do not take medication anymore for my issues, haven't for about 8 years or so."
6629,"I talked with the counselor about regular therapy the rest of this year and summer, maybe medication."
6630,"I've never been on any anti-anxiety medication before, have any of you been on lorazepam (Ativan)?"
6631,"I'll keep my fingers crossed that I get the medication and not the placebo, and hopefully it does help!"
6632,"I'm 18 now, and have been on medication for the past 7-8 years, pretty much as long back as I can remember."
6633,"For the past maybe 6 months I've been feeling horrible, my situation has gotten worse, and despite my psychologist prescribing new meds I still feel awful."
6634,"I don't attribute any of this to the medication, but I feel it's not helping and I would feel better if I was off it, even just for a few months to evaluate my situation with a clear head, but after even a day without taking my main pill that I've been on for about 2-3 years I feel absolutely horrible and can't even function, and I feel almost weighed down by the drugs that once helped me."
6635,"**Male, 21, no meds currently**

&gt;Picking cuticles, 
&gt;Scratching ears to the point of bleeding,

&gt;constant knuckle cracking, 
&gt;insomnia, 
&gt;anti-social, 
&gt;short fuse(little dumb things can make me rage), 
&gt;compulsive behavior."
6636,"I've even noticed medicine that is supposed to make a little ""drowsy"" has exasperated some brain fog, so I'm scared of the potential side effects."
6637,"I haven't told really anybody about my problems (depression and generalized anxiety disorder), and I am on medication (zoloft 150 mg and abilify 5 mg)."
6638,I'm not interested in medication.
6639,"He told me that seroquel is the only medicine certified to treat the ups and downs, so I need to take two medicines."

6641,"Anyways, can anyone explain the time of the two medicines in simple terms."
6642,I'm currently not on any medications.
6643,"We discussed my syptoms and she reccomended that I begin a therapy group, and then if I was still experiencing syptoms after 2 months then to call her, which then she would recommend medication."

6649,"Anyways, here is my question--Can I get some kind of medicine from a regular, family doctor?"
6650,"I had to stop my ADHD medication a couple months ago, and now I'm drowning in school."
6651,What coping strategies minus meds do you guys use?
6652,I've been given various medications: Effexor (which I stopped taking after a few months due to all the side effects).
6653,"I've been seeing a therapist lately to talk through the anxiety which has been great, but he asked for me to go back to the doctor to see if there are any other things I could try medication-wise."
6654,"I don't want to be on medication my whole life, but this has been so helpful for dealing with the short term dips into an anxious state."
6655,"Not sure if this is an actual effect of the medication, or just from being more calm in general."
6656,I have had medication and counseling awhile but it's obviously not working.
6657,"Btw Yes I've done therapy, been to a psych hospital, and I'm on medication."
6658,b) Should I be looking to get other medication?

6662,"I'd love to hear what works for you guys, whether it's knitting, medication, or even talking to pets."
6663,"She also said that in four weeks time we'll meet again to discuss other courses of action if counselling isn't for me, and she specifically mentioned medication."
6664,"What I'd like to know is what would this medication do, what are the long terms affects of being on it, would it bring any side affects and how reliant should you be on it?"
6665,"The stress of my fathers death triggered a number of things, Migraines, (I still take Imitrex shots for them), Blood pressure problems, (Controlled), Ulcer symptoms, (Controlled with daily meds), and the worst Bowel pain you can imagine."

6672,"Unfortunately, whenever I start meds like this, they usually give me vivid dreams."
6673,Only temporary until the meds kick in.
6674,Update: I talked to a pharmacist at Walgreen's and they told me to stop taking the medication since it's harming me.
6675,Would like advise on how to manage besides meds.
6676,I remember my first panic attack and remember what it felt like and how I got it under control so I have always felt that I didn't need meds.

6678,"I want to switch meds, but my next appointment is in November during my Thanksgiving break."
6679,"(I'm having a lot of trouble describing it right now, partly because my mind is so foggy right now and partly because I've been on this medicine since February, so I don't have any recent examples as far as things that have been triggering me)."
6680,"About 5 months ago, after one too many embarrassing moments, I started trying medication again after years off of therapy and meds because of some bad experiences and general ineffectiveness."
6681,"Part of me wants to stick it out, suggest trying some meds I tried when I was younger (we got a genetic screening, so a higher/lower dose of something might work) and suggest trying rescue again, and I can give it to my mom to give to me."
6682,I've heard conflicting reports that halting medications like Lexapro cold turkey is bad for mental health.

6688,"I'm currently on Luvox and Klonopin, but I know that it's going to take a lot more than medication to break the self-perpetuating cycle."

6699,I recently started taking meds for my anxiety because the symptoms had gotten to be too intense for me to continue to suppress them.
6700,I started initially on alprazolam and wellbutrin and the anti-anxiety meds worked amazingly well.
6701,"I felt relieved that they'd called in a medication for me that I knew would help, but also completely humiliated at the thought that they thought I was some sort of drug-hound trying to weasel medication out of them."
6702,After years of doctors and medications and exploration I accepted what I have and that it isn't going anywhere.
6703,My therapist thinks it would be good for me to have as needed anxiety meds but my regular doctor wont give them to me.
6704,I've recently upped my medication- under doctor supervision- and have been walking around with that really terrifying constant underlying dread.
6705,"My mother worked with me to drop band (which I was certain was causing most of my stress), took me to a doctor to get medicine, and helped set up therapy (first real session tomorrow)."

Lately my therapist and I have been working on some ways to battle anxiety and heal the brain and body without the use of dependent medications."
6717,What I'm looking for is maybe some legal medication since I've been trying to avoid drugs/alcohol due to family history including addictions to both.
6718,"tl;dr: don't want therapy, just want meds"
6719,"Whether I need a higher dose of Paxil, A replacement medication or maybe an additional one, I don't know."
6720,I am seeing a therapist and taking medication which is helping immensely.
6721,I start by saying don't fear the meds but also don't jump onto the medication bandwagon.
6722,"You should really try all other resources before hitting up medication - meditation, exercise, CBT and diet."
6723,Even if you choose to try medication you should continue to do all 4 of these things regardless.
6724,So I am here to tell you that you shouldn't fear medication.
6725,Those of you who have had bad experience with medication please try to put your experience in a positive light to help ease the burdens of those who are fearful of trying it.
6726,My advice is to use medication as a last resort - if you are experiencing some temporary life changes don't run to medication (i.e.
6727,Talk to your doctor about therapy and other solutions before jumping on meds.
6728,For those who are exhausted and frustrated that nothing has helped them and haven't tried medication then please talk to your doctor about it and don't fear it!
6729,I for one feared medication for the longest time...let's say about 9 years.
6730,I started small and cut the pills in half and slowly introduced the medication to my body.
6731,The medication has really helped me open up my world and stop the shrinking feeling.
6732,Please remember that this medication is a bandage and a crutch.
6733,Same goes for medication.
6734,I was once very afraid to try meds and you aren't alone.
6735,"If it really freaks you out take a tiny little grain of the medication, put it on your tongue, swallow it."

6739,(I cannot go on meds or I cannot join the military.
6740,"I was put on Lexapro, but my psychiatrist hasn't renewed my medication in a month so I've been on my own."

6748,The medication is collecting dust on my shelf.
6749,Go to the student health center and get prescribed medication.
6750,What if they don't want to give me medicine?
6751,What if they just think I'm trying to get medicine to sell?
6752,"I should note that I'm 30 years old, male, and I've never been on any anxiety meds."

6775,TLDR: How have you worked with/through your medication to keep a happy sex life?
6776,I am on meds but its not helping with this.

6785,"General info [24/f, 25 on Friday], medications: klonopin &amp; lamictal (have been working well for the most part), therapy: none, was told I was rational enough to work my problems out alone by a therapist."
6786,"I also have been taking medicine for my anxiety, on and off, since then."
6787,"I meant to ask my therapist but I forgot - and google didnt turn up any useful results for me, but do you know if it is safe to take gravol while taking Prozac (or any anti-anxiety meds really...) I don't take any other medications, but I dont want to mess with this is gravol isn't good to mix."
6788,"With cognitive therapy/meds, I have gotten a clearer view of this disorder and taken control back in my life (mostly)."
6789,"I didn't want to be on the medication forever though, so a couple months ago I started tapering."
6790,"Edit: If it counts for anything, I figured I'd throw out that I am on medication (on my 3rd or 4th month)."
6791,"I have an appointment with a therapist to start some medication and do CBT next Tuesday, but lately things have been getting so much worse."
6792,"I did a search about anxiety and weight gain, but all I found were posts talking about having gained weight while taking a certain medication."
6793,I'm considering going to the hospital just to see a doctor that'll prescribe me anti-anxiety medication.
6794,It was diagnosed but i wasn't put on medication until about 6th grade.
6795,"As I grew older, I stayed on my medicine but I developed a skill set to help me deal with anxiety."
6796,I've been to the doctor and they give me acid-suppressing medication and send me away.
6797,"I've tried various medication (tecta, rabeprazole, metoclopramide, ranitidine and sucraflate coating) none of which have helped."
6798,"He's not taking medication for his anxiety, and as I said he doesn't believe in therapy."
6799,"Starting probably around December, I had switched to a new medication that had me feeling great."
6800,Also apologies for the thousands of questions I have posted regarding this medication.
6801,"The nausea seems to have subsided a bit, but my anxiety is now ramped up - I'm taking more xanax than I was before I started this medication to cope."
6802,Or is this what this medication does - numb all emotions within me to treat the anxiety?
6803,I know that I've only been on the medication for little more than a week now and that I've only been on the full dose for 4 days... and that it can take 4-6 weeks for the full effect to kick in.
6804,I'm seeing a counsellor in a few days and I think there's a good chance I'll end up on medication.
6805,"I know it isn't a realistic outcome, but I'm really hoping that the medication is the silver bullet that can make me feel like giving up isn't the better option."
6806,Can anybody relate their experience with medication?
6807,Rx medicine also scares me just because I tend to be somewhat of a naturalist I guess.
6808,"After about eight months of CBT I decided to give medication a try about four months ago, and was put on 10mg Lexapro/day, which worked beautifully almost immediately, *except* that it made me really, really fatigued (read: crushingly exhausted, aching muscles due to longing for sleep, actively falling asleep at work - but still, you know, pretty cheerful)."
6809,"She has said I could take a daily low dose of propanolol, but I really want to avoid any medication if possible."
6810,"He's finally been assigned a psychiatrist, who has changed his medications from 60mg citalopram to 30mg paroxetine per day."
6811,"However, in late spring, I switched to a new place that had both therapists and psychiatrists because I decided that I needed medicine now."
6812,"After about a week of that, I was sure it was the medicine and started taking 15mg again, and felt better, but I still had (though not as bad as when I was on 30mg) symptoms of depression and eventually concluded my depression was now coming back as well."
6813,It took 3 weeks for the medicine to kick in.
6814,"I actually think at this point that I could ween off my medicine completely, but I'm in no rush haha!"
6815,"And if you think you need medicine, don't be afraid to give it a try."
6816,"And if your current medicine isn't working for you, do not be afraid to ask to switch to something else."
6817,There are so many different meds out there for depression and anxiety and many of them work in totally different ways.
6818,My therapist told me many of her patients need to switch their medicine 3-4 times before they find the right one for them.
6819,"I am seeing my family doctor tomorrow and expect medication (which I'm happy for, at this point), but this whole thing has me so shook up, I'm not sure what to think."
6820,"I've been put on a lot of different meds over the last year - anti-seizure, AAPs, stimulants, calcium-channel blockers, blood pressure medications."
6821,"I wish I wasn't like this, I might need to go back on some medication to calm me down"
6822,I keep posting about medication here and I'm sorry.
6823,"I am on wellbutrin, but should I see about getting on anxiety medication?"
6824,"Ive taken paxil for abut 4 months now and I can feel the 20mg no longer working, rather than bump up my meds, Im thinking of tapering down."
6825,"I don't take medication, because I'm personally against it."
6826,"i've hardly any experience with medication so my understanding of other options is limited, but i'm told this is one of the mildest anxiety options."
6827,I've also recently come down with strong signs of depression caused by medication.
6828,"Not currently on any medication, but I'm considering seeking some for those really bad days."
6829,"It's getting better with time in steps, so I don't believe medication/therapy are necessary for me (NOT knocking either in any way!)"
6830,"My SO has anxiety and ADHD, is on medication and has been dealing with it long before we met."
6831,I did try medication (the kind that takes a few weeks to kick in) and it seemed like it didn't help me.
6832,Even things that are frustrating to me yet hobbies are much more pleasurable while I'm on this medicine.
6833,"(btw, I am already seeing a doctor and talking about potentially getting on meds...but until then this anxiety is making me feel like I'm losing it and any advice or help or whatever you can offer is greatly appreciated.)"
6834,"I take medication and see a CBT on a floating schedule, usually once a month."
6835,"Once I can be sure that my new insurance policy will cover my current meds reasonably, I will also talk to my PC about possibly adjusting my dosage, or seeing if I might need to change meds altogether."
6836,"I went to therapy for about 3 years (16-19) and took many, many medications, and hated every single one."
6837,"i don't want to be back on meds, i don't want my fiance to back out because i'm being a spaz (pretty much why every other partner has left me), i don't want to burden my family."
6838,"In September I was sick with a respiratory infection and took cold medicine to help myself out, and preceded to get terrified to the point of having my first-ever panic attack, because I was overthinking how I was feeling and was convinced I had something really wrong with my brain or something."
6839,"I later saw that anxiety was a side effect of the cold medicine I took, and didn't take it again."
6840,Im going to my GP this afternoon for help as im already on medication and am starting to hit rock bottom.
6841,"If it turns out I need medicine for my anxiety, then they will prescribe me a mild drug."
6842,I've never had any medication for it or anything like that.
6843,I am obviously on no medication as I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet.
6844,"I'm not interested in medication because it made me feel like a zombie last time I was taking it, and I can't afford it anyways."
6845,I have soul crippling social anxiety and I have done countless hours of researching treatment and medication and all about paxil and I am confident that I know more or less all the important stuff about it.
6846,I can get my hands on it without visiting a doctor and I don't really want to pay the doctor's fee on top of the medication costs.
6847,I know people's opinion of this medicine is varied but for me it has been a savior...except for one thing.
6848,Buying medicines is so addictive.
6849,Did meds work?
6850,But I'm scaring of becoming addicted to and abusing meds.
6851,"Several months ago, when visiting my physician regarding my anxiety and depression meds I was taking, she asked how much caffeine I consumed per day."
6852,Even medication like benzos seem to make things worse because they force you to relax.
6853,"When I was at my GP for my yearly a couple days ago, I'd mentioned to her that I wished I could get on some type of stabilizing medication because I find I get really anxious and frustrated occasionally."
6854,The doctors are more interested in prescribing me acne medicine instead of my ear.
6855,"I use the term 'medicine' very loosely, because apparently you can't do anything about an ear infection other than a couple of pain killers."
6856,"I was on meds from the time I was 13 until I was 17, I ended up being on 250mg of zoloft a day and knowing nothing about how to come off medication I just stopped taking it, then the downward spiral came and I some how developed agoraphobia."
6857,"The medicine is making me lose my concentration, I keep focusing on my nails or plucking hair."
6858,"I am a 29 year old male from SC...i met the love of my life nearly 4 yrs ago....
She has anxiety disorder and depression...for the first couple years i knew her...she handled it well...but in past year...our lives have become very stressful and her control and medication barely help anymore...it kills me to not be able to help her...and she worries that ill leave her because of it...i wont but i almost feel like maybe im causing her problems somehow...and i feel so helpless that i have briefly entertained the thought of giving us a break..but i worry what that may do to her seeing as ive promised id never leave hwr...i want to marry her...we have been unofficially engaged for about 9 months....what can i do...someone help me please"
6859,"Hello (: 
So the only medication I've ever taken was birth control, but I recently started (yesterday) taking Lexapro."
6860,"I feel like that since that is the highest dosage you can give it's a little unnecessary for GAD, especially with how quickly I respond to other medication and I'm very small..."
6861,If i don't feel better in 3 months I will start taking medication.
6862,I've refused any medication because I figured I could get through it on my own.
6863,My question- is it possible to take some medication for a brief period of time without being stuck on it forever and is there any success with going that route?
6864,I really don't want to have to take medicine and risk any adverse effects or withdrawal symptoms.
6865,Around six months in and after a slow steady ramping of medication I began motivating myself to work and things were looking slightly better.
6866,Has anyone else experienced extreme moodiness when they have stopped taking their meds?
6867,"I tried, and by then 15 minutes had passed, I had an Ativan in me (and an aspirin to thin my blood), so I went outside with him for a walk, thinking to let the meds work."
6868,"And no, medication is never an option for me."
6869,Currently on meds (paxil) but still have overwhelming symptoms that affect my daily life and the decisions I make.
6870,"I take my medication every day, and it's helped a lot."
6871,"Now that I have it under control, I find myself constantly wondering ""What happens when they decide that I should stop taking my medication?"
6872,I'm so scared that because I'm getting better that I'm going to get worse when I stop taking my medication.
6873,I know that I shouldn't take the medication if I don't need it.
6874,If you have switched medications before - how long did it take before you felt like yourself again?
6875,"I'm seeing a psychiatrist, trying different meds, and a therapist, but nothing is working so far."
6876,I take the medications that are supposed to work.
6877,"Can't sleep...anxious about my appointment in the morning, I already took my sleep meds...so I'm drowsy but not enough to get me to sleep."
6878,"I've pretty much finally come to the conclusion (Long story, a lot of thought and just a few situations) that I need help in tackling my anxiety head on (Both meds/therapy probably)."
6879,I also want to share my story because there is a bit of an 'anti-SSRI' bias on Reddit which I know stopped me from taking medication when It shouldn't have.
6880,So here is my advice: if therapy isn't working or you have a family history of the illness (which I did) give medication a shot!
6881,"I decided enough was enough, I obviously don't have the mental capacity to stop binge eating on my own, it's time to get some medication."
6882,"All the can do is give me medicine, but the even the thought of that gives me such bad anxiety."
6883,"I know you guys might suggest I take medicine, but here is another problem."
6884,I have really bad anxiety about taking medicine.
6885,If I took medicine just the thought of doing it would give me anxiety really bad.
6886,"They gave me medicine, but that also gave me anxiety just thinking about it."
6887,I have tried taking medicine a few different times and I just can't do it because of my anxiety about taking it.
6888,I know ADD medicine raises blood pressure so that is a no go.
6889,Not that I would anyways because it would give me anxiety taking medicine.
6890,I just need something I can do (besides meds) that will help when I start worrying...
6891,Does it actually 'repair' anything or is it just a stop gap and once I get off the medicine my GAD and depression will come back?
6892,"I have an appt with doc tomorrow to discuss options, medication being one of them."
6893,I was so happy to be off regular medication.
6894,I have the decision of turning a few hours back and going home or continuing on and trying to manage my anxiety (no meds) and I can't figure it out.
6895,What if the medicine never works completely and this is his life?
6896,I need help but can't go on traditional meds like Paxil.
6897,Generally that medicine helps get me down to a starting level of zero which lets me breathe and see things more calmly.
6898,I've gained 60 pounds since then and am much healthier psychologically since I've gotten on meds.
6899,"I tried Zoloft for a few days at one point and although I know the first few weeks on new meds are really difficult and can make you feel worse, I gave up and decided that I wanted to try and deal with my anxiety without meds."
6900,"When I was taking the meds, I wasn't so freaked out about this, and I would be able to remind myself that nobody knows how the future is going to go and that you just have to roll with the punches, and it made me feel fine."
6901,Opinions of what to do about medications (or what not to do) are totally welcome.
6902,"Anyway, after college I stopped going to therapy, got off meds, etc."
6903,I'm currently not on any meds but I take St. Johns wort and I find it helps somewhat.
6904,I really don't want to take medication.
6905,"However, as I ""weened"" off the medication, I felt funny."
6906,"If I'm over 140, the Army requires hypertension meds which may disqualify me from certain jobs."
6907,I do some more research and find that many of the principles that modern psychiatry is based on are simply a giant scam to sell medication.
6908,I already had to switch away from one doctor in the practice because she forgot what meds I was on.
6909,"I haven't been on meds for a while (can't really afford them), but my anxiety and depression have been getting so bad recently that I decided to make an appointment to start meds again."
6910,I never realized until this happened how twisted my stomach feels and how cloudy my head gets when I'm not on the medication.
6911,The only time I ever talk about these feelings is when I take that medication.
6912,"I can't focus in school or even on driving most of the time, and can't even talk to my parents about it without the medication."
6913,Who can I tell that I've taken my girlfriend's medicine without getting in trouble?
6914,I was expecting to feel worse physically which is fine but I don't know whether my mental symptoms are a result of the meds or just my anxiety over the possibility of developing psychosis on them.
6915,I don't know if I'm just being hypervigilant because of the meds or what.
6916,I just went to the doctor today and they told me I have an upper respiratory infection and that i am required to take two days off of work but that they will not give me any medicine unless I get worse.
6917,"I'm really thinking about trying to get on some medication specific for social anxiety (I'm already taking Citalopram against my depression, but apart from that, it doesn't do much) if such a thing exists, to facilitate my exposing myself to these situations, hopefully learning there actually is nothing to be afraid of."
6918,Any experience with medication?
6919,id like to have half a day of being a normal person before i get racing thoghhts before night time and need to take my stronger meds
6920,I did have meds though (oxazepam?).
6921,"I'm not on medication, I'm not in therapy, I'm not ready to accept that kind of help."
6922,You may have been diagnosed with it and take medication around it and are now afraid to quit taking the medication.
6923,"I have seen a doctor who has checked me for pregnancy, taken blood samples (to test for gastritis) and given me meds to help reduce the acidity of my stomach (which haven't helped at all), I also started taking some ginger vitamins the pharmacist recommended to me but unfortunately they didn't help either."
6924,"I hope this isn't too lengthy, but there is a little backstory about my medication history that I need to say."
6925,The nervousness came from when I searched for Seroquel and Luvox (my new meds) on reddit and read nothing but horror stories.
6926,Has anyone here had any experiences with these meds?
6927,I can't help but worry that all my anxiety problems are a result of all these medications I've taken.
6928,"I've always had very mild depression and anxiety problems as a teenager and young adult, but it seems like since I've been on medication it's gotten severe."
6929,I was prescribed this because when I take ADHD medication my anxiety gets out of control.
6930,After months of convincing my parents I do in fact have social anxiety and one (or two) panic attacks I am finally getting some meds to deal with it.
6931,"I am finally starting to notice (slight) improvements in my symptoms, however I seem to be unable to shake the insomnia that my meds are causing me."
6932,My psych prescribed me meds for schizophrenia anyways....' and you get the idea.
6933,I currently do not take any medication and I never have.
6934,But the thought of the rest of my life depending on medication is so terrifying it makes me sick to my stomach.
6935,Are there any odds of using some anxiety medication to fix my issues?
6936,"TL;DR Can anxiety meds be used as a coping method short term, and in turn make the long term easier even if i come off of them?"
6937,"I have had anxiety for years now (I'm 22 but was diagnosed with anxiety and depressive disorder in middle school)

I have been relatively attack free for the last couple of years (thanks to the right medications, meditation, and lifestyle changes)

One of the things I found that gave me a good benefit was a supplement called **L-Theanine**."
6938,"It's extremely safe, you can take it without worrying about hurting yourself (for those of you who have anxiety about taking medications and so on)

It's sold in 100mg tablets but they also sell it in 200mgs for those who think they need the extra boost."
6939,"The only way you will truly see a real benefit in your condition is the right medications, the right therapist, and the right lifestyle changes."
6940,Does it ever happen that meds backfire?
6941,Also the doc upped my meds to 30mg and I start then tomorrow.
6942,I've gone to therapy monthly for the last four years and I've taken several different meds in very regimented ways while working closely with my family doctor.
6943,I've already gone through 4 medications and I have started a 5th a couple of weeks ago.
6944,"My GP has me start off on a starting dosage for each for 4 weeks and if there are no effects, up to a higher dosage for another 4 weeks, then change medication if that doesn't do anything."
6945,The thing is I am not feeling anything from any medication prescribed so far.
6946,"I don't know if it is an actual lack of effect that the medication has on me, or my GP is prescribing placebos."
6947,"Various phobias have come and gone, but later in highschool (junior year or so) I developed a fear of travel, medication (due to my sisters previous bad experiences with anxiety meds), and food (due to discussing medication over dinner every night)."
6948,"In reality I probably have a significant chemical imbalance and should probably be on some long term medication (there is a family history for it on my moms side, literally every single aunt and uncle have had to be treated to some degree and my mother struggles with it sometimes too.)"
6949,"Because I take medication for it, this is manageable, but it helps a lot if it's not a problem in the first place."
6950,And I been going through this hell that is anxiety since I was young it only manifested its self about 5yrs ago and that anxiety attack put me in the ER and I'm talking bout ambulance trip and 11yrs having tests done and having a IV drip of anti anxiety medications.
6951,Currently I'm waiting to see my doctor to be put on anti-anxiety meds again and going back to my shrink.
6952,I know everyone has mixed results with medication...
6953,"I've never had any medication like this before, and the anxiety isn't helping me trust it any..

Any tips would be great..

Edit: Jittery!"
6954,"I take medication for it, 40mg of propranolol twice a day and I have my first therapy session on Monday with a CBT."
6955,Well I started this journey to get over my anxiety back in January without medicines (I came off of Celexa officially in April) and therapy.
6956,I'm not currently on any medication because I'm afraid of the potential side effects.
6957,"When I went to a community college, and during my first semester of classes at a University, I was taking medication to control my anxiety."
6958,"After my first semester, my doctor at the University decided to take me off the medication."
6959,I was taken off that medication.
6960,"She kept prescribing all kinds of medications, and I couldn't take most of them due to side effects."
6961,"Ironically, I couldn't get services unless I was in classes, and I would have preferred to put classes on hold while I figured out what to do for medication."
6962,"I had a 3.27+ GPA with the medication (still had the ADHD issues, but those were workable)."
6963,"After the medication was taken away, and during the whole turmoil, my GPA went down to a 2.75."
6964,"Given the fact that while I was on medication, my professors and advisors at the community college and University all told me that I had what it took to do graduate level work, do you think it might be worth it for me to take a GRE to show the graduate school that I'm capable of doing graduate level work?"
6965,Would the damage to my academic record due to the removal of medication be too much to overcome?
6966,"I'm back on the medication that was working before, although I am more easily able to pick out the CBD-rich forms of the medication now due to it being legal in Colorado now."
6967,"I fear that using CBD-rich pot as a form of medicine will get thrashed there, although there is more and more proof that CBD-rich pot is effective in treating anxiety."
6968,"Luckily, I JUST started medication yesterday (because I always have terrible anxiety, it's just way worse when I actually have something to worry about) so I really hope that it kicks in in a couple of weeks and gets me more under control before the event."
6969,I was put on this medication for anxiety.
6970,I finally went to a doctor last week and started medication.
6971,"If that wasn't the medication I was experiencing, I have no idea what to expect for the coming weeks."
6972,The doctor has suggested on therapy to compliment the medication.
6973,"I've been taking ADHD meds on and off ever since I was a kid, I was on Concerta for a long time but recently switched to Adderall."
6974,"I don't usually have trouble sleeping, and I'm usually a little anxious on my medication but nothing like this before."
6975,My anxiety lately has gotten really bad and I finally took the step towards using medication.
6976,I'm so scared that the initial first couple weeks of medication are going to be make things worse (the potential side effects) combined with dealing with this breakup is going to be completely overwhelming.
6977,YOU are the one who started me on therapy and medication.
6978,I'm dependent on my medication right now.
6979,"I offered to take off work, and pay all copays and medications if she needs it."
6980,And if I am sick how long can I live without medication?
6981,"I tried going to a specalist doc and all he does is prescribe me meds that my parents are against me taking, but I still secretly take anyway."
6982,I go through Target for my meds since the generics are cheaper than going to my hospital's pharmacy.
6983,"My doctor isn't there on weekends, so I won't get it for two more days now...thats 10 days without the meds... How long before its completely out and I have to essentially start from scratch?"
6984,Anybody on medication that can help those short periods of anxiety?
6985,I think I'm going to ask for the 1 mg version of clonazepam but if anybody else has good experience with other medication I'd like to bring it up with my doctor.
6986,I realize now that I was actually having an anxiety attack over taking the anti-anxiety medication.
6987,I am currently on citraoplam and was wondering if there other medications which are more suited to anxiety?
6988,"I've had plenty of therapy and medicine for depression in my past so I understand pretty well how to talk myself down from over-thinking, usually."
6989,"I have been to my doctor and have been prescribed anti-anxiety medication - I don't feel 100%, but that's another story."
6990,"I'm on a new medication, and I have two comorbid disorders of Panic Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder."
6991,"I've been relying on the medication to alleviate all this, but anything I can do while it's not fully in my system yet?"
6992,"Long story short, I'm afraid to take the medication."
6993,"Is this normal for anxiety medication, and is the possible benefit worth it?"
6994,I told her from the beginning I was against medication.
6995,How is she to function without medication?
6996,"I'm on medication, but this anxiety seems to be worse than anything I've experienced previously."
6997,"If I knew the dangers involved and the start of the medication carousel, I never would gave touched that first bottle of Ativan."
6998,before medication becomes a crutch.
6999,I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and will be receiving medication on Monday morning because I had a panic attack last week during my first round of exams in front of my professor because I did not finish her exam on time.
7000,I'm no longer on meds.
7001,I also visit a therapist regularly and asked if there was a way I'd be able to get onto an anxiety medication since I'm completely sure that I have an issue with it and she doesn't seem to think it's necessary.
7002,I just got on some medication after an ER visit because of an anxiety attack that lasted 14 hours and I couldnt stop throwing up.
7003,"Also, I want to know if the severity of these disorders effects your chances of getting better medically... obviously it would be Fer to do therapy with really high anxiety and unable to think striaght but can medicine get even the very severely anxious (mentally) to a manage able state to work out their issues."
7004,I was seeing a therapist a few months ago and she suggested I have low grade anxiety/depression that flares up during different periods of my life and that I should try medication along with yoga and exercise.
7005,"I'm just not sure of whether I should see my doctor about going on anxiety medication, or just find better ways to reduce my stress!"
7006,"I couldn't help but beat myself up with these questions: Why did he shove all those drugs down my throat without recommending any therapy, why was I given controlled substances while being addicted to meth, and why when I get sober and re-diagnosed with depression/anxiety he is no longer willing to give me the medication specifically designed for those issues."
7007,"They say I need some meds 

but an ear was all I needed."
7008,"But with time and effort I have made some big strides, I have adjusted to my medication which has pretty much cured my anxiety and through determination I have made new friends and most importantly gotten my first girlfriend now at 28, something I pretty much had altogether given up on."
7009,"He's been diagnosed ADHD, on meds."
7010,"I know I have to see a therapist and be put on medication, but I really wanted to post this just so I have some people who understand things my friends just don't comprehend."
7011,"Sure enough, on a weak day (a day I forgot to take my medicine), I felt myself getting attached and falling in ""love""."
7012,"The medication really helped for that and I don't have them nearly as often, I can even go weeks without having any."
7013,"But tonight, at the grocery store, I had my first in-public panic attack since taking medication and it really affects me."
7014,"I have seen therapists, psychiatrists, and tried several medications."
7015,"Im finally on meds and going to counseling and i know im ready for college, i know i can pass all my classes and do great but i cant pay for it now."
7016,Should I worry about offending him by locking up my meds?
7017,This is why I am fairly optomistic I won't become addicted to this drug which seems to be the biggest drawback of this particlar medication it seems.
7018,I haven't seen a lot of posts concerning medication (or self-medication) when it comes to treating anxiety.
7019,My medications seem to be working very well.
7020,"I saw a psychiatrist because the panic attacks haven't gone away yet, and she suggested Clonazepam I think it was, but after what had happened to me on Effexor and seeing the odd horror story about Clonazepam, I've realized I'm quite scared to even go near another medication."
7021,Anywhere I  look at JUST doing something like a screening is $200... and then 150 per consultation not including meds.
7022,I really think I need medication to help me cope while this hell semester goes away.
7023,"The therapist helped but wanted to prescribe me meds, and I gave it a shot, but the feeling of the meds affecting my brain made my panic attacks even worse because I felt like I wasn't in control of my own head, the chemicals were."
7024,I've always been on the fence about medications and been able to deal with it on my own for a while.
7025,"I sought out medication, therapy and practiced heaps of self help exercises."
7026,I have a strong feeling it's yet another medication with little to no effect though.
7027,Recently I almost died due to a food allergy.. only to find out that not only has my allergy worsened but I cannot afford the only medication I need in order to survive another allergic reaction.
7028,"Seroquel 400mg, Prozac 20mg, Klonopin 3mg/day

I have been one many meds, and Klonopin has been the only constant."
7029,"Well, he's prescribed me meds (Cipralex), has me seeing a therapist this evening, and wants to be sure to see me again in three weeks!"
7030,"Now, I know that these meds are NOT an overnight fix and that they'll take time."
7031,I've been on anxiety meds for six years now and as with all of you I'm sure there have been some very high highs and very low lows.
7032,"Currently on meds for depression and anxiety and up until recently, they've been pretty fabulous."
7033,"Part of it is due to the fact that I had to move to a new state 4 hours from where I've lived my whole life, and I'm running out of my medication (40mg Prozac, .5mg Klonopin) as I desperately try to find a new doctor."
7034,"I don't drink ""too much"" often but when I do go slightly over my limit (which isn't much, thanks to my size and meds) I notice that the next day I don't get a typical hangover."
7035,Does anyone else experience this as a result of drinking while on medicine?
7036,Currently I am seeing my family dr and am on some meds that seem to help a little bit.
7037,"Hi everyone,

I was thinking about getting a prescription for anxiety medication, however, I've heard that depression can result from taking it."
7038,I can barely afford medicine and I haven't been to a psychologist in a while.
7039,I'm not on any medication or anything.
7040,"Once diagnosed I went from one anti-depressant and anti- anxiety medication to another, to another, etc, with each time one didn't work the dosage has been doubled each time."
7041,I'm tired of being scared my medications will effect me later in life and I will become dependent like my mother.
7042,He knows none of the medications work for my anxiety.
7043,"TL;DR: I have bad anxiety, and my meds have all sucked."
7044,My dentist offered to give me anxiety meds before the appointment.
7045,"One place I contacted called back and said they only do anxiety meds, despite advertising it on their site."
7046,"Hello im 23 male here huge hypochondriac and also have bad social anxiety

I started on meds before christmas 50mg setralin and then shortly 100mg now im starting to take 150mg since i was still getting panic attacks and bad body symptoms like needles and tingling tunnel vision stiff neck all that scary stuff that scares the shit out of me and ofc i think i have ALS."
7047,I also tried various meds for over a year and they did exactly nothing.
7048,"I was going to therapy up until about a year and a half ago, and there was a short period of time (about a few weeks) when I was on medication."
7049,But these days I'm very desperate and I really want to go back on meds again.
7050,I feel that medication would really help.
7051,"I get the feeling that if you're low-income, you're pretty much screwed in terms of meds."
7052,To be honest I'm not looking for anymore self-help tips or anything like that; at this point I'm just concerned and interested in medication.
7053,"I don't want to take medicine or see someone, but my fiancee(M22) says I should see someone for it."
7054,Is there anyone out there who takes medication for there anxiety's?
7055,Is that normal for someone on those meds?
7056,"I have high blood pressure (under control with meds), am overweight (but with diet and exercise I've lost over 20 lbs."
7057,"I've tried medicine, but it made my symptoms worse."
7058,"Not on any prescribed medication, although I've tried some otc stuff for general anxiety which hasn't worked, including aniracetam and magnesium."
7059,"Finally, I sought the help of a psychologist--she told me I'm amicable and easy to talk to, and she thought I could beat my problems without medication."
7060,"I did it au natural, no medications and therapy over twice a week for about a year."
7061,"I am not on any medication, seeing as I have not gone to a professional, yet, about these issues and I do not self medicate."
7062,I've come to the personal conclusion that my anxiety is linked to an actual chemical imbalance and not just the horrible experiences I had as a child (which didn't help) and that I need medication to regulate my brain alongside my therapy.
7063,Is there anyone who's successfully messed with medications in college?
7064,She thinks medication is a great idea.
7065,"I don't take any medications for my anxiety, and I deal with it head on, exposing myself to whatever 'dangers' are out there."
7066,I am pretty sure he would be unwilling to agree to some medication for me (not even sure psychotherapists can prescribe?).
7067,"you may need therapy,
you may need medication, 
but eventually you will move past it and become a stronger person."
7068,"I'm in therapy, on medication, and doing everything I can on my own but it's going to cause me to lose someone I care about so much and I just don't know what to do."
7069,"My grandmother on my Father's side was on anxiety medication, my mother is on medication for depression as well as for an under active thyroid, and my brother was prescribed medication for anxious thoughts."
7070,"I've already been to a counselling session after I had a panic attack about it, and I've booked a doctor's appointment to talk about potential medication."
7071,"But these are the things that I feel helped me a lot on my journey:

- Finally finding prozac after trying 3-4 different meds
- Therapy throughout college from student health office
- Avoiding marijuana
- working out

And the big one...

**- Consistently testing and challenging my anxiety**

**Everyone, please try your very best to take baby steps every day."
7072,"i don't usually worry about taking medication, but i'm just feeling a lot of anxiety around this, perhaps because i've seen my husband's struggle to get on the right meds, and i know it's not always an easy process."
7073,"i've never taken medication for either of these issues before, and have never really had severe anxiety until a couple months ago (have battled depression on and off for most of my life, but never anything i ""couldn't handle"")

i drink occasionally and socially, but have wanted to drink tons these last few weeks (i haven't)."
7074,"I feel like I should be on meds, but I don't want to risk the side-affects at 16 years old."
7075,Could those symptoms be from my anxiety and not taking my medication?
7076,I hate how I take this medicine that I say makes me feel better but I am so paranoid I don't tell the doctor it isn't helping anymore.
7077,I hate how if I don't take the medicine I feel even worse.
7078,I am back in therapy and changed meds to paxil.
7079,I then went to 20mg of lexapro (now) and still being hit with attacks and symptoms so my next step is going to a psychiatrist to evaluate me for the right meds to get back to how I use to feel.
7080,"I am just really hoping to find the right meds to to put me back in that state of being I had just a few months ago....but of course, I worry of the side effects and another medication not working again."
7081,I don't know if it's because I've been reading so much of this sub section or the people I've talked to but I don't know if I need medication or not and would like to just let the Dr decide.
7082,"I have a tough time reading long paragraphs, and i freeze up in doctors offices, leaving very few options for choice of medications."
7083,"A common side effect of all the medications ive been on is loss of appetite, which is pretty awful for me, as im already quite slim."
7084,"If anyone has experience with a certain medication that seems to work without that side effect, please let me know (I understand everyone has different side effects for different things)."
7085,I know I can't do anything about the actual anxiety--she's seeing two therapists and taking meds--but I'd love to be able to help with this (possible) particular troubling symptom.
7086,Clonidine is traditionally a blood pressure medication so its hard to find people online taking it for anxiety.
7087,"The other effects of the medication have improved our relationship in some ways, because I am more comfortable and can relax more than ever around him."
7088,"I know that the loss of feelings are possibly not because of the medication, however (the loss of libido certainly is)."
7089,Maybe I would be having these feelings even if I wasn't taking the medication.
7090,"But if it is, and if that is what I have to sacrifice to get rid of my anxiety, I don't think I want to take the medication anymore."
7091,"If you've stopped taking medication because of the sexual side effects, have you had success with other methods of alleviating anxiety?"
7092,I've been on various medications for the last few years.
7093,"I feel like I have tried countless meds, and talking to a counselor but still cannot seem to manage the anxiety when it comes to that."
7094,Is this such a deep rooted issue now that its time for medication like Cialis or Viagra?
7095,I don't know what true anxiety issues constitute and I'm unsure of whether what I'm experiencing is severe and actually requires medication or not.
7096,I also didn't feel depressed even though I didn't take any of my medication (I was telling my mom I was taking it).
7097,I didn't have to take any medication anymore and I had a fairly normal day-to-day life with only a few minor panic attacks for about a year.
7098,I was dealing with my anxiety really well without medication and staying clean.
7099,I've made an appointment with my psych doc for next week and have been researching non-ssri medications to suggest.
7100,Any advice or experiences with these meds would be greatly appreciated.
7101,I ask friends (Though I completely understand and agree with the illegal distribution of prescription ADHD medication is wrong and deeply affects people who need it) if I can try their medication and find myself more centered and in control...
7102,"Overall,
I've been drunk all night and have simmering off of my medication."
7103,After that I lost all hope in anxiety meds.
7104,Does anyone have any familiarity with these 2 meds and know what I should expect?
7105,"I'm on medication and have been for close to a year, but it's a daily medication (Zoloft) and I don't have any meds for taking during a panic attack."
7106,"I know this is just general anxiety, but does anyone know what I could do to reduce these without having to take medicine?"
7107,I've been on more medications for anxiety and depression than I can remember.
7108,Our latest little adventure into the world of random medication has be propranolol.
7109,"I got a dumb book from the library and sat outside for a bit and that helped, and I also took some over the counter anti-nausea medication and thats helped a little."
7110,"I could go to the hospital for the post-exposure treatment, but they and my family would think I'm crazy (maybe I am), and the medication is supposed to have extremely unpleasant side effects (to the point where some people actually stop taking them)."
7111,I'm already on meds but the thoughts won't stop!
7112,I'm on a lot of meds due to also having bipolar disorder but I'd say my anxiety has been relative stable for the past few weeks with my meds.
7113,He also thought that my memory problems are a sign that I may have ADD and he wants me to research it and get back to him about it before making me go on medication for it.
7114,"I've finally started running, mainly because my new psychologist (I'm trying CBT without medication for the first time after about 10 years of diagnosis and medications.)"
7115,"We got them on new medications, diagnosed as bi-polar."
7116,"Stick with it and keep reminding yourself, despite nagging doubts: through strength, persistence, and the medication, I'm getting better every day."
7117,Found myself in A&amp;E begging to be put back on medication.
7118,"I know speaking with my doctor is one of the main things I can do, and no one here really knows me or my medication or history, so no one can provide professional or solid advice, but I'm just looking for anything."
7119,I was on meds before.
7120,I felt sick for taking medicine.
7121,"Paroxetine made my IBS worse, and probably all the other meds too."
7122,So now I also feel scared of medication.
7123,The only freedom of mind I get is the fact I dont take medication.
7124,I'm going to see about getting on meds.
7125,"Of course, talk to your doctor before taking any medication."
7126,"Took my nightly meds Gabapentin, Zantac, and Citalopram."
7127,"It usually calms me down and stops my panic attacks   not causes them   But usually I don't take it so close with my other meds either
is there some timing problem with it so close to the others?"
7128,"I'm not currently taking any medications, but have been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds in the past (went off them last August or so)."
7129,Oh I am also back on anti depressants and I was good on both meds for 2 years then when I quit them it got bad again.
7130,I started medication and therapy at age 19.
7131,I had a medication regime and still I felt awful.
7132,My meds were tapered off.
7133,I started sleeping through the night without medication.
7134,Four months later I'm off all meds.
7135,"Years and years and years of hard work, medication change ups, therapy, groups,  family support and lifestyle changes healed my brain."
7136,The anxiety medication I was on when I was admitted wasn't helping anything because I had hypertension which wasn't treated properly.
7137,I didn't think I'd ever be off meds.
7138,"I quit taking my zoloft, because I don't want to be held down to anxiety medicine for the rest of my life."
7139,I started therapy and swore I would never take medicine.
7140,"I started my therapy up again (I had taken almost a year off), and discussed medication."
7141,He has bumped up my meds to 10mg hoping to see more of an improvement.
7142,I know the medicine will take time to kick in.
7143,"I guess I just wanted you guys to know, if you are against medicine, you might want to reconsider."
7144,I live in Japan and I'm not sure if the doctors will give me anything medication for anxiety or just tell me to wait it out.
7145,He gave me a prescription for general anxiety as well as another medication to use as needed in the event of an anxiety attack.
7146,"Some personal facts: I'm a 25 year old male, I live in the UK, I've never been prescribed any medication, I don't really know what else to say here."
7147,I controlled my anxiety really well for 4 and a half months with no medicine either!
7148,I want to start by saying that I've had anxiety for years and have never taken any medications for it because I can usually control it myself.
7149,"Its not that I don't want more help, its that getting help in the first place was fairly crippling and the medication I have been taking has been working well so far."
7150,The point is that I have come to the realization that the medication has maybe not been working so well in the last few weeks.
7151,"I have tried therapy, vitamins, eating healthy, and medicine."
7152,"Since I did that, I went about 3 days where the meds weren't seeming as effective, but that has seemed typical that every two weeks around the same time I'd have a few days like that."
7153,"Now they're effective again but now I'm back to where the effects will fade over night and I feel okay, but I don't feel ""great"" until about an hour after I take the meds."
7154,I've been on medicine in the past.
7155,"and she got back to me within about a day and left a message just wanting to know the nature of the request, so I left another message with some further details (anxiety, depression, meds, yadda yadda)."
7156,"The only medication I take is klonopin (.5mg) nightly and I've wondered if being on it for the last year has contributed to it, but I highly doubt it."
7157,Had a appointment with my Pdoc (who also has a lot of experience in other areas of medicine) and he suggested I see a cardiologist for a work up due to some weird palpitations I've been having and to put my health anxiety at rest.
7158,"I did get a formal diagnosis for depression about 5 years ago, however, I have not been in therapy or taking medicine for some time."
7159,"I haven't tried different medication because I decided that because this worked, wasn't giving me any negative side effects, and was making me feel better I was just going to stop there."
7160,"It has gotten better now (I'm 17), but when I was a kid (a smaller one, atleast :)) it was really bad and I used to take medication (not sure what it was)."
7161,"I think removing those problems could boost my confidence a little, but should I use medicine or do you think I could work through this myself?"
7162,I haven't been on medication that works in months and I can no longer afford my old meds.
7163,I've been through a few different medications but have been on my current medications for several months now (Lithium and Prozac).
7164,"I say non-ER because it is frankly very expensive, and my parents are already spending quite a bit between my dermatologist, counselor, and medications."
7165,"I haven't yet been diagnosed with any kind of mental health disorder, nor given any medications, and I went in for depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, social anxiety, and sporadic panic attacks."
7166,"I'm not currently taking any medication, and my anxiety is primarily triggered by any sort of new social situation."
7167,I'm hoping that the meds will help with therapy which has been useless in the past.
7168,Keep my fingers crossed that meds will fix everything?
7169,Neurologist wants me to get off the medication but told him I want this sleep condition resolved first.
7170,"Of course my mind gets involved and I worry that I'm going to die because I can't sleep, or that I'm really going to have a seizure and all these years without one are gone down the drain and I'll never get off my medicine, or maybe it's just fight or flight kicking in and I can't do either and just being helpless."
7171,Does serotonin medication actually help?
7172,Do you think my medication could be making me feel like this?
7173,"I am wondering now since I am in a good place if it is wise to ween myself off my medication, as I feel like I no longer need it."
7174,"I have read that this medication causes difficulty with orgasm which I believe I am experiancing, but I have nothing to compare it to since I lost my virginity in this time period- I know for a fact though I do not and never have had a low libido."
7175,I also have frequent and vivid nightmares on the medication- sometimes I forget whether it is reality or not they are so life like.
7176,Anyways besides these issues the meds are not effecting my life in anyway except positively- if at all.
7177,Is it advisable to ween myself off of this medication?
7178,"I am on no medication, my doctor told me to use herbal remedies which are doing nothing."
7179,I don't have much experience with anti-anxiety meds but are these side effects a normal part of taking benzos?
7180,Had a session with my therapist today and we talked about how I haven't been taking my meds.
7181,I am currently taking lamictal as well as lithium and I've been taking the medications too recently for them to take effect.
7182,The medications [sic] used are broken.
7183,"Do not suggest medication, it's a scam and I refuse to take any medication."
7184,"Do not suggest therapy, it's a scam and worse than medicine."
7185,"Have had panic and anxiety attacks before, was on serotonin meds for a while but just stopped taking them, felt weird."
7186,tl;dr Anyone ever got help minus meds?
7187,"I talked to my therapist who said I should call my doctor (just my general physician, he is who is prescribing my meds now) and see if I could get the dosage increased."
7188,"The nurse I talked to on the phone was amazing, she said she has medicine anxiety too and she hates taking meds like I do, but that these two meds are made to work together and they think it'll really really help me be able to cope and function with day to day life."
7189,"*My question is, has anyone ever been on two different meds/med classes?"
7190,"I have a prescription for anti-anxiety meds but I only take ""when needed"" ..."
7191,Today starts the third weeks in which I've been on meds to control my recent Anxiety issues.
7192,I used to be on meds a few years ago and came off and have been fine til I bought my first house.
7193,I've been in and out of therapy but never really finished a program and I'm really trying to avoid meds (my current therapist just brought this up as an option if things don't improve over the next few weeks).
7194,My thoughts turned to what medications that can be bought and mixed in a way that I would go peacefully to sleep and never wake up.
7195,I take medication for it and consider it to be manageable.
7196,"Lost my job 5 years ago, have been housebound since, got off of all meds except got some Xanax here and there from family members."
7197,"* If you’re medicated, make sure you’re keeping a steady habit of taking your medications."
7198,Are there over-the-counter medicines that can help?
7199,PS: I refuse to take medication.
7200,"So I am a 16 years old guy, 2 weeks ago I had my first anxiety atack because I though that I am having a heart atack and I am gonna die, after that everything was fine untill yesterday when I was running outside with my dog, stopped for a moment and felt like my heart skipped a beat, I panicked, ran inside and had an anxiety atack again, after my dad gave me some pills (I think it was xanax or something to calm down), I went to bed and felt asleep, then today in the middle of the biology class, while talking about heart and stuffs, I got an anxiety atack, this time I calmed down in 3-4 mins, but today all day I was feeling pretty bad, every time when I think about my health or anything related to heart I start to get close to having an anxiety atack again.So I was wondering if there is any way to stop my anxiety without taking any pills or anything, I talked to my dad about going to someone to consult me but he said that I am fine and I dont need any medicine (he is a doctor, and my mom is a doctor too).When I get an anxiety atack at home, most of time I just cuddle my dog for several mins and then I slowly calm down... but that is not posible at school and I dont want to look like a guy with serious mental problems in the middle of class just because I have a strong fear of heart atacks, even after my dad explained me that a skipped beat (or a PVC) is nothing to worry about, because no one in my family had heart problems and my EKG is fine, my heart has no problems except that when I get a panic atack, my pulse gets pretty high (130-140 yesterday when I though that I am gonna die because of the skipped beat)."
7201,I have a few symptoms that I was hoping some people on here are familiar with that could give me some ways I can alleviate them without the use of medication.
7202,"I also have an appointment with a psychiatrist on June 12, but I would really like to go the route of no medication."
7203,"Because those who have enjoyed the benefits of the drug they are taking, they are out enjoying the benefits of their medications, and living life possibly free of their symptoms."
7204,"But I have also seen meds save people's quality of life, their way of life, *their life*."
7205,"You may have to try a few different meds, but if meds are indicated, make informed decisions about what you are trying."
7206,"More often than not, if you and your doctor have decided that meds are the way to go or at least try, you're going to need to try multiple different meds to see what helps with the fewest side effects."
7207,I'm here to see if anyone can relate some experience to taking anti-anxiety meds to combat such an issue.
7208,"I'm not even doubting that the meds work, but I'm curious as to *how* they work on someone like me."
7209,"She said their policy was not to provide any such meds and that it was all about ""mind over matter""."
7210,I've tried meds that made me want to commit suicide and so on.
7211,I've tried a lot of medications.
7212,"An endless loop of medication, therapy, and anxiety that just sends back to where we were before, sometimes worse off."
7213,This time around I want to try to help myself a bit more by going on anxiety medication (ONLY if I get accepted to the college I applied to.)
7214,What type of doctor do I see for this type of medication?
7215,"I regularly meditate but I'd love to hear some helpful breathing exercises and/or any other self help tips, thank you in advance!&lt;3  

EDIT: forgot to mention, I don't take medication and I quit therapy a few months ago for other reasons."
7216,"This post is not to tell you why, diagnose or provide an alternative to therapy or medicines."
7217,"I was once almost put on anxiety medications, but that sort of fell through partly because of my reluctance to take medication."
7218,Can therapy and/or medication really help me out of the horrible state I am in now?
7219,"I'm currently taking 10mg of Citalopram a day and 7.5mg of Buspirone as an ""emergency"" medication."
7220,"Part of it's the fear of retching or throwing up, and part of it's just that the meds kill my appetite."
7221,Today I've decided to drop the meds.
7222,I know it's normal to have to try more than one medication.
7223,"I think that, despite thinking of myself as pretty savvy, I was desperate and looking for a magic cure to make everything go away, when this is something I could probably work through without meds."
7224,"I'm relatively convinced the meds are causing the attacks, because again, I've *never* been this anxious in my entire life."
7225,"I'm in therapy and on medication, but when I'm stuck at school for long periods of time alone, I wig out, and am tempted to snoop on my husband's online profiles."
7226,"I've doped myself up with medication before, but I hate being a zombie."
7227,"Today I got up and eventually made food, but pretty much everything that comes out of the mouths of my family members is making the irritability and anxiety worse, and I don't have any anti-anxiety medicine as my pharmacy needs to have the prescription renewed by my doctor first, and now I am in a different state all-together."
7228,How does everyone else deal without the aid of medicine?
7229,"So anyway, doc Rxed me 20mg Paxil a night (long story, has to do with my thyroid meds and a disagreement we're having over how to treat my hyperthyroidism)."
7230,"Recently, I've been getting to sleep, but having these oddly vivid dreams and waking up in a panic I guess, and maybe it is my thyroid changing (or the meds themselves interacting with my other meds, which is Xanax mostly), but doc thought the Paxil would help that and maybe my anxiety overall."
7231,"We both think I might benefit from adding a second medication into the mix, possibly a short acting Xanax."
7232,What about adding a second medication?
7233,"I want to hear success stories about medication, or therapy.. Because I need a kick in the ass to get me to commit to asking for help."
7234,It just hurts to see someone I really care about very obviously struggling and very obviously afraid of weaning off of medication.
7235,"She has recently (within the last year and a half) got medication for her disorders though, and I've seen a dramatic impact."
7236,"With the money generated from selling off all the things I don't really need, and the money saved from my last paycheck (I had to quit the job because the stress was giving me panic attacks every time I was at work), it is enough to pay for many appointments to mental health doctors and medication for 3-4 months, without insurance."
7237,"I'm hoping that after the first few months of medication I will feel good enough to get a new job, and continue to fund my meds for much more time."
7238,"I've sought help and thank goodness, I'm finally receiving help from a therapist and receiving medication (Mirtazapine, 15mg)."
7239,The side effects scare me and so does the thought of being dependent on a medication.
7240,Besides taking medication I see a counselor once or twice a month and work on mindfulness and such.
7241,My partner suffers from anxiety disorder and has been a guine pig for so many antideppressant/anxiety medications and their side effects for the past 20 years and.
7242,"We've gone through the emotional roller coaster everywhere from panic attacks, nervous breakdowns, separation anxiety, feeling bad for me having to deal with it, beating herself up, crying fits, insomnia, abusing her meds, not being able to leave the house, hopelessness and wanting to die, ect..."
7243,"I'm also sick, but am sick too from the side effects of missing meds."
7244,My panic attacks are going crazy from missing my meds and are only fueled because I feel ill.
7245,Could the medicine change be doing anything?
7246,I've always wanted to be on meds.
7247,I have limited amounts of medication and I'd rather not rely on it when I should be able to find a way to wake up when I need to without it triggering an attack.
7248,Feel free to ask any questions as to what medications I take and what my sleeping routine is.
7249,"The first several medications I tried either didn't seem to help, or (in one case) actually created even worse symptoms."
7250,"I was off my meds for a while after getting discouraged, going through what seemed like a hundred options that didn't work, and then finally decided to try again this past September, and it's been working so well for me I can't believe it!"
7251,"Just remember that because a particular medication didn't work for someone you know doesn't mean it won't work for you, and just because the first (or second, or third...) meds you try don't work for you, doesn't mean there isn't one that will!"
7252,"I know I should speak to a therapist or take meds, but the idea of doing either makes me worry because I feel like it would make it official that I have a real issue and not that this is just a passing feeling."
7253,Maybe I should just get some kind of medication?
7254,"I'm a 21 year old male and I can't get legal medication until I am out from under my parents, if I even need it."
7255,"So, a few months after weaning off of my medication, my anxiety has peaked again, and now I'm getting stress hives."

7257,"I've tried meditation, I take medication, I drink sleepy teas."
7258,"Ive read this is a very effective medicine, and I know I should, but Im afraid of the side effects or having an allergic reaction."
7259,I'd say the climax was a massive breakdown in 2010 that very nearly landed me in a psych hospital and finally convinced me to give medication a try.
7260,"I've stuck with the medication, although I'm not always happy about it."
7261,"I have switched my medication from Prozac to Zoloft, and because it works a thousand times better for me, I've been able to preform in this job and face my fears."
7262,"My medicine has a big fat ""DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL WHILE TAKING THIS MEDICATION"" sticker on the side of the bottle."
7263,I stopped my medication and was accepted.
7264,"I'm now back home and in university, I haven't been on medication in over 5 years but its something I've thought about possibly trying again."
7265,However I want to apply to the police force and I'm horrified of the possibility of being turned down due to being on medication.
7266,"This is something that has been bothering me for awhile, I've come this long without medication and I can function and get by but I often wonder how things could be different with medication."

7273,I've had to take 3-4x the amount of emergency meds as I have in the past few months.
7274,They gave me Apo Alpraz ( anxiolitic medication ) but when I was doing panic attack in class I could NEVER NEVER come back in because I was thinking that people may think i'm weird.
7275,But I never gave up and threw my medication away and day by day tried to understand what made me felt this bad and focused on it.
7276,Did you take medication?
7277,"To start, I've always been against medication."
7278,"I've always felt if I take a medication that alters my brain, I'm giving into someone, something."

7280,"Every time I'd take a Nighttime cold medicine or something that would make me sleepy, I would get incredibly agitated."

7282,"I was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder last year, and after seeking professional help, it seemed we found the right combination of medications (Zoloft and Klonopin)."
7283,"I haven't yet identified all the triggers, and though I'm on meds for both the anxiety and depression, I can have days where it's very, very hard to function."
7284,"Being on my own then was the right thing, and it helped me recover (along with upping my dose of antidepressants and getting some new anti-anxiety emergency meds for the really bad attacks)."
7285,I came off my anxiety/depression meds back in June and had been doing pretty well up until this past few weeks.
7286,"I started taking my meds again last night, but its not overnight."
7287,I took my anxiety medication that I have for when I get panicky.
7288,I was taking 50 MG of Zoloft but after the attack I self medicated back to 150 MG since my insurance has been cut off and I don't have a doctor to treat my medicine.
7289,"Calves, tights, lower and upper back, shoulders and my head feel so painful in the morning that sometimes I can't even move much in the first few minutes despite my pain and anxiety medication."
7290,My medication for anxiety is 3x2mg of Clonazepam daily +Propanolol and/or Pregabalin when needed.
7291,"Thanks, this is a great subbreddit, I decided to use a throwaway for this, also I'm not on any meds."
7292,"Anti-anxiety medicines include many adverse unwanted effects, but biofeedback for anxiety provides a natural and noninvasive treatment alternative."
7293,"Prior to deciding to begin a prescription medicine, you need to explore all of the available alternatives."
7294,"By teaching the individual how you can correctly react to their anxiety, biofeedback might help sufferers of anxiety to manage their signs and symptoms without medication."

7298,"It is probably from my medicine, lexapro."
7299,"I still smoke regularly but lately, I have been considering asking my doctor to help me better understand my anxiety and for some kind of medicine that would help."
7300,"Also, what medicines would you recommend I ask my doctor specifically about and what side-effect/withdrawals have you experienced with them?"
7301,I take low doses of most of my medications because I seem to be very sensitive to them.
7302,"When I try to bring up these issues with my psychiatrist, she doesn't have any real solutions for me except to try different medications."
7303,"She doesn't offer any explanations on which medications would be a good fit for me, trying to have a conversation with her about the difference between SSRIs and SSNIs is like pulling teeth."
7304,Does anyone have any experience with difficult psychiatrists or different types of medications for anxiety that might work for me?
7305,I've been prescribed nearly every medication available so I'd pretty much given up on the idea of ever being well again.
7306,"If anyone deals with anxiety and depression I urge them to try it, especially if you've had no luck with other medications."
7307,"I don't want to take strong medication, but I have not even started therapy or much of anything else."
7308,this medication does not reduce my anxiety.
7309,and when i finally see this person i'll have to start a new medication like lexapro or something (i've only ever taken ativan) and i dont know if that will work or how it will affect me when i finally get it.
7310,i've always been scared of taking medicine every day.
7311,feeling like i could have a panic attack at any time because i dont feel confidence in this weakass medication.
7312,"It's all in my body language, some of my personality quirks, and my failed attempts at passing off medication side effects as just being ill."
7313,Any medications I can buy in drug store?
7314,"I've been taking my prescribed anxiety medication (it's as-needed, I normally never take it but I brought it with because I knew this would happen...) but sometimes that doesn't totally cut it."
7315,Is this normal while on anxiety meds?
7316,**TL;DR: How do you know when/if anxiety meds stop working?
7317,Recently my meds haven't been working as well as they were and I've been feeling really anxious.
7318,He said I had general anxiety and to take a medication for a while and it should go away.
7319,"I really am trying to make things work, and I took a medication vacation to avoid the sexual side effects of Lexapro as we were beginning our relationship."
7320,"These past couple of days I have started wrapping up this phase of my life, I have made amends with the women in question with a clean slate after I apologised for the way I acted, I will start to be even more social, get involved a lot more, continue volunteering, come out of my shell a lot more (I have gradually been doing it since I started the meds), be more confident, stop over-thinking, continue losing weight and take control of my life."
7321,So I want to use alternative medicine instead.
7322,"I have noticed that the anxiety gets a lot better when I take some of my leftover hyperthyroid meds, such as atenolol or trazodone."
7323,"Last week I started meds, (Zoloft, 25 mg twice a day) and the first night I woke up at 3:30 with a clenched jaw and felt horrible until it was time for work."
7324,"Yesterday my doc finally got back to me and told me to get off the meds, said I had a very extreme reaction."
7325,"I know it might not be out of my system yet, but honestly this isn't much worse than where my momentum was carrying me before I started meds."
7326,"Currently, I have a few things I'm trying: 1) Pursuing different meds, 2) continuing counseling with my counselor, 3) Seeing a general physician (haven't had a checkup in years), 4) Seeking group therapy, 5) Maybe exercising (which has always been hard for me), 6) trying to do CBT and recognizing and fighting automatic thoughts."
7327,I found some info online about two meds that have shown promise for treating bruxisum - clonazepam and buspiron.
7328,As the title says im looking for some over the counter anxiety medications that I can try to help me get through my next speech in public speaking.
7329,I went off the medication and my anxiety/depression was manageable.
7330,"I can't sleep, and I feel myself slowly falling back into the terrible place I was at the first time I needed the medication."
7331,"I don't necessarily want to be on medication, but I don't see another option."
7332,"What medications have worked for you, and what side effects did you encounter?"
7333,Please tell me what medication you are on that is not doing either of those things.
7334,"Since he is Army, the idea of medication isn't even an option."
7335,Also I don't take any medications so it isn't a side effect of any drugs.
7336,I don't want to rush getting off the medication.
7337,"At the end of the day, I guess I'm a little nervous about the final step and I'd like some reassurance that it'll all be okay to get off my meds!"

7344,I'm not sure about other possible medications.
7345,I'm not too big on medications to begin with and have anxiety even about taking medication.
7346,So to wrap up (I guess you could call this portion the TL;DR) is there a specific medication I should ask my doc about?
7347,"I was thinking about Zoloft, I've read many positive experiences about it but again I'm not sure...most of these meds seem to have more negative effects than positive."
7348,"I have to be honest, I would rather continue to live with this anxiety than become a different person from medication."

7350,I didn't take my ADHD meds again today either.

7353,I have to see the doctor tomorrow and I may go back on my Lexapro meds for anxiety/depression.

7357,"So far though, this medicine seems to be doing the trick."

7365,I am a 20 year old male who has never taken any type of medication outside of antibiotics when I am sick.

7370,"Everything started to go well and I landed the job in october 2014, the job interview went great with the help of the anxiety medication and after a few days at work I decided to throw them out as an addiction to Benzodiazepines is way worse than anxiety, I moved out of my apartment to my grandfather as I hated the current place I lived and considered it a conduit for my anxiety and depression."
7371,My parents want me to get help but I'd rather not go on medication.

7373,"She then asked what it was that I had in mind in regards to the sort of help I was looking for, whether I was hoping to look into counseling, medication, etc."
7374,"She explained there are a number of different possible medications, anti-depressants, and a ton of other things but that she thinks it would be best to hold that off as an option, but not a first move -- unless I felt my anxiety was so severe that I couldn't get through my day to day life anymore without something to help calm me down."
7375,"I explained that I was open to medications if necessary, but that it wasn't my first choice as I'd rather learn to deal with my issues around decision making, the future, fear of failure, etc."
7376,"She then told me that she'd like to see me again in a month to see how things are going and told me that if I feel like I need to explore medication, we can look at it at that time, or if things get worse before then to come in sooner if I need to."
7377,My next appointment with my doctor is in the middle of April and I'm going to ask for medication again but the thought of that makes me feel so much more disappointing and hopeless.
7378,How did you guys broach the subject of medication for anxiety and deal with parents/family who have this mindset?
7379,Is there any way to reduce my anxiety without the use of medication?
7380,"Up until that point though I was resisting getting on medication, because I wasn't actually feeling depressed and honestly I didn't even feel all that anxious in the first place during all this."
7381,"Finally I gave in to her suggestions that I 1) get on medication, which is now a low dose of Lexapro, 2) continue seeing a therapist, and 3) attend a mindfulness meditation group."

7399,"At this point I'm seriously considering just throwing myself down some stairs, I don't want to kill myself but if I do something like that I won't have to go to school and I'm sure that will expedite the process of getting meds."
7400,"I know meds usually take a week or two to take effect, but I could at least get a little bit of comfort out of the idea that I have them."

7457,Two years ago I finally gave in after years of resisting and began taking medication.
7458,"But if I go to anyone else they won't understand, they'll just think I'm looking for pills to pop, since I have only talked to my doctor about general anxiety and haven't seen the need to ask for meds before now."
7459,"I've been feeling increasingly anxious throughout the day for no apparent reason, but I know that it's just my body getting used to the medication and it'll pass."
7460,"I've never taken this sort of medication before so I'm not entirely sure at what point ""as needed"" is really needed."
7461,I am not on any medication.
7462,Do I just take the other medication as needed after the attacks happen (which shouldn't be for a while)?
7463,I am wondering if I should look in to medication for this.
7464,Meds or no meds?
7465,Do you have any tips (other than medication) to help me stay asleep longer?
7466,Was given more meds.
7467,I'm so worried that any medicine for it is going to affect me negatively.
7468,"So I was diagnosed with social anxiety and depression years back, and have been going on and off various meds since then."
7469,"Around last year I got to a really low oint because I hadn't been on anything for about 12 months, and it was a final push to get help because I was too anxious to do anything, school work, cleaning, hanging out with friends/family was difficult, and I finally went to therapy and got on meds."
7470,"So with the medicine, over the past year I've been getting better (yay!"
7471,He said it was to prescribe me medicine.
7472,"I am scared that I will go and I won't like them, but I would like to have someone who could prescribe me medication so that I don't have to get a doctor seperately."
7473,I'm currently on no medication.
7474,Some background: I take a daily anti-depression/anti-anxiety medication that has worked really well for me in the past.
7475,I have an appointment to see a psychiatrist to get back on medication.
7476,As we were going over my medical history I mentioned I do my anxiety and that I take medication for it.
7477,"However, I wish they would have paid attention to the fact I said I have anxiety and that I take medication to control it."
7478,"I started taking medication for severe anxiety, and everything was good for the first couple weeks."
7479,"I have been prescribed .25mg of xanax 3x a day recently, no warnings from my psychiatrist about drinking on this medication."
7480,"I am having a panic attack now, because I have drank on this medication."
7481,Are there any medicines I should take?
7482,"Regarding medication, I refuse to take medication because well, a little because of the stigma that is attached to it."
7483,"I realize people don't have to know you're on medication, but it will hurt my pride if I take it."
7484,I have tried four different kinds of medication and I hated every single one of them.
7485,"I have been prescribed Xanax, some chest medication to maintain heart rate so I don't get chest pains and Prozac but I haven't tried any of them out yet."
7486,I want something where I do not have to take medication to fight this anxiety.
7487,"Okay, long story short I have extremely bad anxiety, to the point I can't leave my house most days, and I am worried about starting anxiety meds because I have heard how bad they can be for you; addiction is also a strong factor in my family as my mother got addicted to anxiety meds."
7488,"I was just wondering if anyone can talk a bit about their personal use of either anxiety meds or cannabis for anxiety, also sorry for how poorly this was written."
7489,After wrestling with anxiety symptoms for a year now I finally brought up the conversation of medication with my doctor today.
7490,"FURTHER EDIT: SO I talked to my doctor this morning and while she acknowledged that binge eating/weight gain is uncommon on Lexapro, she was more than happy to have a chat to me and to try some other medications."
7491,I was wondering if anybody had any ideas on why I could be getting anxious around my birthday and then anyways to kind of help it naturally because I don't want to have to take medicine all the time.
7492,I've been consistent with taking my medication.
7493,"I guess I came here to talk about it, and to get some reassurance that with help from a doctor, a therapist, and maybe even medicine, we can get this thing under some degree of control and keep having our wonderful relationship."
7494,"So boom, back on the medicine."
7495,So again I find myself retaking the medicine because I think I'm too dependent on it now and basically I cannot properly function without getting to a breaking point and acting as if the world was ending.
7496,"While doing some of my research not that long ago, I found out that 40mg is actually the highest dosage this medicine is prescribed at and they start at 10mg."
7497,In my general life experience I've found that doctors usually gradually move from lower doses to higher ones to properly assess the right dosage of medicine to give someone.
7498,However I'm also the one that's been going back and forth convincing and unconvincing myself on whether I need this medicine or not.
7499,"I promised my BF I would contact my doctor and get on something, I have always been opposed to medication but it has never been this bad."
7500,"I have a therapist, I take meds."
7501,"What can I donor, my anxie is back, no medications work, and therapy has been a bust for me,even when I trytogetsmething out of it."
7502,I know that my best friend who also has ADD has said that a lot of meds actually have the opposite intended effect on her - she ends up feeling anxious and restless on them.
7503,"Of course I will be taking my daily medications and have Ativan if need be, but I always like to try and calm myself down if I can."
7504,I'm looking to see my GP to see if I can get some meds to see if they help.
7505,"I very much am not comfortable with the idea of seeing a therapist about this though, as I have friends I can talk to who also have this problem - they recommend I give meds a go as it has helped them."
7506,"I got prescribed meds that made me feel worse, and I decided that what I felt before was better than what the meds made me feel."
7507,"Since my anxiety is mostly centered around fear of having a severe allergic reaction to medication / suffocating to death from inexplicable and magical causes, this freaked me the hell out."
7508,My anti-anxiety medication gave me a panic attack?
7509,"I am on an antidepressant and antianxiety medication, which helps, but not all of the time."
7510,"I meditate to curb my regular panic attacks and that works a lot of the time without needing meds, but with this sort of ""attack"" I cannot even begin to focus on meditation."
7511,He replied saying he doesn't feel comfortable talking to a stranger and the idea of taking medications is a turn-off as well.
7512,So I am finally tapered off all medication.
7513,"I really don't want to be on medication, but I also can't be a successful student, girlfriend, puppy mom, etc."
7514,Should I just suck it up and try another medication to get a hold on it?
7515,"The doctor's appointment/meds are happening eventually when money and transportation stop being an issue, but in the meantime I've been trying so many things, MoodGym which has helped but not really stopped the random physical panic symptoms, meditation which I can't really do in the throes, taking 5-HTP, and just recently binaural beats."
7516,"However, the psychiatrist prescribed her an anti-anxiety medication and anti-depressants as he felt that depression might also be a part of the problem."
7517,"However, after the medicine wears off I spiral into this soul crushing depression which I don't know whether it's caused by the medicine or just my anxiety coming in full throttle without any chemical help to suppress it because my life is lacking stability right now."
7518,So I got my meds adjusted just over two weeks ago.
7519,I don't know how I'm going to survive until I get meds.
7520,"Somehow, I have to survive 2 more weeks (and then more while I want for the meds to hopefully kick in) when I'm in extreme anxiety and suffocating existential despair."
7521,I'm reading reviews and now i'm anxious about my anxiety meds haha the irony.
7522,I'm also kind of scared to take any cold medicine now.
7523,I feel like I've tried everything and ready to try medications again.
7524,What are some success stories and past histories with peoples medications?
7525,"**PART 1: BACKSTORY:** 

I've had anxiety problems since developing a phobia as a child but have always been scared to take medication."
7526,"If so, what other type of medication has worked for you?"
7527,"I honestly didn't suspect the medication was causing any of my problems, since I took it to stop those very issues."
7528,"I'm scared to try any other medicine, but I think I probably need it at this point - at least as a stepping off point for improving this."
7529,"*

[Hair loss with medication][http://www.dr-bob.org/tips/split/Hair-loss-with-medication.html]"
7530,No meds.
7531,I need my meds but I need sex too.
7532,"She had been through quite a list of different medicines combinations, and feels like their is nothing left to try."
7533,"I'm also on some temporary non-related medication as well, that I take on mornings and evenings."
7534,"Just now when I was getting my other meds (it's evening over here) I noticed right after swallowing, that damn, that was Escitalopram and not the other stuff."
7535,"Oh yeah, and the escitalopram has no effect with my other meds, so that isn't a worry, even with a bigger dose."
7536,I can't get medication until I am 18 because the place I have to go to is terrible and have a bad reputation.
7537,"I ended up telling him about my breakdown that happened a year or so back and how I'm on meds, etc."
7538,I have no idea what they are going to think of my self-medication.
7539,"After years of trial and error, i found a medication that makes things tolerable."
7540,"But when i forget to take my medication and the feelings come back, even though i know its all in my head, its a constant struggle to keep reminding myself that its not real."
7541,I'm starting to get really tired of taking all this medication.
7542,"I used to push through my anxiety, refuse the medication and I still felt successful, as if I was actually getting closer to leaving home."
7543,I'm scared to try medication because I don't want to lose my sex drive.
7544,He left to go back home where his medical is and so the past two weeks he's been working on finding the right medication and what's causing it.
7545,"Since he's left he talks much more, found out what has caused it, and at least got a medicine to tame the attacks when they happen."
7546,He suggested anxiety medicine and I called my mother who wanted nothing to do with the conversation.
7547,She belittled me by going on medication and called them happy pills and my father said if I want to live in la-la land than go right ahead.
7548,"I am taking a leave from work to focus on figuring out my medication, therapy, and the direction I need to go after this."
7549,meds diazepam 5mg.
7550,When did you say enough is enough and go for meds?
7551,"However, I'm beginning to think I need a change in meds."
7552,"I didn't really expect it to instantly cure my troubles or anything, but the medication only really ever took the edge off."
7553,I'm willing to try whichever meds my psychiatrist recommends and will stick with whichever one helps me!
7554,The anemia test came back negative and he sent me home with anxiety medicine.
7555,The medicine made me sleepy and I felt better.
7556,I spent a small amount of time working on school work and then began reading about a new medication my doctor had given me.
7557,I am not on any medications currently and am going to a psychiatrist on Friday.
7558,Does anyone have any suggestions on medication or other options?
7559,"I developed anxiety attacks about two years ago after an isolated incident, then created a plan on how to address and eliminate it that included mindfulness meditation, some therapy (not super helpful), confronting triggers in controlled doses, and a very low dose of anti-anxiety meds that worked WONDERS."
7560,I've been off meds for quite awhile now and I have all kinds of mental coping strategies in place for my occasional anxiety attack/outbreak.
7561,I've been recommending the anti-anxiety meds to her since the day I started them.
7562,She continues to suffer through her anxiety because she is paranoid of becoming dependent on the meds if she even tries them once.
7563,"I feel like she's just suffering for no reason, and the intensity of her anxiety prevents her from feeling like she could ever have any control over it - meds would eliminate the worst of her attacks in a way that would enable her to work on a recovery plan like I did."
7564,All she hears is meds.
7565,"""But I don't want to be on meds."""
7566,"**tl;dr: My friend has mostly irrational reasons to not try medication therapy for her debilitating anxiety attacks, and I don't know how to deal with it other than just let her keep suffering."
7567,"So, ever since I was a kid, I have suffered with my nerves, which lead to numerous doctors saying I had mild anxiety disorders and I have heard different doctors diagnose different types, (sometimes recommended medication, to which I have refused several times in my life as I worried I would become dependant on them)."
7568,"Being suffering from massive anxiety and panic attacks since I was 10, been benzo (xanax) addict for 2 years, I took 6mg-10mg a day, managed to quit somehow, have tried every AD, every anti-anxiety drug, every legal and non legal drug (self-medication), sports, counsellings, destroying my life, trying to enjoy my life - tried everything, have been trying to get help all my life from psychiatrists - finally they described me Paxil (no idea why no one did it before, I have tried like 30 of them)


Didn't think about it anything, why not try, nothing to lose."
7569,"I already take other meds, but they kind of just keep me alive, I'm still chasing quality of life..."
7570,"I had a terrible experience with an SSRI in the recent past, which has made me quite nervous about trying to add new medications to the mix."
7571,"I've never taken meds and I don't really want to, I really want a natural cure for this... (Yep, I don't want to see a doctor and am scared of med side effects)."
7572,Should I wait a bit longer or go to the doctor and try to get on medicine?
7573,I went to my doctors the Thursday before last and went back on medication (Pristiq 50mg).
7574,"As I grew older I became more frustrated and disillusioned with pandering therapists and the ever-changing cocktail of meds I was prescribed, which never seemed to do me any good."
7575,I did not anticipate being anxious about actually tapering off the meds.
7576,I felt like I had no other option than to finally see my doctor and get some medication.
7577,I really need to take this medication in hopes of getting better but how can I if I cause myself endless worry from taking the medication itself?
7578,I need to get over it though so I can let the medication help me.
7579,"I mainly have health anxiety, so I fear that somehow the medication will make me sick, give me headaches, make me too dizzy to drive, etc."
7580,How do I get over this fear so I can benefit from my medication?
7581,Is it a side effect of stopping taking meds that will go away on its own?
7582,"I usually take Kolonopin (as well as a barrage of other meds) to manage my symptoms, but my medication has lapsed considerably in the past few months."
7583,I'm really trying to deal with my OCD and anxiety without medicine.
7584,"In June, I went to my local health clinic and explained that I pretty much feel like shit and had researched meds and felt that Xanax would be a good solution for me."
7585,"I was not taking it three times a day, but refilled my prescription prior to running out because I have a history of not having insurance and I wanted to stockpile meds..... (just kind of a weird thing, but I was afraid of running out I guess) 

After three months of refills, I had a situation where the pharmacy and health clinic were both saying I needed to check with the other one to see why my prescription wasn't being refilled."
7586,She (along with another PCP) both explained that Xanax can be very addictive and it's not a medication that they prescribe.
7587,I called prior to going to see if it was a medication they prescribe.
7588,"She agreed that it was not a medication that she prescribes and that ""they"" are learning more about it and it's not a good option."
7589,"So, now I've asked three different doctors for a medication that I genuinely thought helped, but they think is addictive."
7590,"I am embarrassed and in hindsight, pretty pissed off that a doctor would cut me off of a medication that made me feel better without even ever having met me."
7591,Is Xanax not one of the most widely prescribed medications for anxiety in the world?
7592,"I don't even know what it is, and I don't like the idea of taking medicine every single day, regardless of circumstances."
7593,but how can my file be closed if my meds are still being prescribed?!
7594,"there must be a record of me somewhere, they aren't just going to dole out psychoactive meds to anyone... i felt like this doctor was going to be there when i needed help."
7595,"i feel abandoned &amp; like no one cares...

&amp; what truly baffles me is that there is even a system in place that could have someone prescribed meds from a distance but not be allowed to see the doctor prescribing them."
7596,"what if they suddenly ""delete"" my file &amp; i can no longer get my meds?"
7597,Have any of you had similar symptoms and did any medication help you?
7598,"What’s frustrating is I show a mask of a calm co-worker and I almost never seem stressed in person (except the few times I’ve been caught “sleeping” when I was actually having anxiety attacks), and I’m more lively due to the medication, so my bosses think I'm perfectly fine and keep lighting the pressure on me."
7599,Both of them became self-destructively impulsive after starting their medication.
7600,What if medication doesn't work?
7601,"I was wondering about the experiences any of you have had with the following:

1) If you were afraid of starting medicine for your disorder, what finally made you decide to take it?"
7602,"2) Have you ever experienced stigma or resistance to taking medicine (even though you wanted to or felt like it helped you) from a partner, spouse, family-member, or friend?"
7603,"So yes I am mentally ill, but I do take my prescribed medications."
7604,"Before I even start I might as well let you all know that I don't get panic attacks, I'm not on any medication and I get by pretty well day-to-day."
7605,I've tried medication before.
7606,Luckily medication and therapy has helped with a lot of that.. except now I carry scissors and nail clippers everywhere.
7607,I made the decision that I hadn't wanted to reach the point of: I was going to get on meds within the next month.
7608,"I'm afraid I can't handle being off my medication, but I also can't handle gaining all that weight again."
7609,I'm waiting to be put on stronger medication because Citalopram isn't working at all.
7610,Is there anything you think I can do to work through it or will it never go away as long as I'm on medication?
7611,I was put on medication at one point but stopped taking it.
7612,She's a regular family medicine doctor.
7613,"My age is 23, male , I don't know what type of anxiety or if i really have anxiety at all, not on meds, U.S., not sure for insurance."
7614,What what just happened as not happened for a year on meds.
7615,I really don't want to become reliant on any sort of medication.
7616,I don't know... this is my first time being on any type of medication.
7617,She's taking meds once a day.
7618,I sought out some therapy and was medicated until I learned to control my severe panic attacks without the meds.
7619,"While dealing with the causes and symptoms of crippling anxiety and depression is very subjective, there are a few things that I have found which *really* helped me alongside prescribed medication (I am on Sertraline and Propranolol);

* Sleep - for me, regardless of medication, a lack of sleep is a major, major trigger."
7620,* medication - oh lordy - I  can only speak from experience with SSRI's but holymoly dont miss a dose or fiddle with dosages.
7621,"I've been doing really well lately because I have been in consistent therapy for a year now, and I'm finally on meds that actually make a difference."
7622,"When I was a kid I was diagnosed with some sort of anxiety and had panic attacks, and I took medication for it for years."
7623,Maybe it's an infection or something I need prescription medicine for?
7624,She told me to suck on a cough drop if allergy medication wasn't working.
7625,I also told her I was taking allergy medicine every day and I didn't think it would be allergies.
7626,I would really like to avoid medication.
7627,I wanted to get on some type of medicine to control my anxiety and hopefully help if I became depressed while taking my MS medicine (depression is a very common side effect of interferons).
7628,I have an appointment on Saturday and I'm not sure what I should say to get off of this medicine.
7629,and this medicine makes me want to kill someone.
7630,"This is a difficult time for me and I'm going to be doing my first injection of MS medication next week, which could potentially cause a slew of side effects."
7631,"I really don't want to be dealing with these horrible medicines, but I would like to stay on the Ativan (just to have for anxiety emergencies, even)."
7632,"I have a feeling I had bad reactions to the Lexapro and Wellbutrin because I'm not actually depressed right now, I'm just anxious - but I also seem very sensitive to medication."
7633,What medicine do you think she will try next?
7634,Personally I'm not really into psych medications.
7635,I have 1 klonopin left (i got from a trip to the ER heart rate related) from now until my medication appointment next Friday.
7636,I'm going back on some form of medicine because this is ridiculous.
7637,"I had a really odd reaction, and the meds made me manic."
7638,"I'm worried as to where to turn next, as without the meds I'm anxious, but with them I'm manic."
7639,"I have a numb spot that comes and goes in the middle of my forehead, my chest feels unusually tight all the time, I've have had constant high blood pressure for about 6 months and was given medication."
7640,I feel like they're experimenting with me :/ These mental medications have just seemed make my emotions all wonky without lessening the feeling I have.
7641,What do you use when it comes to cough/cold meds?
7642,Experiences with other medications for treating anxiety/OCD are also appreciated.
7643,I take medication for it and it's normally not a big deal.
7644,"In December i was on a medicine designed to deal with urinary issues but it made me feel like shit, then I began having like weakness in my muscles and shakes sort of, I've always been shaky and not very steady with my hands."
7645,Turns out I had low vitamin D which lack of leads to muscle problems but Ive been on meds to give me D for two months and somehow its gotten worse.
7646,"Atm, no meds, and I feel silly seeking professional help for something that is not an issue at the moment for the most part."
7647,My mom also suffers from anxiety issues and thinks I should get on some sort of anti anxiety medication.
7648,"That being said, I'm not sure whether I want to try any medications."
7649,Has anyone else had a horrible experience with a medication they usually have no problem with?
7650,1st one)This was the worst one oflot all advice he gave was eat more medicine he increased my dosage randomly.
7651,My mother flew into a rage when she heard about that so my treatment stopped completely.. until we decided to go to him again he give some miracle pills idk i felt like i was flying i was ridiculously active and positive but what's this medication killed my appetite completely i couldn't even take 1 biscuit with a little coffee i would vomit.
7652,"So, today I got some lorazepam, first time ever using meds, so it's been the only thing to help."
7653,"(Side note: in my country you can get virtually 99% medication without any prescription, its not even illegal.)"
7654,Like before I started taking any medications.
7655,I wondered whether anyone has experience with these methods (either with or without CBT and medication) and whether or not you felt any relief.
7656,Do meds genuinely help?
7657,I feel like if I take meds I won't really be solving the problem at hand and instead I'd be taking the easy way out.
7658,"Also, how do meds make you feel?"
7659,I've tried anti anxiety medications but none have really worked.
7660,"Edit:  
A few details about me, in case that helps  
18 years old, male, and I do not take medication for anxiety"
7661,"I'm wondering if the medicine can help my sex drive, or hurt it even more."
7662,I have been having trouble finding and securing an appointment with someone who can monitor my meds.
7663,"Time, therapy and meds have made me learn how to deal with the stress so it doesn't generally boil over into anxiety."
7664,I don't plan on discontinuing this medication again.
7665,"Put on a rainbow of medication, most recently zoloft."
7666,Refused to take medication for fear of weight gain.
7667,"I have an appointment with a psychiatrist next friday, but I'm scared the meds he gives me will make me gain weight."
7668,The only medicine that has ever helped is Klonopin..cbt and other medicines all failed.
7669,With certain medication I can minimize those attacks to a liveable center.
7670,"I talked to the pharmacist and he told me about st john's worts medication--not sure if it's supposed to help, but thought I'd give it a try."
7671,"I'm off meds and without psychotherapy for over a year, I have to wait about a year to test my ears or pay money (hoooray our ""free"" healthcare!)"
7672,I have been on many medications over the years.
7673,Therapists and meds have not helped or made things worse.
7674,"I'm a little aprehensive about medication, but when I started to panic last night I took a pill and it did help within 30 minutes."
7675,Now I'm worried that I'll still panic at work... even with the medication.
7676,"And my meds...and so I wait for them to kick in and work, to remove these thoughts for now and wait...wait for the storms of life to return and to go through this again."
7677,"Will think I'm seeking drugs to abuse or sell and then I'll never be able to get any medicine to help me 

I've tried Zoloft and it almost killed me, Prozac which helped with my PMDD before I got on birth control but is useless for anxiety, and BuSpar which literally did nothing."
7678,Most other medicines make me panic just when I think about the name because I heard them when I was being abused.
7679,I feel like if I take those medicines then I'll be abused again.
7680,"Like, even I know that I need another medicine with klonopin because you can't take it all the time, but just the names are so terrifying and even thinking them makes me want to hide and cry."
7681,Maybe I could find a list online of all the medicines and cross out the scary ones for the doctor...
7682,"As far as medications go, I have tried almost all of the SSRIs and SNRIs, multiple times."
7683,"I've been on medication for about 4 years now and it has helped a good bit, but recently I have been having some issues."
7684,"My meds allow me to hang out with friends and do somewhat normal things, but when it comes to going to a party or doing anything with a lot of people I can't do it."
7685,Should I talk to my doctor and increase my meds again?
7686,I thought maybe the medicine was actually the cause of the problem so I slowly stepped my dose to .25mg 2x/day which seems to have relieved some of the issue...but I'm not sure if that's a direct cause and effect.
7687,Anyone experienced something similar or have any more knowledge about the meds?
7688,Anyone have suggestions for medication combos that work well for panic attacks (mostly at night)?
7689,I'm not currently on any medication because they all ruined my already horrible sleep schedule.
7690,"Therefore, I can't go to a psychiatrist to get actual proper treatment/medication."
7691,"I need medication now so I can get rid of the anxiety enough to get a job, which will in turn give me my own health insurance where I can get the proper help I need."
7692,How much of the previous paragraph can I tell the doctor so that I get the medication and not have to go to a psychiatrist?
7693,"Any good medication you guys know of that isn't addictive, acts fast and is helpful for anxiety?"
7694,"I am not on any medication and never have been, nor have I ever taken any drugs."
7695,I fear that I might have to go on meds in order to rectify this.
7696,"For a long time I battled hearing that Anxiety was a mental illness, to me when I hear that term I think of people in institutions that require daily dosing of heavy duty medication."
7697,I went to the doctor who prescribed me medication for my acid reflux.
7698,"Yes, the allergy medicine."
7699,I asked her if she really meant the allergy medication and she asked me what I thought hydroxyzine was.
7700,Had a panic attack because I had just taken a medication and had flashes back to when I've had bad side effects from medications.
7701,I've always been sheltered by my mother who also has terrible anxiety even worse since she's on meds for it .
7702,Question 3: What ways do you cope and not have to take medications ?
7703,"( I'm very against prescription medications , especially for anxiety as in some cases it makes people different ) 

Question 4: Does physical and mental exercise really help with anxiety ?"
7704,"I completely understand, I tried 2 counselors, 1 psychiatrist, and countless medications (prescribed and illicit) to no avail."
7705,"So I thought to myself maybe it wasn't working and decided to talk to pdoc about switching medications

He recommended Cymbalta as the next choice so I tapered down to 10 mg Lexapro by cutting my pills in half as stated by doctor."
7706,I've been getting worked up constantly and I've decided I'm going to try medication.
7707,"I'm the last person who'd want to take meds, but I'm to the point now where I'm COMPLETELY fed up."
7708,"I've taken some unused pain-meds from cabinets in my house before when I just needed to feel ok for a few hours, but its not worth the shame I felt afterwards."
7709,"And I don't want to take medication I just want to lose weight and find peace, and be happy, and have a life, anxiety free..."
7710,"My blood pressure came back a bit high (because I was nervous about seeing a new doctor) and despite my efforts to explain that I really needed help, the doctor said my anxiety was BECAUSE of my blood pressure and prescribed high blood pressure meds!!"
7711,"I didn't take them, because if he had bothered listening, most of my family has issues with blood pressure meds."
7712,"(I'm guessing the doctor would be the proper person to talk to about this, but I'm completely uninformed about the medications that exist.)"
7713,"I'm on medication (150mg Wellbutrin &amp; 50mg Zoloft) and have a therapist, and while I'm definitely on the right track to getting better, I still have my issues."
7714,"I keep trying things like medication and attempting to convince myself I'll be okay, but it never works."
7715,i've kissed a girl when i was about 12. i've suffered some severe social anxiety/depression for a number of years and got to councilling/been on meds and yet i'm still terrified.
7716,"I know medication cannot be the only answer, but I think I am in an extreme state of anxiety lately, and I feel Ive tried every non medicinal way I know of with no relief."
7717,"I guess my very long winded question is, what should i do/what can i say to my family physician to get him to see that anxiety medication would benefit me."
7718,TL;DR:  what should i do/what can i say to my family physician to get him to see that anxiety medication would benefit me.
7719,"Therapists, medications, doctors, not to mention the travel involved, fuck."
7720,"I am looking to consult with my doctor tomorrow about medication, and I am interested to know what you are taking and how well it has worked for you."
7721,I'm finally pursuing medication (as an adjunct to the CBT and meditation I'm already doing).
7722,"This situation is not the sole reason for my wanting to go on meds - the anxiety affects other areas of my life too, just happens most pervasively with my love relationship."
7723,"Before I ask a non-psychiatrist about medication, is there anything I should keep in mind?"
7724,Specific meds I should ask about?
7725,I've tried different medications and once took way too many and my family had a hard time waking me up on the airplane.
7726,"Regarding medication, I was on Lexapro of varying dosages from the age of fifteen until last December – I had tapered down to 5 mg already, but I couldn't afford it any longer once I turned 26 and was no longer on my father's insurance."
7727,"I believe I need to get on some kind of anti-anxiety medication, but that is such a daunting prospect not just because of the issues of doctors and finances, but because of how much trial and error it might take to find something that works."
7728,"Hopefully, I can work on getting medication through them, or they can help me find someone who can get me started on that."
7729,I would like to hear about your experiences with different types of medications that can me overcome social anxiety/depression/bipolar disorders.
7730,I am scared to try any medications because I heard a number of bad stories particularly when it comes to antidepressants.
7731,"I'm not totally sure if this is a side effect from switching medications, but I didn't have this problem on my last meds, so I'm assuming."
7732,Is it possible for me to get medication in my financial situation?
7733,I did it because I ran out of meds and money to refill them.
7734,"I'm very weary about medications as the side effects always freak me out, especially Seroquel."
7735,I've had a massive headache for the past 2 weeks that hasn't gone away and I read that this medication can cause migraines.
7736,"I am worried he will think I am looking for medication and to get signed off work,  which I am not."
7737,"So yeah, just wanting to ask what medications you take for anxiety?"
7738,"So, redditors who are and have been on meds...do you really think the breathing room the drugs give you are worth the side effects and the fact that your brain now needs drugs to function?"
7739,"Meanwhile, though my counselling is covered by the county health system until January, medication would not be."
7740,"And at this point, I feel that medication is an absolute necessity."
7741,It would be easier to get medication.
7742,I want to know if medication would help me make that final push into the no more anxiety at all.
7743,Has anyone else lost their appetite while on medication?
7744,"It's not just anxiety medication I need, I want to try a new antidepressant again(for the 4th time)."
7745,"I know I want a low dose anxiety medication until I've had more counseling, do I just state that blatantly?"
7746,What can I expect with the new medication?
7747,He is completely against going to a psychiatrist on a regular basis and refuses to be on any medication.
7748,"But there really is no time for therapy or money for medication, nothing."
7749,I was put on some meds and have started a bit of therapy but have yet to get far.
7750,"I have to leave for an appointment in 2 hours to the city haven't slept to see a psychiatrist for medication, I have ADD aswell and need to get a script filled to help me get through uni and hopefully make me feel better, I'm scared that its going to make my anxiety worse."
7751,How long should I give the citalopram before I think about upping the dose or trying to new medication?
7752,"I just feel a lot of guilt because I had beaten anxiety without medication, and now I'm in this hole again."
7753,"But when I think about my anxiety, I get this overwhelming fear about my need for the medication."
7754,I get really worried that 20mg is alot and one day the medicine might lose it's effectiveness on me and I won't be able to be prescribed more.
7755,"Been through benzos, SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, AAP, and the meds don't get me where I need to be."
7756,"I feel like such an utter failure when I have to take emergency meds for it, or I have to run out of the classroom because the room is spinning, or I have to leave my groceries in the middle of the store and cry in my car."
7757,do they often prescribe medication right away or therapy?
7758,Other medications: 30mg Paxil
7759,"The medicine is helping, but I'm still feeling the thrawls of the episode."
7760,"Fast forward to now, years of anxiety treatment and different medication regimens and a stay at a psyche ward after I was diagnosed with depression."
7761,After a few months I got off the meds altogether.
7762,"She gave me a prescription for situational Xanax, but said that if I still feel I need it in a month, she thinks I should be on a daily medication."
7763,I'm really just wondering what anyone else's experiences are with different medications.
7764,The peace and satisfaction they bloomed in me was better than any medicine I can imagine.
7765,"Note: When my anxiety medication wears off, I now GET anxiety immediately."
7766,After that I decided I didn't want to depend on the medication any more and started working with a Psychologist on my anxiety.
7767,I started it 14 days ago and I felt like it is the right medication to help me quit lorazepam completely.
7768,Usually my medicine helps me more quickly than that but I think it was only partially responsible.
7769,I am beginning to think meds are the way to go.
7770,The reason I am considering meds is because it is the only option I have yet to try.
7771,"I work in a somewhat medical field (pharmacy), and every day I have people coming in for all sorts of dementia, cancer, heart, brain, you name it medications, adult diapers, and the likes."
7772,"And every day at least one person ends up telling me after picking up their meds ""don't get old, it sucks""."
7773,I'm having a little freakout now because I'm nowhere near a hospital or anywhere I can get medication to kill the virus.
7774,Last year I got off a lot of medication because my insurance ran out and I couldn't afford to pay for it anymore.
7775,TLDR; don't know if my anxiety is enough to need therapy/medicine.
7776,"One of my sisters, my mother, my godmother have all suffered from depressions and are on anti-depressant medication."
7777,"She immediately asked how I felt about medication and due to personal experience I am somewhat opposed to it, so she gave me a prescription for counseling and told me to find someone."
7778,"this is causing a strain in my relationship with my boyfriend, he's always telling me i need to see my doctor again or need new medicine, (i do have an appointment in a couple of days.)"
7779,It may be a strange thing but I don't want to take any type of medication because frankly I wouldn't even remember to take it daily.
7780,"Edit: 

I spoke with my doctor about dealing with anxiety with out medication."
7781,(guess I'm all messed up now...) I still have not taken any medication as I am stubborn.
7782,I got through it with no medication (SSRIs) that may make you dependent &amp; sometimes have weird side effects.
7783,"Some people need meds and that works perfect for them and all the power to them, but I made the choice to take the long road of no meds for my crutch (except for .1 milligrams of blood pressure medication to help me get better sleep) and finally I've been attack free for over a month now... which is incredible."
7784,"They don't believe using meds for depression or anxiety is the ""right"" way, because I should just pray for the problem to go away."
7785,"They also believe that any medication will have a bad side effect, so I should just not even consider it."
7786,"For any of you taking meds, is it helping you, and are these side effects enough to deter you?"
7787,"I don't believe there would be meds if they were really that bad, right?"
7788,""", I mean they will let me go to a doctor to have them decide if I need meds or not, but not without a guilt trip and practically implying that the problem comes from me and I should (again) begin relying on God."
7789,She wasn't even qualified to prescribe meds.
7790,"15 years after it first developed I went to a dermatologist and am now on two different medications, guess what?"
7791,I really hope it's not something really serious because I don't want her to be given anti-psychotic medication because the side effects sound horrible.
7792,Sure I take meds and they seem to work for the most part.
7793,What are the potential side effects of i guess any sort of medication i would take if i opted to do so?
7794,I think I need to be on some type of medication.
7795,I tried other meds like propranolol and buspirone but they didn't do much.
7796,I know of a medication that works wonders for me - the problem is my doctor won't prescribe it to me.
7797,"I don't like the idea of being on mind altering medication like that permanently, and since I don't feel like this all the time, don't think its necessary for me."
7798,I hate taking new medication because I hate side effects... particularly in regards to my stomach :\  But the idea of not constantly feeling like shit or like I'm hung over 24/7 sounds very appealing.
7799,"I've been seeing doctors, psychiatrists, multiple medications over the past four months, but I cannot shake my self harming or panic attacks away."
7800,"We attempted some medication, but it wasn't really effective."
7801,"I quickly made an appointment with a psychiatrist and counselor, and was put on a low dose of meds."
7802,"After a couple of weeks, I started feeling even more anxious, so I decided to stop taking them (I've always been skeptical of medication, so that didn't help)."
7803,"When can I expect to feel better again, assuming that I resume my meds at ~10 a.m.?"
7804,Is medication the answer or can i learn to stop overthinking?
7805,"I don't know what to do anymore - the medication was ineffective, my therapist eventually ended my sessions because, in her words, ""there's nothing more I can teach you, all you can do now is apply what you've learned to situations."""
7806,I finally feel out of options and I am ready to give medication a try.
7807,"I want off of these meds,  but I don't know if I'd be able to handle coming off."
7808,"I've never gone to therapy, seen a medical professional, nor taken any medications for it."
7809,With no help from medication or therapy.... i'm so proud of myself.
7810,"I was thinking about asking my gp for medication, but at the same time I am little bit afraid because of ""getting used to the drug"" and other outcomes."
7811,"Besides taking my medicines, is there any other things I can do to avoid having a major anxiety attack if I choose to fly?"
7812,"The medicine has successfully calmed me down a bit, but it sucks to sit in a family that hates you."
7813,I'm not on any medication although I have Klonopin for emergencies.
7814,"Honestly, with the combination of meds and therapy and attending NA meetings (I used to have terrible means of dealing with my anxiety) I've been so much better...almost my old self - which is this crazy, not shy, quick and clever girl...but all these changes are happening."
7815,On a new medication that makes me nauseous.
7816,I'd like to start by giving you an example of what happens to me when it comes to my anxiety issues and what medication I have been given by the doctor.
7817,I was wondering if anyone out there takes medication for their Depression and/or Anxiety and how it made them feel and whether they had to be placed on a stronger or weaker dosage?
7818,"While I was out with her my the medication started to come down, I started to feel extremely anxious while I was sitting down, I started shaking and could not focus on my conversation with her which was really bothering me because normally I am very good at making conversation."
7819,I told my grandma (I live with her) what happened and asked her to feel my heart because I thought it was the medication that made me feel so anxious.
7820,"She said ""oh no that's not good, your heart is racing"" (it was about 90BPM resting and my blood pressure was slightly higher than normal) I immediately began to freak out even more thinking that the medication was gonna give me a heart attack or something."
7821,The funny thing was this all started happening 7-8 hours after I took the meds so I doubt they were even in my system still.
7822,As the title says I'm (18/f) about to start these medications for some severe anxiety/depression I've been having.
7823,"Now, I've never taken either one of these medications or any like it."
7824,I have never had this reaction with the Ativan ( I know certian meds do different things with different people) I was just wondering if anyone here has had a bad reaction with the clona?
7825,"I'm also not on any medication for my anxiety, and am wondering how you guys calm yourselves down without pills."
7826,"That pill was about 6 hours ago, and it's the first allergy medication I took orally since 1 month ago."
7827,"Also, why the hell did my psychiatrist tell me the meds she prescribed for my panic attacks&amp;insomnia are sold on the street as a date rape drug?"
7828,#1 Do drugs/medication help?
7829,Also tried ADHD meds like Adderall and it seems to work too.
7830,I have an appointment on Tuesday with my doctor to discuss options as far as meds and possible therapy.
7831,Or what if I end up putting myself and my baby in danger while I'm pregnant by going off medication for nine months?
7832,I am not one of those people who can manage without medicine.
7833,"At my last Dr visit, I told him my medication still isn't doing anything (on Cipralex, for just over 3 months now)."
7834,"(I've tried meds and therapy, but my oh so clever brain can still tell me all the scenarios of how she doesn't like me, or what not)."
7835,"My son's father has had anxiety since I met him six years ago, he's gone to meetings, therapy and is on medication and still has anxiety which causes him to sometimes not see our son for months at a time."
7836,"Neither do the calm-down meds, so this is in my brain."
7837,I'm worried that my meds aren't working but my doctor seems hesitant to change my antidepressant.
7838,"* Ativan 0.5 mg for emergencies

I also take medication for ADHD which can cause an increase in anxiety but it's actually helped me more than anything else."
7839,I'm really tired of all this and I know it can take a while to find the right medication or for the right medication to work but I just don't feel like the Lexapro is helping.
7840,I'm afraid of medicine because in the past I had a bad drug interaction and it made matters worse.
7841,But during my last two flights the medication had adverse effects and I've been told to stop it and try flying without taking one.
7842,So I just started seeing a psychologist about my anxiety problems and I'm not sure how to go about getting new medication or stick with the same ones.
7843,Have any of these meds worked for you guys?
7844,Any recommendations on any different meds that have worked for you?
7845,"I start noticing that my heart rate is irregular, and that freaks me out, and I literally believe that the medication will kill me while I sleep."
7846,"Could it really be a side-effect of the medication, or is just all in my head?"
7847,"Ive never seen a doctor or taken medication, yet ive had panic attacks seemingly at random or feelings of nervousness and shaking that are extremely hard to tame."
7848,"Its been interfering with my life lately (extreme nervousness, paranoia, violent mood swings, fits of nervous energy revolving around meaningless things, etc) yet I dont feel as though I should get medication."
7849,"I am on medication and I avoid possible triggers, but every night like clockwork, I start getting that really anxious feeling like things aren't quite right or are about to go south."
7850,"My name is Mark, and me and a group of 3 friends (all with a heavy background in psychology, medicine and/or motivational speaking) have decided to launch a portal devoted entirely to Depression."
7851,"- Daily news posts with easy-to-understand (""for dummies"") explanations of what the latest research on depression and depression medication-related topics are saying."
7852,My doctor at the time (this was on a military base if that affects anything) prescribed me two medicines he claimed worked well together.
7853,"He prescriped Risperidone and another medication, I forget what."
7854,"I was impressed, and glad to get meds to help."
7855,Why couldn't I find anywhere online that said this medicine could be used for anxiety attacks?
7856,"But on the medicine, I always heard a whooshing in my ears, and felt a little disconnected from the scene, though not entirely far away like before."
7857,"edit: tl;dr Doctor seemed to know what he was talking about, but prescribed me medicine used to treat bipolor disorder and schizophrenia, and medicine for elderly who had suffered heart attacks and I'm wondering if that's normal/a good idea."
7858,My desperation and stubbornness led me to self medication - I broke my collar bone when I was around 17 and was put on opiates.
7859,"I know I need to see a therapist again, but I'm starting to consider that I may need to start thinking about medication options as well."
7860,"I would like some advice about therapy, or medication, or just any tips or tricks."
7861,"Honestly after 2 months the Buspar wasn't doing anything and was just making me extremely tired all the time so I stopped taking the Buspar, but continued taking my ADHD meds."
7862,"Its never going to go away, but with medication, talking about it openly and therapy."
7863,"I've been intermittently going to therapy and taking medications for just over two years now, and the medication(Zoloft) has helped me greatly."
7864,"Because of this, he's been endlessly helpful in keeping me on my feet while I struggled through coming to terms with my anxiety and the meds."
7865,"I don't drop all of my problems on him, and I try to keep my unnecessary worrying to a minimum when around, but I do disclose to him my medication changes, anything I consider a serious problem or something I absolutely need to talk through, or other important issues."
7866,I haven't talked to her in a year since I tried and failed to takr Zoloft after I hallucinated from the medication.
7867,Currently I have the cost of my medication covered under my father's insurance.
7868,"They are also skeptical of medication in general (they're into the whole ""natural"" supplement thing)."
7869,"He's on medication for it (I'm not 100% sure what it is), and also has a script for Lorazapam that he'll take if he feels a panic attack coming on (happens a couple times a year)."
7870,"His family's first line of defense has always been medication, which angers me to no end."
7871,"But it's frustrating for me to watch this happen to him, and his first resort is medication without even considering other alternatives like therapy or other lifestyle changes."
7872,"Because of the medications I am on, I cannot drink alcohol."
7873,I'm scared someone won't accept me or reject me because I might have to be on medications for the rest of my life.
7874,"I am currently on lithium to stabilize my mood, though I am on nothing for my anxiety currently (I'm open to medications, obviously, but benzos and shit scare me)."
7875,"I have tried meds in the past, but nothing really worked."
7876,What is the process to get on anxiety meds?
7877,I would appreciate any advice or experiences you have had with anxiety medication.
7878,I'm scared to take prescription medications so I was looking for something more natural.
7879,I need some expertise from anyone that has been on Anxiety medication.
7880,"I ran out last week, and so missed about five days of medication."
7881,"I'm seriously considering going off my meds for a week or so just to get some perspective, but I worry how that might effect my job performance."
7882,"I just recently discovered I can do the job, while on my meds, without developing a major headache, so if I need to take them later in the day that works too."
7883,"I don't know if I just need to wait for the 150mg to take effect, or wait until my triggers all die down, or if I need to advocate for a new medication regimen."
7884,"Given that I haven't had an attack in a year, I'm happy with my progress, especially considering I've made all this progress with no medication, just me, a journal, and determination."
7885,"I went to the doctor, got on meds.."
7886,"Months later, meds started giving me hives.."
7887,In the past two weeks I have been in the ER from a panic attack and been officially put on medicine to help get my anxiety back under control.
7888,"It should just be an easy first step before I consider long term things like therapy and medication, but I can't bring myself to go!"
7889,"Biomedicine and Pfeiffer Test (to check for chemical imbalances, vitamin deficiencies etc) is what my mum is urging me to try (her friend's daughter had a lot of success, she was previously always dizzy, nauseous, fainting, couldn't hold down a job, dropped out of highschool, now she's doing very well)."
7890,"For the most part, I've been really careful to recognize my triggers, breathe, do something nice for myself, deal with it no meds needed."
7891,( along with counselling ) I am pretty nervous about taking this as the only medication I have taken Ativan.
7892,"I am a 24 (f) 

EDIT: Female users of this medicine who are also on birth control, how did you see it effect your sex drive?"
7893,"Luckily, I've been fortunate enough to get some medication that at least quelled my G.A.D."
7894,"When I was anxious all the time I never had an appetite, and I thought that'd be at least somewhat fixed with meds?"
7895,Throughout my time seeing her she has casually mentioned prescribing me medication for anxiety.
7896,"I've been reading a lot about the potential side effects, and I wanted to gather information from others who are on anti-anxiety medications."
7897,My psych added Abilify to my meds.
7898,I have a little question about medications for those who take them.
7899,I still have much of my general anxiety (which has been the main problem) but I feel comforted knowing I didn't have any huge side effects upon starting the meds.
7900,"As I said, I haven't noticed any major changes, but I also know I don't want to get up to something like 60 mg and then notice the medication actually hasn't done anything (or isn't strong enough)."
7901,"Sorry if it made no sense, I took some Ativan a little bit ago (which made me even more anxious until it kicked in because taking medication is stressful or something)."
7902,Do any of you take anxiety meds and depression meds?
7903,"Now I'm afraid to take my depression meds, but really want to because I've been feeling exceptionally down lately."
7904,"I can't afford to see a psychiatrist, but am prescribed these meds through my regular doctor and don't think he'd know what to do."
7905,The only reason he does this for me is because I've taken these meds in the past and they had worked.
7906,"I have some ""emergency"" pills I take when my anxiety is particularly bad and they do a good job of calming me down, but they're not meant to be taken every day or I become reliant on them, so it'd have to be different medication."
7907,I don't want to start taking any meds either (unless it's absolutely necessary).
7908,"I know this sounds ridiculous, probably not to you guys, but lately I've been feeling too nervous to even go see my doctor (I think I'm nervous about it because I want to ask for medication for my anxiety and depression)."
7909,I feel like it would really help if I could just get some medication prescribed to me first so that I can be more comfortable going places/leaving my house - which would ultimately result in me being able to see my doctor and therapist.
7910,I think I need to get some medication from the doctor.
7911,"I don;t want to go into every detail but I have tried it all from medications/therapy/meditation/acupuncture/change in diet/cardiologist and finally the beta blocker I am on now that I thought was finally helping but low and behold, here I am posting another story about how much these symptoms bother me."
7912,I feel helpless since I refuse tryin medication.
7913,In order to get adhd medication my doc has drug tested me and told me to stop cannabis use or she will stop treatment.
7914,"Should I just be like ""I have this symptom, this symptom, and this symptom, I really think some kind of medication would help""?"
7915,"I'm currently not on medication (waiting on a doctor's appointment), so I was wondering..."
7916,"Excluding medication, what sort of activities, exercises, and the like do you guys do to help combat this?"
7917,"When she suggested I get evaluated for some meds, it was like the skies opened up and whatever higher being said ""you're not crazy!"""
7918,I am not taking medication for any(life is complicated and you should all know that by now.
7919,So in my life medication has been ruled out.)
7920,"I've tried so many different medications since my anxiety started, I honestly never expected that I'd be the one asking about them."
7921,"I'm usually very open when it comes to trying and starting new medications, because I know each one works different for every one."
7922,"If I take the Cipralex for a month and then ask for a different medication, am I going to have to start the process over again, or will the Cipralex have prepared my brain (so to speak) to feel the effects of the new drug right away?"
7923,"Having no experience with this kind of medication, and after researching more about the drug, I'm still scared of starting it."
7924,"Does anyone have advice, knowledge, or experience with this kind of medication?"
7925,"Sure, some of that confidence might've come from psychiatric medications, but it's not responsible for all of it."
7926,Have I been using a different medication from a doctor?
7927,"I realize that it's unlikely that will happen to us, since the cat actually had anti-flea medication prior and also because we only found two, but now every time I itch I'm freaking out."
7928,"Other than that, I feel like it is not doing much for everything else and I hate that I feel increased physical anxiety symptoms such as heart jumping, sweating, and last week I almost had a panic attack which I was able to fend off but I hadn't had one in a few weeks so it was strange that I had one when I got on these meds."
7929,"I had posted a while back that I was dealing with my anxiety medication free for a couple of years, but recently I had broken down."
7930,"And lastly a little thing I just learned from my doctor prescribing the medication was that if you have tried to keep everything bottled up and force yourself not to think about it, your body lets out those held up emotions in the forms of dreams."
7931,I'm scared that perhaps my meds interfere more than they help.
7932,"I've worked extensively through therapy, medication, and self-help (exercise, books etc) to gain control of my symptoms, which I have in the sense that they don't run my life like they did in college, but I still find myself very frustrated when I obsess over a certain thought for a day or week at a time, only to have it pushed out and replaced with something different like a revolving door."
7933,I've had anxiety medication prescribed to me before.
7934,I don't take medicine because prior to this incident I generally didn't have anxiety.
7935,I have always lived with anxiety but I think I am finally willing to accept that it is keeping me exhausted and lacking in life so I decided to try meds.
7936,My mother was diagnosed as depressed and took meds and my brother has had a General Anxiety Disorder for a while too.
7937,Not sure if he still takes meds or not.
7938,"I've been in therapy and been on and off medications since then, dropped out of high school, experimented with drugs and alcohol, all that ""cutting loose"" stuff teenagers sometimes do."
7939,"However, I have a fucking stack of medication that doctors have given me over the past few months that I've been afraid to take."
7940,If the meds you are on aren't working try something new.
7941,I have been on medication for 8 years.
7942,edit: I have taken medication for 8 years but it doesn't work.
7943,"My anxiety medication does help, but I did just 'relapse' for the first time since August."
7944,My meds really haven't been working (xanex) and the things I do to cope with my anxiety isn't an option anymore since i'm in a dorm.
7945,Now I am on no medication and have no therapists or councillors.
7946,He refused to give me any medication and instead told me to use herbal remedies.
7947,"To make things more interesting im breastfeeding with no end in sight, so my medication options are limited and most meds are off the table."
7948,"I've had severe anxiety since my earliest memories and have been mainly bounced between celexa and zoloft, but the thought of being on a medication that's not supposed to be used forever makes me wonder if I should just be on nothing?"
7949,"I'm going to be on medication soon for it, but I don't know what I should expect my psychiatrist to prescribe."
7950,"If medication DOES help, how much relief should I realistically expect, because I wasn't able to hold down a job before cause of anxiety?"
7951,"This resulted in me losing my therapist, medication, and everything else keeping me stabilized."
7952,I need to be careful with antidepressants because I'm bipolar and I can't take any blood pressure meds because my blood pressure runs quite low.
7953,"It is fairly controlled by medication, but I have noticed in the last year or so that during the days before my period, when I typically suffer from a little PMS, my anxiety is absolutely compounded."
7954,"I'm willing to talk to my doctor about playing around with my medication, but I also would love to find coping mechanisms that might work in the short term."
7955,This is my second time to attempt to stick to medication.
7956,"The last time I started Prozac, I started at 10 mg and  worked my way up to 20 mg with little to no issues but then I stopped before going up to 40 mg (I was afraid of having to be on medication for a long time)."
7957,I take the medication at night before I go to sleep because I can't afford to be lethargic during the day.
7958,So my question is: am i missing something because as far as i can tell there is nothing special about my case that would warrant such treatment and even if there is it feels unlikely that my doc could have discerned it form the 20 min talk that preceded the diagnosis and the prescription of the medications.
7959,"I'm 31, and it reared its ugly and powerful head when I was about 13 or 14, I've never been on medication but finally decided it was worth a try."
7960,"so ive been going to the doctor lately, and i have been trying to convince her that, along with cognitive behavioral therapy, i should probably get some medication(benzos,beta blockers, anti deppreseants, etc.)."
7961,"i tell my doctor this and all the other stuff that makes me anxious, yet my doctor insists that i dont need medication, i dont understand why she refuses to prescribe me medication."
7962,I'm not on any medicine right now that usually dampens emotions like anti-depressants.
7963,"For the record, I've never been diagnosed with anything nor taken medication."
7964,"I've had this problem before and had medicine, but my mother didn't want me taking it because of possible addiction."
7965,"My ex-girlfriend had me committed a few months back, saying I was suicidal (wasn't) and was mixing meds (I stopped taking all meds now, out of complete fear)."
7966,"Edit: another stupid thing I do is I never keep a lot of pills (pain meds, sleeping pills etc) because I am afraid one day that I will have a stupid impulse/not think clearly and take too many."
7967,And please don't direct me to any medicine or drugs.
7968,what have your experiences been like when reducing (not quitting) meds?
7969,I've been seeing a therapist and taking medication (paxil) for the last ~6 months.
7970,A pretty shocking reminder to get back on my medication.
7971,"Did you know you needed meds, or did someone tell you?"
7972,As of right now I feel like I have two options either quit but I don't have another job lined up or find a shrink and see if meds would help.
7973,"I was diagnosed with severe clinical anxiety when i was 5, due to meds (currently on 75 mg of Zoloft) , its been pretty manageable until now."
7974,Or did it really effect you to the point where you'd never mix alcohol with your anxiety medication ever again?
7975,"I'm planning a trip to the doctor this week to see if I can sort things out with medication or counseling, but is there anything that I could do right now to improve my situation?"
7976,Obviously I want to get the full effects of the medicine.
7977,My boyfriend is prescribed medicine for his anxiety and really thinks I should go talk to someone but I'm afraid to.
7978,I am going to a doctor today to discuss going back on an anxiety medication.
7979,I feel like it has to be some sort of anxiety issue since it pretty much stopped while I was on the medicine.
7980,I think I need to get on meds or something...
7981,"Since I have health anxiety, I hate taking new medications...I'm always afraid of having a reaction, etc."
7982,It works great - better than any medication I've ever been on.
7983,"I've always had this issue with medication.. no matter what pill I take, or what it's for, I just feel like a junkie - I feel like someone who should be able to deal with their particular brain chemistry on their own, and by having to use pharmeceuticals to get through things, I feel.. broken, I guess."
7984,"The previous prescribed medication made the anxiety worse, and the doctors appointment isn't until tomorrow."
7985,I know everyone is different on how they respond to meds.
7986,I think I might be extra sensitive to medicine or just anything I put in my body like foods.
7987,"I've also been completely without medication (alcohol or pills) for long stretches before, and they were without a doubt some of the worst most worrying times in my life."
7988,"I realize he worries about addiction, but my only other options to deal with said anxiety is self medication, and I know it will end up killing me if I continue to drink with the same frequency I used to in order to combat anxiety."
7989,When I brought up seeing a psychiatrist he immediately dismissed the idea and said we should continue trying different antidepressants along with the anxiety medications.
7990,"I feel like the only reason he's trying to push less effective medications on me is because he is worried about the addiction potential, but antidepressants are addictive too!"
7991,Being a functioning human who has to take anxiety medication ?
7992,I truly wish I could stop with the medication (prescribed and self-administered) entirely but without it my entire world comes crashing down.
7993,I am in therapy and on/in-between medications.
7994,"The usual things like medication, physical activity, and counting down from 10 have not helped much."
7995,Anyone else feel this terrible starting on medicine before it (hopefully) got better?
7996,The medication came on pretty strong the first day.
7997,"Two days ago (five days on the medication), I got invited out to the bar by a friend of mine that I absolutely adore."
7998,"Without the meds, I could have _fifteen_ beers, and still never muster the courage to dance with a girl."
7999,These medications are so easy to get addicted to you might not even realize you are until your body wants more than what you're currently taking.
8000,"I told my case manager I would volunteer at an event with her today, but I haven't been able to sleep or eat properly in weeks because of problems with my meds."
8001,"I really don't want to use medication

Thanks!"
8002,"I normally would just as a precaution but I'm really poor right now and can't afford any OTC medications (luckily my prescriptions were free, yay Canada!)."
8003,I'm really excited to finally be trying medication but I'm worried that I'll overreact to negative situations and make myself think the medication isn't working before I even give it a try haha.
8004,"Until I was on medication, it was much more vague what I was having panic attacks about."
8005,"I've gone to doctors, Im taking meds, tried various types and whatnot, and nothing seems to do it."
8006,"It could be lack of sleep and exercise, and these things I want to fix, but I'm wondering if perhaps this medication isn't for me?"
8007,"I'm also not really open to medication, I'm hoping for some natural remedies (and as I'm still breastfeeding medication isn't an option right now anyways)."
8008,"Hi everyone - quick background: diagnosed with ""Anxiety Disorder NOS"" along with depression around 12; PTSD around 15 following an event that happened that year; ongoing issues with social anxiety / panic disorder / generalised anxiety disorder that are more or less under control using just behavioral therapy methods; no medications for depression/anxiety ever."
8009,It started when I began taking sinus medication a lot because of a sinus infection that my doctor ignored and would refuse to help me with.
8010,"Eventually the infection cleared up, I stopped taking the medication, and I went to a different doctor for some blood tests to make sure I didn't do any damage to my liver or kidneys and she said everything was fine (this was just last August)."
8011,"When I get sick I won't take any medication out of fear that it will kill me, so I'm just completely out until I start to feel better naturally."
8012,I used to take medication for it but that just made me want to kill myself more than usual.
8013,"I take no meds, and have received some counselling but refused further help on the basis of I don't have nigh a £100 to spend an hour telling someone I feel fucked up."
8014,"i know its a known side effect of the medication but i dont know if i should tell my psych, i dont want to unless i have to because its kinda embarrassing."
8015,"I attempted to take some medicine that was prescribed to me, though I just am unable to take it."
8016,"Hello fellow anxious people,

I was hoping you could recommend me a good beta blocker medicine and a good normal anti anxiety medicine, in terms of results and with the least side effects."
8017,"I only recently found out about these meds and am feeling quite excited knowing that I could possibly turn my life around :D

I do understand that beta blockers are for a sudden need of anti-anxiety and that they aren't a solution for a completely getting rid of my anxiety issues."
8018,"A few days later, I called my aunt and she explained to me that this issue was completely triggered by my OCD and the only thing that would make it better was getting my meds increased to a higher dose."
8019,This week was my first week back at school after being horribly sick with the flu and after breaking down at John's and getting my meds increased.
8020,I think I might finally have the nerve to call my doctor and set up an appointment to talk to him about trying some kind of medication.
8021,"As for medication I have been taking 20mg of Cipralex for the past 4 years, both to combat the anxiety, but also because of bouts of depression that I have been experiencing."
8022,"Not on and off because of my doctor, I'm just really bad about staying on any medication for more than a few weeks."
8023,"Since I can't stay on my medication consistently enough for it to really work long-term, my doctor has suggested coming off of it completely and replacing it with regular therapy in an attempt to find the root of the problem."
8024,"I decided to go back on meds, but I wanted to try something different so my general practitioner put me on Zoloft generic (Sertraline) at 50mg daily."
8025,The last time I had anxiety meds was as an outpatient from a hospital 4 years ago.
8026,"I've stopped taking any sort of ADD meds because they make me bug out, but I do take them when I need them."
8027,"When I'm on the ADD meds i cant help but remain anxious, it's like I didn't take the meds to study but to just focus on how much of a piece I am."
8028,"also i apologize for my post being headed in so many different directions, I took my ADD meds today but couldn't stop thinking about this."
8029,So I haven't touched my meds today.
8030,I'm still not convinced that I don't have Serotonin Syndrome so I'm avoiding my meds.
8031,I'm not sure if it's a side effect of the medication or just psychosomatic.
8032,"So far I've managed my GAD fairly well without medication (regular counselling, hypnotherapy etc), but after a huge anxiety attack on Monday, with the ripples still affecting me now, I was thinking of asking my Doctor for Valium or something similar for when get an attack of severe acute anxiety."
8033,I've decided not to go on regular medication (SSRIs etc) but I just need something there for the times when things outside my control make it unbearable.
8034,"After seven years of heavy heavy medication and abuse of such, i got myself drug free, and have managed for almost two years now."
8035,I'm not on medication.
8036,No allergy meds in the house.
8037,"I've been seeing a psyc and he thinks a small dose of medication could do the trick but, I would love to try alternatives."
8038,My doctor is deciding not to fill my anxiety medication that I've been on for 5 years and I haven'thad my meds for almost 2 weeks.
8039,The pharmacy won't give me anymore emergency medication I'm panicking.
8040,"Gave me some low dose med to take when the symptoms come up, but I was told that the meds could make to dizzy/lightheaded/drowsy so being anywhere besides at home made me nervous in case I had to take the meds and started feeling those side effects."
8041,I'm just not sure it's anxiety and don't want to start taking the meds for it if that is in fact not what it is.
8042,"Although longterm use of his medications said it might happen, and maybe the hip injections he had today could have caused it."
8043,He's on anti seizure meds and new meds for pain.
8044,This event doesn't help my other medicine that makes me kind of shaky.
8045,"The meds I'm on are helping, but I don't know how to coup with this."
8046,"Off meds for a month or so, no withdrawals and everything seemed awesome, now Im getting terrible anxiety about the littlest things."
8047,I was on them for about 3 years but wanted to try to deal with my problems without meds.
8048,I really dont want to get back on my meds but Im not sure I can last feeling like this.
8049,She said it was a random thing and it was just to check and see if I'm actually using the medication.
8050,"She told me that since she now knows that I have been smoking marijuana that she thinks all of my anxiety/panic problems stem from that and that she was no longer going to give me any more medication because she said, ""it's clearly the marijuana."
8051,I'm going to try my best to find another doctor but here in KY they are so focused on people abusing the medication that they make you go through other things first...some won't even prescribe it at all!
8052,"She knows I have anxiety disorder, and that I take as-needed medication for it, but I just cannot shake these feelings."
8053,"Hey Guys, I have a GAD and even while on medication I am still having a lot of anxiety constantly (Like even typing this)."
8054,"I cannot seem ever come ""off edge"" even with the help of medicine."
8055,I don't have health insurance at the moment so medication and therapy aren't available to me.
8056,"Took some medication from the doctor (non anxiety related) and started feeling ill yesterday, made a point at the doctors not to know the 'see the doctor straightaway' symptoms but after checking that day few matched up."
8057,I am on medication for anxiety/depression and I talk to my psychiatrist regularly.
8058,"I'm in a catch-22, can't make appointments to get medication, can't get to appointments without medication."
8059,So now here's the question most of them say avoid alcohol but I drink not everyday or every week depending how I feel it could be once a month or 5 times a month but not regularly So the day I know I am going to drink I don't take my meds or if I do I take at least 6-8 hours prior is it still bad ??
8060,"I mean we all need to break monotony, So kind of like to do but not too much also I get drunk super fast sometime beer or two and I am tipsy maybe because of the meds idk."
8061,":)

 Also smoke tree once in a while same as drinking depends and I do the same thing with meds either skip or take prior."

8072,I grew up as a single child or a single mother who suffered from extreme anxiety and refused medication.
8073,"From what I have read, most of you seem to have either social anxiety, a specific phobia, or just a *constant* state of anxiety (and possibly depression) that can be managed long term with the use of medications like SSRIs etc."
8074,"After a while he did suggest I start taking anxiety medication, which I do now."

8084,"But back then, I KNEW what was causing my depression and anxiety, I got on meds, I saw a psychiatrist, I got away from the triggers (namely specific people) and everything got better enough for me to get off the meds."
8085,"Sure enough, most things are chalked up to anxiety so I decided to go back on the meds, which help for a little while, but now I've been getting palpitations and heavy beating of my heart with the occasional hit of dizziness."
8086,"The only thing I can think of is that it's another doom circle of anxiety causing a symptom which in turn causes more anxiety - but with each test coming back clear (so far) I would hope that they, in addition to my meds, would stop this :(


At the moment I'm on 10mg of lexapro, but my doc was thinking of switching me to zoloft after my holter monitor results come back (if theyre clear)."

8101,"I do not show the top symptom of feeling as through I'm having a heart attack, as is indicative with panic attacks...No, my symptoms immediately culminated in my intestines and issues there...So it was just a lot of fun, fun, fun...

Now, I am Nearly eleven years into the agoraphobia thing, and after finding medication that was not a narcotic to deal...I am able to cope."
8102,"I am a psychologist and have done a lot with cognitive reframing, so was able to get myself off the medication for the agoraphobia...My physical body thanked me :)  But I have to work at it all the time...

8157,Should I keep taking the meds?
8158,"My thinking is that when I don't have the medicine, the level of anxiety is at a steady high state, so I can't tell how bad things are, because, there is no reference point for comparison."

8246,"Yesterday he explained that he had been prescribed medication for GAD, depersonalisation and obsessive paralysis which may explain his distant state recently, as well as silence when we were discussing things; he explained he couldn’t process what to say to me when I asked him how he felt for me, previously."
8247,He told me that he did have feelings for me but didn't seem to realize that i'd be open to the idea of waiting to see how he felt after taking medication and receiving therapy.

8268,Then the medication ran out and social anxiety soon took over my life again.
8269,"My old doctor is extremely open to trying new medication on me and probably wouldn't say no if I brought it up, but due to my anxiety I get really worked up asking doctors directly for a certain type of medication (I feel like I'm being judged as a pill seeker)."
8270,I HATE taking prescription medication.
8271,Or as a last chance is there any medicine I can take to stop it?
8272,"it started in 2011 and i got on meds ( 25mg of amitriptyline) in early 2012 and it was good for a while, I had my life back but it gets worse then gets slightly better then worse then slightly better... sometimes I leak a tiny bit."

8308,I have tried meds and other tactics to try and help myself but I still notice that even the smallest things can trigger my anxiety and make me feel down.
8309,"I'm really not in a position to pursue any professional help as far as therapists or medication goes, and to be honest I'd highly prefer not to go down that road anyway."
8310,the doctor did all the tests and turns out it was just caused by anxiety :( she offered to prescribe some meds but we decided not to for now since i am young and healthy etc.
8311,"Lately I've been having difficulties with medications, before none of them really helped or so I thought since I still couldn't handle things, but after being off medication for 4 days because of an allergic reaction to medication on the weekend, I couldn't immediately go to the doctor and other things got in the way."
8312,"Today I realized I can't live without medication, I'm so messed up, I just want to cry."

8322,Your thoughts on medications?
8323,Now I'm learning that these effects can even be permanent after you've gotten off the medicine sometimes (PSSD).
8324,I sought out some therapy and was medicated until I learned to control my severe panic attacks without the meds.
8325,I would like some advice that doesn't involve medication where I can get over this anxiety of mine.

I've been taking a Lexapro off-brand medication (for about 5months now) that has helped me a little."

8328,"Then I actually went almost 3 years without medication, where I finished high school, and things seemed to be looking up."
8329,"I've been on the very edge of panic since we moved, and my medication is not working."

8340,"Also, some meds make me extra tired or dizzy or any number of other things that aren't my normal or desired state."
8341,"Most medication used to treat anxiety is something the body becomes immune to over time, so the dosage must be increased."

8346,When neither medication was fully integrated into my system.
8347,Either way I want to go to the doctor and get medication.
8348,I was wondering if I should go to the GP and in your experiences do they put you on meds immediately or no?
8349,"I know I have to give this medication a chance, I just don't know how to do it."
8350,"By the third week, my anxiety somehow convinces me that the medication isn't working and that my body is telling me to stop taking it."
8351,This isn't my first experience trying to take medication.
8352,"I don't want to give up on this medication before I've given it a chance, but my anxiety is so strong and controlling."
8353,"I don't have a primary care provider at the moment, but hopefully will soon since I'm running out of meds."
8354,This doctor convinced me that anti-depressants work better for anxiety than anxiety medicine.
8355,"As soon as my mother found out, she started being extremely cold towards me, even going as far as saying that if I took the meds, she wouldn't like me as a person."
8356,I've been off the medicine since August and haven't been back to the doctor since.
8357,My dad made me an appointment to get my medicine back for next Tuesday.
8358,"*TL;DR My mother doesn't believe in psychiatric medicine, so I have been without medication or therapy for my panic disorder for almost 6 months."
8359,"I've been treating it with the following medications:

Paxil 40mg/day  
Dexepine 20mg/day  
Xanax .5mg 2/day

I still have some anxiety, though I haven't had an actual panic attack in over two years."
8360,"My newest meds work great, they go after the unwanted thoughts obsession and calm me down (50mg Pristiq; 1.25mg Clonazapam daily), but I think there is a big problem; for the past couple of years, I wake up some mornings (sometimes everyday for a week, then nothing for a month), with the most awful feeling, purely physical; it is like someone is sending electric shocks from my brain through through the rest of my body, there is an audible high pitched frequency accompanying each 'brain-thump', and a pins and needles feeling in my face and fingers, and the feeling that I am falling, just dropping down a mine shaft, I want to go to sleep, and have a hard time walking and talking and thinking."
8361,"I've been on and off different medication for the past 4-5 years for both my anxiety and depression and have self diagnosed myself as ""good I dont need meds anymore"" I guess I just dont like how they make me feel but, I always have these wake up calls like a little earlier tonight."
8362,"So maybe I need to get back on my medication and muster through the whole ""I don't like how it makes me feel"" issue and realize that its helping me in the long run.."
8363,"I have made it halfway through the year, and have tried anxiety and depression medicine, but it just makes me feel lifeless but tolerable."
8364,Talk to a dr about different medication?
8365,My wife has GAD and has tried the non-medication route for about 2 years(6 months of actually being diagnosed).
8366,"We have had an incredibly difficult time making any kind of progress, and her dr and therapist both think that medication may help break a downward spiral."
8367,She has also asked me to be honest with her and let her know if I think she needs to start medication.
8368,They don't take depression seriously  suggest meds some shrug meaway.
8369,I'm terrified of going to a doctor about my anxiety because I'm scared of getting meds.
8370,"He's suggesting that I go on disability, but I'm scared that they're going to tell me that I either can't get benefits unless I go on medications, or they're going to deny me for having no medical history for the last ten years."
8371,I'm not saying I need to be out on medication at this point but it might help.
8372,"I've been on the meds for about 4 days now, so I still have plenty left to take, but it worries me that it hasn't improved much yet."
8373,It was irritating and they're going to work up to getting me a shrink and getting me my meds.
8374,"No medication ): Live in PA, USA"
8375,Overall: Drinking on these meds aren't worth it.
8376,"Some background information: I suffer from OCD, which I am on medication for."
8377,She seems afraid of the medication and what it will do to me.
8378,"I've asked (but not requested) medicine solution, but they say that ""talking"" should be the first hand choice."
8379,"I've also never really been comfortable with asking for meds, because I don't want to be seen as a drug seeker, even when I feel I need them."
8380,Like medication wise and that
8381,"And I can't really afford to see a psychiatrist weekly or monthly (That whole hair thing was a gift not something I could afford) so I had my year check up with my GP so I could continue getting my meds, but I'm out for the month."
8382,I was on the meds for several years when I decided recently to go off the medication to see if I could function without them (The idea of being dependent on a drug for the foreseeable future kind of irritated me).
8383,I'm wondering if maybe going off the medication wasn't that great of an idea.
8384,"I keep a good handle on my anxiety for the most part and have managed to stay off medication, but I don't have any close friends I can confide to and my husband is in no position to be receptive to my negative emotions."
8385,"I have years of training for whats coming, but I still feel that all my knowledge has just melted away with the fear :( The last few weeks have been composed mostly of me just trying to manage anxiety, with lots of walks, therapy, medication use, etcetera."
8386,"I don't take meds, i think i should."
8387,"I have a learning disorder that makes learning sometimes frustrating, and I have a prescribed medication to help me cope with this."
8388,* Is there a possibility I could take meds for anxiety attacks/could I be prescribed them?
8389,"Gone through withdraws, lost health insurance, and gotten the right meds again."
8390,"Except the use of medication (antidepressants and benzodiazepines), how do you think I can regain a natural and normal sleep ?"
8391,I was contemplating on going to see a GP and requesting some anti-anxiety meds to help me through the transition.
8392,"I leave in about a month so time is a factor (I know, I should have done this ages ago...)

So yes, is it unreasonable for me to ask anti-anxiety meds to help ease my transition of living in a different country?"
8393,"I'm pretty exhausted from the anti-anxiety meds I plied myself with, and I'm gonna pass out soon."
8394,"Well, I decided rather than taking my anti-anxiety meds at night like I normally do, I'd space them out over this super-stressful event."
8395,I didn't want them to see me taking meds.)
8396,I take clonazepam (klonopin) for pretty bad anxiety but everything I'm reading online says it's a class D medication that shouldn't be taken during pregnancy.
8397,I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and I was curious if there are other medications for anxiety that are safe during pregnancy.
8398,"I'm scared to even be taking it while trying to concieve because you don't really know if you're pregnant until after around 10-14 days after conception and I'm worried taking the medication could harm the fetus even during that short, two week period."
8399,"Notice: At the risk of sounding offensive or rude, I'm not looking for the type of advice that's similar to the whole ""but quitting smoking during pregnancy is way stressful and can be more harmful to the baby than just smoking during the whole pregnancy"" IF anxiety meds like clonazepam, ativan and xanax simply aren't safe for a fetus."
8400,"I don't want to go onto more medication, I want to try and figure out what I can do."
8401,I've never tried any medication like that and I don't know if I'd really like to but there's *no way* I'm getting on a airplane again without something like that in my system.
8402,I think medication is probably a good start and will help me to overcome the physical response.
8403,Every person is different and how every person reacts to medicine is different.
8404,My google searches have all shown that this medication is generally only prescribed to bipolar patients.
8405,"But in another way, it seems like it could be a bad thing; what happens if I go off of the medication and feel like I can't cope?"
8406,I have vallium upstairs that I am supposed to take in emergencies and I'm currently on 2 anti depressants and one anti-anxiety medication and I feel like they're not doing anything right now.
8407,"I know what this all stems from, I’ve tried multiple therapists and have anxiety medication to take as needed but some days this just controls my life."
8408,So i've made an appointment with a psychiatrist to seek cognitive therapy and medication such a benzos.
8409,"Will medication give me that same ""carefree, outgoing"" feeling i get with alcohol (without the negative effects of course)?"
8410,"I'm really against medication because I'm terrified of becoming dependent, but I am also really over feeling flighty, randomly feeling like crying, shortness of breathe and my damn thoughts just don't stop!"
8411,Yes I'm on meds/ councillor and hell I'm even doing neural feed back.
8412,"Because medication didn't improved anything, i switched to  psychotherapy, i have it on a weekly basis for the last 1,5 year."
8413,"I've seen psychologists, I'm on meds, I spend all my time on self help/motivational sites, my life is on track, ...but nothing seems to be getting any easier."
8414,"Second morning of meds, i already feel like quitting, i think its more i dont feel mentally ready to be on meds, if that makes any sense, should i think of stopping, n trying again when i get more info/support while taking these."
8415,If anyone has had similar issues I'd love for a PM because I'm at the end of my wits and there's no way I'll be able to see anyone or get any medication before tomorrow and if I do end up panicking myself into problems in scared what will come of my girlfriend and friends.
8416,"I've seen a couple different therapists in the past few years, and just recently started meds."
8417,She's basically just there to prescribe and monitor meds rather than actually doing therapy.
8418,The meds are helping somewhat and for just over a week I felt really good.
8419,"On meds that are helping, but need extra help."
8420,"The problem is that the meds really affect my sex drive and ability to orgasm, and this is impacting on our relationship and putting strain on us both."
8421,"I am not ready to come off the meds, having tried just before Christmas - what else can I do?"
8422,I want to try to get some medication.
8423,"I'm under my parents insurance still, so I know that they'll know what medication I'm given, but as long as I'm the one to tell them the details, I can say that it's all for mild anxiety."
8424,"Also, is there any way I can get meds without going to a therapist?"
8425,they could provide all kinds of medication.
8426,"Each one of the listed meds haven't worked well for me, having either a complete opposite reaction ( scary!)"
8427,"As it stands I cannot afford therapy, and I've been on various types of medication and none of them helped me at all."
8428,"I've brought up, in passing, about possiblilty getting medication but my mother has always just said that I need to ""calm down and relax"", as most of my anxiety relates to university."
8429,I need to know how to really tell her that I need medication.
8430,"I'm considering medication again, but those fucking side-effects can be worse than the problem."
8431,"A daily Benzo, and depression medicine."
8432,I'm wondering if there is any good off the shelf anti depressant type medicine?
8433,"Anyway, I just want to know if anyone knows what I can do to help myself without being diagnosed or having a prescription for medication."
8434,I'm off my medication.
8435,I'm taking meds for it but it doesn't work anymore because of my high tolerance to benzos.
8436,Ive had zanax before but it makes me too sleepy to work on and Idk about other meds.
8437,I'm seeing my general doctor tomorrow to talk about therapy sessions and medication options.
8438,Since I started taking the meds I quit Caffine (i used to drink allot of coffee) I quit drinking for the most part because it did not play well with the meds made me feel really messed up.
8439,"I tried to taper the pain meds, and that pretty much sucked."
8440,Will medication help?
8441,"I don't know how he'd react and the fact that I'm from a small area means I'd be worried about others finding out, especially if I needed medication."
8442,This is my first time on any sort of anxiety medication.
8443,So back in May I made a long overdue appointment with my doctor to discuss getting on some medication to help me manage my anxiety.
8444,"While the meds have definitely helped to reduce my anxiety tremendously, it seems to have also reduced the rest of my emotions as well."
8445,I would say probably for the past two months or so I have only really felt much in the way of emotion twice… and both times I hadn't taken my meds for a few days and ended up having a panic attack on each occassion.
8446,"So, anyway, I'm now in a zone of discovering what meds will work with me (hopefully without weight gain."
8447,"If you have any suggestions on meds, please tell me!"
8448,"After being out of therapy and off meds for over a year, I made an appointment and am going back in."
8449,"I used to take klonopin to help control the panic attacks, but have been off all meds for the past 2-3 years."
8450,I can't get used to meds again right now.
8451,"I'm not going into the full details of my disorders (they're not diagnosed) and medications, but know that I was receiving treatment."
8452,"I accepted the medications even though I felt (and feel) that I am letting my family down by taking them (they think all medication is BAD BAD BAD, shouldnt be taking them, etc)."
8453,"I moved in with my boyfriend (was 1.5 years off all medications and happy), and I was offered some when I was incredibly upset and near panic attack, and it calmed me down and didn't make me feel bad."
8454,"Ive been working my butt off with CBT and counselling, and Im finally off my most of my meds so I thought Id give it a test."
8455,"I take medicine for it, but I recently switched and I don't know if it's working all that well compared to the stuff I used to take."
8456,"I stopped medication a while ago, for one reason or another."
8457,I have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist on a monthly basis since then and taking my medication.
8458,Meaning not including benzodiazepines or short term medications and for generalized anxiety
8459,"I stopped taking these meds in november of 2014, and am still having issues."
8460,I am still having issues 6 months later after being off the medication completely and am beginning to wonder whether it's becoming a mental thing as opposed to an issue from this medication.
8461,I was just wondering how you guys can tell that your medication is working?
8462,"I've kind of digressed, but the main point is that yeah, I have never been able to tell if my medications were working or not."
8463,"I've taken Klonopin as needed for anxiety attacks, and that has helped someone in the moment, but as for those medications where you need to take them regularly... well, I'm still pretty much a sad zombie."
8464,"I hated the idea that I had to take meds just so I could do my schoolwork, especially when I was really happy with the other aspects of my life."
8465,"Dear Sirs and Madames,

As a long-suffering anxiolite, I've spent most of my life resisting medication and its well-established limpdickeriffic side effects."
8466,I've been going back and forth on whether I should see a doctor and be put on medication.
8467,"When I was about 18 I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism, which admittedly I'm bad at taking my meds for."
8468,"I have PTSD with anxiety and depression, I've been in therapy and meds for two years."
8469,Yet not so much that I can so easily handle the downs that happen when I come off my meds.
8470,"On top of all of this,  if I did chose to have children, and manage to conceive, I would not be allowed to take meds during the pregnancy/breastfeeding."
8471,"I'm not on meds now, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't be, and that I won't be in the future."
8472,My medication definitely doesn't help my drowsiness.
8473,"Since I can remember I've had a problem with my anxiety disorder and I've experienced cognitive, hypnotic, and regular therapy for years and have been on Prozac for a pretty long time, but I knocked medication and therapy out of my life and can confidently say I haven't had a serious anxiety attack in months!"
8474,"He's been doing therapy and taking meds for a year, and yesterday he decided he wants to quit, at least the meds part (he doesn't feel like they're working)."
8475,"I don't know, what if the meds were actually helping and it's going to get worse now?"
8476,Right now I'm trying to inform myself about his meds and such while I control my breathing.
8477,EDIT: I'm also curious about beta blockers as a medicine for anxiety and panic.
8478,She was seeing a therapist and taking meds which helped her function a little more normally but now she is on a kick where she doesn't want to be the type of person who takes medicine.
8479,"My psychologist told me I have social phobia and I am on medication 


But I am starting to doubt that I do have social phobia."
8480,"Now, I know that it takes a while to adjust to new meds but I have been exhausted...like without anything specific to do I am sleeping 14-19 hours a day."
8481,I haven't really been able to gauge whether the meds have been helping my anxiety because I'm so tired.
8482,Clearly the antidepressants/anti-anxiety meds I've been on since my early teens aren't cutting it anymore.
8483,I have been told to go on medication but I am determined beat it without it.
8484,I'm really crossing my fingers this will be the one that finally works after the squillions of meds I've tried.
8485,"Hi everyone, 

I'm 21 years old and I have had problems with generalized anxiety in the past, and I am currently on a low dose medication (20mg celexa)..My anxiety has improved immensely and it continues to get better everyday."
8486,That year i started medication and therapy.
8487,I have had medication and counseling awhile but it's obviously not working.
8488,"I'm having a fun bout of I CAN'T SWALLOW SOLID ANYTHING, so I wasted two doses of medication, which makes me worry about how I'll be judged when I refill my prescription early."
8489,I am really open to trying a new medication to try and help.
8490,"So, did this medication work for you?"
8491,What really makes me believe I have it is because I have a condition known as [Psychopsychological Insomnia](http://www.sleepmedicineeducation.com/page2/page10/page14/page21/page21.html) which basically says that you worry about having more insomnia.
8492,"So, should I just play there game and take the meds just to get to my real issue or should I say fuck them and get to the medicine cabinet?"
8493,I'm not on any anxiety meds either and asking for professional help isn't an option.
8494,"I am panicking because this medication has really helped me, and I don't know if I will be safe without it."
8495,I just forgot the medicine one day and its already a disaster.
8496,"My medication helps, but its still not enough with having to socialize."
8497,I've also tried 3 daily anxiety meds to no success as my body absolutely does not react well to changed in the serotonin levels.
8498,2) For the meds - has anyone found good daily medicine to control anxiety outside of the serotonin inhibitor family?
8499,"One method of treating panic attacks in panic disorder, as well as other anxiety disorders, is to use prescription medication."
8500,"There are several types of medications that have proven effective in treating panic attacks, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines."
8501,"These medications help regulate the levels and functioning of neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin, to help regulate mood and therefore prevent panic attacks."
8502,"Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

One of the most common types of panic attack medication is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs."
8503,"Some common SSRI medications include:
•	Prozac (fluoxetine)
•	Zoloft (sertraline)
•	Paxil (paroxetine)
•	Luvox (fluvoxamine)

Although SSRIs are highly effective in treating panic attacks and anxiety disorders, they are known to have side effects, including:
•	Irritability
•	Loss of sexual desire
•	Drowsiness
•	Difficulty sleeping
•	Headaches
•	Changes in appetite
•	Weight gain

If one SSRI has not worked well or has caused side effects to a level that has become problematic, the individual’s physician might have them try a different SSRI."
8504,"Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are another type of panic attack medication."
8505,"Some common benzodiazepine medications include:
•	Xanax (alprazolam)
•	Klonopin (clonazepam)
•	Valium (diazepam)
•	Ativan (lorazepam)

Like all medications, benzodiazepines have side effects."
8506,"Other Types of Panic Attack Medications

Although SSRIs and benzodiazepines are the most commonly used types of panic attack medications, there are other classes of drugs, which can also be used to treat anxiety and panic disorders."
8507,"These include:
•	Tricyclic antidepressants, including Anafranil, Norpramin, and Tofranil
•	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), including Marplan, Nardil, and Parnate

These types of medication have also proven themselves effective in reducing the number and severity of panic attacks in people with panic disorder; however, they are less commonly used and are often prescribed when SSRIs or benzodiazepines prove ineffective."
8508,Panic attacks can be effectively treated and prevented with prescription medications.
8509,"These medications affect neurotransmitters in the brain, which play a role in causing anxiety, panic, and other mood problems."
8510,The most commonly used panic attack medications are SSRIs and benzodiazepines.
8511,#panicAttacks #medication
8512,I have tried different medicines but I never really felt a difference.
8513,I tried taking meds before but after a while I just quit because I never felt a difference and I really don't like being on medicines in the first plac.
8514,"I stopped my anti-depression meds about 3 months ago and thus far, it has been going great."
8515,I am no longer at the level of depression I was a few years ago and am to the point where I don't need the meds.
8516,Since that time frame I have been to several doctors and on daily medication.
8517,I experience the attacks much less now than I did before I was on medication.
8518,"This is mostly a rant, but also wondering in what ways have you personally found most effective in dealing with your anxiety, aside from medication?"
8519,"**

If you haven't gotten help yet, or slacked on therapy or your meds, go get help!"
8520,I don't want to go back on medication (16 months Zoloft-and-Wellbutrin-free) but I've been working on meditation.
8521,But this was before I sought help and got medication.
8522,"As a result, I now have to change the medication that I was FINALLY getting used to (after 3 months) because of tachycardia."
8523,What is everyones thoughts on medication?
8524,"I've taken my anxiety meds (Hydroxyl HCL), but I can't calm down."
8525,The school I was in told me I either take medication or change schools.
8526,I changed schools and went on medication.
8527,The medication increased my appetite and messed with my emotions.
8528,"I stopped taking the medication, and was **constantly** grounded."
8529,"""We love you more when you take your medication."""
8530,I haven't used medications for years and plan on keeping it that way because they seemed to exacerbate the issues.
8531,"The medicine took quite a while to begin working, but it is doing a GREAT job!"
8532,"Recently I've gained a partner, and things begin well, but usually after 15-20 minutes the soldier collapses... Is this a common problem, I want to consult my doctor, but this medicine is working so well I am scared to go off of it."
8533,"However I couldn't give them enough space and oine set of medication made me very moody and bad tempered, another incredibly paranoid."
8534,I don't like the idea of medication and am extremely hesitant to seriously consider trying it.
8535,"I spend time in my room because when I am in my room it allows me to calm down and not panic (I am not currently on meds or seeing a doctor as I am still on a waiting list for a doctor up here, I go for my appointment tomorrow)."
8536,I know I should probably ask my doctor personally on his advice but I've gotten some duds as far as medication goes in the past so I'd like some advice before I make an appointment.
8537,I'm in the process of getting insurance and don't have a healthcare provider right now so meds or therapy aren't an option.
8538,Unfortunately my psychiatrist is booked until October and I can't talk to her about finding a new medication to help me with my anxiety and nightly panic attacks.
8539,"If so, what have you done about it without taking medication since my psychiatrist is booked for months."
8540,"I have read about ""Brain Zaps"" that feel like they go off in the head when you miss even a day of the medication as well as other side effects that I don't like the idea of."
8541,But I can't take the medicine.
8542,For the entire weekend I didn't need my Anxiety medicine.
8543,"So confused and tired...maybe I should go back on my medication...

Would that help things?"
8544,I've tried meds (and am back on them) it's a low grade dose of Imipramine prescribed after going back to the doctor to let him know i have been having anxiety and depression issues.
8545,on the flip side i have seen the effects of meds on others and it scares the hell out me to be dependent.
8546,I don't have health insurance so therapy and ongoing medication isn't an easy option.
8547,I talked to my doctor on Wednesday and she adjusted my medicine and recommended I set up a meeting with the school counciller.
8548,"I went on a low dose of anxiety medication and saw a therapist for a semester, which dealt with my problems at that time."
8549,Does anyone have experience with sexual dysfunction and SSRIs who can recommend a different medication or ways to cope with it?
8550,I take Vyvanse for ADD which increases my general anxiety so I have to avoid those kinds of meds.
8551,"I shuffle things around &amp; only do the bare minimum required
* Have had extramarital sex twice

I don't know if the medicine is changing me, or if deep down I'm just a heartless son of a bitch."
8552,I have medication that is purely for situational use.
8553,Another problem is that I am EXTREMELY nervous/anxious about meds.
8554,Even ones I have taken before (tylenol/advil/Imodium/etc)...so meds won't really help me as it is very unlikely that I could actually get myself to take them.
8555,"So here goes this story;

One of my best friends (Female, 17 year old, panic disorder, not sure of medication) has been suffering from panic attacks and this year it has gotten worse."
8556,She actively goes to the doctor's and has tried changing her medication but this time her panic attacks are happening more frequently (4 to 5 times a day) and they are lasting longer.
8557,"Then my sister says I don't need medication for sleep or anxiety or depression while my other sister's on 5 different meds, smokes, and drinks."
8558,"I'm trying my best not to get on meds, mainly because of the difficulty of getting them and my mom would know that I'm a depressed, socially anxious, bipolar mess."
8559,I stopped taking meds for months now and entered a new state: Depression.
8560,"Also, I don't have the luxury of going to a doctor and getting medication; I need a job first to get the money to make these changes but in order to get the job, I need to be anxiety free (;_;)."
8561,this happen to anybody where meds seem to do well then stop?
8562,"very intelligent, aced primary school anxiety started at puberty and it's severe, ruined highschool grades got below average so damn disappointed with what happened everything else is going shitty, grades, friends, relationships tried meds, counselling, doctors, sleep schedules, natural lighting, better eating, improvement and improvement of exercise ah fucking hell"
8563,"Without meds/therapists, is it possible?"
8564,"**Bottom line**: Without meds and without therapy, is there a chance the Generalized Anxiety would ever go away?"
8565,"I've been having anxiety for over a year now and the only medication I've ever taken is Sertraline, 25mg in the morning."
8566,"I was on spring break last week so without having to do my morning routine, I forgot to take my meds, too."
8567,"The only side effects I've had from Sertraline was loss of appetite and bloating, so I don't know whether the way I felt today has anything to do with meds."
8568,My anxiety might have exaggerated the symptoms but does the irregularity of taking meds can cause more severe side effects?
8569,I should take my meds more carefully.
8570,Im 18/f by the way and take medication for them!
8571,My doctor is trying to get me to try medication but I'm so terrified it will change who I am in a negative way or that I will go from caring to much about everything to not caring at all about anything.
8572,"I'm clearly not good at controlling it on my own, since I'm always fully aware of my issues and yet cant seem to seperate myself from them and then I'm terrified to try medications."
8573,Is medication as terrifying as I believe it to be?
8574,The medicine my doctor put me on isn't working and neither are valiums :( Please some help I am so sccared
8575,I used to just hide my anxiety but about 6 months ago decided to try some medication to help me out.
8576,I wish I never tried medication in the first place.
8577,"in addition to my long-term, day-to-day medication or do they only do one or the other?"
8578,"I notice it pretty much goes away when I take anti-anxiety meds, so that might mean something."
8579,"I have been to many doctors and psychs, tried many medications and I haven't had a job in 3 years... Everytime I go outside, I have an attack and i'm terrified just thinking about working."
8580,I've been off medication for 3 weeks and it's been the worst three weeks of my life I can't think properly.
8581,"Last year I was diagnosed with GAD, and my parents opted not to put me on medication."
8582,I was also discussing exercise with a girl with tachycardia I work with who was describing how she gets without her meds...
8583,I have struggled with anxiety for many years and have tried numerous medications.
8584,"Hey so I have started going to therapy and taking meds regularly to help me cope with my anxiety and other issues, but I have been smoking marijuana for 12years and I would say for at least 6years its been habitually everyday all day."
8585,"The last time I had worked actual retail was many years ago, when my anxiety was controlled by medication."
8586,"Until I began working again, unmedicated this time, I had never realized how anxious I am without the meds while working with the general public."
8587,"(26, M, G.A.D., Triggered by everything, No medication, U.S., VA Healthcare which doesn't provide good therapy, Too poor to afford therapy out of pocket)

Thanks in advance."
8588,"I have actually tried to talk to my doctor (the same doctor my parents see) about all of this, and I explained to him that my anxiety is ruining my life, but he told me he would absolutely not prescribe me ANY sort of medication for my anxiety because I would get addicted and at my age (22), IT would ruin my life."
8589,I received therapy a while back but the second I was diagnosed with something I was given meds and my case was dropped.
8590,I did find [this article](http://www.livestrong.com/article/345797-how-to-stop-weight-gain-from-zoloft/#page=1) that made me look at my meds differently.
8591,Going on my meds will be about making all of me a better person.
8592,I was prescribed medicine by my regular doctor whom I told EVERYTHING to; that (medicine) has taken care of the depression very well.
8593,I realize that medicine usually isn't the best way to handle sensitive things like this so I want to see a clinical psychologist to try and get rid of whatever is left of what I have because I'm sick of suffering and not being the person I once was.
8594,"I'd like to get diagnosed mainly so that I can start either seeing a therapist, take some meds, or just do more yoga (although arguably, I could just do that last part now) and see it as treatment."
8595,"From family who has offered to ""reward"" me with money to simply ""stop taking my meds"" to family who see me break down in crying attacks and can't breathe and emotional wreckages in front of counselors to one week later asking ""Don't you think if you were just strong enough you could be off the meds?""."
8596,My family hurts so bad and I don't want to stay on my meds my whole life but god dammit Im sick of crying over everything.
8597,I know it has to be the sudden decrease of meds but I feel like its better if I can just get them to see the mess I am without them... What do I do?
8598,"Now I just tried taking it in the morning with all of my other meds, and I'm extremely woozy and sleepy."
8599,What do you guys do to cope with the drowsiness of medication?
8600,(Obviously) I take medication.
8601,from what i can tell all they seem to care about is collecting there paycheck and making sure to push all the bogus fda approved medications.
8602,Not sure what medication if any to try next and I think I trust reddit more then any doctor atleast for some opinions and ideas.
8603,My next issue is meds.
8604,My brother is on meds for issues similar to mine and he's given me some in the past.
8605,"This is the first time I'm seeing the doctor for meds in almost two years, so I'm hesitant."
8606,"About a month ago, I stopped taking the medication after halving my dosage for two weeks."
8607,I've posted here before asking about medication but I'm scared that because I don't feel comfortable with counselling that I won't be prescribed anything.
8608,Any other meds that you took in addition that counteracted the weight gain?
8609,"She is on medication for anxiety, and even though the panic attacks and sporadic depression phases can sometimes be difficult to our relationship, I have always tried my best to support her and to help her improve her health and well-being."
8610,I don't take any medication.
8611,"I've never experienced hangout, so everything seems more like medicine, than anything else."
8612,"First is the meds, which I was there to talk to him about."
8613,Second was the therapy; talking to someone along with the meds would help drastically.
8614,"**TL;DR: I've been on Effexor XR for 6 months now and don't understand what the brain zaps are, nor how to go to sleep at night now that I've switched taking the meds from day time to night."
8615,"I was going to a psychologist and she decided I didn't need any medication, because I came to the point that I'm really sick and tired of how I feel."
8616,"I've been prescribed meds, but I'm also a massive hypochondriac and feel unable to take them because of the myriad side effects."
8617,I don't even have to to go to the campus pharmacy and get my meds refilled.
8618,I don't want to suffer from withdrawals if I end up taking a stronger medication and then can't get a refill in time.
8619,"However, before I broke contact they mentioned they were having a hard time socializing due to starting a new medication/ the anxiety."
8620,I did get some meds though.
8621,Would other meds act faster?)
8622,But I still feel like I need a pep talk to keep trying out the medication (I could have taken some when I freaked out today but didn't) and to prepare myself to open up to another doctor who should be better.
8623,"TLDR: Shrink wrote off my problems to smoking weed, it was no small emotional or financial feat to get myself to a doctor and I'm really disappointed, the meds she gave me don't give the feeling I was hoping for but I don't know if what I hoped for is realistic."
8624,"My girlfriend and some friends have seen some very ""reputable"" people but have all been rushed onto meds after the first session."
8625,They wanted to prescribe me something but I really am not comfortable with meds.
8626,She offered to prescribe me medication last year but I refused to take it; now I'm strongly considering taking it if she offers.
8627,Does anyone have any comments/suggestions on what to do when you first start taking medication for anxiety?
8628,"I had to stop taking my meds because of allergic reactions, and i have just been getting more and more distant.. i don't want to lose him, but i have anxiety attacks whenever he gets close to me."
8629,"I'm hopefully getting new meds tomorrow, i hope they work, and start to work fast...  i hate this distance between us... its killing me."
8630,No medication.
8631,"Instead I've wasted hundreds of dollars on medications that don't work, or make me the human equivalent of Grumpy Cat/sleepy/dizzy/hate life (Atenelol, BusPar, Prozac), or only work for two months and just stop working (Wellbutrin, Klonopin)."
8632,"So next appointment, I want to state that either I want to be put on Adderall/Ritalin or stop my meds and find another psychiatrist."
8633,Yes I know it's bad to just stop taking meds without talking to a doctor.
8634,I can't wait to get into a psychiatrist's office soon to find out what meds *will* work for me.
8635,I need to know if it's healthy to have alternatives to a counsellor and if there's any way to tone down anxiety without medication.
8636,"However, my attacks have been more frequent and I've been taking meds (Xanax) for the past few days."
8637,"Taking anxiety meds also facilitates being anxious, I think."
8638,"Hey guys, so I've been recently diagnosed with some mental illnesses and I've been living with them for over 10 years but I'm just finding out about them and getting help, but I'm not sure how to deal with knowing that I've never been normal and that if I want to be normal and have people accept me then I have to take meds.."
8639,"I've really been contemplating suicide for a while, I really don't like the thought of only being considered ""normal"" by taking meds for the rest of my life.."
8640,I don't like the way meds make me feel and I'm not sure how to deal with it
8641,"What could therapy do for me, in this situation, if I refuse to take anti-anxiety medication?"
8642,Or anything to help the medication along?
8643,I was meant to be getting off my meds this month; 50mg sertraline daily.
8644,What were you doing with your time leading up to beginning medication?
8645,"Hi all, I have suffered from anticipatory anxiety for a while and am trying to deal with it through means without medication, but it's a struggle."
8646,"I've been taking my prescribed anxiety meds seroquel and Xanax like everyday, and it seems to not be helping me, I have no clue of what to do anymore."
8647,I am not on any medication so its not a withdrawal symptom and i have had ct scans and mri's come back clear... is it just acute anxiety?
8648,"I do not take any medication because I have found other ways to deal with my anxiety and I have essentially eradicated it, except for some random health problems that just popped up."
8649,"I get everything ranging from weight gain, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, etc etc from these class of medications."
8650,Her father has even worse anxiety but deals with it via homeopathy medicines (herbs and such).
8651,There was a huge fight over her medications and they constantly made her cry.
8652,I can't really function like this so I finally decided it was time to take the next step and ask the doctor for meds.
8653,In the past was seeing a dr and was on many medications....last meds were prozac...abilify....klonopin....want to get back on klonopin .5mgs twice a day.
8654,Lately I have been seeing a councilor as well as a Dr for medication.
8655,So a couple of weeks go by and I get a letter in the mail saying that she tried to contact me and that since she saw me as stable (non suicidal) she was releasing me and i will now only be seeing the medical doctor there for medication.
8656,"I've been on a whole array of medication for my severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder, some of which has worked vaguely for a little while before they just stopped working on together."
8657,"I mean, I realize that often medications take time for your body to get used to, but I don't know how much longer I can go on feeling like a nauseous pile of garbage as I wait for it to actually start working properly."
8658,I'm not medicated as anxiety medication didn't help me.
8659,"I have an appointment to meet with a doctor on Monday, and possibly get prescription medication to deal with this problem."
8660,"Do you guys have any suggestions for holistic treatment, or vitamin supplements that could be used as alternative medicine?"
8661,"I'm currently taking medication and forcing myself to go outside almost daily, just to see if I can extend how far I can go or how long I can stay out, however I don't feel like I'm currently making any progress."
8662,I have to start a job search but know that meds will help.
8663,There was a fuck up with my meds which caused me to crash into a pit of debilitating anxiety.
8664,"When I asked her about medication for anxiety in the first place, I was hoping she'd prescribe me an antidepressant."
8665,"I'm also seeing the counselor at my college once a week, and plan on continuing to do so if/when I'm prescribed a long-term medication."
8666,I do have a doctors appointment set up in a week to go on medication but every day is literally hell and I'm not even confident that the pills will help.
8667,"I'm on new meds, and have check ups with my doctor every two weeks."
8668,How willing are doctors to prescribe meds if you don't want to talk about it much?
8669,What if my medicine interacts with alcohol (it doesn't).
8670,"While we've been together she's been making progress, trying out different medications, etc.."
8671,Can't take it anymore so I threw in the towel and visited my primary doctor today to talk about medication.
8672,I was on medication in the past but I wasn't myself and made me too tired.
8673,"My bf says he understands but it's so illogical he gets very frustrated.i had a few  years without medication and i was fine, but lately its controlling every part of my life."
8674,"I am hoping this will help and won't need medication, but what is she suggests it?"
8675,"I've tried CBT and Propanolol, this time my checklist is to try a new, more 'aggressive' medication (I was on a very low dose before), start seeing a psychotherapist to help understand **why** I have this constant feeling of dread, and to get a formal written diagnosis."
8676,"I'm wondering if people here a) have had similar experiences as me, b) have any suggestions for things I could try, or c) could recommend an alternative medication I could look into."
8677,* have you switched from ativan to a different anti-anxiety medication?
8678,"* is there anything that I could try besides therapy, mindfulness, timers/schedules (the 45/45/30 model worked for me for a while, but has lost its powers of late), and medication?"
8679,Any recommendations for alternative medications (or alternatives *to* medication)?
8680,"I go to a therapist and talk and i did so in the past, as well as take medicine, but at the moment i don't take anything."
8681,Went cold turkey off the Pristiq a few weeks ago since I couldn't make it to my doctor to pick up more meds.
8682,Does anyone else feel some of these psych meds doctor prescribe aren't really doing their intended job after a while?
8683,How much choice does the patient really have with their medication?
8684,Can I even choose my own treatment without feeling as though i'm being mocked or judged by my psychologist or case worker for choosing my own medication?
8685,I'm just wondering what your anxiety is like now that you're on your meds.
8686,What was it like before and after meds?
8687,Which meds are you on?
8688,"I am not a drug user, rarely drink and the only medication I'm taking is birth control."
8689,I been having stomach issues from yesterday morning it's 1am and I haven't been able to sleep yet and my stomach still being a bit off I wasn't sure due to getting used to the meds (sertraline) as I been on them for month now.
8690,I am on medication (Lexapro) for anxiety and depression.
8691,"I am a psychology major, and I know there is medication for episodes, but I also know that this medication can lead to a dependency."
8692,Are any of you on episode-related medication?
8693,"I guess I'm just asking about medication, and what you guys do to stop yourself from entering a major episode."
8694,"Since anti-anxiety medications are taken at the onset of anxiety, that wouldn't be a good option for me since my anxiety occurs while operating a vehicle."
8695,This was before I was on medication.
8696,(I had been on medication for about 2 weeks at this point.)
8697,"I don't mean just psych meds, but when I get a new prescription i obsess about whether or not to take them."
8698,I actually feel worse now then I did before medication.
8699,I just hated medication and therapy helps but sometimes it is hard to make is functional in the moment.
8700,"What it means is you need to take actions to have on you your medication, water (or relaxing tea such as chamomile or ""nighty-night"" or ""easy now""), your cell phone is charged, maybe a pocket knife or touchstone or whatever, and any relevant research and preparation for whatever it is you're going to do."
8701,"I had passed out before then, but I have a lot more general anxiety now, especially concerning taking medicine and eating new foods for some reason."
8702,What medicines have you taken to treat your anxiety?
8703,Just looking for new medicines to bring up to my doctor or ask questions about whether or not they would fit my situation.
8704,I've never gone to a doctor to talk about it because I'm afraid they're just gonna prescribe me some medicine that I'll become reliant on and that's not the way I want to live.
8705,"After 18 years of dealing with panic disorder I'm at the end of my rope so to speak, so I have found a place that focuses on functional medicine and getting to the root cause."
8706,"I'm on my meds and therapy, but almost everyday (if not everyday) I feel the same thing."
8707,Switched meds several times and every time it seems worse than before.
8708,"I've been off medication for about 3 months now, due to a big move, finishing school, etc."
8709,I'm going to the doctor to see what kind of regiment I can get back on with meds and/or therapy (I've done both in the past).
8710,He has a chapter about medication that details the facts/side effects/uses of some drugs.
8711,"Now I am taking meds for my anxiety (gabapentin 300mg twice a day,bupropion sr 150mg three times a day), while they do help deal with my physical symptoms, they don't remove them and do little for the mental ones."
8712,I'm tired of dealing with anxiety and having to take medicine that probably needs to be upped in dosage (again) and having to stress manage and having to go to several counselors and having to do all this other stuff that I didn't have to deal with two years ago.
8713,"But I had taken it in the morning, at 10 a.m. so surely the restlessness last night was not from the medication I had taken fourteen hours before."
8714,"My question is, could the meds have anything to do with this, only having been taken twice?"
8715,Or is this some sort of stomach virus I have caught and it coincidentally coincides with starting new medication?
8716,I'm considering being open to medication but I have a fear or being dependent on them for years on end.
8717,I suffer from GAD and panic disorder and treat them with both meds and therapy.
8718,"I'll start: I finished tapering off my meds last Friday, but I'm still going through some icky withdrawals."
8719,"I got diagnosed with ADHD six months ago and while medication definitely helps, the stresses of college pile on, leading to a lot of stress and anxiety."
8720,"Really, I could care less if I'm on meds or not."
8721,"I've though about going to a doctor to get medication, but I don't have insurance, and I don't have the money to go right now."
8722,What if I can't afford medication that he thinks will help... Will I have a few good months after starting it then fall spectacularly to pieces afterwards when I can no longer afford it?
8723,It's partly my fault for waiting until I was almost out of meds before getting a refill.
8724,Despite my attempts at medication and therapy I cant escape it.
8725,Taking my meds.
8726,"Supposedly this has been helpful for many people, especially those who are trying to avoid prescription medication (which I am trying to avoid)."
8727,"I asked my therapist his opinion on how the medication is helping me, as he sees many more people with anxiety than I do."
8728,"So, that leads me to my question - what medicine has helped you with anxiety the most?"
8729,"I have tried meditation with little success, I think my only option is to use anti-anxiety meds and/or sedatives if I can get them."
8730,"So, a few days ago I went to the Doctors, I essentially had the option of staying on my medication Celexa 40MG, however it made me feel extremely unwell, at least I hope it was the medication making me feel this way."
8731,"I stopped that right away to start taking 10MG of Sertaline the next day, I started that threw days ago, today I woke up feeling good, as o progressed through the day I was having trouble speaking to people, which is why I was put on the medication in the first place, now I'm feeling really nervous, dizzy, I'm quite scared, I'm worried I'm going to die."
8732,"I am feeling more and more like I need a medication to help control my ridiculous anxiety, and then I also should start therapy on the side to help myself get to a place where I eventually don't need the medication any longer."
8733,"**Edit:** This is why I am so scared to try meds, because their effects are varied and unpredictable!"
8734,* Who prescribes medication and how do they decide if you need it?
8735,* How much do therapy and meds typically cost?
8736,"I had been on medication the past six month, I had been doing so wonderfully the first semester."
8737,"Now I am just back to worrying about everything, my medication runs out in a few weeks."
8738,"He's already been seeing a therapist for years, has been taking various types of prescribed medications and has been attending various addiction programs."
8739,"I stopped medication about a year after, willingly and I was okay for a while, but in the past year and a half I've been shaky."
8740,"I've been diagnosed with Depression/Anxiety for a little over 12 years now, and I've had it pretty well under-control with therapy and a series of medications (Paxil, Zoloft, Lexapro, in that order)."
8741,"Things have been going perfectly smooth the last 3 months, im on a new medicine that has leveled me back out to normal."
8742,Doing so totally threw me off and I forgot to take my meds.
8743,"I am no longer on medication because I was convinced I had the tools to deal with my anxieties and depression myself, but I clearly do not."
8744,"Ive had anxiety for a couple of months now and started getting anxiety attacks which completely freaked me out, 
I went to the doctors and they prescribed me citalopram which completely knocked me out for a week, it increased my anxiety attack and generally made me alot worse, i then switched medication to Sertraline and that seems to be working okay since then, however when I have free time at the weekends I seem to get very anxious/ depressed and i'm just not sure what I can do about this situation so reddit any tips for dealing with anxiety and depression during down time or just in general?"
8745,I'd like to try other options before I go down the medication route.
8746,"6) If all else fail, try medication!"
8747,"I want to start on medication, but I'm concerned that the first two weeks might spike my blood pressure up to a dangerous level(it already spikes when feeling anxiety, so pretty much all of the time these days)."
8748,I have never been to a psychiatrist/psychologist and am not currently on any medication
8749,"I will probably be talking to my psychologist soon enough to get on some medication, I know it's different for everyone, which works best etc."
8750,"I'm afraid of taking medication because I think it ~~will~~ could make me worse (mood swings, suicidal thoughts, depressed, more anxious etc etc) But, I can't live like this anymore, I need to do something about it."
8751,"sorry for the huge texts;

TL;DR - When did you know your medication was working?"
8752,Or is it just the meds kicking in?
8753,Since then I have tried a variety of different medications which have either not worked very well or not worked at all.
8754,Is it possible that no medication will ever work for me?
8755,I understand that medication isn't a fix but it should at least help.
8756,"Okay guys, my boyfriend (who was recently diagnosed with anxiety) refuses to take his medicine because he's afraid of all the side effects."
8757,Did any of you go through something like this where you were afraid to take your medicine because you thought it would do more harm than good?
8758,"I've recently been dealing with a lot of anxiety, and while there are many different ways of dealing with it, medication, meditation, therapy, or the million other things you can do, I have found a really easy way to take about 1% of the edge off, and I'm sure a lot of people do it."
8759,I have been treated as bipolar but I guess my reaction to the bipolar meds showed my Psychiatrist that I wasn't in fact bipolar.
8760,I  have tried so many medications.
8761,"Hello, here is my experience with medication and my anxiety/depression."
8762,"(I know only my doctor can make this choice, so I am purely asking for opinion and to broaden my horizons and possibly bring up certain medication names with my doctor.)"
8763,"My question is:

Is there a medication like Wellbutrin that does not have stimulant properties?"
8764,By that I mean: A medication that treats anxiety/depression that has less chance of sexual side effects that is NOT a stimulant?
8765,"And I'm trying to be positive about the therapy process, and that it will help, or that I'll get on medication that will help me."
8766,"I have never taken any prescribed medication for my anxiety as its been too specific and short-lived (although very intense, not symptomatically but emotionally and mentally) and I've dealt with my depression my entire life so I haven't bothered with that either."
8767,With the help of therapy and medication I feel reborn.
8768,And there is medication that can calm those thoughts.
8769,I'm not currently on any medication because I've been able to manage my anxiety up until recently.
8770,"First, I don't have health insurance so I don't take medications or visit a therapist."
8771,"I'm still taking my medication and trying my best, but it feels like a slippery slope."
8772,I've been going to therapy for over a year now and while that and medication seem to help nothing really changes very much.
8773,"Out of all options, I started to see a gastroenterologist who was trained as a functional medicine practitioner, as recommend by Dr. Greenblatt."
8774,who is also trained in integrative medicine has helped me a lot.
8775,"Yeah, giving up gluten sucked....but there are days that I wake up, without taking my daily psych meds and feel right as rain."
8776,"As a kid, I was raised on a lot of weird eastern medicine."
8777,"Not to say Eastern medicine isn't valid (the stomach-ache finger-prick thing, anyone?"
8778,"), but I think there are times that western medicine prevails."
8779,"I know she's going to go to Korea, and get told to try some more eastern medicine."
8780,keeps taking random eastern medicine in hopes of trying to fix herself but its not doing anything.
8781,now she's in Korea looking for even more eastern medicines.
8782,I used meds and they helped but felt like it was just a band aid.
8783,I have been taking on my anxiety without meds now for a few years and  just don't want to go back.
8784,One of my recent posts I made was right before a panic attack I had because my doctor refused to fill my anxiety medication and he still is refusing to fill my prescription because he wants to see me but has no reason to.
8785,"My therapist and I were working so well with everything, I was going to work regularly and school getting fair grades but after the other night and being off my meds I'm defeated."
8786,My manager doesn't understand my condition and will get furious if I call in but even thinking about being in that environment right now is making me start to hyperventilate... my mother is thinking of taking our doctor to court because this isn't the first time he has refused me medication just to have me come in.
8787,"He also started me on anti-depressants and decided to stop filling them 2 months later because he changed his mind, but did so without informing me or my mother and without giving me any other form of medication."
8788,"I really think medication (Xanax possibly) is the only solution to my anxiety, I don't think I will be functional without it."
8789,I've tried medications.
8790,"I think with the right CBT, I could make some improvements, or maybe even medication?"
8791,I wanted to post here to encourage those thinking about trying meds or in the process because I feel it saved my life in a way.
8792,Sure I may find the right meds and I may find nice coping mechanisms but I will never be normal.
8793,"For now, all we can do is cycle the meds and live to battle another day."
8794,Would they insist I go on medication and see a therapist?
8795,I have GAD and haven't taken any medication for anxiety and depression for over a year now.
8796,I discontinued the medication in December and went through about a month of withdrawal.
8797,"i'm 21, and i've only tried meds once and that was when i was 16. it left me feeling drowzy all day, every day so i cut it out."
8798,"my mom picks up, ""mom, i'm having a really bad reaction to my meds, i think i'm dying, what the fuck do i do."""
8799,"she tells me to calm down, it's probably just the meds."
8800,By the way I don't want to take meds and I already am seeing a therapist.
8801,She was completely understanding and even shared that many of our family friends struggle with anxiety and take various medications.
8802,"My question for you all is what meds have you taken, what has worked for you, what are side effects?"
8803,"The thought of going to the next training put me into panic mode, and I tried to work through it, I really did, telling myself it’s all in my head, doing deep breathing, taking my anxiety medication… but I couldn’t bring myself to actually leave the house, so I just quit."
8804,"The job has been going alright, but the health insurance doesn’t cover anything until I hit my ridiculously high deductible, so I can’t afford my therapy or medication anymore."
8805,"Other than work and social situations, the meds are helping a lot."
8806,"I stopped the medication and am no longer sick, and I'm getting attacks pretty much daily."
8807,"F/26/US/insurance covers therapy (going to my third session tomorrow), medication and doctor visits."
8808,"I looked it up today, and some people are saying that the tinnitus never goes away even after they stop taking the medication, and now I'm afraid to take it."
8809,"Also, what other medication should I ask my doctor about if I'd like to get off of this one?"
8810,"This past December I was put into an institution for being suicidal...long sory short, my narcolepsy meds made me a little crazy...Im on different meds now, but I cant seem to shake this feeling of wanting to die."
8811,"I suppose my reason (if any) for wanting death is so that I dont have to worry about my medication anymore...so my parents never have to worry about me, so that I have no more responsibilities, etc...I am just so sick of everything."
8812,I ended up beating it without medication afree getting a job and telling myself I have to get on with my life even if it means dealing with the symptoms.
8813,"(Since I started meds [currently my psych-relating meds--meaning not all were meant for psych, but all can be psych meds--are Topamax 200mg, Klonopin 2mg, and Wellbutrin 200mg] the dreams ""branched out"" a bit from the constant death, fighting, chasing, being chased, and so on."
8814,I should note however that my mother has depression and takes medication for it.
8815,"The doctor reassured me that everything was fine, that she wasn't pregnant and that I didn't need anxiety medication, so I went on but the fears continued."
8816,"I know sometimes it can take time for the meds to work right, and I want to know what tips you all had for managing the physical symptoms, because at this point they are practically unbearable."
8817,My SO picked up some Quiet Life tablets and asked me to give them a try until my medication is ready for pick up.
8818,"Last winter, it was just so severe that I couldn't leave my house (I was also getting off of a medication)."
8819,"After getting off of this medication -  I was put on a number of other medications - all with paradoxical reactions (for example, I was put on lexapro and it simply made my anxiety worse)."
8820,"So, I got off all of the medications that I ""tried out"" for my anxiety as they made my symptoms worse."
8821,I am currently back on the medication that I was trying to get off (Klonopin 1 mg a night).
8822,"I got off of a medication (Klonopin) only to be put on medication that made my symptoms worse..only to be put back on Klonopin
3."
8823,I'm not sure if this is just a really unstable time and therefore I'm more anxious or maybe my meds don't work as well?
8824,"I've done it briefly in the past, but have never been on the meds and talked to someone."
8825,"I don't want to be on these meds forever, but I can't function off of them at this point."
8826,"Also, I have not seen any results with my anxiety (which was the reason I was prescribed these medications) and I'm wondering if Sertraline isn't right for me."
8827,EDIT: I'm taking 50 mg of both medications.
8828,"Hello, I'm debating on taking anxiety medication."
8829,tdr; Would like to try anti-anxiety medication over the counter before going to family doctor to see if it helps and if I actually need it.
8830,"So, like the title says, I've been trying to get off of anti-depressants/anti-anxiety meds for nearly a year now."
8831,"My issue is that, on top of my thyroid meds I find that I need to drink 1-2 cups of coffee a day to stay awake properly, which causes my anxiety to kick into overdrive and I find myself worried, and nervous and all that fun stuff over nothing or tiny issues that normally I would just be mildly anxious about."
8832,"If so, did meds help?"
8833,"After I turned 21, maybe because I got on medication (Paxil) or maybe just by random chance my life began to change and I developed the social life I had always wanted."
8834,"In 5 years I've had 5 different doctors try to help, been on tons of different meds, including 4 this year, CBT with and without a doctor, other workbooks, mindfulness, exercise, breathing, etc."
8835,I don't take any medication for anxiety other than propranolol for when I have to do class presentations - so maybe 2-3 times per year.
8836,I really have no desire to get on any medications if I can avoid them.
8837,"We go through these cycles of therapies and meds and fads and ideas, but we're only ever knocking the wind out of it for small periods, it's a losing battle."
8838,Also going to see the school psychiatrist to see if I can get medication that would help enough to make job hunting more doable.
8839,Yesterday evening it was apparent that my anxiety just isn't improving from medication; at least not to an extent that allows me to function normally and enjoy a healthy social life.
8840,"I am obsessively focusing on the possible negative side effects of his meds, and reading horror stories on the internet, and even though I know I SHOULD NOT, I can't stop myself."
8841,So my question is... is it ok to take this medication sporadically?
8842,I don't want to take medication.
8843,I ordered her some worming medicine off Amazon and ended up telling my parents about it so we could get her help.
8844,I suffer from chronic depression and have been fighting for the past few years to get the right balance of meds and therapy.
8845,"It's gotten much better, and my current meds (bupropion--generic welbutrin) has made me more confident and energetic, however it's come with crippling anxiety attacks."
8846,"So far we think it's the meds, because I have had 0 history of panic attacks before this."
8847,I had low vitamin D so that was partly the cause of the muscle weakness I am on meds for Vitamin d deficiency and while I am not as weak im still somewhat weak and still get jelly legs often especially now that I am home from school.
8848,"To talk about my anxiety, and ask about medication."
8849,"I want to go on medication, but I don't know what it will do to me."
8850,I'm afraid that anxiety medication will change who I am so much that she will leave me.
8851,TL;DR: I want to be a better person for the woman I love so I want to get some anxiety medication.
8852,"Anxiety people who are on meds, do you remember taking your first pill?"
8853,"•diagnosed with bipolar II and everything starts making sense
•adjust depression and anxiety meds."
8854,Any so proud or advice about using potentially habit forming medication regularly under doctor supervision to assuage the rest of the pain?
8855,"Due to my inconsistencies in taking my medication, I'm in withdrawal."
8856,I just thought I'd post this as a reminder to be diligent with taking your medication and working in therapy.
8857,"I know everyone is different and that meds and therapy are generally the best route, but is there any unique way YOU or someone you know has gotten over these attacks?"
8858,How long till the medicine has an effect?
8859,I've been getting treatment (meds &amp; therapy) for anxiety and depression for a few months now.
8860,"I've been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for almost two years, and I've been on more medications than I can remember, yet I've continued to slowly get worse the entire time."
8861,"No medication at moment, none has ever helped."
8862,During the Navy I was put on a multitude of different medications but for the last 5 years have been on 0.5mg of Klonopin.
8863,I still get severe panic attacks even on this medication.
8864,"Aside from medications, what else can I do?"
8865,Just wondering if anyone has taken this medication and what I should expect.
8866,Does anyone have any positive things to say about this medication?
8867,"Anyway, we have adjusted my meds."
8868,"But, their goal is to get me away from the ""rescue"" meds."
8869,I don't think this doc is good at adjusting meds.
8870,"I've had horrible anxiety for the past 10 years or so, on and off different medications."
8871,Hoping the meds help with this...
8872,"I'm in the middle of a medication transition right now (six months of trying to find something that will work again), I'm 27 and I live at home with my parents due to anxiety and a chronic illness, my parents (mom and step-dad) are separating/divorcing but we all have to live in this house until September, my mom has a boyfriend in Turkey and is talking about moving there eventually, I haven't had friends that aren't exclusively online friends since high school because of isolation from the illness and from my anxiety, and I feel like my world is blowing up in my face and I have no one to talk to."
8873,"Also, I'm 17, Female, no medication, no previous history of any serious medical conditions =P 

Thanks for reading my wall of text!"
8874,I must have made a bad impression because he pretty much told me there was no point in talking unless I took his expensive meds (Pristiq).
8875,"Granted it doesn't always work, especially when I'm having a conversation with someone etc but as far as walking around in the grocery store, getting meds, whatever it is, the hair helps me."
8876,"So after a rough six months of panic attacks,anxiety,therapy,doctors and trying different meds I'm on a low dose of klodapin 0.5mg half pills twice a day and 10mg of paxil."
8877,While im feeling good because of these meds is there anything I do besides take more meds to get back to my normal self.
8878,I'm at a point where I understand my anxiety is caused by stress at work and on the homefront and I want to make a good life change but I dont want to make that change with just medication.
8879,"I am also a recovering addict, so I try to stay away from anti-anxiety meds (I smoked pot for a few years, but now I am off of that too)."
8880,My parents made me feel guilty about how expensive all my meds are.
8881,How do I deal with the knowledge of how expensive my meds are ?
8882,I'm in and out of drs and trying out meds and see if one can fit with me as I keep getting some more severe side effects on ssri
8883,Has anyone else noticed increased dream recollection since starting anxiety medication?
8884,I have finally decided to get medication.
8885,"I have not explicitly asked her for another anxiety medication (currently taking 50 mg Vistaril/Hydroxyzine as needed--for me, it does nothing), although she is well aware of the frequency of my panic attacks."
8886,On and off meds (currently off) and just gaining a better understanding of what this is and how to keep it at bay.
8887,"He mentioned he has somewhat of the same issue but to a lesser degree of public speaking, and that his own son is a bit worse off than myself with multiple meds."
8888,Basically the guy is dealing with a wife in depression who continues to occasionally try and ween herself off of medication without doctor/therapist interaction.
8889,"I have been on a bunch of different meds (welbutrin, paxil, prozac, etc)."
8890,He rolled his eyes and talked about how bad of an employee my last Dr was and that she should have never prescribed those meds for me with my symptoms.
8891,*Update: I went to my GP and he said to not worry about that Dr telling me I was on the wrong meds.
8892,"He said instead of giving me a referral to a Psychiatrist, he would just administer my medications since I don't do counseling."
8893,So I ran out of my anxiety meds on Saturday.
8894,"Bad thing is with no meds until I get a refill from my doc, I have no hammer to beat the anxiety back, and none of my other methods of dealing with it are working except...

Alcohol."
8895,"I currently do not take any medication, haven't for 6 years or so."
8896,"I had heard medications could help me but as a healthy, active 17 year old athlete, I hated the idea of medication."
8897,"These were all the questions I had and they were answered; no, certain medications are not addictive, I can stop, and it won't do anything to me mentally besides halt my anxiety."
8898,"Although my medication helped me with the sudden random panic attacks and constant anxious feeling, certain topics would still stress me out and flare my anxiety up."
8899,"Last two days, with the thoughts of losing the battle to the pain meds went fantastic."
8900,"TL:DR - had high motivation, started getting a bit of anxiety, led to full blown GAD and likely hypochondria, been against taking meds for it as I feel its admitting defeat."
8901,He gave me a prescription to a low-dose anxiety medication which I STRICTLY use for on-set anxiety attacks.
8902,"I was diagnosed with GAD and trichtillomania caused by the GAD, and I decided that I did not want to go on a medication."
8903,I was wondering if there is anyone (preferably in the UK) who has been prescribed meds for their anxiety and if it has to be formally diagnosed and how they went about getting a prescription.
8904,"I don't want to go to another doctor, explain my entire story again, and take something for a few weeks until my doctor comes back and then have her change that medication."
8905,"For the better part of the past fifteen years, I've been taking meds &amp; seeing counselors to deal with my generalized anxiety disorder, specifically panic attacks."
8906,I've been off of meds for over two years &amp; have not had a panic attack in a very long time.
8907,I don't take anxiety meds.
8908,I am now with out anxiety medicine for almost 3 weeks now And I am a mess.
8909,Also I'm having horrendous and vivid nightmares as a side effect of withdrawing from some meds I am on.
8910,"The meds I was prescribed when it started to get bad made me unmotivated and suicidal after a while, so I got off of them."
8911,"I am soooo nervous to change meds again, because I had a few weeks of a REALLY positive experience with Paxil."
8912,I got prescribed Celexa and xanax today and after a long day of anxiety about taking meds I finally gave in and took half a tablet of Celexa and .25mg of alprazolam.
8913,"Idk how to explain it, has anyone else felt this way when they got temporary relief from meds?"
8914,"I've never been to this sub, but after a search led me to you...here goes:

my friend suffers from GAD, and is currently in the process of adjusting to new medication, which as you may know, can be pretty tough."
8915,I am probably about 60 to 70% of where I was before the medication.
8916,My body is apparently getting used to this medication!
8917,I've finally got to a point where I'm mostly anxiety free without the use of medication and it's scary watching myself spiral over something as silly as naked pictures of women on the internet.
8918,"Finally after over a year now on solid meds , and my family and friends being the most helpful ever, I have done more in 30 days then I have in 5 years."
8919,"I'd almost prefer a low dosage of some sort of medication to keep this in check as opposed to just being told to ""go see a therapist"", mostly because I'm afraid having that on my medical history could affect my firearm ownership or my chances of getting on a paid department."
8920,It has taken almost three years for me to admit that I needed to get on medication full time.
8921,Getting onto the medication was taxing and I felt like a zombie while I was on it.
8922,"When I decided to cold-turkey the meds, I was sick for about two weeks."
8923,I am so glad I admitted I needed some help and I don't plan to get off these meds anytime soon.
8924,I hope that anyone out there that is debating if they should or should not should know that there are so many different doctors out there and that there isn't just one medication for you.
8925,"You would take antibiotics if you had an infection, so why not take anxiety medication for your anxiety?"
8926,"Never took medication for the anxiety, but I was on zoloft for about 3 years for depression; I just got off the zoloft this past summer and I feel great other than having slight seasonal affective disorder symptoms from November-December."
8927,I'm really excited about it and I hope it will help; my first presentation is this coming Thursday and I feel like I'll actually break down and cry from sheer joy after the speech if the meds help.
8928,"I know I need to get back on medication to get this under control, but my last psychiatrist I was seeing last year was terrible and I haven't been able to bring myself to find a new one."
8929,"It's helped with the anxiety, but now I think I'm feeling more of the depression, which is what led me to try the meds in the first place."
8930,You don't magically get cured once you take meds or take to a mental health professional.
8931,Anxiety causes me to be afraid of going to the doctor to get meds.
8932,"I don't want to talk to a therapist, I just want meds that will take away the constant fear and anxiousness so I can finally make it over the hurtle of talking to people who have always known me as someone who doesn't talk."
8933,I was given some heart medication to slow my heart rate down.
8934,Am I going to need medication for this?
8935,Long story short im going to see the doctor sometime this week and im probably going to get prescribed some sort of anxiety medicine.
8936,I've been on different types of meds over the years.
8937,"I'm not currently on meds or receiving any assistance, though I'm about to go register with the doctors."
8938,"I'm not interested in taking medication day to day, taking something specifically for this ""event"" may be an option, but I'm a little worried about functioning before and after the flight."
8939,"What kinds of medication might help, should is it normal to ""dry run"" a drug I'm prescribed so I know how it will affect me if I can't really test the stressor?"
8940,if a medication is the answer of course.
8941,"I'd like to try to do self improvement on this over getting anti anxiety meds, but I'm not sure where to start or what I can do."
8942,"I've run the SSRI and mood stabilizer gauntlet, tried pretty much everything after years of being stubbornly against medication under the premise that I was ""strong enough"" to cope and deal with it myself... but nothing worked, many just made it worse."
8943,I couldn't keep track of my meds.
8944,"You try keeping track of that when they give you a prescription of 120 at a time...

Long story short, I have always had difficulty keeping track of these meds and have had a history of having to call in refills a *little* later than I ""should"" have."
8945,I figured it would be better than dealing with being accused of drug-seeking/distributing and booted out of the Medical Center when I was trying to get the medicine they made me dependent on.
8946,"For 3 months following my withdrawal last January, I was off meds completely."
8947,"It's making me more panicky, more anxious, more paranoid **and NOW** I have barely enough meds to deal with a problem that they made about 20x worse."
8948,I've considered just buying the meds off the street.
8949,"Let them waste their resources on a fucking agoraphobe that rarely leaves his house and lives with his parents, **anything** to exonerate me and allow me to actually get the medicine I currently need."
8950,"I'm on medications for nightmares and hyper-alertness because of this, which seemed to have helped in the beginning but it becoming less effective now."
8951,"Naturally, being anxious makes it very difficult to see a doctor (what if he thinks down on me, what if he tells someone I know and they pity me or think I'm weird, what if he gives me meds that make things worse, what if the meds make me an emotional zombie without me realizing it due to the comfort of not feeling anxiety and then proceeding to live my life as an emotional zombie, what if im not infact anxious and i end up on meds)."
8952,"I was on meds from the time I was 13 until I was 17, I ended up being on 250mg of zoloft a day and knowing nothing about how to come off medication I just stopped taking it, then the downward spiral came and I some how developed agoraphobia."
8953,Sometimes I will have to change medicines or periods of time will just be worse than others for awhile.
8954,Since trying meds none of seemed to really make a big change in my anxiety either.
8955,Or have I just not found the medication that is right for me?
8956,"Helloooo, so I have always thought i've had some kind of anxiety disorder but never really went and was tested for it, though I am diagnosed and perscribed medicine for my ADD."
8957,"I think I am also a hypocondriac so, when I take meds, my mind flies."
8958,"How do I make him understand that when I get like that (which isn't often anymore thanks to a cocktail of medication and my own techniques for diffusing my anxiety during a situation), that I don't want to talk and I want to be left alone and it is unfair to me that he expects me to just get up and get over it (which I do more than he does when it comes to keeping my problems away from my daughter)."
8959,I've been taking some medication (sertraline) for the first time for 3 weeks now.
8960,"Also, what other long-term meds are people taking?"
8961,"I look at this subreddit, and google searches, and the stuff/medicine out there for all of us, and it kind of pisses me off that people are making so much money off of us."
8962,I stopped taking my meds like a week ago because the side-effects were getting to be too much to handle.
8963,I haven't built up the courage to call and set an appointment with my doctor to see about trying new medication because along with the side-effects that were bothering me I don't feel like they were helping with my anxiety.
8964,"If I take anymore of my meds, I'm pretty sure I will fall asleep from them."
8965,My weight was all the way down to 90lbs and I some how pulled myself out with no appointments or meds.
8966,I've been successfully treated for my bipolar disorder with Lamictal 200mg daily during this time and have responded well to the medication.
8967,"I’ve considered trying a benzo or getting on an anti-anxiety medication, but I also want to be able to have a few drinks on my wedding day."
8968,But if I’m on a meds I don’t want to mix drinks and turn into a lunatic!
8969,Any certain types of meds to try out or stay away from?
8970,"I'd like medication for my anxiety, I tried Xanax, but I have the paradoxical disinhibition effect when I take benzodiazepines."
8971,Does anybody else know of a good anxiolytic/anti-psychotic medication that could treat my anxiety but let me stay awake?
8972,"I don't smoke and rarely drink but I did bite my nails which turned into biting my knuckles :( 

Never been on medication or seen a doctor for it I just thought it'd get better but a friend showed me this subreddit and yeah /r/skincareaddiction helped with my bad acne so maybe someone here could help me out with my anxiety."
8973,In high school I was treated for depression and anxiety and after about a year of taking the medicine I stopped taking it on my own.
8974,"I'm currently seeing a psychologist for therapy and a psychiatrist for meds, both of which think the best course of action is exposures, exposures, exposures."
8975,What meds have helped for you?
8976,Have you turned to stomach meds instead to help your anxiety?
8977,Does anyone else take this medication for insomnia?
8978,I am pretty closed minded to anxiety medications because I was on then in my teens and lead to a manic episode.
8979,"Now I'm in therapy and taking medication, but I still feel totally incapable of making friends."
8980,I adjusted my asthma meds and voila - I'm sleeping s ton better and waking up refreshed.
8981,"I was on meds for a few months a couple of years ago and they worked wonders, but I got off because of pressure from my parents."
8982,"Please, no negative comments about how meds don't solve everything and the withdrawals are awful, because I'm very aware of both."
8983,"I tell people that I have an anxiety disorder, that something they're saying/doing is giving me anxiety, that I take medication."
8984,I feel i should stop taking the meds.
8985,these meds also have withdrawal symptoms so you have to keep taking them.
8986,I'd like to know about wellbutrin and what side effects you have on ssri's and how you deal with them and if your meds are helping.
8987,I'm not on any medicine right now.
8988,They said I had to have at least 4 visits with my counselor before I could see the doctor and get medicine.
8989,"It's only been a couple weeks, and I haven't decided if medication is the right path for me."
8990,When we fought we would say we loved each other even when we went to bed mad and days before he started the medication he told me he loved me more than anything and appreciated me so much for being such a support system in his life.
8991,When I told him the drugs were affecting him he refused to believe me but I'm convinced its he medication because he's never been a good liar and I know he wasn't feeling distant from me before he started the medication.
8992,"Now, I've been off and on medication and in and out of psychiatrist offices in my career of suffering with OCD, but I've been without meds for a long time and thought I was stable."
8993,My experience with meds hasn't been a bad one.
8994,I dislike anxiety medications because I believe my brain becomes dependent on them to work out the panic situations and deteriorates my ability to logically remove myself from the situation.
8995,"I am switching therpaists because my old therapist moved to a less than convenient location, and I'm seeing a doctor for psychiatric medications on Friday."
8996,I have / am accepting the fact that I am too panicked over health and life in general + too depressed at times to not be on medication right now.
8997,I'd like to talk to someone about medications to keep this at bay while I go through school.
8998,"If I can talk to someone and pay for meds out of pocket, that would be easier."
8999,I recognize that no one is going to want to give me meds and just send me on my way... and I'm fine with that.
9000,How do I approach the topic of medication?
9001,"My backstory: I've been depressed and anxious as far as I can remember, last year finally got on some medication that worked really well killing my then near daily panic attacks."
9002,"Only, I've now managed to triple the dosage on my meds over the past year to keep the anxiety off, and has in general done nothing for the depression."
9003,"The first couple of weeks I was on Xanax, I felt no difference and had anxiety like I had never even taken the medicine."
9004,I am proud of myself...the medicine I am taking is helping me to see I can't run from all of my problems.
9005,"Honestly my SO and I have been having weird arguments about nothing, and she says she's positive it's the new medication, and if so, I'm not sure I want to stay on it."
9006,"He has been taking this medicine for about a week now, and he keeps telling me that it typically takes up to 6 weeks to adjust to a new medication..... And I'm adjusting to it just as much as he is, if not more so."
9007,"I know that it's really not his fault and he was prescribed this medicine from his psychiatrist, but i think it would be in his best interest if he were to get off of the medicine before he gets addicted to it (as it is highly addictive) and ends up depending on the medicine to control his minor anxiety, instead of trying to  take his own actions and procedures to control his anxious behavior."
9008,"To be completely honest, I would rather have my boyfriend be himself with minor anxiety, rather than continue this medication and act so differently."
9009,I've been on meds for over a year now and I still feel like crap and like I can't handle anything.
9010,I've switched meds twice and got my dosage upped twice.
9011,"I am taking meds, and just started my fourth kind in as many months, so my body is still adjusting."
9012,"Ive been to therapy, taken meds, read a bunch of self-help/anxiety/confidence stuff, and the conclusion is, I still feel like shit."
9013,"He's not on any medication, he's convinced all his anxiety/depression stems from withdrawal from being on klonopin for a little while, and he's not seeking therapy."
9014,I keep trying to remind myself that the transition from meds is part of the issue and it will soon even out... but I just am not coping well at all.
9015,And please don't direct me to any medicine or drugs.
9016,She's pretty granola so her help pretty much involves therapy and holistic medicine.
9017,"Not to mention, she is very against ""Big Pharma prescribing medicines people don't need"", I'm barely allowed to take my ADHD medication as it's always an argument when I need to get my prescription re-filled."
9018,I didn't have anxiety so much anymore but my doctor said it would be good to take medication ''just in case''.
9019,Should I change my medication?
9020,"Just the other night I had my first panic attack (even though it was mild), since starting my medication."
9021,What kind of things could I try to calm down until I get on meds?
9022,It feels like I'm going back to how I was before meds.
9023,Somehow my dad pretty much convinced the doctor that it was a stomach problem and probably due to my acne medication.
9024,So the doctor said he would switch my acne medication and see what happens.
9025,I always  obsessively research every medicine I take and always end up in a panic over it.
9026,The school made my sister put him on medication.
9027,"Other information: I'm on my period and two days ago, I had too much to drink at a party (first time drinking on my meds)."
9028,Does anyone have any ideas to help with the side effects of not having my medicine?
9029,"I'm okay with it now, because I know what's cussing it and it's not too bothersome, but my question is will this go away, or should I start looking for other meds?"
9030,"I quickly made an appointment with a psychiatrist and counselor, and was put on a low dose of meds."
9031,"After a couple of weeks, I started feeling even more anxious, so I decided to stop taking them (I've always been skeptical of medication, so that didn't help)."
9032,"Like I used to be on meds for it but, I got off of all of my meds, and I get anxiety attacks from everything now."
9033,My life is being overcome by this monstrous anxiety and I don't know what to do and I can't get on meds anymore.
9034,"She hadn't had an anxiety attack for about a month, she was off her medicine."
9035,"How do I get her to understand my severe anxiety/depression is a physical disorder, not something that can be fixed without medication."
9036,my friend has severe anxiety that he takes medication for and goes to therapy for.
9037,"I was taking the off-brand of Celexa, but Halloween weekend I was out of town for 4 days and I forgot my medicine, so I was off of it."
9038,"Once I got back I took 2 days worth of the medicine (over two days, not all at once) but I haven't take it in 2 or 3 days."
9039,"Is there anyway I can significantly lower my anxiety both now, and in the long run, besides taking my medicine."
9040,"I'm not worried they're thinking that I'm abusing my medication, I'm worried they're seeing all my medication and drawing a (probably correct) conclusion about how messed up I really am."
9041,"Does anyone have any advice about the medication or anything really, be it college or ways of dealing with anxiety?"
9042,"I'd rather die slow and ignorant than have to freak out and take medication every morning to remind myself my body's slowly shutting down and I'm dying, all the while working at some dead end job with no pay raise in 4 years and increasing costs of benefits (Which would be the only thing keeping me alive at that point."
9043,I'm also really concerned that I may have to be put on a new medication.
9044,"Sorry for ranting, I'm just excited to be getting off of this medication!"
9045,"I do not currently have a psychiatrist, because before the marijuana panic attack happened, I was doing great and looking to get off meds all together."
9046,"A month and a half ago I realized that I had to do something about it just to pull through the remaining year of studies, regardless of whether it would involve taking anti-depressants (my family has a strong bias against ""unnatural"" medications and a rampant fear of having an ""addict"" as a child so they are unlikely to pay for those) or going through therapy."
9047,Anxiety medication has always hit me pretty strong.
9048,Are there any anxiety medications that don't have these aide effects?
9049,"My anxiety medication doesn't help much, and I'm just really worried that I screwed my life up with smoking."
9050,I've decided to try medication for anxiety.
9051,"The idea scares me (makes me anxious of course), has anyone tried medication?"
9052,I've tried medication (anti-depressants) and nothing has helped.
9053,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but the fear of bad side effects is making me not want to try out different meds."
9054,"I'm also going to therapy so I don't think medication is the end-all cure, but I was wondering how much is a normal dose."
9055,Deep meditation isn't really helping and I don't want to go on any medication to treat this problem right now.
9056,"Or, you know, it could just be that the new meds don't work for shit."
9057,I've been taking medication for about a year now and seeing specialist after specialist for no reason I guess.
9058,"Therapy and medication have really helped by decreasing the frequency and intensity of said attacks, but I still feel lost when they happen."
9059,"Therapy, meditation, medication, books, plenty of sleep, healthy diet and gym 4 times a week."
9060,"She was doing *decent* for the first part of the medication, but now she's having significantly worse depression and anxiety around week 3."
9061,Are there any other medications we may want to look into?
9062,Right now she's only tried Lexapro and my first thought was that perhaps 1) either the dosage isn't right and needs to be adjusted or 2) we should find a different medication to try.
9063,I've told her that anxiety requires time and patience to treat as medication often needs to be changed or adjusted and also requires time to take effect.
9064,"I went to my therapist, I started medication, I started going to church, I started working out, I looked for support (online and family) and I completely cleaned out my room."
9065,"Anyways, I then started to take medication for my anxiety, and because I was so desperate to feel better, it became the only thing I would think about, and I would be obsessed with it."
9066,"Anyway, I'm now getting off the medication."
9067,I successfully got over anxiety 2 years ago and was doing so well my doctor took me off my meds.
9068,I'm back on my meds but don't know how to cope.
9069,I haven't even taken my meds (fluoxetine) since Friday and I feel better than I do most days.
9070,I've been without my medication for six months now.
9071,"Before I tell the whole story, I'll say this: I'm a 22 year old female, currently not on any medication."
9072,"=)

I'm coming off my anti-anxiety meds right now and I'm on day 5 without them."
9073,"I'm explaining what all is going down because if someone is out there who wants to quit their meds, I want them to know what can happen."
9074,"Every since I've stopped taking my meds, my urge to eat the house down has basically calmed down."
9075,"I actually gained weight when I started taking the meds, so I thought that might be something interesting to mention."
9076,**TL;DR:** I'm having SSRI withdrawal symptoms due to me going cold turkey on my meds.
9077,I got prescribed meds for it but I'm scared to take them because i don't want to think differently i don't wanna be in a dull mood i don't know if that's what happends but that's what i think it does.
9078,have you tried any natural medicine or something?
9079,I made some appointments to see a therapist and to get refills on medicine (something I've been forgetting to do for a while) and I was talking to him about it and I asked if in the future he would come with me to one of my therapy appointments so he could get a better understanding of what I'm dealing with.
9080,"I can't go home home as I can't afford the bus fare, and the last buses have stopped now anyway, but I'm without medication etc (non-anxiety related) but I missed it this morning so that makes two days now and I don't fancy getting ill. On top of that, I may have screwed up my degree."
9081,"While my interest has since extended beyond just hallucinogenic plants, I've found I'm very interested in examining the history surrounding various cultures uses of natural medicines, as well as looking at the use of psychoactive chemicals in religious and social practices in the past."
9082,"It's just so cool to me to think that, long before we could put chemical identities to the alkaloids present in plants, people were still able to utilize them in medicine, as flavoring, in intoxicants, etc."
9083,"After finally getting an appointment and going in today and speaking with temporary doctor there, she was afraid to prescribe me medication because of a bad experience I had with celexa (citalopram) that caused me to forgo treatment three years ago."
9084,The fact that it generally takes multiple tries before a medication that works if found and 4 weeks or so of taking a medication before one can know it works or not means that it will be long before I get any help while life goes on for everyone else.
9085,Now the problem I have is every now and again I will forget to take my medication for a day or two.
9086,On the second day when I finally realize that I forgot to take my meds I can feel it in my body.
9087,"When I finally go back on my meds after a few days everything goes back to ""normal."""
9088,My question is that should I be worried that I'm missing something else going on with my body and the medication is numbing it down; or like everything else is it just in my head?
9089,"**But a couple of years of therapy, medication and self-forced exposure therapy** and i'm a much more social and like able man."
9090,"*For those curious about what meds i'm on, it's cipralex 20 mg and mianserin 10 mg.*"
9091,"yogi - kava stress relief ([kava](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kava#Effects) is a for real drug)

traditional medicines - lemon balm

gaia - sleep and relax"
9092,"However, I never go in to my psychiatrist and just ask to change my meds without researching every little thing we may discuss."
9093,"In the past I have been put on so many anti-depressants and bipolar meds and mood stabilizers that I would try for a month or two, have horrible side effects and no good results, and then go onto the next one."
9094,I have lost track of the names of the medications I have and haven't taken in my adolescence.
9095,"**So, my question for you guys &amp; the tl;dr of it all:**


Are there any medications that I could ask my doctor to prescribe me after I taper off of the Xanax for good that are ***neither*** benzodiazepines (e.g."
9096,"She has meds for it, but she doesn't always take them, because she's feeling fine."
9097,"She ended up having to drive home and get her meds, and I was worried if she would get home okay."
9098,"Now she's home safe and sound, but I'm wondering if there's anything else I can do in the future to help her without having to get her home to get her meds."
9099,"Good: dr. Al-Tariq in Middletown ny
Horrible: dr. Wolfson in goshen ny this man told me to get a labotomy and wouldn't give me different meds when mine weren't working"
9100,"The medicine wouldn't have taken full effect just yet, as I'm well aware it takes time, but in the interim, I've noticed some of my more inconspicuous triggers."
9101,I have been on my medication for almost a year and all of a sudden my hair has been falling out in clumps.
9102,"At first I thought it was the meds but its been a year, side effects don't usually pop up after so long do they?"
9103,Is this very common (I'm male) and will it return with continued reduction and offing of my medication.
9104,I'm worried that for some reason that the medicine will have killed my sex-drive forever which I hope isn't the case.
9105,I began to get diagnosed with anxiety and the depression had seemed to be at a level manageable without meds around 20.
9106,"However, self-medication and unhealthy lifestyle combined with my meds (I believe) gave me a psychotic break and I ended up in the mental ward after a manic episode and suicide attempt around age 23 which resulted in a bipolar diagnosis which was retracted once I had gone off all meds and managed my anxiety in a more natural way with Xanax occasionally when I would be getting legit panic attacks."
9107,"My ideal goal would be to use the Xanax as needed and hopefully reduce the need while pursuing exercise, diet, and spiritual practice rather than pursue long-term medication although at this point I need help as my anxiety has come back to affect my ability to care for my son and work at times, which makes me more anxious and leads to panic attacks...you know how it is."
9108,"Long story short, I developed a severe anxiety and panic disorder at age 20, for which I sought treatment in therapy and medication."
9109,It helped immensely and by 22 I was feeling better every day though I did gain some weight from the medications.
9110,I'm still on meds though the amounts have been reduced and I no longer take klonopin at all (I'm also not napping three times a day anymore!)
9111,My doctor just prescribed me celexa for my anxiety yesterday (first time ever taking meds) and today I decided to do a little research on it.
9112,I feel that if I continue this medication and come home unable to satisfy her it will destroy my relationship.
9113,"Also, she doesn't know I have anxiety or I'm taking meds, and I don't plan on telling her or anybody."
9114,"It's everyday now, the meds worked for the first week it seemed but now 2 weeks in its back to how I used to be before."
9115,It's gotten to the point that I'm considering going on medication again to cope with my anxiety.
9116,Can anyone recommend an anxiety medication without these side effects?
9117,Eventually she gave me medication for 2weeks only.
9118,"I thought I would be nothing more than a lonely cat lady, drinking coffee, watching tv and popping RX medicine."
9119,"I was seeing a new psychologist today because I am out of my anti anxiety medication, which allows me to function like a normal human being."
9120,Like I was some drug addict trying to get a fix and not a sick person who wanted medication.
9121,"Cognitive therapy has been clinically proven to be as effective as medication for depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues."
9122,I've went to see a psychiatrist and he said it seems like its manageable without meds just told me to read self-help books and exercise.
9123,I feel like i should resort to meds at this point because i feel i need to re-develop habits in social situations.
9124,I have to admit i kind of fear of the side effects that come with meds but I think those can be manageable now that I've struggled so much with other symptoms.
9125,"Today, I am fully off medication...still dealing with anxiety but I am learning to tell it to ""take a hike"" without resorting to medication."
9126,"At this point, I feel like I would benefit from therapy and possibly medication again (I've been medicated before) but in the act of trying to 'self-help' my way back to normalcy, I spent hours and hours obsessively reading about psychopaths and personality disorders on a website aimed at helping their victims."
9127,"I'm going to be frank I self medicate as much as I can buying lorarazepam, diazepam really any fucking type of anxiety medication I can find just to get a few hours of relief but it always comes to an end."
9128,I was on meds (mostly Celexa/Lexapro) for about 13 years.
9129,I started taking it on Friday at just 2.5mg (I'm ridiculously sensitive to all medication) and I've been in hell ever since.
9130,"I really, really want/need this medication to help, but I can't deal with not sleeping and spending the first two hours of my day in the bathroom, not to mention feeling like I'm jumping out of my skin with anxiety (which is why I'm taking the medication in the first place)."
9131,"I don't take any pain meds, but I do take Omnicef (antibiotic) and an antifungal to prevent yeast infections."
9132,I also have hypertension that is somewhat controlled by medication.
9133,I don't like talking to my wife about it because she gets so worried and seeing me in pain and swollen and sick from herxheimer response from my meds takes enough of a toll on her.
9134,I'm a 31/M and I don't take any meds for my anxiety.
9135,I am currently taking Xanax .5mg in the morning and .5mg total throught the day as needed and Prazosin (a heart medication to control the physical symptoms of my anxiety attacks) 1mg 3x a day.
9136,"I have also been seeing a great therapist for the past year, seeing her does help but not enough to stop medication

My psychiatrist was resistant to put me on Xanax because it runs the risk of dependency, but now he won't take me off it even though it has done nothing for me."
9137,"Things were fine until she suggested I look into homeopathic medicine, which is something I don't believe in at all (except as a placebo), but I was too shy to say anything about it."
9138,"I have my anxiety under control otherwise with a therapist and medication, and have for several months, but this is my first time dating since I got help."
9139,"I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, and I've been on medication for a few years."
9140,"I got medication for my depression; funny thing is the medicine helped my anxiety, but I still felt depressed."
9141,I changed medicines and now both are back!
9142,"I started medication again, eat low carb during the day time when I work, and I chew gum."
9143,"Her: ""I haven't seen a doctor about it because I don't believe in medications or crutches."""
9144,"""I don't believe in medication or crutches because unlike some people I have will power and don't need them."""
9145,"Me: ""So you aren't diagnosed with anxiety and you weren't chewing gum to cope AND you don't take medication?"""
9146,"""Wow I wish I was you, but I'm not, I""m me and I need medication for my diagnosed anxiety disorder and I need to chew temporarily."""
9147,"My Pdoc is switching my medication, so I'm hoping that this will help."
9148,"Then when I was diagnosed, I was getting help from a psychiatrist who got me addicted to medication (10mgs of ativan literally whenever I wanted so I took it like candy) and refused to get me actual therapy and refused to explain side effects, so I thought I was going psychotic when in actual fact the medication was making me hallucinate and totally fucking up my thought pattern."
9149,"Then they sent me to a psychiatric ward and I was able to leave after a year of absolutely no real therapy besides aforementioned medication on the condition that I go to retarded classes at my highschool, where I developed severe anxiety disorders from having to deal with being locked in a room with a retard banging on a door and screaming at me through the other side."
9150,I talked to my therapist and I am going to set up an appointment with my family doctor to ask about medication.
9151,But I am also scared to take medication.
9152,So obviously I can't keep doing this but I'm scared about meds.
9153,I took a vitamin a while back and I had a panic attack about it so I'm scared the same will happen with meds.
9154,Also I've never had to ask a doctor for medicine like this since I've never had this kind of problem before.
9155,"I'm taking my medicine everyday, trying to be mentally healthy but I am falling apart and have nowhere to turn."
9156,"&amp;nbsp;

Up until today I've been completely against SSRIs, but this analogy on my self-medication has left me questioning my refusal to take prescribed medication."
9157,"Why do doctors frown upon my self-medication, even when I explain it's success for me, and continue to advocate me useing SSRI.&lt;/rant&gt;

edit: paragraphs"
9158,So a few months ago I decided that I needed help and I wanted to go to the doctor to get on meds.
9159,Side note: the meds are working wonderfully and my doctor said that I was taking the tranq a normal amount and if I need to up my dose to come see her anytime.
9160,Suddenly she doesn't like the fact that I'm on medication and she almost begins to shame me for how I am.
9161,Anyways I took one of the meds that stops my attacks.
9162,"We drop the subject for a while, but she notices that I'm a bit sleepy and then gives me a lecture on how I've been abusing my meds and need to stop taking them because they change me."
9163,She tells me I'm weak and shames me for not being able to deal with everything without meds.
9164,"I don't know if hearing about how my anxiety made it hard for me to do things I love made her realize that anxiety disorders are real, and I need medication at least for now."
9165,"Even if I know I've induced them myself, even when I repeat to myself ""You've ingested a medication."
9166,"I am not addicted to anything, I hardly even like to drink, and chose weed because I try to avoid other meds like benzo's whenever possible."
9167,But I have always been apprehensive about being on the medication forever so about two years  ago I tried to come off it.
9168,"So today, I just took 10mg of a medicine that, just a week ago, I celebrated that I was no longer on."
9169,"I don't wanna go on medication, I've tried several antidepressants in the past and they didn't work for me."
9170,"So I get a call back from my doctors nurse and she instantly jumps down my throat as well saying ""we need to alter your medication (Zoloft or sertraline as it is labeled) or you need to see a psychiatrist"" again, doesn't let me explain my situation and I'm pissed off so I request to talk to my doctor, who is unavailable and with a patient....I'm waiting for him to call me back in hopes I can explain my fucking situation to him finally."
9171,"My insurance doesn't cover much of my meds, so it's $30 a month...I know that doesn't seem like much but I'm very broke right now, so that's a huge difference for me."
9172,I took my medicine and told my boss I had to leave.
9173,"I also suffer from migraines, which a year ago, I ended up having to take my pain meds every single day which adds up to quite a lot of codeine."
9174,I use to be on meds years ago for anxiety but I started to not need them anymore.
9175,I'm worried what the meds will change about me.
9176,(Without meds)
9177,I've been on antidepressants/anxiety meds for a long time.
9178,She recommended after the first session that I see a psychotherapist for medication.
9179,The doctor glanced at my file for a few seconds and told me about the three different types of medication he could prescribe me for my apparent depression and generalized anxiety disorder.
9180,"Even if I have a reaction, I figure it's better to know i'm allergic and get the meds I need."
9181,"When something happens like going out in public, or when my parents have been gone for a while and aren't answering, or a multitude of other things, it's like I'm not even on any meds."
9182,"So, the medicine works for general worrying, but it doesn't remove everything."
9183,"I tried to get on lexapro and that was a mistake for me, I guess me and that medicine just didn't mix."
9184,"My mom thinks I'm getting better and I thought I was too, so we lowered my meds."
9185,Ive been seeing a counselor every week and im going to be put on medication this week or next.
9186,The medication has changed my life and added joy back to things in my life.
9187,So they prescribed me some anti anxiety meds 1 mg lorazepam.
9188,"In any case, I'm going to a doctor on Monday, but I'm tempted to go to that clinic again and get more meds (or at least try)."
9189,"I'm really scared to take medication, and I don't know how I'd even see a doctor here in Korea."
9190,"I guess if i have social anxiety it must be kind of bad, because i'd rather skip the counseling and just get a medication."
9191,"When he was released, we focused on getting his counseling to a more therapeutic level and the VA reevaluated his meds."
9192,"I'm not sure what more to do for him, aside from continue to encourage his counseling and medication."
9193,"I don't know what to do and I've been browsing here for a while and I finally just got fed up with it and decided to post

EDIT: Decided to talk to mom about it again, she doesn't believe me and thinks all I need are a couple of relaxers (some liquid you put on your temples after you've had a stressful day, I forgot what it's called) she says all doctors are corrupt and no medicine will do much besides get me addicted."
9194,"So they're a no go, considering reading more on prescribed medication and reading how much a prescribed amount is for a person like me and buying them illegally, I just want to get rid of this"
9195,I know I need meds and I have a few friends that are on them and strongly recommend them.
9196,I won't be able to seek professional help or meds until late-August.
9197,"I'm currently not on any medication, I was on something to bring my blood pressure down but it was causing me extreme breathing difficulties so I quickly stopped taking that."
9198,"Read many self help books, books on anxiety, been to doctors, used SSRI medication and gone to psychotherapy."
9199,Is there a better medicine other than SSRI to deal with my problem?
9200,"They've been really nice to me, and even offered to take me to the doctor to get some kind of medication, but they're usually busy, and can't really help me when I'm hyperventilating on the floor of the school bathroom while they're at work."
9201,After all this CBT *AND* anti-anxiety meds...I still couldn't do it.
9202,When I was a teenager my family tried to get me to take medication and keep me in therapy but I fought them most of the time.
9203,The pain meds aren't working so well and its making me so anxious.
9204,Now I only get anxious and miserable at work and I told myself that if a job situation got so bad that I needed to get back on meds I'd quit the job but that's not realistic.
9205,I can't just up and quit &amp; I'm not in a positive job hunting state of mind so I guess I'll have to get meds to deal with my miserable job.
9206,Anyone else just take meds to deal with work?
9207,Since 2010 I have been on and off random meds.
9208,"He should be able to get unemployment, but my health insurance is through his job (my job's is trash and doesn't cover shit, AND is like twice the price as his) and I can't afford to see my therapist every twice a week like I do now, plus my medications."
9209,"I've already been in the other much scarier type of hospital twice, both essentially from running out of meds."
9210,"She's currently under medication, and one of the pills that she's taking is an anxiolytic called tranxene (clorazepate dipotassium) It helps to keep her from going into a panic and entering a downward spiral but we're running out of stock."
9211,I'm taking the medicine for them but they won't be gone for like a week.
9212,"My question is: If I do get put on medication for it, how will it effect me personally?"
9213,Part of me thinks it would be better to suffer through the next 4 weeks regardless of the consequences on my grades just so I don't need to take these meds.
9214,But at the same time I know taking the medicine would probably really help me academically for the next few weeks while therapy may take a while to have an effect.
9215,"I sleep far less now due to being put on Ritalin (which so far has not contributed to my anxiety, surprisingly enough) in addition to my anti anxiety meds, and I do have more energy."
9216,"I researched on this subreddit, but most of the experiences are value-based, as in, ""this medicine is horrible"" or ""this medicine saved my life""."
9217,I'm going to ask about getting my medication adjusted.
9218,It's time for medicine.
9219,I feel like I'm almost ready to go off my medication.
9220,God I can't wait for my therapy appointment tomorrow and hopefully medication soon afterwards again.
9221,"Right now, I am struggling to get myself to use medication while going through therapy."
9222,"My therapist, and several doctors, have discussed short term medication as a possible solution to my problems."
9223,I really struggle with the idea of a medication that will change the way i act or think.
9224,I also don't use any medication.
9225,"I have GAD and social anxiety, and have tried pretty much all meds possible and working on taking control of anxiety myself."
9226,I am willing to take meds.
9227,Usually I feel a chest tightness and I can feel the panic attacks coming on and can take my meds to counteract that.
9228,Now that I know it exists and I experience all the symptoms I made a doctor's appointment to get help and have been prescribed a medication to help cope with both the anxiety and depression.
9229,It's hard enough to get out of bed without one of my biggest supports completely abandoning me (I only started meds yesterday - lexapro).
9230,"I've made some notes, goals, what meds I've been on."
9231,I can't sleep even when I take medicine.
9232,I've been diagnosed with three types of anxiety and am taking my medicine.
9233,"I'm working with my medical team on my anxiety, but I have a background in cellular biology and am wondering if anyone knows what meds work for panic attacks, and why they work?"
9234,I'm still not sure if the depression is a result of the medication or just because of the entirety of the experience.
9235,My SO suffers with a panic disorder stemming from an allergic reaction to medication among other psychological factors.
9236,Couple this 'diet' with exercise that would improve your physical health and leave you tired enough to sleep properly at night which would also reduced your anxiety or help you better manage it with your respective medications.
9237,She's also recommending that I see my family doctor right away and get medication.
9238,I also have some meds.
9239,"(I have ADD as well, and I suspect maybe OCD...) I know the primary course of action isn't medication, but... just how do I deal with this?"
9240,"I can't stand being given all this medication with all these side effects, when the medication I had in the past may have helped me, but now they won't give it to me..."
9241,"I would need a diagnostic report including:

* A specific diagnosis stating that I do have anxiety
* A description of current functional limitations
* Information regarding medication (none)
* Information regarding current treatment (will probably be only cognitive behavioral therapy)

Have any of you used your university’s disability accommodations and did they help you?"
9242,"But at the same time I'm battling mental health issues, including social anxiety (which I'll start medication for this week) and depression, which I've been managing."
9243,"Alcohol manages to completely melt away the anxiety and my worries if I drink enough, Im very skeptical about medications, and have been trying other natural remedies, with limited success, nothing seems to work as good as alcohol."
9244,Ten years of medication and therapy has done nothing.
9245,"I never went to therapy, and I've never been on any medications, I just... kind of dealt with it until I learned how to manage."
9246,"No meds; started therapy for the first time a week ago) 

Hey everyone."
9247,"The worst part is that she HAS anxiety, and takes medicine for it."
9248,"I've had SEVERE strep that isn't responding to treatment and therefore I've been on heavy pain meds and I can't make the usual 45 minute drive which he never makes anymore.. when his recent lack of communication was brought up, I got this; ""Sorry if textin hasn't been one of my major concerns lately the only the only topic seems to be your illness which blocks the conversation because you can't visit me and there's a reason I can't visit you that I can't tell you because it puts me in a lot of danger but also puts at us an impass meanwhile I'm finding myself more and more attracted to thinner more available women all around me and your insecurity and lack of motivation is making me unattracted to you therefore less reason to want to hold conversations with you MY sex drive is out of control and at this point you can't satisfy it in lake charles"" I can't stop shaking.. no one can calm me down.."
9249,"If I'm ill then I take medicine, get rest, drink water and wait... then it's fixed."
9250,"No, I haven't tried medication and very possibly will soon but I've got the same reservations as many, the feeling being artificial, any other affects it might have, becoming dependent."
9251,"Basically this weekend he decided he needed to get help, we (or more accurately he) decided we shouldn't move in together yet, and he made a doctors appointment (we live in Canada, insurance covers all appointments and most meds)."
9252,"I don't take meds, I never have done and I don't want to."
9253,"I can't keep not sleeping, I can't talk to my mum, and I can't ask her about making a doctors appt, as she is very anti-western medicine."
9254,"She thinks that because she gets past ""anxiety"" without medication, so should I."
9255,"BTW, I've been around the medication block several times, I'm currently on Lexapro 20 mg, and clonazepam .5 mg."
9256,"I do not take my anxiety meds before work because I am worried that it will affect my ability to concentrate and be a successful, hard worker."
9257,I went to counselling and was taking medication every day.
9258,"But because she had studied physiology as well as medicine she knew how the body functioned normally, as well as when diseased."
9259,"I knew it was related to my anxiety, and since learning how to deal with myself I no longer take the immunosuppressants or any other type of medication."
9260,"I feel so helpless.... Also, I'm afraid of what meds he'll be prescribed."
9261,Had one course of cbt a few years back but am not on medication or in therapy currently.
9262,Or should I just forget about meds in altogether?
9263,"I've changed medication several times, and it only seems to amplify those feelings of anxiety and depression."
9264,"Currently, I'm not taking my medication, as it just makes it really hard to sleep and amplifies whatever I'm feeling at the current time."
9265,"I was thinking that it could be due to my hypothyroid, since I stopped taking my meds about a year ago."
9266,I visited with my doctor last Wednesday knowing that I needed to get back on medication {I was on Prozac at one point in time.}
9267,"I read about all the terrible side effects before starting this medication, and even about the withdrawal horror stories."
9268,"I struggle with the pride of knowing I am reliant on a couple pills to keep me stable, but I must remember that just with any other medical condition, it's not my fault and sometimes medication is the best option."
9269,The first 5 days on this medication sucked.
9270,I am on medication to help regulate it and I live a pretty normal life.
9271,Taking any meds is out of the question because they knock me out and I need to be able to drive.
9272,"I tried psychiatry, psychology, various meds, until finally I found a combination of therapy and meds that worked."
9273,"I weaned myself off the meds 4 years ago and have been blissfully free of panic attacks until last night, out of the blue at 3am...WHAM."
9274,"I've been looking into anti-anxiety medications like Xanax and such, but from what I've seen on reddit while reading people's experiences with them, it all just seems so... scary."
9275,"So I got on some meds, started eating waaay better and exercising and it really worked!"
9276,"Because it's a supplement, not a medication - i.e."
9277,"I was lucky to keep my job and have a wonderful family to stand by me as I took a month to get my head back in the game, let the meds stabilize, etc."
9278,BACKSTORY: About two months ago I began taking a SSRI medication to help with my anxiety.
9279,We started off on an insanely low dosage for two weeks until I got used to taking the medicine.
9280,(I was SUPER anxious about side effects and I was terrified of taking medication to begin with.)
9281,"I've discussed this with him (actually, even before I started taking the medicine since I knew it could do this) and we both agreed that my peace of mind (and his since he worries about me) was worth anything we'd need to work through."
9282,I'm not concerned about my relationship or anything and I know I could try other medications but I don't have any other side effects so it doesn't seem worth it to start over when I feel AMAZING otherwise.
9283,"Once it was diagnosed, I was on anti-anxiety meds for a while, and had an MRI, and everything cleared up."
9284,I never took medication or had a session with a therapist.
9285,I'm also off my meds (Concerta) because they were not doing anything for me.
9286,"TL; DR:  I started having crippling Anxiety and Panic attacks about a year ago, I dealt with it thanks to my doc, and meds."
9287,I'm not on any medications for my anxiety as of right now.
9288,"But since im on effexor I can't have any fun, a couple drinks send me into madness, and I'm always worrying about being on meds all the time."
9289,"Long story short - I'm on a few meds, a daily anti depressant, and ""as needed"" benzos, and just recently seroquel for sleep which barely works and it not working even at higher doses pisses me off because it knocks most people out with 25 or 50mg, I'm doing up to 300mg at night and not sleeping through the night."
9290,"It had been two years since I had my last (small) panic attack, and I'm currently on the process of suppressing my long-term meds (1 month to go)."
9291,"I've noticed with anxiety I see the world differently than many around me, my parents believe anxiety is something you grow out of, and medication is not the way to go (idc what they think)."
9292,"Hello, I have a question about medication."
9293,"In times like these, babying ourselves can be the best medicine."
9294,I've given up looking for cures to the pain and panic attacks because no medicine or therapy works.
9295,This is the third medication I tried in six months time.
9296,"I'm going for a review of my medication on Thursday, so I'll be begging my GP for something to help alleviate the pain, but I'm already on a high dose of very strong painkillers, so I'm worried that it's something I'm going to have to put up with."
9297,Would meds be helpful?
9298,"Im already taking xanax, which takes the edge off, but i think this is beyond what medication can control."
9299,So now I am anxious because my anxiety meds are stuck in my esophagus.
9300,"They gave me medicine, and told me to lay back and try to relax my breathing."
9301,"I go home that night, calm as can be with the medicine coursing through my veins, and just sit on the couch and try to understand what just happened."
9302,I hate how anxiety medications think they can solve everything but once one thing goes away another thing shows up.
9303,"I'm getting some mild side effects, but I'm also feeling a lot more depression and no anxiety (the meds make me more anxious for whatever reason)."
9304,Did I screw up the one and a half weeks I've been taking this medication by waiting so long in between doses?
9305,"Basically my last doctor won't give me any sort of benzo-type medication because I have really bizarre reactions to them (for example, hallucinations), but I have terrible feelings of panic and anxiety that last for days and days and seriously damage my quality of life."
9306,"I neglected to ask about alcohol and the medication, since I am typically a light drinker."
9307,"If I avoid the medication for hours/days ahead, would that be enough to safeguard against incident?"
9308,"Please make it stop, I can't do anything anymore, all I can do is worry, I took the medicine but it isn't helping, this anxiety is literally going to kill me."
9309,Was prescribed some sort of medication but my parents threw it out after i made a joke (complete joke) that i was going to sell it in school.I went to the hospital twice convinced i was going to die or have a heart attack.
9310,"I have also been diagnosed with depression and have been fighting it, without medication, for the past 6 months."
9311,There are prescription medicines that a person can take however there are likewise natural anxiety relief cures that are similarly reliable and useful for any of these five major forms of anxiety disorders that include:.
9312,There are prescription medications that an individual can take but there are likewise natural anxiety relief remedies that are advantageous and similarly effective for any of these five major forms of anxiety disorders that consist of:.
9313,"He has started seeing a psychiatrist and getting meds, but I wonder what I can do as the significant other to help him."
9314,"Im waiting for my medication to kick in and hopefully it will even work (i was put on lamictal and am titrating up to 200mg twice a day, also on zoloft 100mg and Klonopin 0.5mgs)."
9315,"Also, there's a 0% chance of me getting meds to take care of this, so any advice involving meds is useless for me."
9316,I managed to escape to France two years ago to teach &amp; my anxiety and panic attacks magically disappeared; I was able to stop taking my medications &amp; enjoy the world as it was meant to be experienced.
9317,Any input on meds at all would be greatly appreciated.
9318,I went to see another doctor who said that he thought that that medication was a heavy handed way of dealing with my anxiety and prescribed me propanolol when I felt anxious.
9319,"I was on the following meds at one point or another: Zoloft, Seroquel, Xanax, Klonopin."
9320,I am not too concerned with side effects as I can tolerate meds pretty well.
9321,I have ADHD but my medication does not help my anxiety.
9322,I have been to counselling and CBT to help myself get through everyday life and for the most part it has really helped- I refuse to be on medication however due to a bad past experience and I personally believe I can work through the problems with enough brain power.
9323,"(That is not to say anyone who IS on medication doesn’t have the brain power, it is a personal thing for me."
9324,I would urge anyone to try medication if they believe they really want it and their doctors give them the option.)
9325,I don't know how to tell my parents that I probably need to see a psychiatrist and possibly get on some meds.
9326,"She had a very bad time at around age 12, hospitalised for two weeks at one stage, but things seemed to get better when she got medication and some therapy."
9327,They also don't have much money for expensive medication or therapy.
9328,"I have made myself as educated as possible about the insertion, but as usual it only helps so much

TLDR; I'm anxious about timing of anti-anxiety medication"
9329,I am already on 10mg escitalopram and I'm wondering if anyone has experience with using these two medications.
9330,"It's been at least 6 weeks since I started on the medication and I have went from 5'11"" and 165 lbs to 152 lbs and have noticed changes in my stool."
9331,"If it works out, I'll be bumped up to 20 mg

Who's been on this medication?"
9332,I've gone through so many meds.
9333,I would like to be able to handle my anxiety without the aid of medication(Mostly because I can never remember to take my medication anyway) Anyone have any good techniques?
9334,"I will say that these meds helped me (saved my current relationship, in all likelihood)."
9335,I know some people do not like taking their meds and will find any excuse to discontinue but since switching from Zoloft to Lexapro the side effects are minimal and I don't mind taking it at all.
9336,"I am petrified that without my medicine I am going to get overly mad at either my work kids or my own, or that I am going to become so anxious that I won't be able to be around them and end up fired."
9337,"But today I got some medicine with simethicone (otc stomach almost all has this) in it and my stomach got quiet, and I'm really relaxed right now."
9338,I'm hoping this will go away because I love these meds.
9339,I'm hoping this is my body getting used to the meds.
9340,The medicine helps somewhat and the relaxation stuff my therapist has recommended helps a little but only short term (I feel better for an hour or so).
9341,"P.S  I know my meds are working, my heart hasn't jumped out of my throat nor is it racing."
9342,"My insurance from the new job has only been in effect for about a month, and my dr. appointment to get back on my meds is tomorrow."
9343,In the last week or two I have dropped my medication dosage of escitalopram (lexapro) from 20mg a day to 10mg.
9344,Os this dangerous when starting fluoxetine or doing it at all on the medication?
9345,"I'm going to ask for her professional opinion on medication and therapy, particularly if he has any recommendations on someone he thinks can help me."
9346,"Birth control interferes with my medication, so I don't take it and instead use the more conventional methods of birth control."
9347,"After two years on medication, I'm feeling more stable than ever in my life."
9348,"I am schizophrenic (a mild case and it's under control with meds) and a double amputee (makes walking a chore and driving impossible for now, so getting around is a huge hassle)."
9349,Are the meds really necessay/helpful for me?
9350,I told my husband i want to try a new medication and he got mad and told me i just need to stick with something.
9351,My first day on the meds I wrote 2 and a half term papers!
9352,"I lasted just 2 months on these meds because the insomnia was pretty bad, but also I started building up this extreme agitation and social avoidance."
9353,"I saw a psychologist for six months, and was put on some meds that seemed to work at the time."
9354,"I know that my pharmacy will give out a few days' worth of emergency pills for things like blood pressure medication, but I have no idea if they'll do that for me."
9355,Its really getting out of hand and I don't want to take anxiety related medicine unless I'm truly forced too.
9356,"My second year in therapy I felt basically no better, I decided to try medication as well."
9357,"After six months on this medication I stated being able to be social again, I still had symptoms of anxiety but the full blown panic attacks were gone, so my confidence rose each time I went for a walk or caught up with a friend (which was still very rare and included a lot of last minute panic bails on my part)."
9358,She was on medication but worked very hard to get off of it.
9359,I don't know anything else I can do at this point to help myself other than medication.
9360,"I personally see nothing wrong with medication, but all the stigma that goes with it scares me."
9361,I also have friends who talk about meds being a 'crutch' only weak people need.
9362,I'm hoping that a mix of counseling and medication will help me enough that I won't need to do either for the rest of my life...
9363,"Please don't tell me to see a psychiatrist or take meds, because neither are options for me due to financial strain."
9364,Why do anxiety medications make us tired?
9365,I'm at work and I forgot my Anxiety medicine at home...I can't leave work to go get it.....
9366,I am seeing a psych and taking meds but it doesn't seem like it's helping.
9367,I started medicine but went off of it when I moved back home.
9368,Made me feel like a drug addict cause I know people can abuse anxiety meds.
9369,"I'm on new medication, but I would love to find another way to try and fix these issues."
9370,Mental illness runs in the family ( mother is bi-polar but the truckload of meds she is on now enables her true good self to now be exposed....and our relationship is good ) I  have been an extremely anxious and self conscious depressed individual since as far back as I can remember ( even kindergarten).
9371,"The anxiety and BDD runs my life,  I am on a medication now after finally accepting that i have to try something again, and was on a slew of meds all throughout my high school years...to no avail...only tranquilizers seem to help....but i take them sparingly because they can be habit forming."
9372,"I ended up getting prescribed to a few anti depressants and anti-anxiety meds (such as celexa, lorazespam)."
9373,"I wish lorazespam would help with the shakes but nothing has helped yet, meds like novo pranol make me want to fall asleep."
9374,"All the other medication is far too long-term to be effective, and I've yet to see any lasting results from it."
9375,"I'm willing to take any other medication a doctor tells me to take in conjunction with it, but antidepressants alone aren't going to fix that."
9376,I took time off to get my meds figured out and got to a good place early this year.
9377,I am still seeing the psychiatrist and the psychology and taking medication.
9378,"I was considering switching doctors a few months ago, but we finally found a medication that was showing a lot of promise, so I decided to try to stick it out and get to the right dose."
9379,I already scheduled an appointment with another provider and requested a release of all my medication information.
9380,Many years ago I discovered for better or worse that heroin was a fantastic medication for many of my difficulties.
9381,"Now, because I am stupid enough to be honest with my doctors, when I moved away from the doc who prescribed my anti-anxiety meds, I was unable to find a doctor to believe that I needed them."
9382,Being on medication in the past hasn't helped.
9383,I do not have health insurance and have run out of my anxiety medication.
9384,"I've tried lots of different medications, meditating, counsellors, even neurofeedback, but I still feel the way I did then."
9385,Maybe it's too soon to really be sure and the medicine isn't working at its peak yet.
9386,How bad is it to actually drink while on medication?
9387,"i went to a shrink once a month, occasionally took meds."
9388,I have been seeing a specialty doctor for 4 months now and all he does is prescribe me medication and up my doses.
9389,"I dont have meds to take, deep breathing only gets me so far, and theres usually something I need to go get up and do right then and cant relax and lie down."
9390,I've been on anxiety meds for more than 5 years now and none of them worked.
9391,"I've been turned on to these cannabis strands though and it's peaked my interest, I honestly don't like taking meds, my goal is to get off of them and function normally."
9392,I hate the idea of taking narcotics and prescription meds...
9393,Are there any other kinds of medication I could try?
9394,Is the nausea just a phase in adjusting to the medication?
9395,"When I was prescribed the medicine, my Dr said I could go off a 50mg dose with no side effects at any time, but after looking it up online, it looks like that might not be true."
9396,"Straight anxiety meds I can only use as a bandaid because unless I'm acutely anxious, they put me to sleep."
9397,"Today my therapist said that I'm pretty much out of options, medication-wise, because I've tried everything."
9398,At a young age I was diagnosed with severe ADHD and hopped from one medication to the next until my freshman year of high school at which point the side effects had become too much and I abandoned medication in an attempt to learn self control and deal with my misgivings on a personal level.
9399,"I was always incredibly underweight as well, a clear side effect of my medication."
9400,These intensified once I began taking higher doses of various medications.
9401,"At any rate, I can't really remember much of anything after going off of medication."
9402,"I want to succeed in school, and it seems like this medication is wasting my time."
9403,Any tips on how to conquer this without meds?
9404,"The only way I can describe the comparison is using the following videos:

[Before the Celexa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cVlTeIATBs&amp;t=7s)

[Today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv_JTjYYaQI&amp;t=32s)


My hopes with this post is that someone who is on the fence about trying medication will see that meds can actually help."
9405,"I am in therapy, I am on meds, I try to eat right but I can't get any consistent rest, except on the weekends I sleep until 2:00 in the afternoon because of the depression."
9406,"Some lingering problems seem to have permanently raised my baseline anxiety, but therapy and medication have helped me keep moving forward."
9407,I have been off of the medicine i usually take (Paxil) for a few days while i wait for the perscription to be renewed.
9408,"I don't know if this is anxiety, and if anyone is curious about what meds I take, I take vyvanse for ADHD and maybe this plays a factor in anxiety, but I just wanted to know if anyone else experiences this?"
9409,"It's taken me so much therapy and medication to get this far (applying for a job, getting an interview and accepting it) and I can't screw it up because financially I need this job."
9410,I have just started to change medications from paxil to viibryd It is too early to tell if that is going to work.
9411,"I'm a writer who's all out of words when they're constantly running through my head, a painter who's vision is simply that of my own sanity stitched together with my own thoughts rather than the medication that the doctor perscribed me."
9412,"So what I want to ask is, should I talk to my doctor about upping my medicine?"
9413,I don't even think he fully understood and suggested medicine for high bp.
9414,I'm on medication for depression and anxiety and have noticed that during the few days leading up to my period my anxiety goes through the roof.
9415,"I have asked my GP about Remeron/Mirtazapine in order to stimulate my appetite, but this medication seems to be aimed at people with major depression."
9416,Is it likely that these medications will help me?
9417,I am now on a new medication for management of my panic attacks and anxiety problems.
9418,"As it is a strong and immediate acting medication, I can say that it has already helped me in a very positive manner."
9419,"This new medication has helped me realize his advice, and I am having less anxiety and stress since taking what he has given me."
9420,"I've been advised that sertraline is the best medication to deal with my anxiety and depression, since fluoxetine didn't really work for me, but I've also been advised that propanolol can be used to treat the physical symptoms of anxiety."
9421,I initially had fears of meds.
9422,I have so much empathy to you guys - especially those who have difficulties finding the right meds and have suffered this their whole life.
9423,I'm 29 and have been off meds since I was a teenager.
9424,"I'm trying to get back on medication now, but my works insurance is spotty so it's been hard getting a prescription."
9425,"I don't even know why I'm writing this 

Does anyone have any success stories with meds?"
9426,For the past 2 years I had it under control with no need of medication until recently.
9427,"I am not suffering from a rash-presumably due to my anxiety medication, but I am having a terrible time catching my breath."
9428,"I've never taken medication for my anxiety, but I'm open to anything."
9429,"I also had bad acne (I would eventually have lazer and take medication,you wouldn't really know it as bad now.)"
9430,"Hello everyone,

My sister has been diagnosed with anticipatory anxiety, she has some medication for it that she takes at night."
9431,Is there anything that can help me relax that isn't medication?
9432,"Hi guys, I ended up seeking help with my doctor for the first time and I ended up getting prescribed paxil as my first medication to try."
9433,They gave me anti-anxiety meds and I felt a million times better.
9434,"By the end of high school my anxiety reached the point that it became a serious problem and I received some counseling, exposure therapy, and medication."
9435,"I was put on medication (Celexa, then Prozac), and had individual and group counseling (primarily CBT, and some Acceptance Commitment Therapy)."
9436,"I weened myself off of the medication, and I feel that I am once again productive and making good progress."
9437,"As one might expect, getting off medication has brought up my anxiety level a bit."
9438,The various anti-anxiety medication I've been prescribed doesn't help and often triggers panic attacks or increases my anxiety.
9439,I'm kind of wondering what I do next if therapy isn't working and medication isn't working.
9440,He finally had the balls to prescribe me medicine.
9441,"Anyways the meds started working so I began the Hell that is coming off of klonopin... became agoraphobic, but eventually I was able to go out without any klonopin."
9442,anyways the viibryd was about the same as when i was on the other meds.
9443,so that brings us to what meds i'm on currently.
9444,Basically the ADHD meds are not doing anything right now cause the anxiety is just to much to handle anything.
9445,Last night I did probably a big no no and took 2 of my anxiety medication (that's prescribed) and a half a Xanax an hour later when I realized my meds weren't working.
9446,After the first two years I gave in and went on medication (Citalopram) it seemed to be working.
9447,I'm not on meds right now but I'm seeing a psychologist.
9448,You are resistant to relaxation exercises and medications.
9449,I am not taking any medication yet but I feel like I might want to try.
9450,"I find that the medicine have lowered my basic symptoms, but when something like either a depressive mood or anxiety attack comes, then it's like the medicine isn't in my system during that time."
9451,"But besides that, i like my medicine for how it helps me in my everyday life."
9452,I'm on meds but they don't help (anti anxiety meds).
9453,"I've struggled with anxiety my whole life but not really realized it until this year, recently started sertraline and it has made a WORLD of difference in my life and I'm finally able to confront my anxiety and start looking at non-medication solutions for the long run."
9454,I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to approach talking about medication with a therapist.
9455,I'm trying to get a referral for a psychiatrist while I'm home for a while and I want to make it known that I interested in adding medication to my treatment but just the thought of brining it up makes me super anxious.
9456,I'm not exactly sure what I'm worried about other than my parents have always been big advocates of not needing medication in order to get better (that and that my anxiety is me just being dramatic but that's a different story lol).
9457,"Anyways, I was just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to talk about medication."
9458,"Title pretty much clears everything up - I'm 17, I don't like the sound of any medication that people take and I don't know where to start with therapy."
9459,"I'm 23f and not on any meds (probably should be, but afraid of approaching therapist)."
9460,I've always had chronic anxiety problems but my parents are against medications.
9461,So I have had anxiety for three years now and I just started a new medication a month ago.
9462,Back when I was a junior in high school I told my parents I'm going to pursue medicine to become a doctor (preferably a veterinarian.)
9463,"He began his lecture about how medicine is highly competitive, I can't possibly do it, it's not practical and a science degree is useless without pursuing graduate studies."
9464,"I know everyone is different, but I'm wondering what your experiences have been with Zoloft (or other SSRI medicines) and dosage."
9465,"Other things I've tried:

Motion sickness medication
OTC Anti-nausea
Beta-blockers

I started 20mg Fluoxetine a week ago which I hope will help when they start kicking in."
9466,"I have been strongly urged by doctors to use medication but I decided to try counseling (I have been seeing the counselor every two weeks for about 5 months) in conjunction with changing up my lifestyle as far as eating, sleeping and exercising goes."
9467,"I don't have anything against medication, I just want to try everything I can to mindfully manage my anxiety and be able to rely on my own strategies to relax or redirect my emotions in a positive way."
9468,"That said, I would use medication if need be but I feel like I've made progress in understanding my anxiety and what to do when I begin feeling anxious."
9469,"The medication has helped me relax, be open minded and ignore that negative voice in my head."
9470,"I told her this was not a routine follow up or a new issue but more of a ""I need to get back on my meds because things are getting worse type of deal"" (I'm waking up in the middle night having panic attacks) She didn't seem to care and continued to deny me my appointment."
9471,"All I got was a ""of course not, but.."" Anyway, she treated me, gave me meds to last three months and now I have to find a new doc."
9472,But does anyone here have experience with these two medications that they can share?
9473,"I've been suffering from them for about 6 months, but they usually hit me at home(which is why I don't take medication)."
9474,I have been seeing a counselor for about 6 weeks and today she suggested that maybe we start some meds.
9475,"By starting meds, will I have to continue them for my whole life?"
9476,What medications might a doctor prescribe me so I can do some research and come prepared?
9477,"i developed extreme anxiety for a solid 6 months (this story is not for karma whoring, just thought I'd explain), medication did NOT work for me, as I was very prone to abusing it, so I decided to go off it entirely and just brave the squalls, I went back to the E.R."
9478,"I expressed my concerns regarding medication (used to self medicate many years ago, worried about.addiction) but let her know my.boyfriend and friends were keen to support me and prevent anything like that."
9479,I just started taking hydroxy-zine pam 25 mg for anxiety and wanted to know what others have had this medication and your experience with it.
9480,I was also wondering what experiences everyone has had on this medication and others for anxiety?
9481,"I recently started taking ADHD medication, and it helps so much."
9482,When I felt like I was strong enough I tapered off the meds and was mentally healthy for the following year.
9483,It hasn't full come back yet so I still believe there is hope that I wont have to go back on meds or anything.
9484,"My blood pressure was a little bit high going in, but I've never been big on medication, so instead of taking any anxiety meds before the operation I told them no, I think I'll just do some breathing exercises."
9485,"I felt obviously weird, and for a few minutes I felt like I kind of had to focus on my breathing, but again...without anxiety medication...I relaxed and kept a good attitude, joked with the nurse, etc."
9486,"I even accepted some pain medication, which hit me IMMEDIATELY and  made me feel pretty weird, but I took a short 20 minute nap after they gave it to me no problem."
9487,Is there medication that can help this?
9488,"tl;dr my anxiety and depression symptoms are becoming unbearable, but i'm afraid of becoming addicted to the one medication that can calm me down."
9489,"anyway, i guess this is seeping into the rant/meds/depression categories, but i just needed to reach out...thanks for reading"
9490,I've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks for 4 years and I've recently decided (with much reluctance) to try meds while also going through CBT sessions.
9491,"I feel like the anxiety is out of my control, even when it's tempered by my meds, and the only reason *I'm* not out of control is because I don't have anything to obsess about at the moment."
9492,"I am unable to take medication, not because I don't go to a psychiatrist or I can't afford it but because it makes me ill, I guess I was just wondering if anyone else is / was in my boat and what they do to combat anxiety?"
9493,"I don't even want to think about talking to my psychiatrist, because I really don't think he could help me; I'm already on bipolar medication, and I can't go on any others because of money issues, so what's the point?"
9494,"Therapy, medications and self help were involved to a degree though."
9495,Through counselling and medication I got myself out of this.
9496,"I fully intend on attending therapy again, but medication is something I would rather stay away from since I had a bad experience in the past that I would rather not elaborate on."
9497,"Her uncle is a psychiatrist and prescribed her anxiety medication under her dad's name a few years ago, but her father made her stop taking it because it only made her drowsy."
9498,These medications have shown no change in the way I feel whatsoever.
9499,"Heck, I would have been satisfied with feeling *anything*, but it's as if I wasn't using the medications at all."
9500,I honestly think I just need to be put on some medication.
9501,"Hi Everyone,

I was wondering if anybody has had a positive experience taking a small dose of anxiety medication, who can share their experience."
9502,One of my biggest concerns is weight gain; I am absolutely terrified of this side effect and have heard of horror stories of people gaining 50+ pounds without changing their diets on certain medications.
9503,At the same time I am in a desperate situation and know deep down that medication could be a life changer.
9504,I'm not on medication but my mother wants me to see the family doctor to get perscribed (terrified of prescription drugs).
9505,There was a few back and forths of me might being prescribed anxiety medications.
9506,Are they OK to be taken with stimulants (Narco meds)?
9507,I think medication will help make it more manageable in addition to CBT.
9508,Did the meds miraculously kick in or is there some other factor at play?
9509,"I am on meds, though

edit2: Mania is diagnosed when three of more of the following symptoms are present; an elevated, agitated, or irritable mood, a decreased need for sleep, an increased need to talk, racing thoughts or lots of ideas, abnormally high self-esteem, difficulty focusing attention, an increased in goal-directed activity or difficulty sitting still, and reckless involvement in pleasurable activities (like sexual indiscretions, or excessive spending)."
9510,I'm supposed to be on anxiety/depression meds (Pristiq) but I can't afford the medication atm so I've had to ween off them (I only had 4 left this week) until I get paid next fortnight but before this week I've been pretty steadily on them for a couple of periods and while it makes socialising easier I still don't seem to make friends.
9511,"Your brain can play some awful tricks on you and I've experienced all of these over the years in some form and duration:

Dizziness, feeling faint, feeling short of breath, feeling as if not able to take a full breath, feeling as if close to blacking out, pounding heartbeat, skipped heartbeats, rapid heartbeat, spots in vision when blinking, fuzzy ""fogged"" vision, excessive afterimages in vision, numbness/tingling in fingers, feeling unsteady/shaky, insomnia, sudden waking due to breathing issues, metallic taste in mouth, twitching in a muscle, feeling as if muscle movements are ""jerky"", intestinal pain, chest pain, certainty in that I was going to die if I fell asleep, and on and on...

Anxiety ruled me for almost a decade with these symptoms -- It took medication and a lot of mental work to end the cycle."
9512,Or is it time to find a new medicine?
9513,Nowadays when I have the anxiety attacks specially on social occasions it reminds of how simple and smooth life was on meds.
9514,IAMA 21 year old female university student with serious social anxieties and I am terrified of how medication is going to affect me.
9515,"I tried meds briefly a few years ago, but did not like how they made me feel."
9516,"First though, this isn't medical advice or a substitute for meds."
9517,I'm not on any anxiety meds but I sure wish I had some.
9518,"I just got out of a psych hospital where they were adjusting my psych meds daily and shouldn't have been discharged when I was, I was not ready."
9519,I want to get back on medications but I'm afraid to go see a psychiatrist.
9520,Which means it is getting worse or my medication never really helped in the first place.
9521,"I think I might need to go see someone, maybe seek some counseling, perhaps even start some medication."
9522,"He is on medication and seeing a therapist but it doesn't seem to be helping, especially since he's been missing a lot of appointments lately, which I know is connected to the anxiety."
9523,"After unsuccessful attempts with both therapy and medication, and being in a place where I was satisfied with the way my life was going, I had resolved myself to just roll with the punches and live with my anxiety and hope for the best."
9524,"A lot of people coming in asking about what we think about medicine, and depending on who is online at the time, they will get mixed answers."
9525,So I want to know your medicine story.
9526,"*

*NOTE: All medicines affect different people in different ways."
9527,"Which is why prescribing medicine is so difficult, and such a long process."
9528,Ok I have had anxiety/depression for a while now and wasn't really sure if medication was the right option.
9529,Has anybody taking the anti-depressant medication called Pristiq?
9530,"The doctors have been constantly trying new medications but nothing is helping, and she is now saying things like ""I don't know how much longer I can go on like this"" and ""I don't want to live anymore if it has to be like this"" so I am very worried."
9531,"Then again, I think that meds may be my only hope for a semi-normal existence."
9532,I can't really access therapy and it turns out I'm allergic to the medication my doctor prescribed me.
9533,"**tldr**; i'm a 19 year old, genderqueer person in the USA without access to therapy/medication who can't get any sleep because of my anxiety - i'm wondering what you guys have done to help yourselves and what your experiences have been like."
9534,She has gone to see psychologists and psychiatrists and she is currently on a few different forms of medication.
9535,"I've been really proactive as far as dealing with it- reading lots of books, going to groups, using CBT techniques, therapist, medication, journaling, etc."
9536,Around this time I began seeing a therapist and a couple years later I began meds.
9537,I don’t take meds nor do I see a therapist.
9538,"Hey folks, I don't drink or take recreational drugs, nor am I on medication."
9539,"You can read my last thread I made here for some background [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gy3mn/meds_i_feel_like_im_having_withdrawals_but_i_take/)
but basically, I am having severe xanax withdrawls (extreme anxiety, general uneasiness, weird head pressure where I feel like I am about to seizure, and a general disconnect with reality like I feel as if I am going crazy.)"
9540,"I dont think I will be able to get off some type of medicine completely, but the xanax is affecting me weird and I dont like it."
9541,I feel like I will probably need some other type of medicine while I am weening off of the xanax (whether that be another benzo or maybe even an SSRI).
9542,Any help about traveling tips of Ativan medication would be helpful.
9543,My medication isn't working and I am at my wits end.
9544,Or medication just ISN'T working?
9545,"When my sister left i was beginning my senior year, testing out accutane (which you may know, is a skin medication that has a crazy side effect of depression."
9546,I'm currently not taking any anti depressants or any anti anxiety medication.
9547,I'd really like to be able to breathe... how bad is it if I take cold meds with paxil?
9548,"I was depressed, on meds for anxiety and depression and spent months researching online on how to help myself."
9549,I was curious if anyone else has ever gone off their medication and what their experience was.
9550,"About 3 weeks ago, I noticed that every night I took my medication, I was having terrible panic attacks the next day."
9551,"In between having started the pill, I found a great counselor and had some pretty profound breakthroughs that I think are at least *as* responsible as the medicine ever was."
9552,"As a result, it's been hard to discern what is the result of going off the medicine and what's the result of panic that makes sense (y'know: guilt and fear over the ensuing ticket and court date and all that)."
9553,"Overall though, I feel like I don't really feel a difference without the medication."
9554,"Has anyone else ever decided to quit their medicine, and what was their experience with that?"
9555,"I'm 19 years old, and I haven't been taking the medication long enough for it to ""kick in"" yet; I've only been on it about 2 weeks."
9556,Is tolerance an issue with SSRI medications?

9558,I really don't want to have to worry about constantly upping doses and cycling medication to keep it working.
9559,i must stop my meds to start body bodybuilding?
9560,While doing some research on other medications I came across studies saying certain anti-epilepsy drugs like this can reduce the effectiveness of birth control.
9561,"Even though I am getting things done, this is NOT good energy because I do not have the ability to calm myself down unless I take my medication."
9562,"Just curious if anyone had any suggestions for help, besides medicine, or if anyone else has gone through something similar."
9563,"I am trying to deal with all of this through therapy, medication, talking to friends, meditating, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and exercising."
9564,It sounds stupid but worked better for me than medication and many different psychologists.
9565,"I was recently diagnosed with ""Cluster C"" avoidant personality disorder and im very aware of how it affects me and my psych has confidence i can get through this without medication but im finding that its very hard for me to face ""reality"" and under stress i tend to drift off into fantasy worlds or i become ready to drift into a fantasy world to cope/avoid the stress."
9566,I've tried medication (Cipralex) which I don't want to go back to as it was not a good experience.
9567,"I haven't been able to obtain my medication because I can't just take an anxiety med, I have to also take a mood stabilizer, and the one that works best for me is expensive."
9568,"I have tried everything but meds, I have suggested to my parents about anxiety pills but they say they cause alot of problems/addiction."
9569,"They ran tests and said ""fuck it"", and put me on meds to calm my brain."
9570,"I can't drink alcohol, due to medications."
9571,So that's why i'm doing therapy and taking the meds.
9572,Should I ask for a different medicine?
9573,"i saw some of the posts here talking about medication but my therapist has never mentioned it except in the first visit, and i don't want to bring it up because i feel like i don't know whether i really ""need"" them or not."
9574,I just quit another job and I am going out tomorrow to get some medication for the first time ever and then write yet another resume for another job.
9575,"Ninja edit: I'm looking at getting medication this week, but I don't know how to find a psychiatrist in my area."
9576,"-He finds a job, and is doing 'ok'
  -I start having anxiety issues at work (random, painful, debilitating migraines [*I can't take medicine for headaches/pains anymore because when I do, I feel sick for days and can't eat which in turn gives me a headache amongst other things.....*],inability to speak to customers because of an overwhelming feeling of wanting to vomit, and what I can only assume is high blood pressure...my heart would beat hard and fast and I would get headaches and dizziness...In fact, this is probably what caused my migraines most of the time."
9577,"-I don't sleep well and sleep medications make me sick for days, as well as they do not work, and the ones that have a slight effect make me so groggy for days."
9578,"Also, medication is not an option for me."
9579,I've seen too many friends turned into emotionless zombies because of medication.
9580,"Plus, I just hate medicine."

9582,I'm a big baby when it comes to medicine.
9583,Not judging anyone who takes medicine.
9584,"I've had terrible social anxiety and GAD for all of my life, I've never been prescribed any medication for it because I was too scared to ask my parents or call a doctor."
9585,This makes me think if i am depressed and if medication might help?
9586,I am usually against medicine and being on pills but i'm starting to wonder if this will help.
9587,At the time of my diagnosis (which actually took several years to get to the bottom of) i was put on anti-depressant and anti-anxiety meds.
9588,"I didn’t like the meds ultimately, and over the years i found a substitute (making music) which actually worked a lot better than any medication I was on, so i slowly (under my doc’s guidance) weaned myself off."
9589,"My fear of medication, especially psychiatric, also really enabled my stubbornness."
9590,"She ended up recommending I see a doctor to discuss other options, such as medication."

9593,I want to go to counseling very badly or get back on medication but the nearest real town is a 1hr bus trip and I don't know how long it would take to get a counselor.
9594,"I'm on meds, but they don't nearly solve the issue completely (they do help a lot)."
9595,all the benzo's/ anti deps/ anti psychs /calm meds they put me on?
9596,I have been back on medication for 3 weeks and doubled my dose a week ago.
9597,I don't know if it's the medication causing this but I feel very alone and scared.

9604,I've had a lot of discussion lately on here and with supportive family members and friends regarding the nature of my panic attacks/anxiety and whether or not going back on meds for my panic attacks is a good idea.
9605,"In every situation, whether I act on it or not, I find myself feeling like I have to *justify* why I feel I need these meds."
9606,"Whenever I bring up the medication to my family, they give me all these alternatives that I could be doing (meditation, exercise, diet, etc)."
9607,"To stem the tide before anyone says anything, I simply want the meds as a fail-safe in case my attacks get out of control, just a safety net to fall into."
9608,"Overall,  I have a thyroid problem, and so I got my medication adjusted."
9609,"For Years I wondered why I was getting more and more afraid of going to the dentist, but it's pretty easy to understand, if you know that this medication is used."

9612,"I've been taking meds for a while now, and before I go back to uni, my Dr recommended mentioning this to my personal tutor/supervisors."

9614,"), I experienced serious anxiety for about 2 years and have happily relapsed through counciling and a little help from medication."
9615,"What kind of medication(s) should I seek out, considering my depression?"
9616,Its worth noting that I am not currently on any kind of medications for anything whatsoever.
9617,"And if I do get help and go on medication, I'm a guy... with a mental condition!"
9618,"I have been to about eight therapists in my short life, I have tried two medications, the meditation thing, working out, breaking things, basically everything to stop this kind of reaction when people get mad or yell but nothing works."
9619,Does anybody have any experience with this medication?
9620,I've been having anxiety for about a year now and was faced with taking prescribed medication.
9621,I did a lot of research on this drug because this is the first time I've ever been prescribed mood altering medication.
9622,"From what I can tell, if the medicine works, it's basically a miracle drug."
9623,"However, from what I've read on the internet, if the medication isn't a good fit, it's a terrible one to be on (terrible side effects, and pretty horrible descriptions of what the withdrawals are like; in many cases it causes hospital stays)."
9624,"Also, if anyone has any advice about Effexor as an antidepressant/anxiety/long term panic medication, feel free to bestow your knowledge and insight onto me."

9630,He then goes on to say that most people don't want to take the medicine.
9631,"I then asked a few more questions and he's like you can either take the medicine or exercise more, i'm not a councilor."
9632,"Things I tried to help it:
therapy - couple different therapists, and I think they were nearly useless
medication - got on lexapro 5 mg and still am on it
exercise -  started working out, especially lifting weights 
supplements - vitamin D 5000mg daily,  fish oil supplement 
meditation - all based on Jon Kabat Zinn's audiobook recording of ""Wherever You Go, There You Are""


My improvement was painstakingly gradual."
9633,I just remember being so disheartened surfing anxiety boards and seeing all these lifers who had been on 50 medications and never improved.
9634,I usually smoke weed and drink alcohol about twice a week but since I've started the meds I've been afraid to.
9635,"For the most part, I can say that the meds have helped a lot, though I still have a long way to go."
9636,"It worked for a few months, but over the last two months the medication stopped working, so I was switched to 75mg of Effexor."
9637,"It’s driving me insane…
I’m currently on a few medications: lamictal 100mg, 30mg Adderall, 10mg viibyrd (just started a few days ago) and was prescribed klonopin on Thursday (today is Monday) .5mg."
9638,"I’m trying to keep the dose low &amp; take it only as needed since I don’t want to build a tolerance because I need this medication to work when attempting to socialize…
Can anyone give me their experiences with klonopin &amp; how they handle their anxiety/social anxiety?"
9639,I've considered medication because of this.
9640,My two GPs want to put me on bipolar medication or antidepressants.

9644,"A lot of my life, I have felt that I have been in a fog and coming out of it thanks to medication and therapy."
9645,"Unfortunately, anxiety runs in my family and my mom is on medication for it still currently, she knows I have a problem with anxiety but I don't think anyone really knows the extent."
9646,This has all effected my life and I know most of y'all can relate...I don't want to go on medication and I wish I could just talk to someone like a close friend but not even my boyfriend takes it seriously.
9647,"I really don't want to go back on my meds, but I'm far too scared to even approach the counselor at college."
9648,Been on multiple medication cocktails.
9649,"My boyfriend is on several prescribed medications:

-Low dose anti-psychotic for sleep (only drug he's found that allows him to sleep)

-SNRI anti-depressant for depression (I don't know if he's diagnosed)

-Stimulant for his ADD (his tolerance is high but he doesn't abuse it for fun)

He has been semi-regularly smoking marijuana since college and has now increased his usage significantly, smoking everyday."
9650,"His currently gets his prescribed meds from a GP which I think, of course, is a bad idea."
9651,"I've told him gently but repeatedly asked him if he can accept the possibility his marijuana use is actually hurting him in the long run, both in negatively affecting his prescribed medications and causing stronger anxiety/depressive episodes because weed only temporarily eliminates his symptoms."
9652,His response is that it is too scary to try and change anything right now medication wise.
9653,Am I right to suspect that perhaps his current cocktails of medications is no longer working for him (or at least they need some modification) and/or that the marijuana use is exasperating his symptoms?
9654,"It is also important to note that my girlfriend has been out of the country for 2 weeks and wont be back for anothee week, and I miss her tremendously, and my mind just wanders.......

My question really is, how do I control this without medication?"

9661,I went off my meds a couple months ago because I was working on an intense film project for school and kept forgetting to take them and I ran out.
9662,"I don't want to go back on the medicine because the side effects are ridiculous and it's expensive to keep having to go back and forth to the dr, and I rarely have time to do so, especially so often."
9663,My mom had ADHD but didn't realize it until she was so old that all of her relationships had been built around that personality and the doctor said she'd be better off not to take medication.
9664,The benefits don't seem to outweigh the costs with the meds I've tried.
9665,My only thoughts are that my meds are in the fiance's Jeep.
9666,I'm thinking about taking advantage of my Short Term Disability insurance so the bills get paid and so the doctor and I can work on some different supplemental meds to go with the Welbutrin.
9667,"TLDR: had a panic attack at work because I can't find my meds, start having the ""I'm going insane"" thoughts and disassociation from my body feelings."
9668,Reading about other peoples struggles on this sub I realize that I could have it a lot worse as I am fully able to function in society and do not take medication or necessarily see any need to.
9669,"it took me to go see a therapist what was really wrong with me, ive always had depression, but im a rather positive person, even with these drawbacks, i geuss the worse thing about it is it trick your mind so much that danger seems real, its truely amazing if you think about it, im far from 100 percent, but im working on it, im currently on no meds, its hell but im trying to overcome things naturally, the only meds i take is for blood preassure, but its only because my family is very rpone to high hp, and mine has been perfect for a long time, and physically im am as helathy as i can possibly be, dont smoke or do drugs and drink very little, i wanted to give anyone going through the samething advice."

9693,"This is real,  it was a positive test result,  I have medication that can **fix** it,  instead of being up all night crying with the pain and worrying about getting into work when I can't leave the toilet or when I do I can't cope with the discomfort,  only to go to the doctors and it be a negative result."
9694,This is mainly down to me running of my medication and I can't get anymore till Monday.

9696,I would rather see a psychiatrist because I’m interested in trying medication.
9697,"How do I do that, other than seeking heavy medication?"
9698,"I take escitalopram and it really helps my anxiety but it makes my depression (not taking meds for it) a lot worse, it also makes me a really angry person."
9699,When I'm not on my meds I'm too busy worrying about things and thinking it's all my fault but when I take the pill I tend to get really on edge and angry and start blaming the other person.
9700,"Also note, she is taking medication."
9701,"In general, my anxiety has been under control through the combination of therapy and medication, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this sort of thing."
9702,"Because I have problems regarding taking drugs/getting high, I can't bring myself to take any form of medication out of fear that I'll end up high."
9703,I didnt have insurance and I couldnt afford to keep up appearances with the therapist or dr or meds so I stopped going.
9704,I am going to be making a appointment with the APRN there to talk about meds.
9705,My psychiatrist is at the point of putting me on meds i have taken before.
9706,i have gained 65ibs since i've started on anti psychotic meds and its accelerating.
9707,meds make me feel tired and stimulated at the same time.
9708,I really don't think these meds are supposed to be used for prolonged use.
9709,i feel like i'm going crazier on these meds because i know ill eventually get dietbetes from this unhealthy weight gain.
9710,Adding to that im starting to hallucinate visual and having a hard time concentrating on these meds.
9711,Thinking about going off meds and start smoking weed.
9712,"I sprawl out all the things I use day to day: bobby pins, remotes, cups, medicine, etc etc."
9713,It has gotten so bad that once I tried to kill myself with the same medicine that is suppose to be saving me.
9714,"I've tried therapy for years, many different meds, and now all I have is Xanax which helps at least prevent panic attacks (but my lovely doctor wants me off them cause it's not ""long term"" but doesn't have me on anything else, so I'm starting to get worse again and he don't seem to care)."
9715,"Listening to stop worrying tapes and lectures, meds, therapy (had to stop, new insurance has a 30 co pay and that, on top of dr visits, just isnt affordable to me), hypnosis, the whole mirror thing (both positive and negative attempts to convince myself), motivational post-its, and so on."
9716,So I was recently diagnosed with REM Behavioral Disorder and my doctor is wanting me to take medication for it.
9717,I know they're can be a lot of side effects with these types of medications.
9718,"Since then, was a mix of medication (zoloft) and later CBT."
9719,"I went to see a doctor for my anxiety, and she has referred me to see a psychologist, and suggested I take medication (specifically sertraline, i.e."
9720,"Zoloft)

I'd like to try medication as my anxiety is quite severe, but I'm more than a bit scared of the idea."
9721,"I'm seeing my doctor again tomorrow so am going to ask her more questions, but could anybody share their views on medication, or experiences they've had personally with sertraline or other SSRIs?"
9722,Any tips on how to be more comfortable taking medication or your experience with Ativan or flying with anxiety?
9723,"We got it under control with the meds but now I'm finding it easier to get really, really mad, externalize my anger and lose it."
9724,"However, the medication has made my anxiety EXPLODE."
9725,"I called my doctor, and they told me cut the medication and half, and that definitely reduced the issues a little bit."
9726,All medications I have tried have helped very little.
9727,I have had very minor anxiety even on my meds but for the most part it was working pretty well.
9728,Go to the doctor and get medication.
9729,"Horror stories come with every type of medication or therapy, and in the new age of conspiracy medical faults turn into diabolical schemes."
9730,"I just saw a therapist for the first time, and they suggested that I get back on medication for my anxiety."
9731,"So I took medicine, felt better and forgot about it for a few days."
9732,"But the next week the cramping came back again, so I went to the doctor and took another bout of medicine."
9733,"No matter how much medicine I've taken, I just feel so so wrong."
9734,"I'm set on an actual psychiatrist since they can actually prescribe medication (and I'm pretty sure that's what I need), but it seems that psychiatrists don't like to work evenings and weekends."
9735,"I found an office that has a psychiatric nurse practitioner who can prescribe meds, so I'm headed that route for now."
9736,I’m glad I can take it only when I need it but the idea of medication is still freaking me out.
9737,I am on medications but I still want others who deal with this problem to talk with.
9738,Just wanted to know how to talk to a doctor about anxiety and getting medication to manage it.
9739,I didn't find it necessary to go on medication until a traumatic event 2 years ago really threw me into the deep end.
9740,"He told me that they don't prescribe those types of easily habit forming drugs much anymore, and instead put me on Pristiq after discussing my problems with past medication."
9741,Can anybody recommend anything to help with the transition onto a new medication?
9742,Ever since taking my meds this AM I have felt like my muscles are connected to a generator powered by the sun.
9743,"Last week I had my first visit with my new therapist and I'm having a dilemma... 
My old therapist told me that the first thing she does when she starts seeing someone new is tell them to stop taking anxiety medication."
9744,TLDR can't decide if I should take anxiety medicine or not
9745,I have very sensitive anxiety and lately I've been on medication (5 weeks and counting) and today just thinking about a scary preview that came on TV got me worked up.
9746,"The medicine is helping in the fact that I'm not going all wigged out, but it's still there:( Just needed to vent."
9747,"I'm on medication for my anxiety, and it usually helps me to calm down in anxiety provoking situations, but not this time."
9748,I'm kind of opposed to taking medication because I've heard of horror stories of the addictive properties of benzos and how hard it can be to get off them.
9749,"When I feel normal I dont want to seek out counseling or medicine, but when I feel crappy I feel like I need it."
9750,"The doctor said he could prescribe some medication, but at 19 years old, I don't really want to be taking medication for the rest of my life."
9751,"This is the second medication that I have tried, the first being seroquel."
9752,What medications have you been on that don't cause drowsiness?
9753,"I feel something like xanax which is more of a situational medication, such as a date or an interview,  would better suited for me."
9754,"it's not just gonna go away

my relatives are SUPER homophobic fundies, they live in a small town in texas inhabited almost entirely by conservatives over 60, and they fucking scare me and i have to go visit them on saturday to help them clean stuff up and i cant get out of it oh god oh god oh god help i feel like i'm gonna die i reallllly dont wanna go

i'm not on any anxiety medications because i had a REALLY bad experience with abilify and a creepy psychologist in middle school (i think 7th grade?)"
9755,The insomniac medicine they give me at least helps me fall asleep.
9756,"She was not like this before the meds,  she would overschedule sometimes, but not nearly this bad."
9757,My medicine (Citaloprame) does nothing and when I went to the doctor to change it they just increased my dose.
9758,I'm scared to take pain medication afterwards.
9759,"I've had pretty severe anxiety most of my life, and as a result I've mostly been on some medication (buspar 3x daily and xanax as needed for full blown panic attacks)."
9760,"After a month, I can ask my doctor about different medication or something."
9761,I don't really know what to expect since this is my first time on medication.
9762,"It was a Godsend when I first went on the meds, but the side effects have begun to outweigh the benefit I get from them."
9763,"I recently started doing some research into natural supplements, and made the decision to go off of the prescribed meds and begin a more natural treatment plan."
9764,"I knew the side effects from going off the meds were going to be bad, but I had no idea they were going to be like this."
9765,"The most ironic part is that I'd probably give in and go back on the meds at this point, but my research has shown that once you mess up the cycle (even by missing the timing of your dose) the medicine is less likely to work and is MORE likely to have negative side effects."
9766,I've been referred to a psychiatrist to determine my proper dosage of anti-anxiety meds.
9767,"I haven't really found a common thread

medications(if any) = none

country = Canada

insurance = ?"
9768,Any suggestions for backup supplements/medicine/treatments if something doesn't work?
9769,Are there any long-term effects of these supplements/medicines?
9770,"I had been taking the generic for lexapro (on prescription), but recently, I have been wanting to try and get off meds because they really weren't doing anything."
9771,"He gave meds a very brief try, same with therapy, said they did not help and were expensive."
9772,I'm considering seeing a psychiatrist but I'm worried about medications and side effects.
9773,Anyone know of meds that are known to work like Cexela ( It really worked for me but the sides sucked) with my happiness and Valium with my nerves/panic attacks but w/o the side effects?
9774,**TL;DR** Need input on meds out there that won't cause sexual side effects (Celexa) or make me passout (Valium) so I can research and talk to my Dr.
9775,"None of those things have really worked and now I am 19 years old, I am on no medication, I have no therapy and I feel completely lost."
9776,I did try various meds.
9777,PS: I refuse to take medication.
9778,"anxiety over taking anxiety meds... awesome..)

Fast forward to April, and out of nowhere, I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my lung."
9779,"I know they're not the same drug, and I'm aware that everyone reacts different to certain medications, but if I feel better when I get that boost of serotonin from taking Tramadol, is there a chance that the Lexapro may actually make me feel ""normal?"""
9780,"&amp;nbsp;

A year ago I started my first project about nano medicine in chemo therapy and it turned out to be really stressfull."
9781,"I ***do*** take medication, which does help quite a bit in retrospect, but obviously that can't cure everything and I still get anxiety about certain things- i'll just start with my job story now..


About a month ago I got hired at my very first job ever, retail at an amusement park."
9782,Now before this I had tried every stomach medicine I could get my hands on in a store.
9783,"I have been taking an anxiety, nausea medicine that has a helped a little."
9784,I am also scared that the doctor would put me on some medication when I really don't need it.
9785,"I've always been against medication due to my anxiety(scared that it changes the way you think,act etc and also side effects)  I started celexa 2 days ago on a 10mg doss for 2 weeks then up to 20mg until the summer where i willl go off it and see how i feel."
9786,The reason i finally decided to get on meds were severe stomach aches caused by anxiety.
9787,"Taking the meds arent helping psychologically though (because i know they haven't started working yet) but im getting negative thoughts, my stomach feels worse just knowing im taking the pills."
9788,I did not feel this way at all prior to starting my new medications.
9789,"I don't take meds, I do take high doses of B complex and some calcium and magnesium."
9790,After 5 different medications I found one that works with minor side effects *yay!
9791,My Dr. said I should avoid caffeine due to it reacting poorly with the medication.. Any advice on how to stay awake?
9792,"While on it, I've also discovered that caffeine, imitation sugars, and many allergy meds (which I need to not be miserable..) make my anxiety hit hard."
9793,And here I am married to a heart attack survivor who's on 5 diff meds...
9794,"I KNOW the answer is therapy and medication, but that's not doable right now."
9795,"Starting meds for the first time, only been on them a week."
9796,"So Torn…Dealing with Sexual Side Effects

I am a 22 year old woman, and I suffered from awful GAD before starting on meds."
9797,"When my boyfriend gives me head, my reaction is hardly affected by the meds, and him touching me with his hands feels only slightly less good."
9798,"I try hard to tell myself “If you feel better, it’s because the meds are working” but I’m not convinced."
9799,"Maybe it’s because it’s getting sunnier that I’m feeling happier, and the fact that I am now on meds is just a coincidence, or maybe it's because my first year of teaching is coming to an end, and ahead lies months of relaxing vacation and then a job at a better school."
9800,"I'm only an 18 year old guy, I'm not on any meds at the moment."
9801,"The medication did not, however, help with my anxiety."
9802,"Got meds for, I want to say lorazopam?"
9803,I take my medicine before I leave for work (2 hours late) but I can already tell it's going to be a bad day.
9804,"I went to the doctor and she put me on Xanax and Zoloft and it's only been a few days so nothing has changed and I'm trying not to rely on the Xanax too much and this is my first time on meds so it makes me nervous and all I can really do now is wait and see what happens but until then I feel kind of helpless, you know?"
9805,I've never taken any medication so I'm a bit worried about the side effects.
9806,I have been put back on medication and I guess it's starting to kick in.
9807,I've got some homeopathic medication (Bach Rescue night spray) and Seroquel (which I was prescribed during immediate withdrawal but just made me really tired) which will suppposedly help me sleep but I am still just so fucking terrified of the night and would rather just keep playing games all night but I know that will just make everything worse (two nights in a row with no sleep would obviously not be benifitial).
9808,I've always had anxiety but it's gotten progressively worse the past year so my doctor prescribed me medicine.
9809,"The last time I saw my doctor, she said we would discuss whether or not to take me off the anxiety medication I am on."
9810,"We decided this before I started taking the medication since I don't want to be dependent on it forever, I just was having such bad anxiety I wasn't functioning almost at all."
9811,I never noticed truly how much anxiety I had until I toke the medication and it calmed it down by like 90%...
9812,"The problem is I'm really scared, I don't want to depend on medication my whole life to deal with anxiety, but I'm scared that if I get off of it, I will feel how I did before."
9813,"The medication is helping me through a lot of past issues since now I don't get horrible panic attacks every time I think about my past so I know that I won't be as bad when I get back off of them, but I'm still really scared."
9814,"TL:DR - I'm probably going to get off my anxiety medication in May, but I'm nervous, is there anyone who has any stories about getting off their medication?"
9815,I've tried a few meds and I'm on Fluoxetine (Prozac) right now and have been for maybe 7 months?
9816,I've had severe anxiety and depression for the past 12 years and haven't gotten on any meds up until this past month.
9817,I was finally able to make an appointment to get medication for my depression and severe anxiety this past month.
9818,Go to support groups get on medication or go see a therapist!
9819,I'm basically going to go with self-help and meds.
9820,-Have only been prescribed meds after my first panic attack and have just got some through friends after that as needed.
9821,"I started taking Zoloft 50mg on the 26th on November, it is now December 17th making it a day shy of 3 weeks on this medication and I can't even describe how terrible I feel."
9822,"I find it difficulty to even leave the house, I've never had any of these problems before but my psych keeps telling me to stick with the medication for another few weeks and that I need to get out of the house."
9823,For whatever reason my anxiety is especially bad today which is funny because this is supposed to be an anxiety reducing medication.
9824,i called my doc and asked him if maybe i should just take 200mgs at night instead of twice a day but he said no and that i need to stick it out and get used to the medicine.
9825,im so done with switching meds (ive been doing it for over a year and a half and have tried just abot everything on the market) that i hope this is the one that will help.
9826,"He has a general anxiety disorder that he admits to, has seen a therapist for in the past and takes medication (*Ativan*) for."
9827,"I see a psychiatrist on campus and she says that they can't prescribe benzos just due to the population they serve (kinda stupid, they do the same with ADHD meds too though.)"
9828,Do any of you have experience with some other sort of medications that might apply in my situation that I could at least bring up to my doc?
9829,"No more therapist, medication has ceased."
9830,"I'm on Paxil and I have a therapist, but the meds aren't helping and I don't have an appointment for a while."
9831,Is there a daily medication for anxiety -- one you'd take once a day which relieves anxiety throughout the day?
9832,"I realize there's medication like Xanax which you use for temporary relief and which lasts relatively briefly, but is there something for anxiety control for the entire day -- similar to how one would use a daily antidepressant?"
9833,I was wondering if anyone has experienced the same and maybe knows how to stop it or what medications could really help?
9834,So I've recently started taking an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication.
9835,"But the medication made it go away completely, and since I'm not taking it anymore, it's come back."
9836,I really really really don't want to take the medication again.
9837,I took some xanax once and that helped stop it but I don't have any anti-anxiety medication.
9838,"I've never been sure if I should get help, if I have the money, or if medication is a good idea or if my symptoms are even worth seeking help for."
9839,Are you on medications?
9840,I do have anxiety problems and have been prescribed meds.
9841,"A decade ago, I went through pretty much all the major classes of anti-depressants under two separate psychiatrists, and none of them worked at all, so I have more or less zero belief that further attempts at therapy or medication would be effective (on I think reasonably good grounds, though of course it's hard for me to know how warped my own thinking is, and I know that thinking this is a common delusional aspect of severe depression)."
9842,I'm wondering if medication might help.
9843,Last week i started with the meds that come along with it.
9844,"I'm sitting here, all dressed and with my make up on for the first time since i started my medicine, but i'm frozen."
9845,I'm getting sick of feeling unlike myself and I don't know how to go about getting medication.
9846,"I have to take Xanax for my anxiety, and I am incapable of being able to handle problems without medication."
9847,Should I talk to my GP about switching meds?
9848,I've been on/off meds over the past decade.
9849,"I've been through a gamut of medications since then, prescribed by m.d's in each town I've lived in."
9850,"I agreed to accept medication again, but as my title says, I'm afraid to start, afraid of it not working, afraid of it making me sick, afraid that I will be denied my meds and end up in withdrawal again."
9851,"I think I need to go on medication to at least take the edge off while I get back into therapy...my boyfriend and I are going back to university 2700 km away from home...(him for law and me for biology), I don't exactly feel ready for the move or for school."
9852,"Those who are on meds, do they really help?"
9853,"I don't take any medications, not even Tylenol...unless I have a migraine."
9854,Is it possible to go onto the meds for however long I need them and stop taking them when I feel therapy is enough?
9855,"I'm going to see my therapist this week, so I'm sure she will be able to answer these questions...just want some advice from people with real experience with anti anxiety medication."
9856,Think I need meds to take the edge off while I get back into therapy.
9857,About a year ago my girlfriend told me she has severe anxiety and takes medicine for it and sees a psychiatrist and everything.
9858,I can't take medication in fear of becoming manic or something similar.
9859,I have been off my medication for about a month.
9860,I decided I don't want to take medication anymore.
9861,I've tried four different medications.
9862,Does anyone know of any decongestant/cold medicine that's safe to take with Luvox?
9863,"when I mentioned that they had helped (years ago, and I've tried several types of meds, too)."
9864,I guess I didn't seek help because of the anxiety itself and fear of the side effects from meds.
9865,I'm willing to put up with medication if it can help set my life back on track...
9866,"I basically stay at home everyday which is a rather stressful environment...
 

**Maybe medication can set me on the right tracks**

My thinking is maybe it can help me sleep better instead of lying awake anxious and feeling fatigued the next day."
9867,"**The medication I'm looking into**

I've done some basic research..."
9868,Which specific meds should I look into (and perhaps the typical dosage)?
9869,I went to my psychiatrist after months of unsuccessful counselling and I've been put on medication.
9870,I start taking the medication tomorrow.
9871,"I know maybe I shouldn't feel bad, but I had no idea medication was this expensive."
9872,"I'm also incredibly afraid of medicines and anesthetics/sedatives because I'm afraid that they'll kill me, so looking up the medicine on the subreddit wasn't such a great idea."
9873,and I do charity events and I feel like the medicine would just ruin all of my fun.
9874,"My parents have already paid for the medicine and everything so I don't think I'd be able to switch to another, as if there happens to be another that's better."
9875,I really don't think I need a medicine.
9876,I hate that my parents and doctor completely ignored my requests to not be on medication.
9877,"**TL;DR - My parents and doctor are pressuring me to get on Zoloft, and after reading the side effects, I quickly became even more afraid of taking any medication at all."
9878,Maybe that's what was holding me together because my anxiety meds don't seem to really do anything.
9879,My doctor thought I definitely needed meds so she put me on Effexor extended release and lorazepam.
9880,"I don't want to just be on meds, that only puts a blanket on my issues, it doesn't exactly make them go away."
9881,"I don't want to take any medication, I'd be frowned upon as everyone here seems to expect the 'ideal' family, and having to break with that image would dent my image even more."
9882,"Bottom line, considering some history of mental issues on my mother's side, she decided to schedule me an appointment in April with a psychiatrist to see about anxiety meds."
9883,My therapist says people with OCD generally benefit from medication but I would like to try some natural remedies.
9884,I am not currently taking any medication.
9885,"I'm sick of using medication, although it helps to a certain degree, but there are always side effects."
9886,"I'm worried that if I start taking medication and it makes my anxiety much better, then I'll have no reason not to get forced into an awful job that I'll hate."
9887,On the meds I felt like I had my whole schedule lined up and I knew everything that needed to be done.
9888,Went to a doctor to get medication but he wouldn't prescribe me anything and instead referred me to a psychiatrist.
9889,"After I stopped my meds, I was okay for about a week, but now I get them everyday."
9890,"I refuse to go back on medication, for 2 reasons, I don't want to rely on them, the fact that I'm relying on medication for it can sometimes be a trigger for anxiety itself some days."
9891,"The other reason being that I don't want to experience the side effects that one gets when you go back on medication, in my case Prozac."
9892,"If youve stopped your medication, could you tell me if this is normal?"
9893,"I do take a medication for my ADHD, Concerta 36 mg but if anything that makes my sounds trigger sensitivity worse, I live in the US ."
9894,"I'm 2.1mo off klonopin, which means I'm flying high without any specific anti-anxiety medication."
9895,"Ive tried meds and i couldnt keep on them, i been seeing a psychologist for almost a year now but made very little progress."
9896,"I want to pursue therapy and going on medication, but the problem is that money is tight in my family right now and our insurance sucks so I don't think that we can afford it."
9897,"If anything I'd like to go on an effective medication for now as a short term fix, until our financial situation improves."
9898,"Now I'm working on it but I'm wondering if meds for blood pressure will help me in long term, or will they just cover my anxiety??"
9899,"Back in January I saw a quicky-clinic doctor because of a sinus infection, I wasn't feeling very well and was taking and over the counter cold medication."
9900,I'm sure we all know what happens when you simply search for any medication stories.
9901,Can anyone contribute or offer advice on what I'm going thorough or possible medications to help?
9902,"I'm on medications for it that work okay but sometimes, like always, my thoughts overwhelm me."
9903,"They gave me medication that I'm only supposed to take if I have really bad chest pains, or another episode."
9904,I don't want to be on medication and depend on something else for a personal issue.
9905,My mother is extremely against medication for mental illness.
9906,"I have suggested to her that I try a psychologist first to hopefully learn how to deal with this without medication, but she's even against that."
9907,"I'm on Prozac, but I'm thinking about asking my psychiatrist to up/add meds for the week that ill be there."
9908,"I guess that puts to rest any question as to whether it's effective, but I'm just curious if anyone has experienced the same thing when you miss a dose of anxiety meds."
9909,Or is this a side effect of my meds?
9910,"Antidepressants, benzos, beta blockers, natural meds, will not be outright cures, but will raise the emotional bar significantly to create a positive space where you can work through your issues."
9911,I have struggled heavily with this when adjusting meds.
9912,Knowing that reduces my anxiety about being dependent on meds.
9913,"**

*Edit: Behavioural experiments challenge you to remove your safety behaviours and learn that the situation is a normal one, that you have done it on your own and without your safety behaviour, whether it's self reassurance, medication, taking water with you everywhere, a friend etc."
9914,"Been on more medications than I can remember for anxiety and depression since 12, and therapy since 10."
9915,"I am interested in CBT though I don't know a ton about it, I definitely do not want to be prescribed medication, and maybe I would like to start by just doing a general consultation?"
9916,"I've explained repeatedly that I already have a therapist, that I don't want a new therapist, that the cost concerns me, that I'm only interested in medication management."
9917,"I just started a my first ""real"" job and don't feel like it's a good time to shake anything up, but no time is really that great to get off the meds."
9918,"I've tended to be anti-medication in the past but have heard stories about how pharmaceuticals have done a lot of good, though only with anti-depressants."
9919,Has anyone here had any experience taking anti-anxiety meds?
9920,"The doc wants me to try Celexa, and if it works just have it be a short term solution (3-4 months), then return to no medication."
9921,I currently have anxiety but have been trying to forgo meds in favor of CBT.
9922,"My original anxiety symptoms were chest pain, throat tightness and fogginess so it's hard to distinguish between withdraw from the meds or a return to baseline."
9923,"And either way, even when I do get the meds figured out..."
9924,Prior to last week my symptoms decreased and I felt that I was able to control the anxiety and depression well with breathing meditation so I was starting to ease off of my meds (.5mg Xanax - 50mg Zoloft.)
9925,"Just as a side note, I personally suffer from depression, which manifests mostly as severe anxiety, and I am prescribed Prozac but struggle with my own feelings about medication and how if affects my personality, as well as my family's attitudes about depression and the stigma in society."
9926,Still they gave me meds and I took them but I stopped after a few months because they made me feel weird.
9927,"For the record, I am diagnosed and currently taking medication for Bipolar Type 1/Rapid Cycling."
9928,"I am usually pretty well controlled with meds, but also suffer from depression because on top of my anxiety I have physical pain that drives me insane."
9929,"No med change (in fact, no meds, because my doc is on a goddamn sabbatical) , no change in eating habits or in any coping method I would normally try."
9930,"If I DID need medication, can a therapist prescribe me something?"
9931,He is on medication for his anxiety and has been for about 8 years.
9932,"I stay up at night, wondering if he has grown dependent on the meds or if hes suffering in silence, or if I'm overreacting?"
9933,I thought my medication was in the way of my feelings.
9934,"Forgot tags:

[help][rant] maybe [meds] (I am sure tags won't work in the body... sorry)."
9935,I am being given kid's medicine!
9936,Still took the meds but now I didn't care too much and had beers on the weekend.
9937,"She had me (like before, which I skipped) on many medications."
9938,"Adding more and more medicines and upping doses, to the point I was taking 8mg of Klonopin a day and still felt anxiety all day long."
9939,"He went to my house, changed my doses and medicines."
9940,Doses and medication were in the norm.
9941,"There's a saying here, not sure how factual, that medicine in Mexico is 25 years behind the US."
9942,"Before starting my medication in January, I had been suffering from a high degree of anxiety for a year and dealing with it without medication."
9943,So I started seeing one of the doctors at my work at their other practice and we had to change my medications around once but once I was on the Celexa Buspar combo I was great.
9944,"(Something that happens when I'm upset)


And now I'm just laying here contemplating going back on my medication and making an appointment with my doctor and all that jazz."
9945,I ordered her some worming medicine off Amazon and ended up telling my parents about it so we could get her help.
9946,One anxious acquaintance of mine exhibits it severely enough to warrant daily medication and weekly therapy appointments.
9947,One person saw a therapist for only a brief stint until they identified a good medication schedule for her.
9948,"going ou with friends, discovering some tasty drinks in bars that before i would never have went to a bar because i hate beer, and i hate bars it's not a fun place to me, music is too loud... but there is a cool little bar with a babyfoot table and a nes-n64 to play :o clubby place with techno music and douchebags and superficials girls uhhh i hate that...


anyway dont drink while on meds.... it's stupid i know i did it and it was in moderation i was never drunk and my medications were not too strong so it didin't really did anything, but for once in my life i wanted to just have fun and freacking go, whitout wories."
9949,anyway i was on 20 mg and now i'm on 10 for 1 month and i'm finnaly free of this medication.
9950,"medications is not obligatory to get better, in my case it helped me greatly, but keep in mind a single therapy will work too, and help you solving your problems."
9951,"Pills only make the pain fade away, it will not resolve your problems, talk to your doctor if you think it's right for you or not (and dont be stupid like me who was drinking while on meds... even in small dose i dont recomand it)

even alcohol in general, i discovered a passion for tasty drink but it's not a good idea if you ask me to drink while having anxiety, a beer on ocasion is ok. but do not ever drink by yourself, you will have the illusion to maybe feel better, and it can cause a circlejerk ?"
9952,"I realize that medication and therapy work best when done together, however my anxiety issues were talked about and dealt with by my therapist a few years ago when I was seeing her for depression."
9953,"I've been on a few medicines but didn't like the way they made me feel, so I quit the second one cold turkey."
9954,"I hate taking medicine and doctors visits, so I haven't been back to see my doctor since probably this past January."
9955,He prescribed me some medication (which I have annoyingly forgotten the name of!)
9956,I did the therapy thing and I was put on medication (Zoloft).
9957,I'm still on the meds four years later and generally doing a lot better.
9958,I have gone 5 months without a regular medication (sometimes I take a clonazepam when really anxious) however i'm starting to think maybe medication could help me a lot.
9959,Just waiting for meds to kick in here.
9960,"I do panic attack almost every week and i can't deal with this anymore, even if the one of last night i have deal with my medication with homeopathy and i don't have cried."
9961,I would highly recommend Phenibut to anybody looking to try something outside of more traditional methods like medication (and all of their side effects...
9962,"I need my meds... 

Help..."
9963,"I've tried self medication, and muscle relaxers that general doctors give me... but now it's in my jaw and neck and face... i know it's going to get worse ....."
9964,"Overall I feel a lot better only a bit of general anxiety, sort of like a back ground type of thing annoying, but very much better than before taking the medication."
9965,"I'm doing everything I can (with the help of therapy, meds) to work out my issues independently."
9966,"I would like to TRY to stay away from medication, just based on personal preference."
9967,I had two sessions with the therapist and was diagnosed with anxiety/depression and was to meet with a psychiatrist the next week to decide on a medication plan.
9968,"I bailed while in the waiting room (because the thought of taking a medicine that could change/interfere with the way my mind worked scared the hell out of me), costing a fee for not cancelling the appointment in advance."
9969,"Along with CBT, exposure therapy, my meds, I managed to make it work."
9970,"I also suffer from chronic insomnia, and the last probably 8-10 months I have been taking my meds solely at night to try to help me sleep, but the same deal is i'm taking more meds and they arent working."
9971,So I quit my anxiety meds 2+ months ago.
9972,"I went from being crippled, relying on meds, to now being able to drive 30+ miles, 30+ minutes."
9973,"Which is not something the practitioner would normally do, because she is our birthing midwife basically, and knew my wife breastfed and the meds would mean we had to quit that, which was really hard for me personally."
9974,"I myself have gone through psych dr in my twenties and have my own success I suppose from being on meds, but then getting off when i felt i didnt need them anymore..."
9975,"That was the first time I tired taking medication, I took a half a peach ( Xanax ) it helped."
9976,"But I didn't start taking them, my friends got bad into them so I always avoided taking medicine my whole life."
9977,"I feel like things have been getting better though, I've never taken meds before."
9978,"For the first 18 months, I resisted medication and instead tried all that herbal rubbish, meditation and of course counselling but nothing ever helped in anyway."
9979,"So I've continued to take OTC meds, which help."
9980,I currently cannot afford to see a therapist or take anxiety meds at this time.
9981,"I've been psychologically, verbally and sometimes physically abused by my dad since i was little, he would insult me on a daily basis and sometime hit me, yet i would be a happy outgoing child, when i was 7 i had my first panic attacks, i would just say to my mom that i was afraid to die, she took me to our doctor, i was given medication and after a while it was ""gone""."
9982,"In the mean time i've seen several psychiatrists and psychologists, but talking with/to them + the medication (had prozac, xanax, deroxat and some other i can't recall the name of) wouldn't change anything."
9983,After years of switching doctors and medication with zero improvement i decided to stop everything and try to get better by myself.
9984,Having been diagnosed with GAD and seeing doctors about it for a while I've noticed that they simply don't prescribe the best medication.
9985,The weird thing about this is that she has actually been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and takes meds for it.
9986,"What kind of medication are you guys taking in SOS situations, how's that turning out for you?"
9987,I've got a friend currently in therapy that is being recommended for an elevated level of care via medication management.
9988,Has anyone ever been on some less common medications that would potentially treat both on a long term basis?
9989,"Ive never found anyone else who has this feeling so I'm looking to reddit to hopefully find someone who might have it as well
I'm not on meds and I'm wondering if anti-anxiety meds would fix this issue because I just can't take it anymore 
(Sorry this post is all over the place!)"
9990,"Im taking all the meds and inhalers but the pollen has been so high in the uk these past few weeks that they are having little effect :/

So, i felt wheezy, started coughing, and then felt i couldn't breathe enough to talk so i started to panic."
9991,I think meds are slowly starting to work.
9992,"So what are some other meds that help with Anxiety/Depression that aren't called ""Zoloft?"""
9993,"Ok, so I now know, and am sure that I need therapy and medication for this disorder I have."
9994,"I have OCD (diagnosed) and possibly GAD, as well as some other non-anxiety issues, and I am currently on no medication."
9995,I'm now on medication.)
9996,"I can no longer participate in a night of drinking with my friends, or take medication as prescribed, because any form of non sobriety makes me panic."
9997,I chose a psychologist mainly because I didn't want medication to be the quick and go to answer.
9998,I understand how this medicine works and I'm certain I can't control it.
9999,"Ive been on medications, currently practice mindful meditation, positive self talk etc."
10000,Just recently he was prescribed a medication that he said was life changing and motivates him to get everything done that he needs to.
10001,Happy stories about starting meds and feeling better would be greatly appreciated :)
10002,BTW I am on meds and have been for about 6 months now but still get attacks nevertheless...
10003,"Edit: I'm a male, 21 years old, I don't really know what type of anxiety that spurred those attacks but I usually get attacks when I have a lot of work backed up, I'm not on any medications but I am drinking alcohol."
10004,Because I was a college freshman (living in dorms and just moved back to my parent's house on Thursday) I have been unable to receive therapy or medications.
10005,"I am on no form of medication, but right now I really wish I was."
10006,The pain meds aren't working so well and its making me so anxious.
10007,I ran out of my meds faster than I usually do.
10008,"I have had my meds for around 90 days, and it was 60 1mg ativans."
10009,I am terrified that my doctor will think that I am abusing my meds.
10010,I've been trying a lot of different methods (excluding medication) to stop my anxiety.
10011,"I have nausea medicine, but it does nothing but make me less likely to vomit and even then I vomit the medicine up sometimes."
10012,I don't know about getting new medicine because my mom basically tells me to suck it up... which makes me even more frustrated.
10013,I'd like to get some kind of medication or something just so I can have a normal relationship with another human being.
10014,"Keep in mind i only have issues with anxiety but she will only prescribe antidepressants (yes i know they work for mild anxiety) or basically *not* anxiety meds... i dont know if thats just her or the whole practice, or maybe because I told her Im a daily smoker of the mj to combat misophonia (sound sensitivity) and anxiety."
10015,"(keep in mind Ive never done any other drugs and have zero experience with anxiety meds)

Most of my anxiety is school related, if that helps, but school is a constant thing in my life so that stressor combined with other things means I get anxiety about smaller stuff too."
10016,"I have no idea how to approach any of this, I kinda hate my psychiatrist, she treats me like an idiot, asks me what meds I want to try even though I told her I was new and would prefer guidance as opposed to ""well what do you want to try"" especially because when I make suggestions (this SSRI dose makes me not feel my damn clitoris, can we lower it?"
10017,"I know it will pass as I normally have strange, unexpected reactions when on new medications."
10018,I don't take meds besides something homeopathic.
10019,I don't want to be on medication anymore.
10020,The transition between the two medicines was difficult but I had a new job that was a lot better so things were looking up.
10021,The medicine has destroyed my sex drive and I don't even care about things I used to like to do.
10022,Does anyone else have a huge fear of taking medication?
10023,I feel like I lose control when I take meds.
10024,I'm at the office now but my meds are in the hotel and I am seriously freaking out.
10025,"When we are cleaning his room, I see that he has anxiety medicine, which gets me thinking."
10026,"I began taking medicine at the beginning of this school year, and it has helped me sleep a bit more."
10027,I have found that working out stops the attacks but I will look into meds due to the fact that will not always have time to work out.
10028,"Likewise, any medications that can help without making life lame again."
10029,"edit: Forgot to mention, I get panic attacks and paranoia about taking meds as well, so they need to work quick or I'll throw up."
10030,"I've recently gotten another job, and I can't afford to screw this up, I feel like I need medication to control it but the councillors / therapists I saw in the past didn't bring up medication at all."
10031,I don't know anyone who's seen a therapist and been prescribed medication here.
10032,I have never been on any anti-depressants or anti-anxiety meds before.
10033,But anyways I'm going on medication soon and while I'm not against medication I don't want to be taking another pill just because the doctor wants to appease me or my mom.
10034,I am on medication and I'm seeing a psychologist.
10035,It's not my fucking fault I have an anxiety disorder I try so hard but I haven't been able to get meds to help me.
10036,"And also, I just got my wisdom teeth out 2 weeks ago and I learned that general anesthesia and pain meds can spike anxiety threw the fucking ROOF."
10037,"I'm studying biomedicine, which means I spend quite a bit of time in the lab."
10038,"Idk if there's a question here, or just a rant, or wanting to not be seen as pathetic or crazy for being on anti-anxiety meds, but yeah."
10039,"I want to avoid getting medications because part of me feels that would be weak, that I can control it through learning coping techniques but I don't want to be too proud."
10040,"We are talking medication was messed up beyond belief, I couldn’t go a day without swinging my emotions like there is no tomorrow, and don’t even get me started on how I was with people."
10041,"More through luck than judgement however, I was able to be put on another new bout of medication."
10042,"I’m starting to realise that I’m suffering from a down cycle, but because of my medication its not as bad as it use to be."
10043,She prescribed me hydroxyzine and zoloft and I am nervous to start taking these meds in fear of them changing my personality.
10044,"I've switched medication three times now in about a years time, and been to a slew of doctors and dealt with insurance woes."
10045,"So now I'm adjusted to my medication, and need to start finding work again."
10046,"I've been prescribed with lexotan but, soon enough, I became a slave to the medications instead of being a slave to the anxiety and realized this wasn't what I wanted."
10047,"I decided I had to face my issues and day by day tried to pursue a semi normal life with no medications: went to university, had a few relations with girls, etc."
10048,I am on meds and in therapy.
10049,I told her that I wasn't really interested in taking any medication at all.
10050,My concern is she didn't really tell me anything about the medication.
10051,I don't want to start taking some long term medicine if I don't need to.
10052,I finally went it to my doctor after a year of having dp caused by anxiety to try medication.
10053,Not to mention this is a completely new doctor (she’s also a resident) and I’m afraid she’s going to think I’m making it all up just to cheat her out of some medication or something.
10054,"Tl;dr: I seem to have all the symptoms of anxiety and can’t deal with it anymore, luckily discovered a name to symptoms days before a family doctor appointment, but will she believe me or think I just want quick medication?"
10055,And although it is general and is pretty much a lingering feeling I have all day (Im on medication right now which helps)..
10056,I've ALWAYS felt better (even before meds) when I was in social settings.
10057,"I have GAD and the only way I know how to deal with it is to escape - using either prescription anxiety meds, drinking alcohol, zoning out, or sleeping."
10058,"I think I read somewhere that anxiety medication ideally is only for short-term use (maybe six months - a year or so), and should be used in conjunction with some sort of effective psychotherapy."
10059,"I'm wondering if medication would actually help in my case, or if the potential reduction in anxiety would only be short-term and unsustainable given that the therapy doesn't seem to be working."
10060,There's not much one can do except cope and take the meds.
10061,should these meds ever feel like a magic switch that makes me feel happy and healthy?
10062,"One is in charge of my personal matters, evaluations and medication while the other is in charge of my group CBT."
10063,I am also going to end up taking anti-anxiety/depressant medication.
10064,"It feels like I'm doing unpaid labour.. 

One of my psychologists mentioned prescription medicine but I have trouble swallowing even the smallest Tic-Tac™."
10065,"I'm not sure I want that because it also helps with my physical pains, and it doesn't consist of the chemicals found in 'medicine'."
10066,"The chemicals are part of why I'm semi against prescription medicine, but the marijuana can only help me so far."
10067,I'd prefer not to take medicine but if that's what it takes than I'll do it.
10068,I need to get back into therapy and find the right meds.
10069,I've been cutting back on my Xanax and I ran out and have my yearly drug screen Tues. but the medicine will by out of my system by then.
10070,The Dr. said it's to make sure you aren't selling your meds and not on other illegal drugs.
10071,I'm just guessing it would only matter if the meds were in your system if you are going back to the Dr. the soonest possible time for a refill which means you were abusing them or selling them if none was in your system but I'm cutting back and it's been four months from the last months supply was filled.
10072,"I haven't looked forward to anything in a long time, and I can't afford a therapist or meds."
10073,"I would also like to note that I am on a very strong medication for anxiety, but once I'm this worked up the attack just escalates."
10074,"Then got up in this morning, felt okay, took my levothyroxine (thyroid medication for hypothyroidism) and then half an hour later, started getting waves of panic and intense brain fog."
10075,"I just have no clue whether it is a reaction to the medication I am taking, subconscious anxiety I've had about school and family and life that has just been building up, or what."
10076,"I can only exercise very little because of my sickness and because of my medical conditions, the sickness, the plethora of medications I'm on and the fact that I get like 4 hours of sleep a night, my body is exhausted and is always working overtime, so I don't eat as much as I should."
10077,I take so many medications every day.
10078,"&amp;nbsp;

A year ago I started my first project about nano medicine in chemo therapy and it turned out to be really stressfull."
10079,"I recently was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer and went through numerous rounds of PPI medications (proton pump inhibitors like prescription Pepcid, Zantac, etc)...but nothing has helped."
10080,The doctor that prescribed me the medication told me to start at 5 mg a day for one week then work my way up to 10 mg a day afterwards.
10081,"Well after starting my medications these last two days, I been experiencing headaches and slight nausea."
10082,"I'm not on any meds, I know that I'm triggered, I don't WANT this to be a trigger, but it is."
10083,"I haven't been on meds for years because I've been able to manage my triggers, except for this one."
10084,I also do not have any medication.
10085,So I've been thinking about talking to my psychiatrist about medication for anxiety.
10086,I've been having some extreme anxiety (different from previous anxiety) and began to take the medicine again.
10087,"Anyway, has anyone else been on this medication?"
10088,Any advice or different medications I should look into?
10089,I don't belive in medication.
10090,"I didn't want to take medication, because I saw it as covering the problem and not fixing it..."
10091,PS Please do not take this post as a request to stop medication or not to seek professional help.
10092,And I have to quit my medication because my insurance is running out.
10093,"I have a mix of depression and anxiety, but the medicine I take helps a lot."
10094,Should I seek anti-anxiety meds to deal with times like this?
10095,"Please note I'm not recommending beta-blockers for everyone, I understand that different people find different meds helpful."
10096,So I always carry spare meds in my bag.
10097,It has been getting so bad that I have been thinking about finally seeing a doctor about it and maybe getting some meds.
10098,"But I've heard a lot of bad stories about meds, like getting too dependent on them, finding it hard to stop using them."
10099,"Some people even use it in place of their meds, because you can't get addicted to it or dependent on it."
10100,"If it does work, that's awesome because it's way cheaper than medication, and more natural."
10101,I've been taking medications ever since and I've been to therapy although it didn't help.
10102,I was prescribed medicine and that hasn't been a problem since.
10103,"I tried talking to one of my university's psychiatrists, but he did the same thing as my doctor back home and just sent me home with medicine (for depression this time) that didn't work."
10104,"I have a family member who is a psychiatrist who I talk to, but they can't prescribe meds obviously."
10105,"I still can't go to public school without feeling sick to my stomach, I've gotten through a lot of things without medication but I am still not anywhere near where some people are."
10106,"For the record, I'm a 21 year old female who's fairly healthy (besides the anxiety/panic), currently not on any medication/supplements, OTC or otherwise."
10107,"The therapist has told me that I really need to continue doing this when I go back to school (in another state), and to consider taking medication because this has been going on for so long that it may be chemical."
10108,"They also can't prescribe medication, which I might actually need."
10109,I stopped medications in 2011.
10110,"He said he wanted to be in touch with that psychologist, and he would decide with them if I truly need anxiety medication, which he wants to put me on."
10111,"I don't want this medication to change who I am, so I have chosen to ignore the doctor's orders, and I haven't spoken to anyone."
10112,What does the medication make people feel like?
10113,I have no medication.
10114,I've always managed to keep it under control without medication (mostly).
10115,I am wondering if how you know when the medication is working.
10116,"I am asking this because everytime I see my doctor (that I've had since I was four) she asks me if I feel any different from the medication and I always tell her I honestly can't notice a difference in me or that I honestly can't tell, but I do seem to do more in my life (first college experience, waking up early) and when I am not on it I can't do anything."
10117,"BTW even though I am back on the medication when things get really bad in my relationship I don't refrain from harming myself, does this mean the medication is wrong?"
10118,What can you tell me about this medication?
10119,"I have a history of asthma (no problems or meds for 7-8 years) and pneumonia (very serious case when I was young, almost died and once again, less serious about 9 years ago.)"
10120,I'm going to the doctor in a few days and I'm almost certain I'm going to be prescribed anxiety medication.
10121,I take a ton of anxiety and sleep meds at night but they don't help much.
10122,"Because of this I started to go see the doctors, they decided to change the travel medication I was on, however this didn’t improve anything."
10123,"I did this and ended up having a terrible night full of anxiety, all the progress I felt I made in the past few years seemed to go away and I am in full blown distress mode for the night, the next day I call him again but he isn’t at work, I call the base hospital and they connect me with the pharmacist who finds out my medication is “extended release”, the pharmacists tells me never to cut extended release in half because I would get the full dose immediately."
10124,"However, she believed that I would likely have anxiety and depression for the rest of my life because it ran in my family and made the suggestion that I go on meds again."
10125,I don't think that I need meds that bad.
10126,I'm open to meds as a possible boost until these symptoms subside but I dont think I need to be on SSRIs where I need to stay on them indefinitely.
10127,"TL;DR
Doctor told me Seroquel is ""harmless"" compared to other meds while a bit of research says otherwise."
10128,"I have never used the medication to ""get high"" or to ""feel good"" - I have only ever used it when extremely anxious or having a panic attack."
10129,"I have no money for any physicians to help, i have no money for medicine that I once upon a time took about 3 or 4 years ago for these issues...that actually worked."
10130,"I noticed that the majority of cold medicines are considered a severe  interaction, so I was wondering what's a safe to take for a cold?"
10131,"It certainly had its ups and downs for me, though cannabis is, in my mind, a fantastic medicine if you can moderate."
10132,"I have insurance, and a wonderfully supportive girlfriend, and if it’s something that’s suggested, I don’t have the aversion to medication I had because of prior experiences with the anti-depressents—I just worry that my drug experimentation might persuade doctors I’m a junkie or something, and turn me away."
10133,"They'll tell me stories of times where they have felt nervous and how they coped with it, what medicines they took or how they drink it away."
10134,My mom recently revealed to me that she suffers from anxiety and is taking medications for it.
10135,Naturally I'm someone who is  extremely anxious about taking medication in the first place.
10136,So why is the medical community so against prescribing both of these medications so fervently?
10137,"Hi All,

I have an appointment to see a psychiatrist (I think, definitely the one that prescribes meds), but it's a wait of over a month!"
10138,I've seen a psych dr and a nurse that oversees meds and this was an ok plan.
10139,It seems crazy to be on 3 meds at once and I haven't filled the script for Xanax because of this (I am worried about med overload and side-effect/interactions).
10140,"Everyday since, I have been breathing abnormally (Making this MPH sound to breath, feeling short of air, and feeling the sense to force myself to swallow and it messes me up even more) I have taken some medication, and it helped at first but hours later making me feeling terrible."
10141,"I've been with my anxiety under control for about 2 or 3 years, last year without any medication."
10142,"im on meds and they certainly help, though only for a few hours tops until the next dose."
10143,Self medication is useless.
10144,"Hi everyone,
I've been suffering from panic disorder and OCD for about 6 years now, but was never able to convince myself to try any medication because I was too nervous."
10145,"Well, long story short, everything was getting worse so I brought up medicine with my therapist and got a prescription to Zoloft and lorazepam."
10146,"I barely ever take ANY medicine, not even tylenol, because I'm just generally scared of something wrong happening and I'll die."
10147,I need to get medication but am so scared the doctor will tell me to stop worrying or try to talk to me.
10148,I just want the fucking meds and to get the fuck out of there no words needed to any one!
10149,I'm worried that if the Lexapro isn't cutting it that I might not find a non-addicting medicine to solve my problem.
10150,I have anxiety/depression that I've recently started medication for (again) but I'm worried this isn't normal behaviour at all?
10151,I think maybe I need to go on stronger medication...
10152,Ive tried 3 different anxiety medicines but nothing has helped so far.
10153,I have to taper off the meds temporarily to make up for the loss.
10154,"i gained 10 kgs since i have been eating shittily and my constant thought is that maybe it was heart related, but it's not, but still, i think I became a hypochondriac... in the last few days i was feeling much better thanks to meds but now i had 2 small attacks since this morning and i need to hear about if this is normal, how you got out of this and anythng that can help me."
10155,I don't really have anything going on in my life that should trigger anxiety or stress and I'm not currently taking any medication.
10156,"She's been trying to get me into a psychiatrist to get some sort of meds, but that hasn't happened yet."
10157,"I made progress, got onto Anxiety meds, was working on my own self, and felt I was in a healthy relationship."
10158,"I've tried everything other than prescription medication, but I don't want to just go and ask my doctor for it because I feel like he'll think I'm just drug seeking (I look pretty bad since all the stress kicked in so I may kind of look like a junky right now)."
10159,So i've been having anxiety about trying new kinds of medicines.
10160,"Also having a noticeable reaction that will effect my wedding (if my face breaks out or even loss of libido during the honeymoon)

One of the predicaments with this is that my anxiety gives me physical symptoms (most related to panic attacks) so if I get any of those I know I'm going to convince myself its the meds!"
10161,"anyway fast forward, i graduate, am on medication, sort myself out and have an ideal job opertunity come up for me."
10162,"ever since i was a kid i've allways been told my moods radiate off me and are infectious, even when i'm on medication to deal with manic highs and lows."
10163,after 2 days i'd had to double up my medication to stop me freaking out at the events.
10164,"i wanted to run out the room and scream, but the medication was numbing me so i was only screaming inside."
10165,"I'm taking my normal anxiety meds and my normal allergy meds as well, but things were getting difficult."
10166,I hope meds will work for me or some therapy will change me.
10167,"I'm on medication for the anxiety, and between the med and therapy, I've made huge strides."
10168,"I started treatment pretty biased against medicine and psychologists, but I gave it an honest shot."
10169,My idea of how to attack this was to get medication while therapy could help me really fix the underlying causes.
10170,"I first met with my psychologist in early August- after an initial session, he said ""well I don't think we need medicine for what seems like a mild anxiety""-- which very much felt awful."
10171,I went on to say I wanted to try medication as soon as possible.
10172,I don't take medication.
10173,Hey /r/anxiety I was diagnosed with GAD when I was 13 and I have been on several meds and been going to therapy since then.
10174,I'm uninsured and am not on any meds now.
10175,"I was prescribed 10mg of Celexa for anxiety, because I've reached a point in therapy and self-work where things are not improving much anymore, so I have decided I should try medication for a while and see what happens."
10176,"Also, is it true that after a while (some years), the celexa can ""poop out"" and start giving me withdrawal symptoms until the dose is increase or the medication switched to another ssri?"
10177,"I've been considering medications for my problem, but I'm not sure if that's the route I should take."
10178,"I went from having about 3 or so panic attacks a week, to maybe one a month while on medication."
10179,I have had one panic attack since (still a big change from before the medication).
10180,I'm thinking maybe I wasn't ready to come off the medication.
10181,Coming off medication too early?
10182,"It makes me worry when i hear people taking ""medication"" from doctors because doctors can be corrupt and prescribe medication to gain money for a friend."
10183,Please explain to me why i should be okay with medication as an answer over just spending more time with a friend thats fun.
10184,Perhaps i'm asking for what specific medication is good?
10185,Help me understand why or why i shouldnt trust medication as an answer.
10186,I saw my doctor and she pressured me very heavily to try a new medication.
10187,I worked very hard to get off my other meds and I still hope I can get by without daily medication.
10188,She told me that taking a medication could thwart the healing process a little because it might hide some things that need to be worked with.
10189,"I hear many different things regarding how certain medications should make you feel, what they do, what they're supposed to accomplish, and what the side affects are."
10190,Would anyone taking SSRIs for anxiety/depression be willing to talk about their experiences with different medications for reference?
10191,"Also, what is the ""right"" medication supposed to do?"
10192,over time it became a lot worse to the point where i no longer had an appetite and after trying anti anxiety meds which worked initially but stopped working i can't help but feel like my anxiety is trying to tell me something that i am not realizing consciously.
10193,"After the tests came back saying I was fine, they continued to ignore me when I said the side effects of the medications I've been on are too debilitating."
10194,I'm being given powerful medication that can entirely change the way our bodies and brains function.
10195,"Due to this, I absolutely refuse to continue with the medication."
10196,I'm going to my doctor on Saturday and telling him i want to stop with my meds (ween-off of course).
10197,One thing im afraid of though is my anxiety and depression becoming worse after im done with the meds.
10198,In 2009 I finally decided to take steps to help after a particularly bad bout of it and started meds and seeing a therapist.
10199,"Last year, I decided to try going off my meds because although things were going so well, I was having some sexual side effects that I felt were putting a strain on my current relationship."
10200,"I make less than $1000/month, $250 of it goes to student loans, $167 to my car loan, $70 to car insurance, $30 to health insurance, I buy my own food and incidentals like shampoo, clothing, medication etc, and gas since I drive a lot is running me ~$100/month."
10201,"I am a 20 year old girl at university and I used to have at least three panic attacks a week at work around 2 years ago, going anywhere was a struggle and there was a period of about a month where I couldn't quite catch my breath and had meds for it."
10202,"Through out 2013 and half of 2014 i was half assing it with my appointments, medication and therapy."
10203,"But with the help of my friends, family, medication and doctors i have been getting progressively better since then."
10204,"I felt super trap and sure i was going to die but i took my medication, did my grounding exercises and now i feel a little stable."
10205,"That's a definite deal breaker for any meds for me, at least if it's going to be an all day kind of thing, which it was, no matter what time of day it would go soft at some point more than once."
10206,"My mother wants me to take medicine to help me, but I am resistant to the idea."
10207,Are there any other non-medicine ways to help get anxiety under control?
10208,"Or am I really just paranoid like my mom says, should I try taking meds?"
10209,Could this be a side effect of my anxiety disorder and/or medication?
10210,"Before I decide to take this medication course.., I'd like to hear your success or horror stories so I can take a weighed judgement call on if it's worth it.."
10211,"Would medication/therapy that effects Social Anxiety help ""cure"", or at least treat, stuttering?"
10212,"(Escitalopram/Lexapro, 5mg) My anxiety isn't as bad as others', but I tried briefly to taper down to 2.5 mg/day a couple days ago, which led to my first panic attack since starting my meds."
10213,"Last week, I saw my doctor and he prescribed me some medication to use sparingly."
10214,"Long story short, seen more than my fair share of waterlogged corpses, been abused etc etc all leading to a pretty monstrous anxiety problem that I can usually handle on my own without medication after a long ride with a great therapist."
10215,"I have a tiny bottle of a floral anti-stress mix that i smell from time to time, a lot less since started on meds though."
10216,I'm already going to invest money for skin treatment so I'm not sure if I can afford therapy but I would really like to go to a doctor to get prescribed some anti-anxiety medication in moments where I just can't go outside due to my acne scars.
10217,"I was wondering if asking for anti-anxiety medication to temporarily deal with my horrible acne scars is reasonable, especially from the doctor's perspective."
10218,"Still, I worry that things are going to get worse instead of better, and don't know if I should see a therapist or get medication or just try to deal with it mentally somehow."
10219,"She was not willing to try medication or seek therapy, so I was ready to love her for who she was and accept that things would just be difficult for her at times."
10220,They sent me home with some blood pressure medication.
10221,"I'm scheduled to see a psych tonight but I'm honestly worried about taking psych meds and even worse, I'm afraid than any prescription would cause a paradoxical reaction, leaving me with crippling anxiety."
10222,I know I will probably eventually need medication for this but I'd rather try all other methods before going that route.
10223,No medicine.
10224,"I was put on a smorgasbord of medication for nearly 7 years, and went through endless sessions of counselling, psych visits etc."
10225,I made the decision to wean myself off the meds last year as Lexapro (the only drug that's worked well for me) was giving me liver problems.
10226,"I can't go back on meds either, no way."
10227,"I still continued drinking (says not to on bottle) while on medication and for me, it was a disaster."
10228,"It was weird, because I didn't give a shit about anything, but the Wellbutrin made me even MORE anxious than before I started taking any meds."
10229,"The first few nights off meds, it was hard to sleep."
10230,The plus side to being on meds was that I could work through my inner turmoil more comfortably.
10231,"Stopped taking meds, learning how to cope with real life."
10232,Yes I've seen doctors and prescribed all the medications but I don't like to take them because the effects are intense.
10233,I just want my anxiety to go away and to be happy again and be myself again): my medication doesn't seem to be helping.
10234,"She has social anxiety (somewhat controlled by medication), a history of depression, ocd, cutting."
10235,"I am not currently on meds, although three months ago I finished a six month course of SSRI's for GAD

My question is in regards to what I can only describe as imaginary pain, I wonder if these are intrusive thoughts?"
10236,"Also, this sounds so vain- but how many of you have experienced weight gain from medication?"
10237,My mind always seems to trick me into thinking that my anxiety isn't severe enough to qualify for medication or even therapy sometimes.
10238,Now I am going to another doctor that is closer to where I live (he knows about all of my other medications and such).
10239,Has anyone else had any of these medications together and had dreams like these?
10240,"I don't see anyone or take any meds, and I just moved to a new area so I don't know how to find doctors here."
10241,I've tried therapists and meds before but they never seemed to have an effect so I'm skeptical of even trying.
10242,I really wish I had anxiety meds to take before I went so I could be calm.
10243,"Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2gbnnz/when_should_i_consider_medication/
I didn't get many replies, but I figured the post trail would be relevant to this posting."
10244,"I spoke with my psychologist last week, and she agreed with me that I probably require some kind of medication for my issues."
10245,I can just try a different medication.
10246,"Here's the back story:

I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD and Chronic depression and have been taking medicine to help."
10247,"I got put on new medication on Monday, Concerta, Ativan and Celexa."
10248,"I'm not on any sort of meds at the moment, nor do I think that's something I'd consider at this point, so I pretty much just have to grin and bear it when I feel one coming."
10249,I'm going to the doctor today to get off these meds because they're making me so much worse.
10250,And I'm thinking maybe I need to readjust my medication again.
10251,"I didn't want to take any medication, I thought getting things off my chest would make it better."
10252,I don't want to be stuck without pain meds but I can't suffer through hours of panic either...
10253,"and my ""stats"" would be
:
age 16,male,no medication,'merica and my families insurance is busy on many other things, I don't know if we could really afford it."
10254,"If anyone is wondering, the only medication I am on is xanax, and I take it only as needed."
10255,"I've noticed I reverted to the way I was back before I was on medicine, and I was wondering if anybody has ever had this happen."
10256,"I feel like the medicine has just stopped working and maybe it's because I'm on a low dosage (10mg), maybe I need a higher dosage?"
10257,I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety and I don't have any medication.
10258,"I have no prior history of mental illnesses, I don't use any medication, nor I smoke weed."
10259,"I know why I'm susceptible to these mental illnesses and  I've half-assed tried meds, therapy, everything  

Despite having anxiety I've always managed to be strong enough to put on a face and hold down good jobs, lots of friends, been sociable and outgoing."
10260,I went to my GP yesterday and she prescribed me a new medication (citalapram?can anyone shed any light?)
10261,"He

3. asked about my meds and said ""you're only on these two, right?"""
10262,I'd given his nurses my medication list several times now.
10263,My chart should have had my medication list on it.
10264,"But he was trying to toot a medicine limited lifestyle, and I'm just sitting there thinking ""let me just hand you my diagnosis list, and you try and figure out how to get by on less medications than I have."""
10265,We get to my meds.
10266,We got to a compromise of upping the medication to the max dosage out there according to my research (2mg.)
10267,Background: have been taking 40mg of Paroxitine (Paxil) for about 8 year and also had 0.5mg of alprazolam (Xanax) in the medicine cabinet if I ever needed it.
10268,Let me preface this by saying that the medication is not mine.
10269,"They've offered to let me use some of their medication to ease my nerves before interviews, though I have not tried it before."
10270,I've had anxiety since August 2010 and have been reading and using various non-medication methods.
10271,But that medicine threw me into a panic attack immediately with no anxiety build up.
10272,I did not take any more of that medicine because 1. my reaction and 2. my doctor told me to stop.
10273,"Now that the medicine has fully cleared my system, I wanted to go to Office Depot this morning, my first time driving in a week."
10274,I don't want to rely on medication.
10275,Particularly if you are having trouble finding real medical help and medication.
10276,Different type of medicine?
10277,2.Anyone have any good results from just having therapy sessions and not going the medicine route?
10278,"(I hate taking meds)

If anyone has any question that they want to ask me feel free."
10279,but anyways it started with withdrawing from my meds (xanax) when that happened i had to deal with everything on my own panic attacks and such.
10280,After i had withdrawn from my medicine it felt like i had just dont something i thought id never do in my life and that really opened me to alot more things to do that i thought id never do.
10281,Antidepressants don't work on me and anti-anxiety meds make me more relaxed but don't help with the motivation part.
10282,"I also see my psychiatrist about every 8 weeks or so for checkups on meds, which I'm taking Lexapro right now."
10283,"I've never been on medications, nor have I ever considered them, due to my successes in dealing with these problems."
10284,"I've been seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist for seven years, but with no specific type of therapy and not a whole lot of improvement, other than medication."
10285,"The only times I feel comfortable around other people is when I'm drunk or under the influence of an upper, such as ADD medications."
10286,I am scared of medication and scared of this process.
10287,I've just been waiting for an appointment to clear with a new psychiatrist so I could get some emergency medication.
10288,"The third day my family took me to the psychiatry, that was a frightening experience, but fortunately they let me home with the diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and with some medications."
10289,My docs think its anxiety and told me to see pyschirariy but I am seeing a therapist and I will never get on meds again.
10290,"By ""quick fix"" I mean some sort of medication."
10291,"Alcohol is the closest thing to medication that I have, but it's a slippery slope and I think it's becoming a problem."
10292,"What's the strongest, most potent medication there is?"
10293,Over a month ago I was coming off because I didn't like being on medication.
10294,I keep telling myself that if I go to the emergency room I can be given a sedative or something to calm me down which is ironic considering I don't want to take my medication.
10295,"I was on medication for it (Tegretol and Prozac), but I got pregnant, so I stopped taking them."
10296,I was on fluoxetine and amitriptyline for four years but went off meds almost two years ago.
10297,My doctor just re-prescribed those meds again and Xanax when needed.
10298,"I have a psych appointment in January, that I'm hoping will allow for some medication or something, but this is a pretty immediate problem."
10299,"I know everyone is different but in your opinion, what anxiety medicine has worked for you that hasn't made you tired or sleepy?"
10300,I was at a restaurant and had my two meds in my pocket.
10301,I was struggling with anxiety for a couple years prior to starting medication and reached a point where I felt desperate to try anything that might relieve me of the daily discomfort.
10302,"Now that I feel better and feel as though I have this perspective, I very much want to stop taking medication altogether (of course, tapering with the help of my doctor)."
10303,"I don't like the idea of being on psychotropic medication for longer than necessary for a number of reasons including the following:

1. the lack of studies done on the long-term effects of antidepressants/anxiolitics."
10304,"Yes, they're safe enough on the short-term, but most of these medications haven't been around long enough for there to be substantial testing done on long-term health effects."
10305,I want to know who I am without depending on any medication.
10306,My question is- am I jumping the gun wanting to get off of meds ASAP?
10307,"I know redditors aren't doctors, but it would be nice to hear about personal experience getting off meds, getting of these meds in particular, and/or from people who feel similarly."
10308,"Ive done CBT , therapy, medication but the negative thought processes are so hard to overcome."
10309,I have a call in to my psychiatrist right now to see if he has any ideas for coping or maybe some meds to get me through this episode until this Effexor kicks in.
10310,"Many years ago I worked for a large phama firm, making Asthma medications, after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars working on on how their patient tracking system worked."
10311,"So my question for those in /r/Anxiety is - does anyone have any success stories, where they were let's say taking Paxil or Concerta or some other med or meds, and manage to get **off** the meds, and do well, without them."
10312,"it wasn't so bad at first, a few mini attacks here and there, nothing worth medication, or anything sleep couldn't fix."
10313,I was taking lamictal for a month or so but stopped taking it because I didn't feel comfortable with taking medication.
10314,"Obviously the meds I'm not are not helping with my physical tremors to the point that I can be weaned off of them, which was the hope."
10315,"Does anybody else fear that behind the self medication, there might be depression or anxiety that doesn't have a real reason?"
10316,I went to my doctor for a change in my depression medicine because it stopped working and explained to her what was going on with my sleep patterns.
10317,The only difference I feel with this medicine is that my anxiety is finally gone and I feel free.
10318,I'm just wondering what people generally experience on anti anxiety meds.
10319,"After so many years of going to therapist, medications, reading so much about anxiety - I haven't come across any solution to Anxiety !"
10320,I'm not on any medication so I still have my moments which is normal.
10321,"I've been given the opportunity to take meds by MDs, but always refused them, because I've always though I could solve the problem myself..."
10322,"* 4 -Go to the gym when it is busy and complete all exercises in my routine
* 5 - Pee in a urinal when there are people already at it (sober)
* 6- Sign up for any kind of social hobby and stick with it for at least 1 month
* 7- Get involved while sober in a conversation with 2 or more people who i'm not that familiar with
* 8- Go into a bar or any social situation involving alcohol while completely sober and stay there for at least 2 hours without drinking
* 9 - Compliment a stranger
* 10- Speak in front of 5 or more people in any kind of social situation or work meeting

I firmly believe that exposure therapy is the only way to beat social anxiety without taking medication."
10323,"My first post would probably go along the lines of:

Had a panic attack because I couldn't find my anxiety medication #anxietyprobs

or this (this one isn't mine but I thought it could apply):

I have anxiety issues so I am trying to seek out a therapist."
10324,"It's been roughly 5 years now - and while I was VERY anxious about any sort of medication after hearing many horror stories, I was assured by all doctors that lorazepam was non-addictive and essentially harmless."
10325,"Naturally, that worries me - and now I'm having a good bit of anxiety over my anxiety medicine."
10326,"My sister has a BIG problem with it, and has seen a doctor and prescribed meds."
10327,"If my test came back fine I was going to get in touch with a psychiatrist to see what, if any, medication might work for me."
10328,My therapy sessions don't seem to be a huge help at the moment and I'm debating starting medication if it turns out I don't have a testosterone deficiency (which likely would be addressed through testosterone patches).
10329,I am seeing a psychologist since Fall 2014 and I’ve been on medication since Spring 2015.
10330,"I don't think medication would be suited to me, as I only suffer from it sporadically."
10331,"I went to the doctors and got some anti anxiety/anti depression medication which I have now been on for a couple of months and it appears to be working to an extent, but I am still struggling- actually quite badly at times."
10332,"From your experiences with medication, did you find it helpful?"
10333,I try a couple medications...
10334,"Start and stop some more medications and, upon telling him about my dreams and sleep habits (ie: I have not had a good night sleep in the last 10 years), he mentions ADHD."
10335,"He, after ages of him avoiding it (I did not ask, I just don't think he wanted to put me on it all willy nilly), puts me on a medication to keep me focussed."
10336,Increase the anti anxiety medication and mood stabilizer.
10337,"""I can't focus"" No change in that medication but come back in a month."
10338,I'm going in tomorrow and I'm so frustrated...I feel like we're finally on the right track - proper medications but maybe need some dosage adjustments here and there.
10339,"Im not on any medication, have no health issues, etc."
10340,"I've never taken meds before and while I don't like the idea of having to take a pill, I would like to give medication a try."
10341,"I am worried, in the present about the medications effect on me because I stopped it so quickly."
10342,It is by far the most effective daily anti-anxiety medication I've ever been on and there's been no lead up time for it to start working.
10343,I'm just someone who found a medication that's been helpful as compared to all the other crap I've tried out there.
10344,She is on medication (not sure of names) for the ADD and depression and I'm looking for ideas on how to help her with her anxiety.
10345,But do I really need medication?
10346,"I HAVE DECIDED, that the heroin is no longer an option for medication so I'm getting hit even harder, paying my emotional debts to the days I just got to checkout of reality."
10347,Isn't medication a fucking scam?
10348,When i was in 6th grade i attempted suicide which led to about a year of therapy and medication.
10349,"I went to my doctor and got prescribed to a couple different meds (Paxil, Lexapro, Buspar, etc)."
10350,I'm a small girl and I don't take any kinds of medicine very often because it affects me so strongly.
10351,"She pointed out that I am a small girl who doesn't handle medicine well, why would caffeine would be any different?"
10352,Did you get put straight on meds or referred to counselling?
10353,"By the way he gave me some medication about it, some Lyrica 150MG, I think it might help a bit, but not at the anxiety I have around people, more on the anxiety about me fucking my university up and ending on the street living by whatever could get me going, or well at that point properly just suicide, who knows."
10354,I weened myself off of paxil and was looking forward to being medication free for a long time..
10355,"I'm depressed and I hate it, but the last thing I wanted was to go back onto medicine."
10356,Now I'm terrified that it won't and I'm afraid if it does what will happen when I have to change meds again.
10357,"Sorry for the long rant, but I needed to vent about my new medication."
10358,"I managed to start controlling it through therapy and some slight meds, but about a month ago I smoked again and almost had another panic attack, but was only just able to suppress it."
10359,"Hey, so I'm almost positive I have social anxiety disorder and I'm planning on seeing someone about it soon but I just have a question about anxiety medication."
10360,"I mean as of right now, the only thing I have going for me in life is that I'm pretty smart and I guess I'm just worried that taking medication might in some way mess with that or something."
10361,"So if someone who has taken medication for anxiety can sort of tell me what it's like or something, that would be great."
10362,I have tried various anxiety medications and they always seem to either make me feel like a zombie or make me put on a large amount of weight.
10363,"I'm on Strattera, which is a Norepenephrine Reuptake Inhibitor, so it's related to various Anti Depressant and Anti Anxiety medication."
10364,"So I got on meds, went to a therapist and started school and everything was good."
10365,"You go to school in the fall and the winter, and for me that signifies the time of the year that I got on meds and felt for the first time in a long time that everything was actually going to be *okay."
10366,"They never last long either, normally a few minutes of screamingly and hyperventilating before it calms enough that I can take medication."
10367,I am generally anxious and definitely suffer from severe social anxiety but I am not diagnosed or on any medication and doubt I can afford treatment or even the transportation to get there at the moment.
10368,I finally found one doctor who listened and agreed with me that low dose medication could help along with CBT.
10369,After a few months the doctor resigned and my medication ran out while I was still searching for a doctor that would hear me out.
10370,"Started on meds (citalopram), worked off them after 9 months."
10371,"The medication helped with combating mental anxiety/depression, but considerably worsened my physical anxiety."
10372,"Even though the medication lowered my social inhibitions and made me more comfortable around other people, my sweating worsened."
10373,I had originally sought out medication in an attempt to curb the sweating.
10374,"TL;DR: what medications, other than SSRIs, alleviate the physical symptoms of anxiety, namely sweating?"
10375,How did these medications affect you?
10376,I've been on the meds for a week and I have a follow-up appt with my doc in three weeks.. What has been your experience with lexapro?
10377,"I've been offered meds twice (ages 12 and 18), but never actually got a prescription because I wasn't interested."
10378,I'm worried medication would take this away from me.
10379,"I would be able to have one in September when I move back to school, but if I'm going to be trying out meds, I'd like to do it with my family doctor who is back here at home."
10380,"I don't have any relatives that *aren't* on anti-anxiety medication (aunts, uncles, dad, surviving grandparent, my mom used to be)."
10381,It's almost like it's a given that you take meds in my family.
10382,"I guess I just want to know 1) What was ""transitioning"" to medication like for you?"
10383,"I get diarrohea and IBS symptoms caused by my anxiety and even though i'm on SSRI and IBS medication, I still struggle."
10384,"I get attacks, and have to carry medication to exams, and worry worry worry."
10385,Yesterday I went to my doctor to refill my ADHD medication.
10386,what other unbearable side effects have you endured from your meds?
10387,"I feel this has turned into a rant ...

tl;dr- Doc is reluctant to give me meds that have worked for me in the past."
10388,Since i was discharged from the Navy my medications have ran out and i have been trying to take care of my self cold turkey.
10389,I'm afraid to take medications because I've tried them in the past and it makes it worse.
10390,"Maybe my meds need changing, I'm on Wellbutrin and am not sure if it works for me."
10391,My therapist has recommended medication but I am hesitant.
10392,"I'm very anti-medication, it took me a long time to even be OK with the medication I have to take for my Crohns."
10393,"You get anxiety, you see a therapist, you get medication, you take medication, you get better, you stop taking medication, repeat."
10394,I was wondering if the only way to treat anxiety was to use medication.
10395,"She takes medicine and sees a psychologist, but it's not helping her right now."
10396,But that was over nearly 8 weeks ago and she's still getting worse prompting her doctor to prescribe her Xanax and some kind of nausea medicine because she's throws up each morning from her anxiety.
10397,There are so many thoughts that plague me and I feel like I just can't cope; I plan on going to the doctor soon and seeing what I can do medication wise.
10398,"There are a bunch of posts about therapists, medication, and different methods of treatment."
10399,"I knew medications lose their effectiveness, but I didn't properly research it."
10400,"I had to go without my meds for a month a few years ago when there was a lapse in my health insurance, and I had brain zaps during that time."
10401,I've never taken anxiety medication before when in all honesty I really should have.
10402,My doctor and psychotherapist practically begged me to go on medication because I know I need help but I've been too nervous about it to take medication.
10403,"I mean if I could do my last set of finals without medication (even though I was freaking out the whole time, I didn't die), then surely I'll be okay."
10404,"Do I have to take medicine forever, can I learn to live with my anxieties?"
10405,"But i' m not on any new medications, just diazapam if it all gets too much."
10406,"Ive been on and off many different medications, some that work, and some that don't."
10407,I think I should also go on a medication to control sweating?
10408,Ide be interested in all of your opinions and what medications or whatever you do that helps you deal with overwhelming anxiety.
10409,"My counselor recommended that I talk to my doctor about taking something for my anxiety and both of my parents flat out refused, saying things like meds are the easy way out, that I need to try harder to get better, that they just mask the problem etc etc."
10410,"I myself had looked into it and knew quite a bit about the different types of medication there are etc, and they just parroted off a load of pre conceived notions they had about medication."
10411,I'm dependent on my parents for this because I can't afford to get meds on my own.
10412,"With a long history of going to therapy, taking medication, and even being hospitalized."
10413,"So, my first place to turn is to natural medicine."
10414,The last resort would be to give up my dream career and start prescription medication.
10415,"That being said, I want to know what natural medicines have worked for you."
10416,"TL;DR Bad social anxiety, want to try natural medicine and/or talk therapy before going to a psychiatrist and sacrificing my dream job to start prescription meds, looking for effective natural medicines to try."
10417,"EDIT: Not sure if this post violates the subreddit rules on medication, but if it does, can anybody recommend a different website to seek advice on?"
10418,I dealt with it with medicine.
10419,"That helped me get through the anxiety on a day to day basis, and after a few months I didn't need the medicine anymore."
10420,If I ever get hooked into an IV or need to take serious medications I don't know how I'll do it.
10421,And I suppose a career involving medicine is out of the question.
10422,I have diagnosed ADHD but I don't take my medicine as often as I should because I'd rather be high and happy than focused because I have nothing to focus on but my self-generated misery.
10423,"I have an appointment on the 11th to get put back on meds, but am I normal?"
10424,"In the last 20 years I've seen 12 therapists of all different methodologies, 5 psychiatrists, tried at least 20 medications (not all at the same time, ha!)."
10425,I started taking new meds because I was abusing ritalin (depakote) and then I had an anger attack at work the other day.
10426,I'm currently not on any medication.
10427,She suggested I try to go for an evaluation at a clinic for low income families and expressed that they will hopefully put me on medication.
10428,"I wouldn't have to worry about today""

So, I definitely think medication would help and I'm open to it if it's determined appropriate."
10429,what is being on meds like when it goes right?
10430,what is being on meds like when it goes wrong?
10431,what happens if medication doesn't help?
10432,I looked through the FAQ and the resources on the sidebar but they're not very useful since I'm not on meds or diagnosed.
10433,"so im 17 years old and have had a social anxiety disorder and depression since i was 13 i take medication for my anxiety, my problem is i seem to have alot of trouble talking to girls i communicate with them just fine over facebook and text but in person i dont necessarily get anxious but i do start acting like a typical teenage nerd talking to a girl, my real problem is when i do get a girlfriend thats when all my anxiety sets in, in most situations i dnt even know whats causing my anxiety i think its just i have become so use to being alone that these changes and differences make me uncomfortable and thus cause anxiety."
10434,I've been one meds for the past few years and I am in a much better place because of them.
10435,"He doesn't know that I am on anxiety medication, and I am pretty sure he's not on any."
10436,"I've made passing mention that I am able to control migraines with medication, but he's not interested in that for himself."
10437,"I am going abroad to study for a couple months in the summer, and would rather not have to worry about medication."
10438,"Hi guys, I finally decided I need to get on medication to get me through the next 5 months of nursing school."
10439,I'm looking for a non prescription alternative to anxiety medication.
10440,"I really don't want therapy, or sleeping pills, or medication."
10441,"The basics of my anxiety began to form such as : 

- Nail biting

- Playing with my hair constantly 

- Fear of the dark, sleeping, irrational thoughts/ideas

- When I try to sleep my body has spasms, muscle spasms, sudden jerks, and my mind is flooded with worries and fears

- I make huge lists of things to do/ remember even about simple things such as ""Shower, straighten hair, clean drawer"" and then i re-write the lists when they begin to get ""messy"" (I have like 5 lists at a time daily)

- I've had two huge anxiety attacks that were extremely painful and lasted about 2 hours each 

- I have tried to kill myself over 100 times ever since I was 11 

- I purposely bruise/bite myself to take out my frustrations

- I rarely sleep 

- I have no motivation anymore and I always assume the worst of things

- I am absolutely terrified of pain/cannot tolerate any pain at all

- I rely heavily on medicine when I AM in pain 

- I starve myself on and off 

- I have low self esteem 

- I have trust issues

- I assume people dislike me almost immediately which alternates between that and me assuming I am better then everybody 

- I am very pale/sickly looking with bruises beneath my eyes but I hide it easily with make up

- I am very shaky/weak boned from bad diet which stops me from exercising 

- I re-organize constantly and need things in perfect order 

- I have extremely violent/constant thoughts that come from nowhere

and that is all just off the top of my head."
10442,I dont want to take any kind of pill because I dont want to feel like my brain and thought process will change from using an everyday medicine.
10443,"I have already been to see a doctor who prescribed me medication which I refused (for now); I have seen a therapist, told almost everyone in my family and my good friends and hired an herbalist to help me find a good mixture of something to get me feeling like my old self."
10444,I haven't had medication in two years but due to a new job and other life events I am having terrible anxiety again.
10445,"I would like to seek out a new doctor or therapist to get me on medication again, but now I live in a different city currently without health insurance and the thought of seeking out a doctor and therapist is only causing more anxiety."
10446,I need to take my meds.
10447,I'm going to switch meds over the summer.
10448,I didn't take my ADD meds to relax further.
10449,"I thought we were just joking about something, but whenever I don't take my meds, I sometimes don't pick up on social cues very well."
10450,"Sometimes I couldn't sleep, but some very average medicine has always done the trick."
10451,"After nearly a decade of therapy, and trying more medications than I can count, I've realized that I'm never going to get better."
10452,"My other option is to go on Paxil, but if NLP is as effective as my therapist says it is then I don't want to start another medication."
10453,I've dealt with a lot in my life and persevered so the thought of taking medication is new to me.
10454,"I've had depression and anxiety for almost 8 years now, and I've been off medication for 4 years."
10455,But I'm worried and I don't want to get back into the meds.
10456,But one thing that has kept me from going off the deep end is being on medication.
10457,But I'm on such small doses that I'm wondering if the medication is doing me any good.
10458,"I guess that the medication is working, but I'm still pretty anxious all the time."
10459,The reason I ask is in the 'what medication do you take' thread everyone talks about their GP's.
10460,I am a social worker that works with people that have mental health issues and from my experience GP's don't make referrals to psychiatrist as much as they should and totally fuck up the medication on a regular basis.
10461,From my observations CBT is often more effective than medication in the long run.
10462,"I am on meds, they're not helping it (although helping my depression)."
10463,"I'll be seeing someone about my meds (gotta get new scripts, moved to a new state) on dec 31st."
10464,I was prescribed a minor dose of a generic anxiety medicine and out the door I went.
10465,I'm wondering if it would be a healthier option to see a doctor and try some medication like an SSRI first.
10466,Should I seek professional help and get some medication or should I just man up and try alcohol to use as a crutch in certain social situations?
10467,"I've got a feeling that people here will be more biased to the medication side since this is the anxiety subreddit, but I hope I can get some unbiased opinions."
10468,"These help, but the therapist wanted to know if I wanted to try medication to see if it would help."
10469,My largest fears in this is that a therapist will put me on medication which will make me addicted (which might be physically and financially unhealthy) and change me for the worse.
10470,TL;DR- boyfriend of a year broke up with me just as I was starting new meds and therapy.
10471,I won't do meds.
10472,"I have a very high stress, high demand job as a litigator and I've seen another person start anti-anxiety meds."
10473,I don't take medication for it as I haven't had insurance for the past few years.
10474,Btw she's on some meds to help her with it but she can't deal with people for 3 weeks until she gets a checkup.
10475,"I've been on and off meds for three years now for depression/anxiety, and none have helped at all."
10476,"Any advice would also be greatly appreciated, as I'm really sick and tired of the medication deal."
10477,I haven't been on medication for it for some time but when my anxiety was at it's worst it was when I was ending a year long relationship.
10478,"Have tried various meds, and was most recently on bupropion (Wellbutrin) and escitalopram (Lexapro) for a couple of years."
10479,"I agreed with this, as I had had some side effects (including sexual function) although the overall effect of the meds was positive."
10480,"Have now been off all medication for 5 ish months now, and have recently had a full-blown reappearance of my anxiety (last 2 months)."
10481,Have I screwed myself by being on meds for so long in the past that I can now no longer function without them?
10482,I talked for a little bit and was wondering if I should ask the psychologist about medication.
10483,Is it possible to fight this without medication?
10484,I finally saw help and they prescribed me two types of medication.
10485,This issue extends to medication.
10486,I can't get myself to take these medications.
10487,What gets you to take medication?
10488,"However, they completely trust conventional medicine, which is pretty contradictory on its own."
10489,"I am not on any medications for my anxiety, although I used to be on 10 mg of Citalopram(Celexa), and I sometimes take herbs for my anxiety (lavender, valerian root, magnesium, etc)."
10490,I was prescribed some anxiety medication and something for my depression.
10491,We had to drive around 14 hours to get there and I had just started my medication.
10492,I stopped taking all my medication.
10493,"I still do not take medication, but I am at a point where I can do that."
10494,It doesn't help that medication is a trigger for me.
10495,The reason being is because I am considering going on anxiety medication.
10496,I didn't want to do it before because I thought that my parents would disapprove or judge me if they found out I got a prescription to anti-anxiety medication.
10497,What are your thoughts on anti-anxiety medications?
10498,I feel like I am taking too MUCH medication.
10499,I never have been on a lot of medication before.
10500,I don't want to depend on these meds.
10501,"(Besides medication, of course) I was hoping that we could compile a list of healthy coping skills for when things get to be too much."
10502,"He refuses to take medication for it, as the last pills he was on made him gain weight."
10503,I rather not go on medications but i would like to get some help if possible.
10504,Should I consider going to a psychologist and getting medication?
10505,"I know someday I'm going to have to try without the medicine, but the Xanax is a life saver for now"
10506,Finally went to the doc to change my meds as I was really having a hard time.
10507,My doctor didn't want me on anything new since I'm having a hard time and she knows I'm not a fan of trying new meds with fear of side-effects so we went back to it since it worked for me and its been 5+ years since I've been on it.
10508,"To put this in context, my family has had a fair amount of family health issues; my father (52) has HBP, and my mother (57) recently developed intense anxiety issues that she is pretty much unable to cope with aside from medications that turn her into a pharma-zombie."
10509,I'm not on meds anymore because they weren't working as well so my doctor tried to wean me off of them in 5 days (they were ativan and i had been on them over a year) but i stretched that out to 10 days just to cope.
10510,"He noticed my rather up-beat demeanor (I'm very good at pretending and putting on a happy face), and when I told him I think I could probably get by without meds, he agreed, but said sometimes these meds are more like a shortcut and they might still be a benefit to me."
10511,I wasn't even this unsure about taking my HRT meds.
10512,"""Just take medication for it""
""Figure it out"" 

Okay...I think you get the point."
10513,"The drawbacks of Zoloft, for me, are FAR outweighed by the relief that I have gotten from the meds."
10514,"I am also on my medication (not anti-anxiety, but beta blockers)."
10515,"Without the medication, I would have easily had a full blown panic attack at this point with a heart rate over 120."
10516,Edit: I am male and have no medication.
10517,I was on adhd medication for a year but came off of it about 7 months ago.
10518,"The medication was called stratera, and I stopped taking it because of camp, and also because I felt like I didn't need it/it wasn't helping."
10519,"I have tried to change my diet, working out, exposing myself to my fears, talking to people and therapists about it, and I even take medication but its still there."
10520,"I genuinely don't know how to cope with this and I don't think she does either, aside from taking her medication (her prescription for which runs out soon)."
10521,"I am on meds as of a few months ago, but I always found it really unsettling that most people couldn't empathize with the feelings that I couldn't even put into words."
10522,"I'm now taking my medication properly, I've lost around 12 kilos through diet and exercise."
10523,"If anyone has similar issues and is taking (or has taken) a medication that had positive results with, I would love to hear about it!"
10524,"I got diagnosed and I'm on medicine, and my GPA is rising aside from two classes I screwed up in."
10525,"(Found out when my anxiety medication mixed with my sleep fuckery--as I eloquently call it--to have me sleep through alarms--and they call, for some reason, if you're a half hour late into your shift."
10526,Now this isn't something that's completely out of the blue as she's been living with it for a while and does take appropriate medication.
10527,"Fast Forward to Current Issue: 

She has taken the week off and has gone up to a co-workers cottage for the majority of the week (left Monday 07/20 and is returning Friday 07/24), she ended up forgetting to pack her meds and shes stated multiple times already that she doesn't think that she can make it until Friday."
10528,"She is getting very homesick and even mentioned it on the first day being away, she really misses her pets, is up there at this cottage with no meds and no one around her age."
10529,I tried going off the meds for a full day and on the second day I experienced the same sad results.
10530,He went through my medications and told my that what I was currently taking was more geared toward fighting my depression and not my anxiety.
10531,I was actually even taking a medication that has a side effect of increasing anxiety.
10532,"Oh, and I am in active therapy.I have Tricare Prime for my insurance company, so everything is covered and basically nothing is off limits medication wise, testing wise, or hospital wise."
10533,"Tricare Prime insurance (no co-pays on visits or medicine), previous bipolar 2 dx."
10534,I have a prescription for medication (Cipralex) which I haven't taken yet because I've been overseas for the summer.
10535,I hope this is something that will go away assuming the medication works well for me.
10536,"I'm on medication (100 mg Pristiq right now) and it's such a help, but I think we all know there's more we could be doing or trying to help ourselves in addition to the meds."
10537,I'm just looking for some advice on decreasing anxiety medication.
10538,"Sorry this turned out so long, I guess I'm just looking for anyone who's tried/been successful with getting off anxiety medication?"
10539,My dr dosen't take seriosly that the meds aren't working right because this is a stressful time in my life (4 weeks to graduate college) but my meds seemed to have stopped working and he wont change anything.
10540,Is this a reaction of combination of meds or what?
10541,**TL;DR:Anyone have experience with meds suddenly not working?
10542,"I eventually decided I couldn't live like this anymore and even though I felt a lot of anxiety towards taking the medication (I don't even take tylenol or anything), I decided it was worth a try."
10543,:) I may be trying behavioral cognitive therapy soon to try and complement the medication.
10544,"And so the only ways for me to fall asleep are getting drunk, taking a ton of anxiety medication and hipnotics, or sometimes when I haven't slept in days I'll be able to fall asleep for 5 hours, but as soon as I wake up the pain starts again and I need to grab my phone and look at twitter or check my email, or take a book and start reading or something and I can't choose to put it down again."
10545,"Do not take this as gospel if you wish to go on this medication, because everyone reacts differently, but Jesus Christ, did it fuck me up."
10546,"I do understand it's something that will more than likely pass (unless this medication doesn't 'fit' me), but I suppose I needed somewhere to vent and just talk about this with like minded people (and I hope that's okay, mods)."
10547,"As I said with regards to my previous medication, do not hesitate to try out medication based on other people's experiences."
10548,I've been told that adding wellbutrin is a common thing that can help with all of these side effects... but I'm a little weary of using a medication to essentially fix the first medication.
10549,I don't take medication because I was trying to get over it without the use of medication.
10550,She suggested I try to go for an evaluation at a clinic for low income families and expressed that they will hopefully put me on medication.
10551,"So, I definitely think medication would help and I'm open to it if it's determined appropriate."
10552,what is being on meds like when it goes right?
10553,what is being on meds like when it goes wrong?
10554,I looked through the FAQ and the resources on the sidebar but they're not very useful since I'm not on meds or diagnosed.
10555,"He started complaining about it a bit, prescribed my medication and left while the nurse came in and took my blood."
10556,"I currently am not seeing anyone or taking meds, but I have in the past and will be at a university where I can get care in a little under two months."
10557,I have a lot of friends who get turned off by condescending or inconsiderate psychiatrists/therapists or they're scared of medication.
10558,I haven't been medicated since September and not getting back on medication after acquiring new health coverage was clearly a horrible mistake.
10559,I know that no one can just make it go away and that I have to get back on my medication but I just hurt so badly that I felt compelled to at least post a thread where others might understand my odd compulsions.
10560,I tried other medicine but most of it actually makes me feel depressed which i feel is worst.
10561,I am wondering what other suggestions that can help me get through this other then medication.
10562,"I feel so relieved and accomplished, not only because I finally came to terms with my anxiety and battled it (without medication!!!!"
10563,I found a new physician who wants me off the meds and recommends tapering down to .25 and then to as needed.
10564,They want to put my on a cholesterol medication.
10565,"I've been talking to my psychiatrist and we've been modifying my medication dosage, but so far it's not helping much."
10566,"I know high BP is bad for your system, but I feel like if I were to take BP medication, it might be bad for my body during periods where I feel normal and relaxed and my BP is low (because it may drop it too low, or something like that)."
10567,"I sought therapy, medicine, spirituality, and friends and community to cure myself."
10568,"And maybe, either way, these aren't just going to go away with some medication that makes me stand up for myself a little better."
10569,And I have the fortune/misfortune of being on a medication that is basically allowing me to live uncompromised.
10570,A medication that I need really good health insurance to get.
10571,This medication has allowed me to live.
10572,get the medicine.
10573,I'm prescribed two meds: Wellbutrin and Lexapro.
10574,"I was diagnosed bipolar and I take a mood stabilizer,  I've been on meds since March,  and while it took a while to come to terms with it,  I was ok.  As the pills fell into my hand I just had this overwhelming feeling of hating the fact that I have to take medicine,  and of course a while bunch of other invasive thoughts started taking over."
10575,Will I need to go on medication or is this something I can overcome with practice and finding the root cause mentally?
10576,I went to the doctor once and she told me that it seems the two most stressful programs are mine and medicine.
10577,Are their medications/ therapy that have helped?
10578,"In the time since I stopped school, I've been getting increasingly worse, I have started to see a psychologists, but I can only afford to see her every 2 weeks and I am on meds."
10579,I got meds which I stopped taking after a few months because they gave me awful feelings.
10580,Edit: I have no idea why this was flared as medication.
10581,"I've never had an anaphylactic reaction and I'm not allergic to any meds, but that doesn't stop me from being afraid."
10582,Do I need anti-anxiety medication for episodes like tonight?
10583,"Antihistamines like sleep aides cold medicine and allergy pills give me sleep apnea already, they restrict the blood vessels and I have scar tissue in my artery where the wire from the defibrillator goes into my heart so I can't take those."
10584,"Therapy, medication, the whole 9 yards."
10585,Any comments on either of these meds?
10586,"I have suffered with depression for a while, was put on medication, got it under control, I'm not on the medication anymore because I can't afford it (no insurance) and I can't see my psychologist anymore for the same reason."
10587,"* taken medication in the past, didn't help, doing group therapy now

For a more detailed descption see here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2evgdc/dragging_ones_self_through_life_5_steps_forward_4/

Most people with social anxiety self describe themselves as introverted."
10588,Then my counselling sessions ended and I stopped my medication as I didn't think I needed it anymore and moved home to live with my parents at the end of my last year of Uni (although I haven't actually completed my degree thanks to the anxiety).
10589,"My friend showed me a documentary on Netflix that was explaining America's rise in both red meat and dairy consumption and how it was linked to America's rise in heart failures, diabetes, cancer, prescription meds, etc."
10590,"I've been seeing a therapist for  the past weeks (really, for years but just a few weeks with this new one) and my therapist is suggesting I see a psychiatrist to get on some medications."
10591,"The thing is, I'm terrified (probably adding to the anxiety) of taking meds."
10592,I have this extreme image of me being on meds and just being practically comatose or just a completely different person.
10593,"I avoided going for many years, as I was apprehensive about being given a label or being put on medication."
10594,I am more than curious to see how I get on next week and wether the medication can help prove to my nervous system that there is no need for excessive amounts of adrenaline in such situations.
10595,"All your meds and the doses, hours of sleep the previous night, levels of anxiety/depression and such, and also a notes section."
10596,"In the past six years, I had a ten month hospital stay where I received last rites three times, got divorced and remarried, lost two really good paying jobs, moved three times and ran out of medications to treat a chronic disease I have had since I was 20 years old."
10597,"Like most people I have gone through a lot with anxiety, depression, medication, suicidal thoughts etc."
10598,"Now that I've found a good medicine, I have made a lot of improvement, I've stopped having panic attacks."
10599,I'm not on any medication but I have talked to therapist for awhile about it and my chronic worrying.
10600,"After 20 minutes of going back and forth he got frustrated, prescribed me adderall for ADD, and told me I would just have to live with the anxiety then because he wouldn't consider any other medication."
10601,"Tried escitalopram (generic for Lexipro), but that medication actually increased the frequency and severity of attacks."
10602,Are there any medications (over the counter) that could help?
10603,"One of the problems is that I have an allergy to almost all pain medications, and other medications that the doctors have tried have had horrible side effects where I have to stop taking the meds, these mostly being anti depressants."
10604,"I am 22 and was diagnosed with GAD around 16, and have been on and off medication, mostly off for the last few years."
10605,Have any of you ever had this immediate of a reaction to meds?
10606,"I am on a trip and before I came, I asked my doctor if there was any medication I could take to take the edge off, as it is a business trip."
10607,"He saw that I had a lot of gas, so he gave me some medicine for the intestines, as well as some medicine for my liver, since he found some fat, although he says that it's expected for my change of lifestyle."
10608,I've been on a variety of SSRIs and talked to therapists but I am currently off of any medication or therapy.
10609,Is it worth sticking it out or did you find switching meds helped?
10610,Currently on some anxiety medication that is not helping in one aspect of my life that seems to still be drowning me and that's my irritability.
10611,"The medications I'm currently taking are Paroxetine, Gabapentin (for sleep), and Vitamin D. I currently have Medi-Cal and am residing in California, US."
10612,"The doctor prescribed me Gabapentin for ""restless leg syndrome"" (the ""restlessness""/not being able to control my body carries over into my sleep unless I take the medication)."
10613,I've been dealing with severe general anxiety disorder since high school (I'm now almost 25) and been on medications for almost 10 years.
10614,I'm currently trying to find a medication that doesn't make me feel like a complete sleepy zombie.
10615,"But I want to know, what meds have you guys tried to treat anxiety/ what do you find works best."
10616,I've come to the realization that no meds is not an option for me as my anxiety is just too bad for me to deal with on my own without this as a crutch/ help.
10617,"He says that my problems are caused by my stress and anxiety, and we've tried a lot of different medications (several SSRIs, Buspar, Lamictal, Ativan, Ritalin, Strattera, etc."
10618,I got perscriptions for medication but the side effects were too risky for me.
10619,"I'm a big worrier, I'm not on meds and I think I'm slowly improving."
10620,I recently upped my medication dosage and I feel like things are just getting worse overall (been close to a month on the new dosage).
10621,So I finally bit the bullet and decided to try medication for my anxiety after getting sent home for having a panic attack for absolutely no reason.
10622,"I'm at the point now, where I'm considering medication."
10623,"Has anyone of you been in the same situation, tried medication and found that it made things easier?"
10624,What medication?
10625,"I'm now 22, and it hasn't gone away, despite sporadic counselling and medication."
10626,"I'm already taking more anxiety medicine than I have in months, and I still keep finding myself on the edge of breaking down."
10627,Compared to only 25% less on meds.
10628,"(The tests were taken over the course of one summer, June with no medication (control), July with prescribed anxiety meds, August with THC) 

And though I've only had alcohol once, I felt more open, I talked to people I barely knew, I started conversations."
10629,"Granted, I was better prepared since I was on medication, I still took it fairly hard."
10630,"I need to change my meds, and just really think about things."
10631,[Here's the original post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/137ylo/started_antianxiety_medication_yesterday_to_help/).
10632,"However, since my diagnoses, my doctor's and I haven't been able to find a medication/combo that has had any effect on me."
10633,Could I suggest medications that are more directly aimed towards anxiety?
10634,"I know that doctors are sometimes a bit hesitant to prescribe these meds, out of fear of the patients abusing/selling."
10635,I didn't take my anxiety meds (klonopin) today.
10636,I just turned eighteen a month ago so now I stay at my house and watch all my acquaintances having the time of their life for senior year while I wait for medication to kick in so I can get my GED and then get a job and live in the real world because now that I'm eighteen my mom's made it pretty clear I have to get a job or move out.
10637,I took my meds.
10638,"Without meds, I don’t see myself going to a doctor."
10639,Then in March/April things got better after I started taking meds (sertraline).
10640,"I stopped taking meds during the summer and things seemed to be fine, but now that I got back to school, I'm not doing so well anymore."
10641,"Anyway, should I start taking meds again?"
10642,"I was put on different types of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, anxiety medication, and add medication since that time until a little before I graduated college over 3 years ago."
10643,"She seems to feel much better with medicine and talking with therapist, and we're talking more after many months of a lot of stress, but it's only been about a week and a half since she's been on Paxil."
10644,While taking the z-pack I have been unable to take either of my meds because it interacts with the antibiotic but I have severe nausea and have felt dizzy/lightheaded.
10645,"I want to stop taking this antibiotic, I know my doctor and probably everyone else would say to finish the treatment but if I can't take my nausea meds along with it, I'm not going to be able to handle how I feel."
10646,Should I just wait and see if I still feel sick after the meds are out of my system?
10647,"I'm not opposed to meds at all, but I definitely want to get into some counselling."
10648,"I got a facebook message from a super close friend of mine, it was a group message explaining how she had had an awful time recently, been taken off all her meds and told her various disorders were up to her to fix as she's 'an adult now'

I called her non stop, convinced my heart was going to explode from the stress of not knowing what was going on."
10649,"She ended up eventually answering me and I calmed her down enough to get her to tell me where she was and what she'd done, turned out she'd managed to take all her medication (which is quite a bit and includes some rather nasty anti-psychs) without anyone in her house noticing."
10650,What meds can I take that will curb this social anxiety?
10651,"So my question is, should I bother with trying to go to the doctors to get medication?"
10652,"It hasn't lasted for too long, and I sound like a total bitch for whining about it, but I can't control it, and I can't let it control my life... To me this is a really strange thing to want, because I usually try not to take more medicine than I have to, just because I like to see myself as stronger than what I am (obviously)."
10653,"Having both at the same time is extremely difficult and tiring to deal with, and even though I'm on medication and seeing a counsellor I'm still having some pretty rough days."
10654,"but I feel like with these kinds of meds, placebo effect can be huge."
10655,"When I started the meds I felt like I was really prepared to ""fight this thing"" and just go fullspeed into recovery, like the meds were my weapon and I was just gonna beat this fucker."
10656,So I feel like I was riding on a lot of optimism and formed a bunch of good habits while I got adjusted to the meds.
10657,"Also, the meds have done nothing to combat my OCD (skin picking) and I even feel like that might be worse than before."
10658,"All of this is very hard to examine rationally because I feel like I can't really even compare to how things were prior to starting the meds, as I have been changing and evolving in different ways and it's hard to remember what my state of mind used to be like even if I can remember events."
10659,So I know my doctor is the only one who can give me an opinion on whether I need to switch my meds or whatever.
10660,"But I was wondering if anyone here had a similar experience with meds, if they tried a different one and got better, or whatever perspective you might have."
10661,First things first - I'm mid 30's male on no medication.
10662,I'm also really concerned about how suddenly the medication has stopped being effective.
10663,"Has anyone else had a similar experience, or felt like their medication had just one day stopped working?"
10664,"I've seen multiple therapists, tried various medications."
10665,My parents weren't happy with me taking medication so we never went back.
10666,My final issue is I don't want to go to the doctors only to be prescribed with medication.
10667,"(I can do math the next morning, couldn't after taking a Xanax to sleep)

I know you can go to some shady fly by night doctor and get a script in DC, but I'd rather find a psychiatrist who I will actually see on an ongoing basis, who is supportive of me wanting to take whatever medicine helps me best, and who can liase with a therapists in the same practice."
10668,I don't want to go back on the medication and retaper off either.
10669,Should I try getting medication?
10670,"When you know that a brain needs at least 5 hours a day of sleep, you can easily imagine that this finished at the hospital, imploring the urgency doctors ""I just want to sleep...""
5 days of hard medication in the hospital later (with huge doses of anxiolytics, antidepressent and sleep inhibitor), I felt a little better and take all my time to sleep."
10671,So my POV is this; I'd rather live a decent life on meds (either benzo's or AD's) than being completely lost from this world right?
10672,"I can't live the rest of my life feeling like this...

TL;DR: Got diagnosed GAD, therapy+medicine didnt help, cant deal with endless dissociation, derealization, negative feelings of detachment and paranoia, becoming depressed, dont know what to take/do"
10673,I just don't really want to start out trying to fix this with meds.
10674,Docs on it but thinks its anxiety + meds (getting off klonopin but ive been on half a pill for a long time i dont think its that) but I dont know.
10675,"I've tried medication in the past, and with a very sensitive stomach, I'm looking to try to stay on the natural side of things to resolve my issues."
10676,"I'm out of anxiety meds and won't be able to pick any up for a while, ~~constantly feel like puking~~,  haven't slept in the past 47 hours, ~~diarrhea has kicked in~~... Just feel like eternal shit and I *hate* myself for it."
10677,"For those of you who do *not* take medication, or those who do, has keeping a journal been beneficial to you?"
10678,"I wish I had medication or SOMETHING to help me cope but I have nothing except for SI, which is how I used to cope, but my therapist doesn't want me doing that anymore."
10679,"I'm very afraid that this is a temporary issue caused by PMS or PMDD, so I don't understand why she put me on a long term medication for something that will end up being temporary."
10680,"Other times that I can't talk myself down, I'll take one of my xanax pills, but they don't work immediately, and I'm prepared for pure hell until my medication starts to kick in."
10681,I'm convinced it is the acid medication and there's something different going on with my stomach.
10682,Suddenly taking medications to alleviate anxiety are CAUSING me anxiety.
10683,I need some advice from people who have taken this medication.
10684,"So I'm off of my medication cold turkey and I was wondering, to others who have been on Effexor/Venlafaxine, how long did you personally have to deal with the withdrawal symptoms?"
10685,I have two questions: the medication can be habit forming.
10686,I think I need medication.
10687,I feel like my meds aren't working.
10688,I've been on meds since uh... November?
10689,Today I decided not to take my meds.
10690,Why do I feel like everything has lifted off my shoulders with a glass of wine and not with my meds that are supposed to do it?
10691,"I was diagnosed with GAD last spring and have been on medication since, which helped immensely over the summer except for a few occasions."
10692,I’ve been on this medicine for about two weeks.
10693,"He prescribed ""Lyrica"" (pregabalin) and I am taking this medicine every night before sleep, 150 mg, and this relief the symptoms."
10694,"I used to meditate, exercise and all that jazz back when I wasn't on the medicine."
10695,That's one of the reasons I'm considering dropping the medicine because I'm starting to depend on it's effects and became sedentary again.
10696,"She tried everything to get me to not worry about it, but instead I just stopped taking the medication."
10697,Then I stopped taking the medications and was OK for a bit.
10698,I am on medications  (although I hate to be) and see a therapist weekly.
10699,And I've tried concentration medications before.
10700,"I've had lots of help in the past with meds and therapy while in HS and college, but nothing has really helped long term except for Welbutrin (which only keeps me from sleeping all day)."
10701,"I'm low on funds but am reluctant to prioritize my mental health because I have already tried so many medicines, partial hospitalization,  etc."
10702,Gunna skip the sob story but hows this medicine supposed to work?
10703,After all these meds I don't feel any different.
10704,"So 5 years ago I had a break down and held my mother with knife ,a year+ ago I stoped taking meds but kept going to theraphy so she wouldnt find out ."
10705,"I've tried a bunch of different medications over the past four years and while I think they help a little on a daily basis, when I'm faced with a trigger I still usually get anxiety attacks."
10706,"I guess I'm wondering if your medication has actually removed 10% of your anxiety, or 90% or whatever."
10707,"I want it to stop, I've been on meds before."
10708,"Any drug excluding alcohol (most of the time, lord forbid I get DRUNK) (I am a 2 year recovering addict at least)

Taking medicine."
10709,Not taking medicine.
10710,"I am not prescribed any meds nor taken any (Xanax two times during huge attacks, given by my father who also has anxiety) and don't plan on it."
10711,"I'm not at a point where I need medication, and it's not hampering my ability to function in life but it is bringing my quality of living down periodically."
10712,She also told me that I may have to go on medications to get myself to stop.
10713,"I'm 20 F (college student= high stress life), undiagnosed, no meds."
10714,"I'm doing well, and I just started taking medication today."
10715,"If you could leave any stories or perhaps some advice about dealing with my anxiety medication, I'm taking citalopram hydrobromide."
10716,"In trying to help my SO understand what I'm going through, I've been sending my SO tips on dealing with someone with anxiety, as well as the list of side effects of my medication."
10717,I'm seriously thinking about taking some type of medication so I was wondering if anyone else here could tell me about their own experience in order to help better my future decisions.
10718,I miss when i was in the USA :( at least i had a therapist and meds there while here my dad wanna take me to what equivalent of exorcism.
10719,"And if I'm anxious about schiz.. Will that get me the illness 


Too bad there is only 1 therapist in my small city and he has rlly bad reputation 


Plz help me 

I lost my appetite and i feel lightheaded a lot and tension in my neck 

Im 18 and I just graduated high school with rlly good grades and I missed singing up for college because of this anxiety .. God mercy on me 

There is no one that has schiz in my family but only my moms cousin 

And inever used any hallucination drugs or marijuana  I only used medications because I had an injury in my knee like 3 years ago 

My child hood was nice and my parents barley fought but my high school was quite bad because I injuried my knee and withdrawed from sports and I started playing videos games and sit at home most of my team and I was quite sad because I injuried my self and I couldn't workout on my body anymore"
10720,"I do have Hypothyroidism, and I take actively medicine for it every single day, I also have PCOS and take medicine for it, and I get regular blood works done."
10721,"I know I'll have the Pre operation tests (to make sure I'm healthy for surgery) with the nurses and then on the surgery day the nurses will take my details again, weigh me and discuss the medications they will be giving me."
10722,"I am crazy anxious today, I'm on medication (20mg citalphram) but it doesn't seem to be strong enough usually."
10723,"Before I was on the medicine I used to get this feeling like I was on autopilot but then suddenly I ""took control."""
10724,"I have been on quite a few meds, and some i am still on."
10725,"I've been on the medication now for about a month and I love it, it effectively eliminates this new ""ambient"" anxiety that I recently started feeling."
10726,"However, I am new to medications in general and am now aware that my body has probably become physiologically addicted to the drug, and I've heard that the withdrawals are going to be intense."
10727,"He wants me to make some changes in my medications, which I understand, and I do see where he was coming from, BUT I also felt like he wasn't really listening to me very well."
10728,"I am not trying to doctor shop (and I have zero interest in finding a new GP), but I've never been to an actual psychiatrist so I am wondering if they are better or worse as far as really listening to your concerns, previous experiences, and preferences about medications?"
10729,"She felt uncomfortable (she has never liked our debates) so she sulkily said ""You guys are really testing my anxiety medication right now."""
10730,"Td;lr (I think that's right): Time is moving fast, I miss the past and I can't even try and enjoy myself in those ways again due to anxiety and meds."
10731,What other options are there for anxiety meds besides benzos?
10732,"I'm a little skeptical of the efficacy of herbal remedies and supplements, but my doctor recommended that I take passionflower along with my medication."
10733,"A colds going around the office and I tried to get by without meds but I just couldn't do it, but when I do take cold meds and my anxiety pills I get the shakes..."
10734,She is going through depression and taking medicine for it.
10735,"She is not sure whether it is from the depression, or from her medication but she gets extreme anxiety when we are alone in our apartment."
10736,"Description of it matches what I've been experiencing, I've been instructed to carry on with the medication for now."
10737,I'm hoping it will help take the edge off a bit during this transitional period and in a couple of months I can go off from it again and move forwards sans any form of medication.
10738,The reason I went to meds was due to anxiety and the physiological manifestations associated with the anxiety that were hindering my life.
10739,Now you know why I'm on the meds.
10740,How long does it take until my meds kick in?
10741,"I've been trying for years to do non-medicine techniques, but my family and I have made the decision to try zoloft."
10742,"Or worse, what if they're is and they have to pay for outrageously expensive medication?"
10743,Anyone have any suggestions for medication or therapy to help overcome them?
10744,"I do think it's bad that I diagnose myself, but seeing as how somatic disorders are in some grey area between psychological therapy and regular medicine, it's been very hard for me to get any help."
10745,"Should I find another medication, or up my dosage?"
10746,"I don't know if it's just a placebo, but it does seem to do a little bit of something for me (not enough to solve anything, but more than any of the non-addictive medications I've been on have)."
10747,"In the last 4 months I feel like I have accomplished a lot, from quitting my anxiety meds to getting a job, and I recently started vocal lessons."
10748,Are there any medications that I can take when this happens?
10749,"At one point she mentions that she was on meds during school, as many of us are, and told me she had to get off them, because they made her feel worse and tiresome- I understood and respected this, I'm no expert but if something makes you feel worse than it should, then there's no point suffering, it's obviously not good."
10750,"I felt like I should be honest with her and I came clean to tell her that I take meds myself, well just one- Cymbalta, once a day in the morning, because of debilitating anxieties I had."
10751,"without meds, but anxieties were still a huge fear for me."
10752,"TLDR; told girl who took meds I take meds, she decides it's not okay"
10753,"Just to give a little background information, I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for most of my life, and in the past year (August) I was just prescribed medication to help deal with this situation."
10754,"Basically I take medication in the morning (for anxiety) and medication at night (for depression, it usually knocks me right out)."
10755,"Being that I'm a bit skeptical of psychiatric medication, I chose to ""train"" myself to be able to talk myself down from panic attacks and they eventually went away for a while."
10756,"I expressed my desire to take a ""rescue"" medication on an as needed basis."
10757,I don't want daily medicine.
10758,"Any and all thoughts, opinions, advice on this medicine would be appreciated!"
10759,"My mom has a heart condition and she tells me that before she was diagnosed, she was briefly put on anti-anxiety medication."
10760,"My current prescription will run out, I'll be forced to come off my meds - being treated for depression as well -, I'll be kicked off the list with my psychiatrist for missing 2 appointments in a row (I missed my last one earlier this month because she wouldn't drive me) and... that's it."
10761,"I always denied medication though because I was afraid that it would change who I am, or make me feel not like myself."
10762,"I'm going back to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist in a couple weeks, I'm going to try meds because nothing is working and I seriously can't live like this."
10763,I'd like to hear about some medications that worked for other people too.
10764,"However, it suddenly dawned to me that it was from the meds."
10765,"My psychologist wants to put me on meds, but I've seen anti-anxiety meds do some pretty bad stuff to people."
10766,"I also stopped taking my meds, prozac a couple months ago."
10767,"A week ago I had a panic attack because I thought I was going to have a heart attack because my left arm was tongly and got back on my meds, prozac and klonopin."
10768,I'm on medication and getting therapy and I can honestly say I feel like a different person and those mistakes are all in the past
10769,"So it has been a blessing to find you guys and to realize that I'm not the only person going through this :)Also, before anyone mentions it, I am seeing a psychologist and have an appointment with a psychiatrist to talk about the possibility of meds for my disorder."
10770,been on lots of diff types of meds.
10771,"after a couple months meds stop working so i was thinking about brining it up with my dr. i tried hypnosis before and i don't go under very easy, it takes a long time and I'm only under for like a few mins."
10772,and like i said meds come and go.
10773,"I got a job that I would NEVER have taken (bartending/barbacking) without the medication, and I have a social life now!!"
10774,A little background: I had not been drinking much if at all when i started my medication.
10775,"I didn't take my medication today for the first time ever, because my practice forgot to call in my perscription, so i'm saving my last dose for work on Monday, just in case i can't get the refill tomorrow."
10776,Note that I get these (albeit less frequently) even when I don't drink and do take my medication.
10777,"I really don't want to rely on medication just so I can sleep at night, I'm only 20."
10778,"I was wondering if you have any general, non-specific tips (I.e not ""Take this medicine, and meditate for X hours a day"") that could get her on the right path?"
10779,"Not spam, I don't work for Costco, I just see a lot of people struggling to pay for meds."
10780,They offer these kinds of discounts for most generic meds.
10781,"Target and Walmart do something similar, but Costco is the only place I've found that discounts this many psych meds."
10782,Also should I give ADHD meds a try?
10783,I started taking my meds again on Saturday.
10784,Did you go to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) before you got medication?
10785,How soon into therapy did you get put on medication?
10786,I'm currently about a month into CBT and at today's session my therapist recommended I go on meds.
10787,Obviously it's different for everybody (people who want medication right away vs. people who only use it as a last resort).
10788,"After my anxiety was to the point where I couldn't operate on a day-to-day basis I started on the roller coaster ride of prescription meds, such as : Celexa, Lexapro, amitriptyline, etc."
10789,And I was also still kind of broken from all of the meds I ran through.
10790,and also possibly talk about getting some type of medication for my anxiety as well.
10791,"Up until last year I avoided going on meds and dealt with it by hiding it from everyone and pushing through the episodes (and it was very much episodic for me, triggered by real life events- starting a new job, really bad breakup where I had to basically start my life over, moved to a new city, etc."
10792,"He has had depression and social anxiety pretty severely his whole life, years didn't see anyone or take any meds."
10793,"They put him on 5 or 6 different meds, and I can't remember what they all are, but I know they included wellbutrin and klonopin."
10794,"He spends every day either abusing alcohol, sleeping, or meeting girls from the internet for casual sex (he still has not ejaculated during sex since he started abusing anxiety meds, don't know if this is relevant)."
10795,I don't know if I should start taking the meds again since I'll just be out soon (before I can get insurance back) or if I should space my doses out so I at least have *some* in my system.
10796,"**TL;DR: out of money, out of meds, got some extras from friends, gap in time btw."
10797,"I feel weak that I have this axiety, even though I have good friends who help me, and even my roommate is currently on meds to anxiety as well, he seems to handle it better than me, so i feel weak."
10798,"I just found out I have anxiety (probably through my mom, she even takes meds) because I told her how every morning I feel like throwing up and I almost always have butterflies in my stomach, I'm always tensed up."
10799,I was initially quite positive about the idea of taking medication to hopefully change my life but now that I've finally got the medication in hand I'm scared to take it.
10800,I know I am sick as wouldn't have all these appointments and therapy sessions and I certainly wouldn't be starting meds if I wasn't.
10801,I spoke to the doctor and my therapist about these feelings breifly and they reassured me to try the medication and see how my progress goes while continuing therapy.
10802,I'd also like to hear how people felt just before starting meds for the first time.
10803,I told her I thought it was the medication but she said it was a symptom of my anxiety.
10804,I think i would as I have been on medication before and am seeing a therapist.
10805,"its like before i started the meds, im having terrible anxiety right now, is this normal."
10806,However the one thing that keeps me in this loop is my fear of medication.
10807,"I want to get better so bad, but I am scared of the side effects of meds."
10808,"I see a psychiatrist who wants me to take meds again, but I didn't do too well the last time I tried them."
10809,"I desperately want to get better, but my anxiety is stopping me from taking the meds."
10810,"The medicine makes it more manageable, but its really all coming down to how I handle my thoughts."
10811,"I spent the next 2 years hopping through different meds, eventually ending up on citalopram, where I am now."
10812,I took 20mg for about 4 months and am now weaning off it because I'm sick of my meds giving me side effects.
10813,"In these 6 years, I've never been without medication."
10814,I'm a little curious as to what it's going to be like transitioning from this to medication-free.
10815,"I'm not taking anxiety medication, because I haven't had my first counselling session yet (19 days!"
10816,Just an FYI to always check your meds for possible side effects-my anxiety levels this summer have been skyrocketing and I had no idea why.
10817,"I had successfully weaned myself off anxiety meds (SSRI's, with the help of a doctor) last year and was seriously considering going back on them when I saw something I think on this sub -but possibly another one- about Topomax, which I had been put on in May for migraines."
10818,"Just a heads up that sometimes a benign medication (honestly, I had asked to be prescribed it because it also aids in weight loss) can be exacerbating your anxiety."
10819,Finally found some good medication and I was feeling the greatest I have felt in years.
10820,I thought medication was supposed to stop this.
10821,"I ended up leaving my friends house to go home and take an anti-anxiety medication, and on the way out I began dry heaving and vomiting."
10822,"I ended up on Effexor which worked great, but i hated the medication."
10823,"So when I went back on meds, the prozac, I wanted to make sure that was working and so I stopped taking Xanax."
10824,I ended up having an attack right after and freaked out because I thought it was a reaction to the meds.
10825,"I've been medication free for over half a decade now, recently (several months now) due to a whole bunch of stuff I just don't want to get into."
10826,Can anybody tell me about their experiences with short-term/as-needed medications?
10827,"My family has all sorts of mental problems - my brother is diagnosed bipolar, yet refuses to go to therapy or take medication for it."
10828,I feel sometimes judged and looked down on in my family for doing therapy and now medication at all - but at the same time I'm the *only fucking one* in the family that seems to actually be seeking help to overcome this.
10829,"After years of anxiety and a recent state of dizziness, nervousness, loss of train of thought, my doctor and I decided to try medicine."
10830,"I slowly tapered off of that and I've been medication-free for coming close to 6 months, and while I'm ""functional"", I'm definitely slowly moving back towards my old anxiety riddled self so I caved and made an appointment with my doctor."
10831,"A few things have kept me from seeking treatment--feeling like I might not be taken seriously, fear of medication side effects, inertia...Has anyone else had similar experiences?"
10832,"Anyone else have these issues, related to anxiety, anxiety/depression medication, sleep medication, or caffeine use?"
10833,"I have been trying to get off my medicine (fluoxetine, 20mg daily) for a few months now but keep returning to it."
10834,I feel like i'm not who I am supposed to be when i'm on my medication.
10835,"I take a medication every night, and as a PRN."
10836,"I was prescribed 25mg but I had a panic attack before taking the medicine because I thought it might be too powerful, so I cut the pill in half."
10837,"Edit: I should also mention, I forgot to take my meds yesterday and sunday, but have gone much longer without them before (not on purpose)."
10838,"She is medicated for both, but always takes less than her doctor prescribes because she is worried she will become addicted to her medications."
10839,I went to the doctor &gt; referred to psych &gt; feel much better now thanks to modern medicine.
10840,"It was for OCD like touching something twice because it felt ""right"" or something and the meds were supposed to help with the anxiety part I guess if I didn't do my OCD."
10841,"im not embarrassed, or scared so i dont know what the fuck is going on and its pissing me off i am no way going back on any meds."
10842,"I just don't know what to do, I think i should talk to a therapist or get some medication."
10843,"I'm in therapy but not currently on medication, as most of them seemed to make it worse and according to two different psychiatrists I've tried just about all the medication options."
10844,"Thank you for taking the time to read this and if you have any suggestions, ideas, things to try - things that don't involve medicine - it would be great."
10845,Do I need medication?
10846,"I had issues with panic attacks when I was in college, was on a one a day medication I believe Paxil or Paroxotine for a about a year."
10847,Once I started feeling fine I weened of the medication.
10848,Just talked to my doctor the other day about being put on medication for anxiety and she recommended Celexa.
10849,Perhaps I should have my medication increased....
10850,"I've been on meds for the anxiety, but I can see the sleepless night coming already."
10851,"And on top of that, the meds I've been using for the last 8 years?"
10852,I ironically have anxiety about taking anxiety medication so I don't want to know anything that could make me scared to take it.
10853,"I would get medication, but my mom doesn't want me on pills for it, and she deals with my insurance so I can't get pills behind her back."
10854,The daydreams are making me so upset that I might take medicine and just sleep the rest of the day but I have obligations to take care of before I leave.
10855,My worst fear is that I come off these meds and the LES pain comes back like it was.
10856,Trying to calm people when the price of their medicine has changed or when we don't have something ready for them the moment they step up to the counter.
10857,It doesn't help that I'm not actually a medical or pharmacy student; So I really don't know much about the medicines themselves or about insurance matters.
10858,I let the Doctor prescribe me two different medications: 150mg of Bupropion daily (to be increased to 300mg on Monday) and 50mg of Trazodone each night to help me sleep in the meantime but I hate how it makes me feel so I have stopped taking the latter of the two.
10859,I stopped taking meds about 4 years ago (before I moved to the USA) and my depression still rears it head occasionally but it is not really an issue.
10860,Does anyone know if there any meds out there that I can even take if I were to become pregnant/had experience with this?
10861,I do have anxiety and take medication as needed (Xanax 1 mg).
10862,"I'm not on ANY other medications, I have a mirena IUD as birth control."
10863,"Hi I was just wondering about medicines and such for treating anxiety , what exactly does it do to someone and are there any long term/short term side affects to taking the medicine?"
10864,Any success stories with this medication?
10865,"I just wanted to know if anyone here overcame anxiety with meds, how they changed after it."
10866,I've been trying various medications and therapies since I was 13 years old.
10867,"Also, should I be seeing a Psych in addition to the medication or wait until it takes effect (hopefully)?"
10868,I get these infrequently and I'm not on meds.
10869,One of my biggest anxieties is over taking new medications.
10870,"It doesn't matter if it's something I have to have (antibiotics for an infection for example), it doesn't matter if I've taken it before without problem, I still have a really hard time and basically have to FORCE myself to take any medications."
10871,I have had a pretty rough past with medications for anxiety and depression.
10872,Does anyone have experience with getting off of medication?
10873,"The one doctor that prescribed me this medication was a doctor that would prescribe ANYTHING, which I felt was dangerous and scary."
10874,"I do see her point in staying on the medication for longer-- she wants her child (I'm well in my 20s, lol) to not suffer more than they have."
10875,"She also says she wants me to see the doctor that prescribed me the medication in the first place, but man, let me tell you, that doctor is nuts."
10876,"I guess overall, all I really need is reassurance that it is OKAY to start to go back to a life without medication."
10877,I personally don't know anyone (or anyone that has talked to me about this) that has gotten off of medication and that has conquered anxiety/depression.
10878,I really do feel like I'm at that point where I will be successful without medication.
10879,"I partly just wanted to rant and ask for other people's experience who are in a similar situation, and maybe advice on medication or ways to relax."
10880,I didn't abuse the meds and haven't gone back since for follow up.
10881,"I'm normally against medication because I saw it turn my dad into a zombie, who himself had suffer from severe manic depression and bipolar...something I'm trying to avoid."
10882,"So I've been battling with anxiety/depression in a serious way for about a year now, and between the symptoms and the meds I haven't been able to do much of anything."
10883,I was fine once I was prescribed a temporary dose of anxiety medication (10mg Propranolol I think it was) and flew straight through the test and passed.
10884,Have you used/using any permanent prescribed and/or over the counter medications to relieve the anxiety?
10885,I'm looking for success stories of people who have gotten off of an anxiety medication.
10886,"I saw a therapist a handful of times and then that was that... Never really encouraged to do anything else, so I just sort of accepted that medication was what I needed and I took it faithfully until the end of last year - so for about a total of 15 years."
10887,At the end of last year various circumstances made me open my eyes to the fact that medicine was the wrong answer.
10888,Am I doomed to a life of anxiety caused mainly by medication withdrawal or being on a medicine I don't want to be?
10889,I feel like there's a dual inside of me raging all the time: the part of me on medicine and the part of me that is human and waking up again for the first time in almost 15 years.
10890,"The human part is getting stronger, but in it's awareness I'm just now realizing how much I hated myself while I was on the medicine."
10891,Another thing that alleviates my symptoms are taking over the counter medication such as ibuprofen and advil.
10892,"I also hate being on medication for whatever reason and that my parents kept a ""scorecard"" of my actions when i was younger and so now i do it to."
10893,I want to go on my medication for it(paxil) but hate being on medicine because it makes me feel like a drone.
10894,"But even going on the medication wont help me with the ""scorecard"" mentality and i want that gone as well."
10895,"After having anxiety my whole life, I was officially given a diagnosis and began medication in 2009."
10896,"Before the medication, I felt very removed from my body, even hiding under a desk at one point."
10897,"Right now I'm living in a constant state of anxiety (my normal is to do pretty well with an occasional full-blown attack, I take no meds)."
10898,"My meds (heavy cocktail of SARI+SSRI+NDRI+Benzodiazepine) have proven to be in some way effective on depression (mainly future centered, still there but less now, i can at least work again more or less), sleep and energy but these do nothing for my social anxiety at large."
10899,"This is pretty much unsolveable for me, and so is my social anxiety or even thinking of any relationship, now i can ""function"" again on meds for some time but not really solve anything in the end."
10900,But as soon as I had a setback in the anxiety I started doubting the medication and it's effectiveness.
10901,"""After a long time with therapy and finding the correct medication, maybe I can be like that"" I say to myself."
10902,"What followed was a few good days, another catastrophe-level panic attack, then five days where I could barely force myself to eat anything, lost 10 pounds, slept 4 scattered hours a night (partly because the meds caused insomnia and partly because of the hunger pain), and was too scared (and too weak) to leave the house."
10903,"Since then, I've done a pretty good job of convincing myself and others around me that I don't want to try meds again, but I've also continued to have panic attacks and anxious feelings at a rate and level that I never had them before the incident with citalopram."
10904,It's just been me and my therapist trying to deal with the trauma of what happened with the meds.
10905,I'm so scared of meds now.
10906,"But at the same time, I know medication could probably help me."
10907,They were so bad I called my mom to talk about maybe seeing someone or getting medication.
10908,I'm also considering medication but I don't know if that's appropriate for my situation.
10909,"I used to be on medication a couple years ago given to me by a family doctor but was never actually diagnosed with anything other than ""yeah you're having anxiety attacks""."
10910,They are the only medication that seemed to help my anxiety &amp; panic attacks.
10911,"The doctor would usually throw in some kind of anti-depressant or ""sleep"" medicine like Trazadone."
10912,"He just throws me on a bunch of meds to make a me a zombie, that his answer to my problems."
10913,I wish I could find a medicine that is quick acting like a benzodiazepine but without the terrible side effects (deadly withdrawals).
10914,I am beginning to realize that taking medication will be my only shot at a happy life.
10915,So I've made an appointment to see a psychiatrist on Aug 16th to see about switching to a new medication.
10916,"I don't take anxiety medication anymore, and I need some help coping without it."
10917,"I'm having trouble differentiating between anxiety symptoms- chest pain, dizziness, nausea, rapid heartbeat- and the symptoms of an allergy to the medication, which are similar."
10918,"I've tried breathing techniques, reading other threads, everything... and I can't get it out of my head that I'm going to die from this medication."
10919,I never liked taking prescription meds because feeling numb and zombie-like isn't my ideal state.
10920,"For a herbal medicine that is supposedly mild, it felt like I took a Tylenol PM, minus the groggy side effects."
10921,"Whenever I've been to therapy as a teen, it always seemed like I was just being evaluated to see which medication I needed to be put onto."
10922,"None of these medications have actually made me feel ""better""."
10923,"And while some of the symptoms get better with medication and lifestyle changes, I still have perpetual headaches."
10924,"Because it appears to be subconcious, my numerous bouts of therapy and CBT have done nothing so I've resorted to trying medication."
10925,"I didn't feel a single noticeable positive effect on any of those medications although I was only using them for 4 weeks (apart from the Lexapro) and at minimum dose, so maybe I need to raise my dosage?"
10926,"Anyway - back to the main question, what medications have been successful for YOU to help deal with symptoms of anxiety/agoraphobia?"
10927,"The Zoloft had been working well on my anxiety and depressing, but I was having the postponed-orgasm problem...  And this new medicine allegedly works like Zoloft but without that side effect."
10928,"So, as is ever the question with meds: How do I know if 1) I'm perceiving run-of-the-mill life crap as worse than it is because the medicine isn't working, or 2) the last couple of weeks have in fact Sucked and I should blame this pill?"
10929,"I'm just curious to hear stories from others who've tried this new (and expensive, as there's no generic yet) medication."
10930,Should I seek medication?
10931,"I've started taking some self portraits already, some with my (many) medications and some representing my trouble sleeping."
10932,My doctor has really been encouraging me to try medication but it's never been something I've wanted to try.
10933,I have had a few friends who've reacted terribly to medications &amp; it's really put me off of the concept...
10934,So I'm basically crowdsourcing experiences with medications as treatment for anxiety and/or depression.
10935,I felt tightness in my chest and was sure that it was caused by the meds because I made the mistake of reading about them on the Internet.
10936,"This summer, I decided that after 9 months and I was feeling great, I should ween off completely as I was under the impression that I didn't want to be dependent on meds for the rest of my life."
10937,"My family are not really pro-medication and I guess growing up around the stigma of drug=bad, I am very nervous about the possibility of being prescribed medication."
10938,"Personally, I think medication is a wonderful tool in the process of self-healing, but you know... logic is not always equal to anxiety."
10939,Is there anything I should know about taking medications?
10940,"I've finally gotten onto medication, after being diagnosed with GAD, and boy was the first week shitty."
10941,"Due to habit, I took one medication for two days and then the other, so propanolol first."
10942,"Years later (last year) I went to the hospital to control my insulin resistance again, and when I mentioned my doctor I was taking fluoxetine (I actually asked her for prescription because I couldn’t get it anymore in the drug stores), she looked at me confused, asked my age, and told me I had to follow a mental health treatment, that I was “too young for that kind of medicine.” I felt pretty bad about it."
10943,"Every 3 months I must see the doctor in charge of the mental health department of the hospital so he or she gives me the prescription for my medicine, and he or she decides if I have to take more of less of the pills."
10944,"I now have a few beers every now and then, smoke pot every week or two, and I take my meds as prescribed, every once in a while I take an extra ritalin, or don't take any that day."
10945,It's been two nights without a moment of sleep and I'm not sure of its coincidental and I'm just super anxious or if the medicine really is keeping me awake.
10946,"The problem here is, with I am on the meds I feel like I'm dull."
10947,So I have been off meds for a while now.
10948,"I can't believe that my university, a leader in medicine, that has built an entire department to provide mental health services to students, has failed to recognize my issues despite providing everything they ask for."
10949,Would I get put on medication?
10950,I'm not sure if I want to be put on medication but I'm not sure if I can deal with whatever is going on with me for the past 5 years any longer.
10951,As I'm already stressed out and I'm not sure how medication would effect my studies/revision/memory.
10952,"the first week i was on this medication, everything was fine."
10953,"So, I read that turmeric helps improve your memory, so I was wondering if there's anyone here who's taking similar medication and turmeric at the same time and if the turmeric has helped improving your memory?"
10954,I am on an antibiotic and asthma meds.
10955,I'm terrified the meds aren't working and I'm going to be hospitalized with a deadly virus!
10956,the meds worked well on physical symptoms of SA but nothing for my racing mind and panic attacks.
10957,My doctor prescribed me some blood pressure medicine and now that it's run out I can't get ahold of her to either make an appointment or refill them.
10958,So last night was the first night in...god I don't remember how long I went out somewhere without taking medicine.
10959,"This sounds stupid I guess but I almost freaked out because not being on medicine and having people get near me, when I know they might have forgotten to wash their hands, or might have been sick, or etc that's a **HUGE** thing for me."
10960,"It wasn't intentional, I didn't go out without medicine on purpose I just didn't have time to take what I needed to, and by the time I got out I realized I hadn't."
10961,"Includes giving meds throughout the night and morning, general house cleaning, and general care-taking of the guys)."
10962,"I took no medicine, no nothing."
10963,"Thankfully I am seeing my counselor next week and she had said something about me meeting with an actual psychiatrist instead of a primary care doctor, since they obviously know more about mental health issues and can prescribe medication."
10964,"I have an appointment with a psychiatrist scheduled for this afternoon - I've been on meds for years, but I've had to find a new doctor after finishing grad school and I'm quite nervous."
10965,What if he wants to change my meds?
10966,Do medications really help?
10967,"I want to see what it's like living a 'normal' life....

Has medication really helped any of you?"
10968,"It like my brain was repeating what I had done that day (which was go to nannas) what scares me is that I have NO RECOLLECTION of this I don't remember the shower or passing out, i only had about 4-5 beers and a couple of these pills..I know I shouldn't have mixed the alcohol with medication (that wasn't mine) but why does that happen?"
10969,"My doctor has offered to put me on medications, but I have a friend who thinks I should continue to try and deal with it on my own."
10970,I have been on Paxil for a month and a half and my anxiety is definitely better controlled on this medication.
10971,I want to take meds but I don't want to lose creativity or energy.
10972,At the same time I worry about not being able to function any more without medication.
10973,"I feel like I might as well just not be on medication at all, it's a waste of my money and I'm not so certain it isn't making me feel a little bit worse."
10974,I'm curious to see what other people's views/experiences are with meds.
10975,When might it be a good idea to talk to a doctor about medicine?
10976,"I have been to a psychiatrist who strongly suggested medication, but I refuse because of my phobias:

1."
10977,I could not handle this medication making me sick.
10978,I fear medication will give a similar feeling.
10979,Is the benefit of taking meds better than the risks?
10980,"Sorry if somebody already ask, but are there any meds i can take that works for you that's over the counter?"
10981,I need to change meds and am looking for suggestions that do not cause weight gain - thanks to Celexa and Luxapro I gained almost 20 lbs in a month...I need an anti anxiety and an antidepressant.
10982,"I'm not taking any meds currently and I don't have a doctor (although, there is a handy walk-in clinic nearby if I need one)."
10983,Taking no medications.
10984,"I know people say not to consider medication unless your anxiety is preventing you from living a normal life, but to me, my fear about stepping out of my comfort zone is indeed preventing me from living the kind of life I want to live."
10985,Is a case like mine an appropriate one to begin a course of medication?
10986,And what sort of medications would it be appropriate to consider?
10987,"I've never been on medication, although I have had a therapist off and on."
10988,I don't drink nor do drugs nor am I on meds.
10989,Anxiety meds are helpful but I have OCS about becoming addicted and don't take them as prescribed even if I am given a small reasonable dose and I don't abuse them.
10990,"Anxiety meds help with my pain, sometimes but other things aren't in my head and just hurt."
10991,I don't like being on medication because it changes my personality and I have lots of side effects.
10992,"I'm sick of meds that don't work, therapy that doesn't help, coping strategies that don't help me cope."
10993,Why isn't my medicine solving both problems ?
10994,"This all said, I do not want medications either."
10995,"One in addition developed some pretty severe GI disturbances, and the other started having seizures (meds were the ONLY thing that had changed."
10996,TL;DR: Any real benefit in actually getting officially tested for anxiety/possibly also depression if I'm already seeing a counselor and absolutely refuse medication?
10997,The meds have not helped in the weight department.
10998,I've slowed the meds down and starting taking melatonin to help me sleep.
10999,"I really want to go back to a normal dosage of my meds, but it can't gain weight."
11000,"Any kind words or polite advice on how to get these awful comments out of my head so I don't have to resort to my ""fat, but happy"" meds?"
11001,"This is a short story about my anxiety, the medication I took and how eventually my life took a turn for the better."
11002,I went to see the doctor again and said I wanted to stop taking medication.
11003,My brain felt woken up and like the glass that the medication had put there was lifted.
11004,Any ideas on medicine I can ask my doctor about next week?
11005,Is it time for me to call my doctor and increase/change my medication?
11006,"Even though you don't have any sort of background on me, I thought you'd appreciate hearing that I've been off my meds since Monday."
11007,It took me awhile to post on here because I'm not one to talk about my problems but I am really stressed out about taking these meds.. Any help is appreciated.
11008,On medication.
11009,My doctor put gave me medication that helps my anxiety as well as helps me sleep.
11010,"-No medication; though weed has been helpful, I use it socially sometimes."
11011,I think that removes the medication aspect of it when it becomes a social thing.
11012,"EDIT: I am also not on any medication, don't do drugs(I've smoked weed a few times but that just makes me even more nervous) I occasionally smoke cigarettes but that also sometimes get me all jittery and makes my heart race."
11013,I am taking medication (anti-depressant and anti-anxiety) and talking with a counselor.
11014,I am not currently on meds because I have been on them (anti depressents) in the past and saw no results.
11015,"What kind of medications should I outright avoid, in your experience?"
11016,What kind of medications work/worked for you?
11017,I am not medicated and would prefer not to be dependent on medication but have always been open to therapy.
11018,I also don't want to be dependent on meds as I said before.
11019,"I've encountered few people whom lives where effected in a positive way from taking prescription psych medication(share yours and be honest please)

TL;DR I've never taken drugs and this thought comforts me if I do take drugs now and they don't work out I think I might give up on everything and rote away."
11020,Does medication help with social anxiety?
11021,"I'm 18, female, and not currently on any medications."
11022,"Edit: I suppose I should mention that I don't have insurance, so it makes it difficult to seek any professional help or even just get medications."
11023,"I had managed this with my depression in the past, and when I started going to the therapy sessions and taking the medication I thought this would be the exact same thing."
11024,Tons of meds and a few doctors later I kinda have a sense of where I am at.
11025,"You see, I am a emetophobe(fear of vomiting) and since I had severe vomiting during my food poisoning, I have been worried ever since...probably to the point of a stomach ulcer  

As I am typing this at 4:00am CST, I am shaking wildly, already having exhausted my daily intake of anxiety meds(Klonopin 6mg) and anti-nausea meds."
11026,"The counselors don't know how to help me honestly, and meds don't work much for me."
11027,"Some back story,  I was on a great medication (Latuda) for almost 4 months and it gave me akathisia and panic attacks so bad I had to get off of it."
11028,"Now I'm between medications and it's a really scary uncertain time, so I wrote this:
      I've chosen to personify my anxiety recently."
11029,"That's why it was so nice to have a medication that worked, and allowed me to do normal life tasks more effortlessly."
11030,"It IS sad that I am not currently on a medication that is successfully managing my anxiety on it's own, and I am allowed to be sad about that, without beating myself up."
11031,"I do take prozac for depression and anxiety (low dosage as I don't want to become dependant on it) and other than medication, what helps some of you when you feel like this, if ever."
11032,"The ""use as needed"" meds like Xanax all put me to sleep."
11033,"The maintenance meds I would take and we'd slowly up the dosage until the side effects were unbearable, and then move on to something else."
11034,I had stopped going to the doctor for a while (couldn't afford it and the copays on my medications) but I'm looking for a new one.
11035,I guess I'll start trying random medications in the hope that one will actually work.
11036,"Basically over the past few years I have become increasingly more anxious with my actions (lifestyle etc) and I find it hard to engage people... As far as prescribed medication goes, I am on lexapro 10mg..

ANYWAYS!"
11037,So I've been on medication since June and I want to know how it should affect me.
11038,Are there no meds which make you more calm and less anxious ?
11039,I used to take daily medication for anxiety but I can't handle the side-effects.
11040,"Suffered with anxiety for 4-5 years now, taken antidepressants/antianxiety meds on and off."

11043,"It seemed as though everything was getting better for a while, and I stopped taking the meds that the drs prescribed and things started to look ok again."
11044,"The hospital also prescribed me with a weeks supply of Diazepam 5mg, but I want to do more research before committing to medication."
11045,"I don't take any medication, I'm definitely not an active person, I'm very good at cooping myself up inside my house and not doing much."
11046,"A few weeks ago I finally managed to find a medication that works for me, of course it did not eliminate the problem but it made it easier."
11047,"As for going to my GP, who I know quite well, I fear he would instantly see how far I have dropped and prescribe me medication ,therapy etc."
11048,"I for the first time in 3 months went out where Im not feeling ""safe""on no medication and ate burgers."
11049,Currently in therapy and taking meds for depression.
11050,I haven't had much experience in changing anxiety meds so any advice is appreciated.

11052,I already tried medication and I don't want to anymore.
11053,Meds after meds and I finally feel a bit better.
11054,The recommendation of the guy who worked with me was to find a therapist to work through and it to consider medication as a stop gap.
11055,"I've never been on any kind of medication before, so I just wanted to maybe talk through it with some folks who have been or previously used this stuff."
11056,Any general feedback about either of these medicines would be greatly appreciated.
11057,It's not near as bad as it was prior to my meds but I don't want to let it get to that point.
11058,I've had this in the past and overcame it with meds and CBT.
11059,"I want to try to get over this without relying on meds again, but another day or two and I'll go see my doc, but in the mean time I'm looking for your help."
11060,"Here's an example: as I was writing this, I was worried for a second that people would read this and say ""You're obviously just feeling the meds"" or ""why can't I feel like that?""."
11061,The idea of medication (which might reduce libido!!)
11062,"I can't be in cars too much(especially at night), I have medication which is usually needed whenever entering new social situations, and I'm basically not a sane person during finals at school because I'm guaranteed panic attacks from the lack of sleep and high caffeine intake."
11063,"He was actually really helpful and suggested trying some medications if I'm interested (pristiq, anyone tried it?"
11064,"I am taking meds due to the constant anxiety, and going to therapy (so are the kids)."
11065,"I've had anxiety issues for as long as I can remember, but in the past few months I've been seeing a lot of improvement (without medication, just coping techniques)."
11066,"I've been developing this/trying to combat this for the last 5 years, to the point that I have to carry anti anxiety meds on me at all times, and often they aren't enough for the acute attacks, only leaving the situation can solve it for me."
11067,"My head was a chemistry experiment for years, but I finally found the right medicines that weren’t a volatile mixture."
11068,"I’m currently only on one medication and it’s only for DEFCON 1 level emergencies, but being positive and finding the strengths in my weakness has been the best medicine I’ve tried."
11069,"Hey guys,

Like most of you, i've struggled with anxiety for a quite a few years, and having parents that firmly believe medicine can do no good for me certainly hasn't helped."
11070,"Here are a few articles about what i'm talking about so you can get a better understanding -

11074,"I think I need to see a psychiatrist to at least talk about the possibility of medication, and hopefully get something that just makes my anxiety more even and a bit more toned down to a point that I can deal with it better."
11075,How long should I take the medicine before deciding whether it's working for me?
11076,"I know that there are probably some drawbacks of taking anything, I'm just really afraid of what those drawbacks are and that the medicine will turn me into ""not-me"" and no one will notice."

11081,"It's basically the square wheel of ""medication""."
11082,"Hi,

I just wanted to ask what is your view on medication for social anxiety."
11083,Especially since it is recommended to take these medications no longer than a year or so.
11084,Is this something I should seek medication for?
11085,I've always been against treating stuff like this with meds but it was the only thing I've ever done to help.
11086,"I'm fit, I'm young (late 20s), I don't smoke, I'm not obese, I don't drink excessively, I eat relatively okay, but I have to take two blood pressure medications to get to a relatively high blood pressure reading 130-140/80-90."
11087,When on just the one medication my blood pressure went as high as 170/100 and when I was in the hospital for a kidney surgery it was as high as 200/100.
11088,Anyone have any experience with these medications?
11089,I feel like I might as well not be on medication right now because this is like it used to be.
11090,He didn't want someone trying to get me on a cocktail of medications when I really only needed one and some good CBT.

11093,"I've been on it for nearly two months now, and although my moods are under control, I have been having some of the most vivid, bizarre dreams since I started taking meds again!"
11094,"I'm so scared it was me causing the panic attacks and not the meds, even though I wasn't scared of taking them in the beginning."
11095,I'd give anything to go back to how I was before I tried the meds.
11096,"I haven't taken meds since I was 15 years old (for the OCD) and have preferred to take the holistic, natural route."

11100,"I have a lot of knowledge about behavioral medicine, and how brain and body interact, and suffering from GAD has been the most frustrating thing I've ever had to deal with, mostly due to the fact that no matter how much I understand it, it seems outside of my control at times."
11101,So I put another one on and the anxiety medication that I'm on gives me slight erectile disfunciton so I went limp for a while.
11102,"Perhaps only a coincidence, I had started taking medication that day before hearing the news, something pushed me to go to the doctor and something was starting to change."
11103,"Doctor prescribed meds for acid reflux, and no caffeine or alcohol."
11104,I want to avoid meds altogether if possible but I want to find the right path to being myself again.

11136,"Are there a lot of cases where being treated by meds and therapy for a few years, stabilizing, and then getting off meds keeps people stable?"

11218,A few of my friends have suggested therapy and medication but I'm not sure what's the first step.
11219,"I've also tried medication, which worked in the short term but made things worse over time."
11220,"Basically, I want to know if going on anxiety medication is the absolute best thing to do."
11221,"I don't know whether the doctor I'm going to see Wednesday is a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist so I don't know if he is going to be able to prescribe medication for my anxiety and I am in desperate need of SOMETHING fast because I feel like I'm losing it every day a little more."
11222,I used to take anxiety medication but I haven't had insurance for 7 years so I had to stop.
11223,"My husband said I should just call and ask if he can prescribe medication or not but I feel like I will sound like I'm a drug addict and I'm getting really bad anxiety thinking if he can't what the hell am I going to do for the next few days, months or whatever, I have things to do!"
11224,I'm looking forward to feeling the pains of anxiety and doing something about it instead of the side effects of medication.
11225,I know I'm going to get flack for forgetting my medication.
11226,Holy crap this place is packed I didnt bring my meds this is just....breathing must remember to breath.
11227,I have medication (sertraline) but I haven't started taking them yet because of my extreme paranoia concerning the rare side effects.
11228,"I'm on meds, maybe that prevents extreme panic, maybe it's not doing anything."
11229,The insomniac medicine they give me at least helps me fall asleep.
11230,He thinks that if the doctor gives me medicine that I will calm down and not mind him dating other people.
11231,"Since childhood I've felt constantly ""off,"" and I came from a very anti-meds family that subscribed to the ""just toughen up already"" school of thinking."
11232,"The whole point of bringing it up finally was because it's affected my life and recently I feel like my anxiety and depression is negatively impacting my job...but the meds I'm on aren't working and I don't know if it's just not been long enough, if I'm on the wrong medication or the wrong dosage."
11233,Do the effectiveness of meds wear off?
11234,I always thought herbal medicine was a bunch of pseudoscience bullshit and I was and still am an extreme skeptic of everything that's not clinically tested and proven to work.
11235,This is just one of many times we have tried to contact hospitals and institutions to get me some long lasting therapy or adjustment of medication.
11236,Family life is ok. Not on any meds.
11237,"I have been on quite a few meds, though none of the good stuff (lol)."
11238,"Recently I stopped taking my medication (Welbutrin, Cymbalta and Vistaril) and have been doing fine."
11239,"Yes, this can be a result of the lingering general anesthesia or the pain killer they gave me right after the operation (I'm very sensitive to medication, but have not been taking anything but Tylenol because my anxiety is not severe)

Here's the thing--I've made two calls to hotline nurses in the past two days to find some reassurance that what I'm experiencing--the insane fatigue--is simply caused by the anesthesia, and that it will go away soon."
11240,Is the medicine they gave me after my surgery going to effect my well being?
11241,"I am seeing a therapist and I'm on medication, and while those have helped few things give the instant relief that talking to my parents or close friends give."
11242,"For clarification: I'm 21, Female, on no medication, and from the US."
11243,"Please, I've been thinking about coming off this medicine for a while, what are my alternatives for medication?"
11244,"I was put on medicine and it seemed to be helping and I was perfectly fine throughout the whole summer, even got myself a boyfriend."
11245,I'm taking this medication now every time I feel like I'm going to have an attack.
11246,"Then I came back in the room with the two of them when they called me in, and the psychiatrist plainly told me that she could prescribe me medication that very day."
11247,"But she also stated that she needed samples or tests of blood and a physical from me, and I agreed to take a physical from my own doctor, then give her the results, and after she's seen the results, by that point I will have decided to take medication or not and notify her of my decision."
11248,"And she'll decide on which meds to give me, based on other things, like if I had bad cholesterol or blood pressure issues, etc."
11249,"It can be a bit confusing because I'm already confusing myself, but uh, I never intended to start therapy straight with medication."
11250,"But basically the russian lady seemed like she was more than happy to prescribe me medication, which worried me a bit or made me feel paranoid."
11251,"I mean, I just thought it was unsafe, to prescribe meds immediately to a patient who you just met."
11252,So she's only recommending meds based on the conversation that I had with her.
11253,"But uh after my dad and I agreed to get the physical done, and then decide whether to start on meds or not, the psychiatrist asked if it was okay for me to take a urine drug test."
11254,I have 6 weeks to decide whether or not I should take medication for my anxiety/ depression.
11255,"I don't even know what the meds will be for, to be honest."
11256,"I just remember the russian lady telling me that she recommends I take medication, because she thinks it will be good for me."
11257,When being treated I always resisted going on daily meds because doctors insisted that I needed anti-depressants when I kept telling them I was a generally happy person who was just going through some heavy things (2 suicides to people close to me within 6 months)  I worked through my anxiety through use of xanax when attacks were really really bad and just learning behavioral patterns to help pass these attacks by.
11258,Am I doing a disservice by continuing to recommend she take xanax episodically coupled with therapy sessions to talk her issues out over listening to a psychiatrist who has had her on three medications in three visits?
11259,"I stopped taking my anti depressants/anti anxiety meds, I was doing so well."
11260,Now I've been to weddings and parties without taking any benzos and managing my anxiety mentally (I am on long term meds - Prozac and Wellbutrin).
11261,I am starting medication on Monday and will also be starting classes focused on dealing with Anxiety too.
11262,Did any specific medication or therapy help?
11263,Any medication ideas?
11264,I can't stop the panic without medication.
11265,The only thing that gives me any relief is anti-anxiety medication.
11266,"I've spoken with both my therapist and my doctor about this and have a generic Klonopin for days when it is overwhelming (I do not take daily medication for my disorders, and I'm trying to avoid such), and a lot of the thought process was that it was surrounding my inability to be active after an injury, but now that I'm active again, the anxiety is continuing."
11267,"under medication, the anxiety is loads better."
11268,I'm out of my anti-anxiety meds and will see the doctor only next week.
11269,"I haven't had medication for a long time for various reasons, but day-to-day life is pretty much fine and I have coping techniques that help with work, etc."
11270,"I've had chronic constipation since I was an infant, but this acne medicine made things way worse and I've never felt the same."
11271,"Even though I now had the medicine to help me, my parents still wondered why I would get anxiety in the first place."
11272,"My problem is, I feel too dependent on this medicine."
11273,I want to get off of this medication and be able to relax at nights without it.
11274,I don't know if I need medication or a therapist.
11275,"About a year ago when I was in college I also did have panic attacks in class but at that time I never sought counseling/medication because I thought everything was in ""my head"" and just needed to get over it."
11276,"It seems obvious to me that my doctor, who is familiar with the fact that I have a panic disorder, would make sure that any medication for other issues wouldn't cause anxiety."
11277,"Luckily my husband put two and two together and looked up the side effects of the new medication: anxiety, problems with sense of identity, and hallucinations."
11278,"ANYWAY, I explained to him (against his advice) that I cannot stay in Jordan for the duration of the 'healing process' from the meds (Cypralex and Deanxit were the commercial names)."
11279,"I went home, told my mom that I stopped the meds and that my doctor committed suicide."
11280,"I had parents tell teachers they didn't want their child in the same class as me because I had a ""teachers aide"" at one point, because the school pushed my parents to put me on a plethora of meds that I didn't need for something called ""ADHD""."
11281,"In K-2: My ""differences"" caused the school system to push my parents into putting me on Ritalin, which caused health problems, so a series of other meds, just to counteract the effects... eventually i developed Tortures Syndrome, No, I don't yell words, or curse randomly..."
11282,"I was ""fat"" after I was taken off the meds, causing me to balloon from 45lbs to 90 lbs in about 2 months."
11283,My parents refused to put me on any medications so the school told me i basically had to go.
11284,I do take medication but it does not help much.
11285,"They looked for a psychologist (briefly) but could not find one that would take adolescents (I had just turned 17), so they decided to just get me medication instead."
11286,So I cut my medication in half (5 mg to 2.5 mg) for two days before going off completely (my psychiatrist recommended this).
11287,"But roughly a week into taking the medications, I realized a lot of my anxiety went away with my ability to concentrate more effectively."
11288,I was awarded a promotion at work immediately after beginning the medication and began working out of town for weeks at a time.
11289,"One night at work it occurred to me that when I was on the medications, for the first time in my life, working didn't feel like a struggle."
11290,The only thing he will prescribe me is depression medication.
11291,"I tell him no thank you, I have been on 4 different types of depression medication spanning roughly 8 years, I do not like the way it makes me feel and I do not feel depressed currently."
11292,"He tells me that I should really try the depression medication, I once again decline and that is the end of the conversation."
11293,"She tells me no, persuades me to try the depression medication."
11294,I'm at a loss and I just don't feel very confident in continuing to try to be out back on medication.
11295,"What also bothers alot is that I won't take any action i.e therapy, self help, meds because if all those things don't work, I am truly lost."
11296,"I just said I felt fine, school is going well, the medicine is working great, whatever."
11297,He strongly feels I just need more medication but I strongly feel dead inside when I'm on them.
11298,I'm not a regular drinker and I don't do any drugs or abuse my meds but they almost Marchman Acted me last night so I know I must've been pretty bad.
11299,I don't know if it was the meds mixed with the alcohol or if I just had a drunken panic attack.
11300,"I've been offered anti anxiety medicine, but I'm scared of it."
11301,"Although not a proponent of meds, at this stage I am willing to try anything to suppress my panic disorder."
11302,I (19F) finally went to my doctor after dealing with horrible anxiety and panic attacks everyday for almost 3 months and I was put on medication.
11303,It makes me feel completely wrung out and I can still feel the anxiety underneath although the medication dulls it.
11304,"Unfortunately,  the medication that is necessar for brain feedback therapy causes synesthesia, or an ability to feel sounds through neurological impulses."
11305,"I know how important it is to be on a stable medicine plan and I would never make an irresponsible snap judgement, but Im starting to think i may need a change."
11306,No amount of medication or counseling helps.
11307,"It's originally a blood pressure medicine, but it's also prescribed to help reduce nightmares caused from PTSD."
11308,Does anyone else have experience with this medicine?
11309,Two have prescribed medication.
11310,"Some days I can deal, other days I've had to ""put myself to sleep"" using medication because the anxiety was just too much to deal with."
11311,My meds don't fucking work and I'm in the process of changing from an SSRI to an SNRI to see if that actually fucking does something for once.
11312,"I just moved 30 minutes away from him, and have contemplated getting a new therapist, but I'm paranoid of telling someone I don't know my problems and them maybe not putting me on the same medication."
11313,I told my therapist today I wanna put the kibosh on this once and for all and I even told her I'm willing to try nutritional solutions (Since my two rounds of meds didn't end wend for me) to finally get myself on track.
11314,"For starts, I'm 25 y/o, female, and have bipolar (I'm on medications..lithium, lamictal, and clonazepam for the anxiety mostly)."
11315,I've already taken my medicine.
11316,"He accepts that he has anxiety issues, but he refuses to get help and accuses me of ""badgering"" him whenever I bring up medication and/or therapy."
11317,and that he doesn't want to take medication.
11318,I'm also leery about being put on a permanent medication.
11319,"The doctor, i have been seeing would not prescribe me a take as needed anixety medicine bc of my age and how addicting they can become."
11320,I have been feeling hopeless and afraid that I may only find relief by taking medication.
11321,I really don't want to take medication as I know they can be very addictive and hard to stop using and I really want to be able to do this on my own.
11322,Is it possible to find relief away from medication?
11323,"Before this, I started taking Dramamine (a motion sickness medication sold over the counter, usually at 7-11's or drugstores) to calm my stomach down."
11324,"Hey guys, so l am prescribed seroquel and last night I took one and about 2 hours after I walk upstairs and that feeling of the medicine kicking in hit me full on and I passed out and had a short seizure-type thing and was out for a few seconds, medics came and said everything looks okay but the rest of the  time I was trying to eat, I kept feeling like it was happening again so I would lay on the floor."
11325,Should I keep taking my meds?
11326,"He is taking medication for it, but he still gets attacks when triggered."
11327,"I think I need medication, but I can't afford it."
11328,"I'm supposed to give the meds about two weeks before talking to my doctor, but should I mention this sooner or will it potentially go away after a couple more days?"
11329,"Ive been to my gp who reckons i also do and gave me a careplan and referrals to see specialists, especially about medication but i dont really want to go see them nor can i bring myself to do so."
11330,I have been depressed for a while and after upping a dose of one of my meds last week my anxiety has gotten harder to deal with.
11331,"I got allergy medicine in case of allergies, didn't do anything."
11332,Have any of you ever had to stop using Ativan or other benzodiazepines because of the amount of time you had been using the medication?
11333,"I've applied for college and am waiting upon acceptance, and really I should have been working the past two years but I started having panic attacks, got depressed and started meds (cipralex, and now effexor)."
11334,"Just felt like sharing a new development in my struggle with anxiety:

After months of therapy, starting a couple of new medications, and working very hard on keeping life in the proper perspective, I feel *normal* for the first time in years."
11335,"I've got general and social anxiety and am currently on Buspar (buspirone), my third medication attempt."
11336,"My only problem is that it is not addressing my inability to concentrate, which no medication has been able to do (some making it even worse)."
11337,I don't want to try out yet another medication.
11338,"Without changing my current medication, what are some things I can do to increase my concentration?"
11339,Is it common to prescribe medications for concentration along with anxiety medications?
11340,"Is there any ""natural"" remedy or cognitive exercises I can do to keep from having to take any more medication?"
11341,"In the past two years, I've given up caffeine entirely, been on and off SSRIs and Benzos, taken supplements, tried holistic medicines, attempted to break up my day with physical activity, changed my diet, and cycled through numerous therapists and psychiatrists."
11342,"I have people telling me I should do this or that - find a new doctor, get some other tests, try massage therapy, try a myriad of other medications, start up a workout routine - and maybe they're right, maybe one of those are the solution."
11343,Can medication help?
11344,I can get medication but my brain is sometimes stronger than the chemicals.
11345,My family has threatened to stop paying for my medication (not on Medicaid atm) if I don't keep this job.
11346,"These medicines are Metroprolol, Cardizem, and Klonopin."
11347,"And at least the hospital would give me food and medicine, and I wouldn't have to beg my family for it."
11348,Am I maybe just still adapting to the medicine and should wait another few weeks for the side effects to subside?
11349,I am extremely anxious about possible side effects of medication/it not working very well.
11350,I've had anxiety my entire life and have never felt the need/want to take medication until now.
11351,Any advice on the medication front?
11352,"I've always pondered the idea of whether or not medication would help him, and the counselor and specialist always give me that kind of random non-committal BS ""if you think it would help..."" kind of thing, never a ""yes, he needs it"", or ""no, he doesn't""."
11353,"Even with all this, and writing it out does make it seem like the decision is obvious, but I worry so much about finding the right medication, and what effect it has on kids, where a lot of it is random guesswork."
11354,"I don't know if that changes body chemistry, and I've also heard about the suicide connections to meds in teenagers."
11355,I have been considering medication...since anxiety does run in my family (basically my whole Dad's side of the family takes medication).
11356,"I don't take meds anymore, it's kind unreal for me to write this, and realize I don't have to pop a pill every day, 3 times a day."
11357,"im 25, now going to school again, seeing a councillor, on meds."
11358,I've never taken any medication apart from Atarax (which is an antihistamine) which doesn't really help.
11359,I'm very worried about taking medication and I don't know if I want to try it.
11360,"The main reasons I worry about medication are:

1."
11361,What are your experiences with Lyrica/Pregabalin and psychiatric medication in general?
11362,"I started with SSRI medication; I tried Paxil, Prozac, and Pristiq."
11363,"I really feel like I need to be on medication, but I don't know what."
11364,tl;dr: Tried medication/therapy/supplements/exercise/meditation to help with my constant fear.
11365,My goal is to get some therapy aided with necessary medication.
11366,I know the story is insane but here goes: I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a couple years ago and had reluctantly begun taking medication (60mg antidepressant and 30mg anti-anxiety) I've also been seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist.
11367,"Here's the thing: I've been forced, against my will, to abruptly stop taking all my meds and abruptly stop attending any and all psych and doctor appointments."
11368,"as I'm sure you know, **discontinuing medication (and therapy) utterly and abruptly without lowering doses over time, and without any doctor supervision is extremely dangerous** but I've been left with no choice 

Why do I have to stop taking meds and going to the doctor?"
11369,"Everytime I reach someone the answer is the same: ""we're working on fixing this, just check back in a few weeks"" they say this every time with no real specifics on who or how or when this will be fixed

up until now I've been rationing the dwindling medication I have left, often taking tiny fractions of my prescribed doses but as of tomorrow I will be 100% out of all my meds and it's kind of scary."
11370,Already I've begun using alcohol too often to supplement the anti-anxiety meds which is obviously stupid and dangerous but I'm at my wits end here.
11371,"I'm not currently on any prescribed medication, I take over the counter vitamin supplements that are marketed towards mood improvement that work to a degree to take the edge off."
11372,"The reason I'm not currently on medication is my last psychiatrist made me stop the one medication that thus far has made a difference on me being able to function at a high level during times of high anxiety one month in because ""she wasn't going to create a Xanax addict""."
11373,So I'm off all prescription medication and have not seen a psychiatrist since because now I have an irrational fear that no one will help me even if I find a medication that works.
11374,"I do go to therapy every other week, we are working on me getting back to get medication."
11375,"I've been seeing a psychotherapist for 3 years now, and while the therapy was extremely helpful in cutting through my perspective in the beginning, I'm really only going back to continue my medication cycle."
11376,"This has become very frustrating, because I'm basically paying just to get a prescription at the end of the visit, and my general practitioner refuses to prescribe me the medication on his own."
11377,"I'm taking the medicine that YOU insisted I needed, and now that I have a handle on what I actually need you're accusing me of being a fucking JUNKIE!"
11378,So I tried to set them up with another doctor but they believe that they will lose some sliding scale benefit for medication by going to another provider.
11379,"I am currently feeling very nervous about starting the medication as I am worried I will gain weight and become numb, etc."
11380,Is it possible for the meds to stop working...
11381,I never tried any medication.
11382,"I have made breakfast and taken my medication, and will not sink into the couch to extend my low to new depths."
11383,"I thought this medication was supposed to treat panic attacks, not exacerbate them?"
11384,"But I just spent a half an hour googling how I could kill myself with medication I have on hand, in my house (turns out it would be tough without alcohol, which I do not have)."
11385,"My medication (Citalopram 10 mg)  has been working great and I don't feel suicidal, and I know he'd take me off of it if I mentioned this."
11386,"All alternatives were exhausted (reading, movies, writing, talking, medicine, all of it) so I sat him down and guided him through a meditation session."
11387,I can't afford counseling and I'm hoping that once I get a steady income I can go to the doctor and get some medicine or something.
11388,The only medication I am on right now is allegra which seems to help a bit.
11389,"I want thaws visions to get out of my head and I want to enjoy life again  

I have anxiety at the thought of taking medication."
11390,"I've never taken tablets unless I've had to ... And my question is will it help me, or is the medication a bandaid as such and will only help while on it?"
11391,I don't know anything about anxiety medication or how to even word this properly.
11392,"It's either medication or keep plodding along, trying to help myself with natural things like mediation etc."
11393,I've taken about every over medication you can think of and nothing has worked.
11394,"I have a high sex drive while my meds dampen it, it doesn't really help it."
11395,"I haven't really been able to eat the past couple of days, I have a continuous headache that won't respond to pain medication, I'm shaking as I type this, and I have no freaking clue how to calm down."
11396,"I need more time to get my meds straightened out, but I need to make a living to support myself."
11397,"I actually got pretty bad anxiety, although not as bad as I'm having now around 6 months ago and ended up going on medication for it."
11398,Unfortunately I had really bad side effects from the medication and ended up having to go to hospital.
11399,I'll never go on meds again after that.
11400,My mom was always very helpful and had me see professionals and take medication along with sending me to art therapy and such.
11401,"In the new year, my insurance reset, and I have to get my doctor to re-approve of all my medications with the insurance company."
11402,I am going to have to probably wait until Thursday to get any meds.
11403,I didn't realize I would have to get my medications re-approved; also I forgot having gone through almost this exact same process a year ago.
11404,"**tl;dr Ran out of meds, was not on top of things, my doctor seems too nonchalant about getting things done and it is making me feel helpless and anxious."
11405,"ETA: 20f, not on any drugs/meds of interest."
11406,"Should I or should I not go on any medication, and what about side effects?"
11407,I have been on anti anxiety and anti depressant medications for close to a year now and I feel like medications aren't bettering me but are just masking the symptoms.
11408,I'm highly considering getting off my medications and trying these natural supplements.
11409,I have never been on any medications before (other than birth control and allergy stuff) so I'm a bit nervous.
11410,"I used to take anxiety medications, and smoke to soothe the stress, however I'm 6 months pregnant so I am obviously off those options."
11411,It's not my meds.
11412,I want to go to the doctors and get medication or something but I don't have a drug plan and I can't afford it.
11413,And to top it all off my cat has non-communicable hepatitis that was diagnosed over christmas with a 50/50 survival rate so I sent her to live with my parents because I can't afford her medicine and I really miss her company.
11414,Ive been to a doctor before about anxiety earlier on in life but all they want to do is fill me up with medications and I am most definitely not doing that.
11415,I take medication for depression and anxiety but it doesn't keep me from being a fucking moron.
11416,"I am afraid I will never be able to eat and have to be hospitalized"")
-Horror stories about medications (""It made me go crazy and I have never felt the same), etc."
11417,"I'm on treatment for my disorders and take medication every day, but as they say, there is no ""magic pill."""
11418,Has anyone had any lucky getting off their meds and actually living without it and not having to go back on it??
11419,I've been diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder and I am on medication to handle the chemical imbalance.
11420,"i could ask my doctor to give me medications, but i am not sure if i wanna live a life that is only bearable under the influence of drugs."
11421,"My parents are divorced and I guess most people have a parent their more comfortable with, and another parent they want to impress) that I am depressed because of my social anxiety, and it's getting worse and that I might need medication, but I don't know how."
11422,I thought medication would make me weird.
11423,"After looking through /r/anxiety and /r/depression, I realized I shouldn't feel bad about being on meds or have them affect me THAT much, plus at this point, I REALLY need them."
11424,"I thought I really had it under control without the need for meds, but now I know it can creep back easily."
11425,I've been taking various medications for my anxiety for several years now.
11426,"Before that, the medication that lasted for more than a month or 2 was Prozac and I took that for years, but felt I needed to try something different because it felt like it was no longer helping me."
11427,"Anyway, I don't want to take medication anymore."
11428,Lately I've been questioning whether or not the medication is keeping me from being all the way ME.
11429,"I know the medication helps my anxiety, I remember what it was like being without it."
11430,"I just don't know what to do....
Are natural options any better than medication?"
11431,I'm on medicine to help(specifically Effexor XR).
11432,"I've been on medication since February - Lexapro for two months, until I decided that it was doing more harm than good and switched to Prozac with the recommendation of a doctor."
11433,Should I give up all hope of this medication working?
11434,Needless to say she booked me an appointment with our doctor and I'll ask for some medication to help my anxiety attacks.
11435,"I know that every person is different in their situations, but I was just wondering how you guys went through the personal process of determining that medication was something that might help you, as it is something I might one day consider myself."
11436,Wasn't sure if I could tag this as [meds] but anyway...
11437,I really want to avoid medications as much as possible because I hated how all of them made me feel.
11438,"I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, was on meds, but I don't believe that to be the problem anymore."
11439,"Parents didn't want me to take meds and I burdened anyone by just talking to them about it (I know because I was told), and that only made it worse."
11440,"My meds are out, my emergency meds are out, and I can't go for my cool down walk because its late right now."
11441,"Its been about two weeks now and since being put on medication 4 days ago, my breathing is better (no more shortness of breath) and limited panic attacks."
11442,I'm afraid of medication.
11443,we have a date this weekend so I have no idea) was on medicine for anxiety/depression and stopped taking it.
11444,"I started medication and therapy, found a new job, lost a significant amount of weight, and started exercising regularly and have pretty much rid myself of the crippling anxiety attacks and days spent in bed dreading having to deal with the world."
11445,"She has been refusing to seek therapy or medication since it didn't do much for her in the past, but I don't really know how she can if she's so dead-set on not seeking help."
11446,"My question is what, if anything, can I do to help her rediscover her sex drive and realize that she's not a loser for seeking help or taking medication?"
11447,I was given medication (zoloft) and a recommendation to a psychiatrist.
11448,I stopped seeing a psychiatrist and soon stopped taking my medication in a effort to forget about what I went through and dismissed it as a hiccup of sorts.
11449,Regardless of my self medication this is when my GAD started to effect my social life.
11450,After a string of massive panic attacks I decided I should go to the doctors and see about getting back on the medication that I had abandoned 5 years ago.
11451,I know the medication will not solve my problems but I know they will help me to have the strength to make the changes I need to make to get to a better place.
11452,"However, I do not take any medication for said anxiety or potential depression.)"
11453,"I've tried therapy, I'm not confident that any doctor would consider me for medication, but it physically hurts."
11454,"Therapy, medications, alternative therapies.."
11455,And she just keeps getting worse despite help from medication and therapy twice a week.
11456,"Her panic attacks and night terrors are so severe that she barely eats and sleeps, but still gains weight from the medication which makes her more anxious."
11457,I don't know if it's her meds or just the stress of our situation.
11458,I've tried medication and it always makes me zombie-like and numb.
11459,I'm wondering if there's anything other than medication that has worked for you guys to keep your anxiety at bay.
11460,This is my second round with this medication.
11461,"I felt great, until suddenly I had panic again, and restarted the medicine."
11462,"Notes: 

-I have been on Paxil

-I'm 20 Years old, female

-I'm very sensitive to medication and very small framed


**tl;dr: Prozac works great until it makes me feel like I have the flu."
11463,I've been coping without meds for a few months now (I used to take Xanax but I stopped because it's side effects were so bad) but it's getting harder to go about my life without some sort of medicine to help out.
11464,meds don't work unless it is a benzo and they make me a zombie/unaware/toaware.
11465,I was prescribed a couple of medications that I haven't taken before and I'm terrified of the side effects.
11466,"I feel wary about the medication because of this--it just feels like he made *such* a hasty diagnosis about something I am pretty sure I don't have, so I guess a part of me feels like he could be wrong about prescribing me Pristiq too?"
11467,"Part of me wants to try the medication, but I guess I'm just really scared and I don't know if this psychiatrist is way off base or something."
11468,"(I'm posting in this subreddit specifically because, while the medication was for depression, I feel like my anxiety has been getting the better of me since the appointment."
11469,Another worry I have is that I've tried so many medications through my primary care Dr over the years.
11470,"The medication was called klonopin, and I started this one about 2 months ago."
11471,"Once I moved out (home life was terrible, causing all kinds of anxiety) and was on the meds for about two months, I felt I was cured."
11472,My meds didn't stop it right away and I panicked even more.
11473,"I had refills on my meds and everything, though once I told her about the episode I had with my father, she switched my meds to 3 months of Zoloft and reduced the klonopin from 2mg per day for 5 months to .5mg for 2wks."
11474,"Now I understand that kind of medication isn't for long term use, can cause dependence, etc.. but it hadn't even been a full 2 months yet AND she had written me 5 refills because I was doing so great."
11475,"I should also add that I have been diagnosed with GAD, I am on medication, and I am seeing a counsellor and working on CBT."
11476,"When I am home alone I sit on the couch in the living room with the gun in my lap and my phone in one hand, watching TV with the volume almost on silent so that I can hear any noises in my house)

I was on anti-anxiety medication for about 8 months once, but I've been of of it for about 2 years now."
11477,The dreams were scaring me more than my real life fears so I told my doctor I didn't think I needed the meds anymore.
11478,Lately I'm wondering if I should maybe try to go back on a different type of medication.
11479,I've taken medicine.
11480,"After a little while I made myself go see a team psychologist and she starstarted offering medicine to which I replied no thanks, thinking that if I got into this mess without drugs I can get out."
11481,There's just something very energetically uncomfortable about Lexapro that I cant wrap my head around- or is it all anti-anxiety meds?
11482,"The ER doctors, and head of medicine and pharmacology friend I have said its nearly impossible for that to happen."
11483,"I've also tried medicine - I was prescribed paroxetine by my GP in March of 2011 (when the panic attacks first started getting so bad that I finally went ahead and sought professional help, even though doctors also fuel my anxiety), and it helped, but I'm weary of anti-depressants because I don't know how they will end up affecting me in the future, as I know I am still young and that my brain is still developing."
11484,"Before I go on, I should note that I live in Japan, and the medicine and psychological help is different from the US."
11485,"The past three weeks, I have been taking it more frequently, and for the first time in the eight months since I have started medication, on more than three consecutive days."
11486,"I am quite afraid of developing a dependence or tolerance to it, and I was hoping for you guys to share your experiences with the drug, and explain to me that either: 
A) I'm being ridiculous, and have nothing to worry about in the short term,
B) An alternative medicine to switch to

Absolutely any help is much appreciated, and I wish you all well on your defeating irrational anxiety."
11487,does medication help?
11488,I was free from [thanatophobia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_anxiety_%28psychology%29) for several years right up to the point at which a medication incompatibility set me on a panic attack which lasted several days.
11489,I'm going to talk to my psychiatrist about it when I see him next because I don't like how this medicine at this dose is making me feel but that's a few days off.
11490,TLDR; don't know if my anxiety is enough to need therapy/medicine.
11491,"One of my sisters, my mother, my godmother have all suffered from depressions and are on anti-depressant medication."
11492,The best he could suggest was perhaps a change in medication and carrying on with CBT.
11493,This was obviously a stupid decision because even if I wanted to try to go of my meds I should have phased them out as recommended by my Doctor but I felt particularity gung-ho.
11494,My anxiety got the best of me and I went through the torture of trial and error with medication and therapy.
11495,I've tried so many different kinds of meds and have seen probably 6 different therapists.
11496,"I don't want to look medication seeking, and I don't want to not be taken seriously."

11498,i would love to get a medication that can help with this but i've never been to a doctor for it.

11502,Had therapy for awhile and meds until I chose to go off of them in high school.
11503,"Last summer, when the general anxiety started creeping back into my life, my family doctor offered to start me on regular meds again, which I (stupidly) declined."
11504,"I've learned to deal with this on my own and that isnt my issue (for those of you wondering why I'm not on medication, hilarious story, taking pills is a trigger for my anxiety as well, FML.)"
11505,I feel the medication is slipping again and losing its effectiveness.
11506,We have talked aboult  to a different medication and adding on to the prozac before hand since we had the feeling the prozac would poop out.. (since the same thing happened to my mother).
11507,C) add another medication to the prozac.
11508,I have anxiety and depression that I take medication for.

11512,I really don't want to be put on medication for it because I have heard nothing but bad long term effects.
11513,tl;dr: What can I do to try and open up to my psychologist tomorrow about my bad anxiety and find a cure without going on medication that I know will have bad long term effects?
11514,Only on light dose anxiety medication (Xanax) and a bit of Ambien to sleep.
11515,Tried a lot of other medications and did not react to them well.
11516,Started with a bad reaction to some migraine medication and i had a panic attack and eventually went through some really bad depersonalization.
11517,i have been on meds since the beginning and they help mostly.
11518,"I know I'm not schizophrenic by any means but every thing he mentioned in his final rant of Facebook such as medicine he's been on, fidgeting legs and other issues just makes me think that when I become older it's something that could just randomly pop up in my life and become schizophrenic?"
11519,"I finished up on my anti anxiety medication a few months ago  
I celebrated within  
I thought I was finally free  
But no
Here comes the ""withdrawal syndrome""  
A vast array of frightening symptoms  
I search the internet  
So many other people experiencing the same  
Their doctors totally disregarding the fact that withdrawal syndrome is a real thing and that it doesn't just last ""a few weeks"" - it can go on for months and years  
So not even our GPs are really on our side!"
11520,I lost my insurance right now so I am not going to therapy &amp; am off my meds.
11521,"I'm also taking fish oil (just a quick warning for anyone reading this, fish oil is a blood thinner, so talk to your doc if you think this might interfere with any meds you're taking), vitamin D, and vitamin B, all of which (supposedly) help with mood."
11522,How long did it take you all to really feel the effects of your medication?
11523,Should I ask her to switch me to a different anti-anxiety medication?

11535,What do the various types of anti-anxiety meds do to you?
11536,I've been off medication for about two months now after being on and off for six months.
11537,"Now, I'm only 23, so I don't need to take medicine to give me an erection but my stress and anxiety wasn't allowing me to keep a hard on and he was so keen on me fucking him."
11538,Every day I'm sick with anxiety just for a paycheck and no therapist or medication has been able to help me to stop feeling that way.
11539,For the next four years I was on and off of various anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications and I also did weekly therapy.
11540,"I stopped medications and therapy for a short while and started again when I was 18, because my parents divorced and I was heading to college."
11541,"I was placed in intensive therapy (12+ hours a week) and my medication was changed, but it didn't help much."

11556,"I tell her my current meds and she says ""That is way too many benzos."""

11560,She was shocked and immediately prescribed me Zoloft and the High BP medicine I wasn't taking due to finances.
11561,Then she got to my anxiety I told her about my attacks and medicines.
11562,Over the next few days my meds were tinkered with mostly the Zoloft was increased and I asked the social worker what I should do about not working.
11563,I'm sick of feeling this way and my medication doesn't feel like it's helping at all.
11564,she's going for therapy shortly and has some meds prescribed.

11572,"I already am getting treatment for anxiety amongst a few other things, however, he's a new doctor (not new to treating, more like I just moved) and we are in the middle of figuring out if I'm on the right meds for the treatments."
11573,At the moment I take ZERO meds for anxiety and depression after taking them non-stop for a full year and a half.

11589,They have ADHD and take different meds so it's a stretch.
11590,"I've been on prozac for 4 months and at 60mg for about a month, so it's possible that the medication has ratcheted down my fight/flight response enough to where I am actually feeling some other emotions that are maybe related to why I'm in fight or flight mode so much... has anything like this ever happened to anyone?"
11591,Not on any medications.
11592,I heard somewhere that Prozac can lose effectiveness over very long periods of time and some people have to change meds to continue to see progress.

11595,"My brother has depression and used to take meds for it, but not is fine without them but says that they helped at the time."
11596,I was wondering if meds are the right choice for me?
11597,This detracts me from medication as I have also heard it is almost always a placebo anyway.
11598,But I can't help but think that meds would help me deal with work and school for my last quarter (usually get very anxious sitting in class).
11599,I would have an apointment scheduled once every about two weeks and they would keep tweeking my meds to try to get them to work right but they could only do that when I would go.

11605,I've been so proud of myself lately since stopping therapy and coming off my meds (Lexapro).
11606,"I've tried medicine, but whenever I take it it makes me feel disconnected, almost stoned if you will, and it just makes me freak out more."
11607,PS - I'm not on mood medication and have no desire to take it.

11613,"I know there are other options besides citalopram, but I'd just really prefer to try and do it myself, I really don't want my decision making or sex drive or anything to be affected by medication."

11626,"Both the therapy, which I'm still following, and the medication eased it a little so I could ""live"" again."
11627,"I have to ask, is shaking something that requires meds to deal with?"

11630,"When I'm sick, I sometimes I have to take whatever medication is needed to relieve symptoms, but also my Lorazepam so that my anxiety won't make me sicker."
11631,"I recently upped my dose, as per directed from my psychiatrist, and though I feel like I was experiencing anxiety and the symptoms BEFORE my dose was increase...I'm a little paranoid it's my meds."
11632,But...how do I know if it's the meds or situational?
11633,I was wondering if anyone else had experienced similar side effects while on this medication and what was done to resolve it.
11634,I'm not on any anxiety meds btw.
11635,"So after years without feeling any abnormal anxiety without medication, i experienced some of the horrors again."

11643,"Now, my psychiatrist recommended 10mg when I told her that I was ""reacting well "" to the medication."
11644,I feel like I am at the same point I started at before I took any meds.

11650,I start thinking about how I'm not worthy of actual medication and there's nothing really wrong with me and a doctor would laugh at me and then I start crying and I'm starting to actually tear up just typing this so I'm going to end my post here.
11651,"Basically thinking about getting help/seeking medication for my severe anxiety is giving me even worse anxiety and I physically cannot bring myself to step inside a doctor's office or even make a phone call, I end up paralysed and staring at the phone and shaking and convincing myself that it's a bad idea and then it triggers a huge panic attack."
11652,Maybe someone else can share their story of how they got themselves help and how they went about getting medication?
11653,ive had panic attack probs since 2007. was good for a while without meds.

11655,I've tried over thirty medications and my doctor has told me that there is nothing left to try medicinally to help take the edge off.
11656,"I've had anxiety for a while, was seeing a therapist in college who suggested meds but couldn't actually prescribe them, so I was never on them."
11657,"I think the Dr thought I was just trying to get medication off of her, because her recommendation was to an addiction clinic."
11658,"I end up shaking, feeling terror and nausea, I am sitting here right now unable to take my medication because my throat feels tight and I feel sick thinking of death."
11659,Only reason I got the job was because of the medication.
11660,"I don't want to rely on the medication for the duration of this job though, but I know I'm going to be in stressful situations on a daily basis now."
11661,"I'm not really sure what to do now, I can't take this medication everyday or I'll get incredibly addicted."
11662,I've been using this medication for two weeks now prescribed by my doctor to help treat my anxiety and depression stemming from it.
11663,I've been on this medication before a year and a half ago to treat anxieties I was having about finding a job and my home situation and don't remember having any negative effects like this.
11664,I want to know if anyone has found this medication to help them overcome their anxieties and depression.
11665,"I'm also bipolar, and other things, and I'm on meds for it."
11666,"The medication I take for anxiety is also for sleep, but I'm on such a high dose that I think I built a tolerance for it, which is why it doesn't help my anxiety anymore."
11667,"After some medication, patience, and the knowledge that these feelings were a product of my own doing, things got better."
11668,The medication gave me the ability to place myself in uncomfortable situations.
11669,After a year I was even able to stop taking the medication all together.
11670,"Medication - There are a host of medications available for generalized anxiety disorder, ranging from SSRI medications (also used to treat depression, which like anxiety, is a disorder of the executive function of the brain) to drugs like Valium, which depresses the central nervous system."
11671,"My grades are up, I have a boyfriend, I find things just overall less stressful (meds helped a LOT), but I still find it hard to make and maintain friendships."
11672,"I refuse to take medication because normally my OCD is under control through the use of exercise, diet, and meditation."
11673,What happens if I don't have my medication?
11674,"Having never had problems with anxiety before (besides minor nerves), I would like to avoid meds if possible."
11675,"I've played brain juice roulette with a total of 3 different medications and 1 supplement, and the 3rd medication is doing reasonably well."
11676,"I got on that 3rd medication, but a few weeks later, I turned 26 &amp; lost my insurance."
11677,"However, my medication just ran out today but the doctor who prescribed it apparently won't even talk to me because I'm not on her insurance anymore."
11678,TL;DR---Last couple years have sucked; I lost my insurance a few weeks after I got prescribed a new medication that actually works for me but I can't see a psychiatrist for a month; lots of trouble refilling the prescription and now everything's just more of a huge mess.
11679,Any viewpoints on sleeping meds is also appreciated as I have started to consider it as of late.
11680,"I just saw a new psychologist on one of my ""down"" days, when I was super anxious, depressed, very tearful, and she immediately suggested I try medication."
11681,I feel like if I try medication there's going to be no endpoint.
11682,I don't see what medication would be helping me with.
11683,"Junior year of high school has started and thankfully my medication has been curbing the ""new year"" anxiety."
11684,"Hi All,

I have my first psychiatry consultation in a few weeks, and I want to come prepared with some well-researched medication ideas/combinations/suggestions, so as to discuss the benefits &amp; drawbacks with the doctor."
11685,"I would like to avoid medication again, since the Celexa, although it was effective, made me feel dumber."
11686,I've been feeling like my anxiety is getting out of control again and my T wanted my meds reviewed ASAP by a doctor.
11687,I've been taking extra doses of my anti anxiety meds but if I take too many I won't be able to think because they slow down brain activity.
11688,"Hi all,

I've been prescribed Sertraline for the first time and I'm actually quite nervous about taking it as I've never taken medication before, and all the potential side-effects are fairly off putting."
11689,"Having said that, I do  badly need help (I'm constantly scared to leave the house and feel like everyone is talking/looking at me when I do) and so requested the medication myself."
11690,Is it fine to lift weights whilst taking the medication?
11691,I'm going to see my doctor tuesday about getting on some much needed medication.
11692,i have little to no insurance and i need to be on anti depresents and anxiety medication.
11693,"It helped, but what worked for me was the medication and the effect it had on me."
11694,"By March next year, it will be four years since I began medication and I am hoping to have finished."
11695,"Been mildly depressed for about 10 years now, currently on medication."
11696,"I am currently trying to sort out my anxiety and I feel its growing everyday, I am at the point where I am worried about being worried and I am now wondering do meds really help that much?"
11697,"I saw a doctor and was diagnosed with ""major depression/anxiety"" and was just put on 20mg lexapro and 1mg of klonopin 2x a day (I guess until the lexapro kicks in)

Before being put on medication I would self medicate my depression with cannabis and it was great when I had it but when I was out I became very agitated and I guess what you would call anxious."
11698,I wouldn't have to take meds so I can leave my room or whatever safe place I'm in if I could just snap my fingers and stop worrying.
11699,So I don't know if all this is what's causing my random bouts of anxiety/sadness/overwelmness or if I'm building a resistance to my meds.
11700,"Here's a list of meds I've tried for various mental health issues:

Strattera

Concerta

Prozac

Xanax

Lexapro

Cymbalta

Wellbutrin

Paxil

Ativan

Effexor

Klonopin

Seroquel

Trileptal

Hydroxyzine

Lithium

and I'm currently on Risperdal and Zoloft."
11701,"The only medications I've found to help some with anxiety has been the benzos (but even that did very little) and Seroquel and Risperdal, to an extent."
11702,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and Social Anxiety by a doctor, and am prescribed medication for it."
11703,"Neither my parents nor I wanted to try medication at that point, so we decided to try therapy."
11704,I have a few appointments for Monday and my mom (who takes medicine for her anxiety) says I don't have to go.
11705,My therapist is putting me on anxiety meds.
11706,Was given anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds.
11707,"So what I'm wondering is those of you who take daily anti-anxiety medication, does it help with overall anxious feelings?"
11708,"I went back to my PCP for a follow-up, and he brought up the topic of medication."
11709,"I have always been very afraid of medication, and especially afraid of any kind of anxiety medication."
11710,"She also recommended that I see a psychiatrist for a second opinion on the medication, and to follow up with the psychiatrist while on the medication."
11711,Did you go on meds?
11712,What meds and what side effects did you experience?
11713,"Therapy, so far, hasn't been particularly productive and I'm very wary of medication."
11714,It was so nice to hang out and he was so comforting and excited to make me food and bring me my meds.
11715,"I took the fluoxetine for 8 weeks, when the doc and the phamacist and dr google all said it would take 6 - 8 weeks to become effective, and it made me feel even more depressed &amp; anxious over those 8 weeks and after that time I only recovered to a level that was about the same as before I started the medication."
11716,"Reddit, what can I expect whilst coming off my meds, ie."
11717,"Which is why I'm asking.. Would it be possible to be prescribed a medication first, before actually going to a therapist?"
11718,I've tried meds but I hate dependence and I'm trying to be straight edge.
11719,"I am having my first full on attack since I went on some new medication, and I don't know who to turn to."
11720,"So far medications have been helpful, and I finally found a good therapist."
11721,i'm 16 and have been on medication (escitalopram) for around 6 months.
11722,"In 11 days I'll be seeing a doctor to look into medication, but that feels like an eternity."
11723,He [20] stopped taking his medication because he's joining the military and he has to work to hold it together so he won't get diagnosed again.
11724,"I'm not prescribed any anxiety medications, but I do occasionally take recreational diazapam."
11725,I view consistent medication as a last resort both because of cost and overall hesitance towards potential dependency.
11726,"I've always figured that as long as I'm not thinking about killing myself, I really don't need anti depressants, and as long as I'm not having panic attacks (I used to) I don't need anti anxiety meds."
11727,Do I sound like I should consider medication?
11728,"I'm shaking I need my meds, not only I am missing those im missing plenty of other shit for the autoimmune problem but this one is the one that I feel I need the most right now."
11729,I was nervous about taking any medication but I knew I needed a change.
11730,"It was working in other ways though, so my psychiatrist wanted to add in another medication to prevent the anxiety (but keep me on wellbutrin)."
11731,"I slowly weaned off both the meds since they seemed to cause my panic disorder, which I hated even more than feeling depressed."
11732,"Had severe depression when i was 14 y old started meds didnt work so i decided to cope with it all by myself, it was hard, i had suicidal thoughts."
11733,"At 18 y old i thought i was just fine to stop taking the pills, one day while i was off the meds i saw my cat being run over by a car decapitated shaking in its own pool of blood."
11734,So i got back on the meds.
11735,SOOO after a few years on meds again and lots of work on myself i decided id become a nurse.
11736,"I was just wondering, when did you start to really notice improvement with your medicine?"
11737,"(i.e., ""I feel 80% better.."") That is, once you found the medicine/dosage that was right for you?"
11738,And is it normal to still have occasional anxiety episodes or bad days when you're on medication as long as you feel better the majority of the time?
11739,I'm terrified of taking new meds.
11740,I'm very sensitive to meds that make you sleepy (I take 1/4 the recommended dose for sleeping pills and they still knock me way out).
11741,"I find the last one quite suspicious as half the information leaflet of that one reads ""no tests conducted and no reliable literature""... probably want to discuss with the doc next week if it's really necessary since I get obsessed with losing track of my meds and the more there are the worse it gets, so I want to only have what's absolutely essential."
11742,I have a really strong opinion agaisnt meds but now i think its the only way... please give me your opinion.
11743,I saw him for about six months and I stopped taking my medicine.
11744,"Quick background: diagnosed w/ GAD, MDD and been on a few different meds over the past 4 or 5 years, Lexapro being the latest and most successful."
11745,"I can't tell if it's the meds leaving my system and causing problems, or if it's a return of my anxiety and depression to pre-medicated levels."
11746,"I had a list of psychosomatic symptoms a mile long before I started meds, and while they aren't returning in similar ways as before, I'm worried that I'm working myself into SSRI discontinuation syndrome-like symptoms."
11747,"TL;DR - stopped meds, shit sucks, help?"
11748,"I'm on meds and see a therapist, but I don't see her all that often because aside from the occasional panic attack, and now my sleep issues, things aren't too bad."
11749,"This has kind of been a bit awkward for me to discuss with anyone except random strangers anonymously over the internet, so I was hoping someone could let me know if they have had the same side effects while taking any meds, and if they went away over time?"
11750,"I know that some of the side effects of these meds, like nausea for example, go away after you've been taking them for a few weeks and your body adjusts to them so I was hoping that this would also apply for my problem."
11751,"I've seen a psych and she's diagnosed me with type two bipolar, and I'm taking minimal amounts of Seroquel (had a bad reaction and waiting on medication advice from her)."
11752,I didn't feel super anxious at first and felt that maybe the medicine was working (I've never been on AD medications and thought they might take effect quickly).
11753,"anyway for the past week or so, i've been getting anxiety attacks like i used to get before taking the meds."
11754,i don't know if this is my anxiety that has always been there underneath the meds or if it's a symptom of trying to quit these meds.
11755,"I also have issues with allergies easily, dust, hayfever, sometimes cats (not always), etc and while I did take anti-hestamine for when I'd have an issue for it, I don't take any medicine regularly at all."
11756,"Given that this is the thought pattern I want to interrupt, can anyone recommend medication they've used to deal with plane travel?"
11757,I've heard some meds are better for short flights and others for long-haul travel.
11758,"Unfortunately she is dealing with a lot of issues, serious depression (she is on meds), a type of OCD, some anxiety issues, she self harms and has suicidal idealization and has tried to kill herself before."
11759,-- I don't have the money for medication at this time) but it's gotten worse in one specific area.
11760,"Now, they've stuffed my nose with nasal packing and given me medication."
11761,I am terrified of being put on meds.
11762,"He first suggested to go see a therapist, but that would cost a hell of a lot of money (which I cannot afford right now), or medication."
11763,I chose the medication and was prescribed a small dose (10mg) of Citalopram.
11764,My medication for anxiety gives me more anxiety.
11765,Im on a few meds.
11766,I want to come off the meds.
11767,"Anyway I stop taking my medication in January this year, and I have been trying to improve doing other things, for example Yoga, meditation, relating to other people, I believe that I am far more stable right now, that my thoughts are more rational most of the time, that I no longer think things as black and white."
11768,"I take meds (celexa, klonopin, and ambien prn)."
11769,"I finally got the strength to send her a long and heartfelt message, thanks to my great therapist and decent medication to give me some clarity."
11770,"After some time in therapy, my therapist suggested I take medication to help with both of these symptoms."
11771,"So I'm nearly 5 months into having my medication now (Trazodone and occasional Diazepam), over that time I've been increased from Trazodone 50mg to 100mg and a few days back reluctantly 150mg."
11772,Anyone else hating taking medication?
11773,"She's not in therapy or on any medication, though she has been in therapy in the past."
11774,"However I have been working out everyday, seeing my therapist, and adjusted my medication."
11775,"NOTE: I have been doing therapy (had to stop due to insurance - trying my best to continue CBT on my own and with books), have taken celexa in the past (but it stopped working for me), and have currently found out I am hypothyroid and working on getting the right dosage of medicines for that."
11776,How long should I stay on it before changing to another medication if the tiredness does not go away?
11777,Tomorrow I go talk to the doctor on staff for a physical evaluation (they like to do a full body treatment) and discuss possible medication to help me through this first phase.
11778,"I struggled with depression and anxiety for over a decade, tried all kinds of medications, and I would get better for a while...until I wasn't."
11779,The doctor provides us anti-anxiety medicine (specifically talking about short-acting drugs like Valium or Klonapin).
11780,"Now our brain has learned a new tool - ""When I feel anxious, I take this medicine, and I'm okay."
11781,"If I didn't take this medicine, though, something bad might have happened!"""
11782,I know I probably need to get diagnosed and get medication or something but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to go to a doctor or a psychologist and even thinking about going makes my heart race and tears start to well up.
11783,Do anxiety medications help with this feeling?
11784,"I've never taken medication to regulate my anxiety, and when I was originally diagnosed, my anxiety hadn't seemed like it was severe enough for medication."
11785,It was also a bit of a wake-up call that I might need to talk to my doctor about finding an anti-anxiety medication that works for me.
11786,Is this a side effect that will lessen - everything I've read seems to suggest it will stay around as long as I'm on the medication.
11787,"Coupled with that my mom is pressuring me to get medication if they suggest it, and i'm not sure what i should do about that specifically."
11788,"She didn't sleep for four days straight, then had a series of panic attacks which caused me to have to take her to the ER to get meds to make her sleep, then the rest of the week was spent taking care of her."
11789,She doesn't remember to take her medications every day.
11790,Ive been trying to get some xanax or any sort of medication to calm me down but they refuse to even get me  simple motrin if i have a migraine so that sort of gives you an idea of how they are.
11791,"It stresses me out even more..


My point though is, can anyone explain to me what is going on or how i can help myself without medicine/doctors incase my parents just dont help me?"
11792,Both my parents want me to get back on it( who are also on anti-anxiety medicine) and they think I don't want to take it because of the stigma.
11793,"I am doing well now on meds and taking positive steps in my life, but four months ago I was having a complete breakdown due to my anxiety and could barely eat or sleep."
11794,"I'm scared that if my anxiety keeps coming back, if my meds don't work anymore and that type of episode occurs again, that maybe someday I would become suicidal."
11795,"I'm thinking I could go into the student health center tomorrow morning and talk with a doctor - maybe get some prescription to deal with episodic anxiety (I already have a list of meds I'm on, and I don't want to add to the daily pills)?"
11796,Does anyone have experience with anti-anxiety medications?
11797,I can never go a week with out having a panic attack and I already take medication for my anxiety/depression.
11798,I'm about to give up on this medication because I have NO idea what's going on with my body.
11799,"I am afraid that I will lose this, and lose my uniqueness if I begin taking anxiety medication."
11800,I would also like to ask if anyone has had problems after taking anxiety medications where you don't worry ENOUGH about things you should worry about?
11801,"So I take daily prescription medication for anxiety, depression, and migraine control."
11802,"But he is against using any medications, of any sort."
11803,I've been on my anxiety meds for 6 years and I completely forgot who that person was without the meds.
11804,I wonder if going off my meds for a month (with my therapist's permission) to show him the real uncontrolled me would convince him that I need the medication... ideas?
11805,"I'm scared of driving, using the computer, drinking coffee, laying down, talking to family, socialising in environments over 1-1, taking medication for a recent head trauma, playing video games, just basically anything that could increase heart rate or cause slight emotional tension."
11806,It made it understandable but never gave us a way to cope or to minimize these thoughts with out medicine.
11807,I am not currently on any medication.
11808,"I'm just feeling torn because I really don't want to medicate myself if I don't need to... And for the most part I'm pretty content with myself and my life, but I'm wondering if this medication will improve my quality of life, especially with winter (SAD season) coming."
11809,It's getting really uncomfortable to live now i mean forget medication and therapy i don't even have someone to talk to someone to pour my heart out too.
11810,"After going off and on meds, struggling with daily nausea, ruminating thoughts, and panic attacks I went to the doctor who found a B12 deficiency."
11811,All the doctors just wanted me to go back to anti-anxiety meds which I had a bad experience with.
11812,"I'm not saying that I won't ever go back on meds, or that everyone with anxiety has leaky gut, but I have noticed a huge difference in my anxiety since altering my diet."
11813,I never thought it would come to this but I may consider taking medication.
11814,so after a really really terrible breakup (fiancé cheated on me) I reacted in way different then most and I for a few months was happy having fun and drinking a lot (denial I guess and freedom.. My fiancé was also manipulative and controlling) and without my doctors recommendation stopped taking my meds pretty quick.
11815,For a while it was fine and I realized I also lost a lot of weight and feel that was a result of going off my meds  and I felt pretty good but for the last 2 months I've been more depressed than ever...
11816,"I am not functioning well, my social anxiety and depression are both skyrocketing  I'm having more panic attacks then ever and I'm even afraid to go back to my doctor..
One of my concerns about possibly going back on the meds I need is the weight gain."
11817,So gaining weight again by going back on meds to get the help I need would be pretty much as bad as feeling this way..
11818,"I have been ill since 2009, and from 2010 I've been constantly taking medications - anti psychotic Olanzapine is the only one of them that hasn't changed in the course of time."
11819,"My regular meds seem to fail, even though I have just been put on SNRI this week, and while on holiday I felt the difference."
11820,Have you got any coping strategies except medications?
11821,Could this be mania or just the medicine still working itself out?
11822,I've seen people wiped clean of all emotions when they start taking meds for this and if that happened to me I'd basically be nothing.
11823,Does anyone know any methods of coping that don't involve meds?
11824,"(And if not, do you know of any meds that people don't usually have the ""emotionless"" problem with?)"
11825,"I have no family history of brain tumors, my vitals are all normal, and the headaches are inconsistent and usually respond to medicine."
11826,I have been on medication and been in lots of therapy over the past 6 years and don't believe there is a silver bullet to getting rid of anxiety.
11827,One of the hardest things is actually having to pick up the medication I take for anxiety (klonipin) from the pharmacy.
11828,"Background:

* F/28
* Off psych meds since June 2010, previously on 150mg Effexor 2005ish-2010."
11829,"When he started the meds he had strong disassociation, he was hearing voices, he went from 1-2 panic attacks a day to a constant stream of panic."
11830,The doctor said that he over-metabolizes medicine and that the dose was way too strong.
11831,Before we started the meds he could at least get out the door.
11832,I'm worried the meds are just making things worse.
11833,"I don't want him to stop taking meds that he NEEDS, but I seriously question whether they are at fault for this break."
11834,I have started seeing a counsellor again after a year of being off medication and seeing my counsellor.
11835,"I don't take any medication (other than weed, which doesn't count I guess) and don't go to a doctor - I have health insurance, but the deductible is so ungodly high because I'm self-employed and thus I can't actually afford it."
11836,"And I'd been off my meds - back on them now - since I'd ran out, so wasn't feeling great."
11837,"Afterwards, she caught up with me and asked how long I'd been off my meds, telling me it was seriously bad to do that (she's a pharmacy student) and made me promise that I'd get them asap (I already had a few hours ago, but they hadn't taken effect yet) and asked if I had anyone to talk to about this."
11838,I am not on any medication for my anxiety/depression.
11839,"I finally broke down the other day and went to a psychiatrist with the intention of going on medication, because I am driving myself and my fiance crazy."
11840,"She told me that I could seek therapy, diet, and exercise ""until the cows come home"" but because I'm biologically broken, I will never be happy without medication."
11841,"People don't understand--I don't hate myself, and there are parts about myself that I love that I know would go away on meds."
11842,"I went to the Doctors today, and this is my first time taking prescribed medicine for anxiety."
11843,I was hoping if anyone could share some of their experiences when they took this medication.
11844,"Edit: if you guys need more info I could always post up more &gt;_&gt;, but as of now I am anxious to take the medications.."
11845,Anyone else have any experience with this medication?
11846,"I've spent time talking with my therapist about keeping a small supply of depression medication with me, as I've traveled to unfamiliar places before and I tend to suffer from sensory overload, but I haven't been on drugs since high school and I'm not sure what would help."
11847,I am freaking out right now because I forgot my anti-anxiety meds at my dorm and I will be away for three-four days.
11848,I try not to take my anxiety meds too often because they make me so tired/unproductive at work.
11849,"Since then it's been a wild ride of medications, therapy, and friend support."
11850,I'm current off medication and not going to therapy ever since I moved to Canada from the US.
11851,"I cant afford therapy, I'm already on meds so that isnt the issue."
11852,I just want to push through but its so hard without medication.
11853,"Hi I'm not sure this belongs here, but I'm not sure where else to ask...please this is an emergency I think I've messed up...bad

So I've just been put on the meds again (Zoloft/Sertraline) and my dosage is 125mg, but I'm not sure if I was supposed to gradually increase first???"
11854,I was still riding high on the medication they gave me.
11855,"And I am on meds, but they make me feel like a zombie a lot of the time."
11856,"I made a lot of medicine switches lately, and I started celexa about two weeks ago."
11857,I'm not taking any meds as I have not had any medical attention.
11858,"Because of the effects on my appetite and motivation, I had to stop taking this kind of medicine."
11859,I realize that everyone responds to medication differently and that there is no one solution.
11860,She recommended that I could talk to my doctor about medication options (specifically anti-depressants) that could help me better manage the overall feelings I constantly have.
11861,"I know meds won't make it ""go away"", but i'm considering medication to help me manage this better because I just don't want to have these feelings this intensely anymore."
11862,"This would be my first time talking with my doctor about the options and potentially taking anything for my anxiety, so I was just wondering what people's experiences on medications, both good and bad, have been?"
11863,I was taken off the blood pressure medicines in May of 2013.
11864,I have been in therapy for over a year and am on medication.
11865,"Every night it's the same thing: I take my meds and wait to pass out, mid paragraph of whatever I'm reading."
11866,"Then I'm up all hours, so I sleep all day, I end up with a wasted day, an anxiety trigger, and a cycle begins, at least until the meds ""work"" swiftly enough some subsequent night."
11867,I'm not taking medication and every medical professional and therapist I've seen have told me this is simply acute anxiety/stress responses that I need to deal with.
11868,Does medication sound right for me?
11869,"Now I'm just  
on some meds to ease the anxiety and panic attacks."
11870,"My doctors (psycho/regular) have  
basically told me (after trying a handful of different medicines) that I'm  
getting all the help they can give, the rest is up to me."
11871,I like it because it doesn't involve any drugs/medications and anybody can do it!
11872,"Overall, I slowly got better after my first attack with the help of meds and some therapy, but it seems like I am experiencing bouts of depersonalization again here and there, and most of the time, it doesn't accompany an anxiety attack."
11873,What medications do you guys find helps?
11874,"A couple months ago I got on anti anxiety meds, started exercising and really focusing on helping myself with my anxiety."
11875,"I've been taking 10mg of Citalopram for the last 4 months - most medication generally hits me pretty hard and it affected me badly straight away, so I stayed on a low dose."
11876,Does anyone have any advice on coping with meds withdrawal?
11877,":/ 
So reddit, can anyone specficially explain what is happening to me, and how exactly can I get over this in some way, shape or form without resorting to medication?"

11883,"I stood between the two as to protect the client who was trying to receive his meds, when the other jumped up without a word and started coming at *me*."

11887,Can medication curb this kind of overpowering concern.
11888,"Since he is only a therapist he doesn't have the ability to prescribe me medication, so I will likely be seeing a psychiatrist or General Practioner/Pediatrician to discuss medication."
11889,**b)**Should I go into the meeting asking specifically for SSRIs or should I simply say I am interested in medication and leave the rest to the doctor?
11890,I was going to therapy and was on meds for over a year and was doing fantastic.
11891,"So now, one month later been off meds and no therapy and was doing okay till the headaches started."
11892,"I refuse to take medication, I just dont like the idea of being on drugs, ive been on one before and it gave me all these side effects and dumbed me down."

11895,Guess I'm going to have to take some meds ugh.
11896,"I've researched this medication a bit, and to be honest, my anxiety medication is now causing me anxiety."
11897,I need to talk to my doctor on Monday but I'm seriously considering getting off the medication and trying to deal with anxiety through therapy or other non-drug methods.
11898,"I take meds that keep my anxiety and depression in check but whenever it comes to jobs, it just loses it effectiveness."

11900,"He's been through 4 psychiatrists over that time, who have prescribed him multiple medications."
11901,"His main complaint is the severe headache and pulling sensation in the temples, that he's convinced are aggravated by the meds."
11902,Any other method (without medication) that has worked for you?
11903,Even the medication I took was just masking my situation temporarily.
11904,I'm at a point in my life where I have some time to stay away from full-time work and I've decided that I want to move on from the Xanax; I feel chained to medicine that I may not need any more.
11905,I guess I am posting this as an opportunity to talk to others who have dealt with similar circumstances: have you been happy with the transition to a life without anti-anxiety medication?
11906,"My problems are not severe enough that I would ever consider medication, but to simply ignore them for the sake of social normality is just silly."
11907,"Before I had my medication my panic attacks were horrible, and I'd often scare myself into having them by thinking I had cancer, or a brain tumor, or somthing like that, and I'd feel numbness I'm my mouth first, and then arms and legs, and I'd have trouble breathing and my heart would be pounding and I'd feel like I was detached from reality, but most of those symtoms have stopped happening since I got my medication (100 MG zoloft and .5 MG xanax)."
11908,Tl;dr : panic attacks have lost most of their symptoms since upping medication.

11912,"I no longer have the physical symptoms of anxiety, and when I do enter stressful situations, the meds make the situation easier to handle."
11913,"A few years ago shortly after this started I stayed 3 days at an inpatient program and I had a terrible experiene (I had about 2 minutes with an actual psychiatrist and I was taken cold turkey off of my meds) so even tho I would be potentially going to a much, much better facility I'm still reticent to do so."
11914,I've tried other medications since my breakdowns.
11915,"I'm scared, but at the same time i'm not functioning very well right now without any meds and i'm a bit desperate."
11916,"Effexor seems to have a smaller weight gain side effect but more worryingly i hear that it is impossible to withdraw from, which worries me given that i have had bad luck with meds in the past."
11917,"Looking to hear about positive experiences (or negative ones) on risperidone, effexor, abilify, wellbutrin, buspar, prozac, or other medications to treat anxiety, especially anxiety related to inability to make choices and sound-irritability."
11918,"People tend to label you as awkward more when you don't make eye-contact, lose your balance frequently slur your speech occasionally, have a flatter-affect, and don't smile - even though I'm really empathetic, and without medication, come off as friendly and confident!"
11919,"I just want to tell random people, I'm on heavy pain-meds that make it so I can write and use my hands without acute pain (which is true, and why my physical health is decent but not excellent, but it isn't the real cause)

Without it, I feel a burning sensation in my head and feel a dull anger that eventually grows to the point where I can't function."
11920,"Many of these people should not have licenses to practice, and any adjustment to my medication, besides trazodone and ADHD, has been a failure."
11921,"Most of these people, both therapist and psychiatrist, do not know what they are doing, do not realize how incompentent they are, and are effectively trying random things till something sticks, which is what happened to get the medication I am on."
11922,"The next day he called and scheduled an appointment with his family doctor to see if he could get a prescription for anxiety meds but he couldn't get in for a few weeks -- those weeks were painful for both of us because every day he woke up scared of having another panic attack, which would in turn cause him to have another (thankfully less severe than the first) panic attack."
11923,"He's not against the anxiety meds, but he's very against anti-depression medication - he thinks it creates too much of a life-long dependency and also read that SSRIs and anxiety medication mixed can make things worse."
11924,I was just wondering what it would feel like when the medication kicks in so I know if it's working or not.
11925,And I can control that with medication and some minor therapy (usually just talking with others about it).
11926,I've already set up a Dr. appointment to discuss anti-anxiety medications (which I haven't tried yet).
11927,Meditation became my medication.
11928,Hi so i've been off and on medication and seeing therapists for anxiety/ocd for years now.

11930,"I'm not looking for a doctor to tell me what medication to take, I just want some first hand experience advice on what has worked for them."
11931,I'm tired of having meltdown from switching meds.
11932,"Well, folks, I'll be really frank (the first of many penis jokes in this thread): sometimes, because of our anxiety disorder and/or our medication, our plumbing might not work like we'd like it to."
11933,"Many anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications cause erectile dysfunction- I take buspirone, and I have intermittent erectile dysfunction with my current partner."
11934,You HAVE to be aroused to get one with Cialis or Viagra or any other ED medication.
11935,"Taking the ED medication is only a partial solution, and it might give you the little bit of confidence you need to relax, or give you the physiological support required to stay erect."
11936,"I know that different meds work differently for everyone, but I just wanna hear some success stories, as well as non success stories from people who have been taking it for over a month."
11937,"Hello again, I thought I'd drop in a progress update on my no medication therapy for Post traumatic stress disorder, Social anxiety disorder, and general anxiety disorder."
11938,"After that episode I went to the doctor, and he put me on anti-depressants (daily, naturally) and anti-anxiety meds (when needed)."
11939,I'm going to go to my doctor tomorrow and see if I need a change of meds (the current doses aren't helping).
11940,"I don't remember what I said in particular that would stick out that session causing her to decide I needed any meds for my anxiety, however I describe it as: a net that is suffocating my chest, holding some form of pressure making my heart beat fast and breath come quicker, and thoughts that don't end with every possible question linked to it."
11941,I was put on medication when I was 10.
11942,The day I first tried anxiety medication to get through exams at uni changed my life.
11943,Anxiety medicine changed to an antidepressant version which I still take every day.
11944,Thanks to the medicine I finally see myself and the disease as separate.
11945,It’s hard to accept that my brain isn’t wired right and that I will most likely have to take medicine for the rest of my life so that I can continue to feel normal.
11946,It’s hard to know that my monster and dog still get woken up and push their way past the medicine.
11947,"Anyway, back to the title: I don't have and cannot afford insurance to get more therapy and medication that I desperately need."
11948,I'm taking 10 mg and I'm just wondering before I actually take the medication if Paxil is a strong drug.
11949,"I'm currently on no meds, as I've had several therapists and doctors inform me there's nothing to help my particular mix of issues (anxiety pills would make me too suicidal, depression pills would make me too anxious, etc.)."
11950,"So I had a panic attack Wednesday, which is rare for me since I'm usually pretty stable on my medication."
11951,"I don't know if it's me just scared that more time is passing, if it's my medication making things wonky, or what."
11952,I've been diagnosed with moderate depression couple of years ago but refused to take medication and stopped seeing the shrink because of the costs.

11956,"I don't know, it's hard to explain :s)

Edit: I'm a 22 year old Male in my 5th year of University for Engineering and am on no meds, although I have minor asthma"
11957,My mom is worried because of the side - effects of meds like xanax.
11958,My concerns are whether its bad to use Xanax to help me sleep and if I should never have alcohol again while I'm on these meds (usually 1 wine cooler is all I do).
11959,I was (mis)diagnosed with ADD at only 8 years old and pumped full of experiemental medications until my senior year in High School.
11960,"I have been trying to avoid medication but two GPs, a psychiatrist and my regular psychologist counsellor have all recommended it, so I've accepted my GP's script for Escitalopram (Lexapro) and had it filled out but I can't bring myself to start taking it."
11961,"She got on medication (something related to Lexapro), started exercising, etc."
11962,"Recently though, she has been wanting to get off of the medication due to birth defect warnings (we may want a kid soon) and her general attitude which makes her want to be able to handle this on her own."
11963,She also has picked up a new source of anxiety based on the fact that she may never be able to get off of her medication without losing control of her life.
11964,Are people with this chronic anxiety ever able to get off of medication?
11965,Has anyone completely stopped taking meds for their anxiety and feel good about it?
11966,I am taking meds for my own case of anxiety and depression which is no where near the intensity she feels.
11967,My opinion is that I wish I had never started taking it as i would't have to deal with the 'lightnings' I feel when I am without the meds and other reasons.
11968,"tl;dr wife tried to get off anxiety meds, relapsed badly 

On a side note, I read this subreddit a lot and it really helps me gain perspective for both my anxiety and my wife's."
11969,Any natural medicine I can take to feel more relaxed?
11970,I was suggested to go to a psych for an evaluation but I'm scared of taking more meds on top of my ADD medicine.
11971,"I took medicine, went to a therapist, et cetera."
11972,I really don't want to go on meds again and risk it getting worse.
11973,Then I found a study that told me that herpes medication could slow down HIV.
11974,I forgot to take my meds this morning and realized once I got to school.
11975,I am just sick of being dependent on this medication and being on something that makes me have withdrawal symptoms when I'm not taking it.
11976,"I just feel zoned out, tired and not myself on this medication."
11977,And they wont let me get meds because they think I'm going to abuse them or something.
11978,"I've never had that issue with other  anti-anxiety medications, just valium."
11979,"I've tried different medications, but they made me feel worse."
11980,And I am currently taking no meds.
11981,"I have been working with my doctor to try and find the right meds to be taking, which has been very frustrating."
11982,"I'm at a loss and don't know if I should take her advice or find another doctor (she's my medicine doctor, not my GP)."
11983,"My whole family is on anti-anxiety medication, so perhaps I should have made the connection a little earlier :P. I am currently on 20mg of Cipralex, which for me helps a lot."
11984,"&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
### Exercise  

Exercise is without a doubt the most important thing (other than medication, probably) for me regarding anxiety."
11985,"This can cause you to not get restful sleep, and is very common with people with anxiety/people who are on anxiety medication."

11987,I've gotten the meds.
11988,I have been on meds before and I made a pact that I wouldn't go back because the first 2 weeks were terrible but I am at a loss of what to do.
11989,What other medications can I talk to my doctor about?
11990,"I can cope logically, but I'm still extremely physically uncomfortable, even on medication."
11991,And all they are going to do is prescribe me medication that I'll refuse to take.
11992,"Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I don't take any medication for sleep, and then Friday and Saturday I usually go out drinking with friends so that helps me go to bed."
11993,"The past couple of weeks, I have had a really hard time getting quality rest, especially on days when I don't drink and don't take medication."
11994,Decided to skip my meds this morning.
11995,"Don't always need them, plus, it was a morning shift -- which requires a LOT of concentration on prep, and doesn't really allow time for my meds to fully kick in anyways, so I figured why bother?"
11996,Feeling like maybe I won't need my meds at all after today.
11997,"Sadly, my medication slows down brain processes."
11998,"My sister Sam has suffered from severe depression and anxiety throughout the past ten years, but took medication and went to therapy to deal with it."

12001,I wouldn't mind taking the meds if I could get this weight gain under control!!!
12002,I was taking ADHD medication a few weeks ago (having taken it from seven years of age to my age of now 21) and I finally stopped since I don't enjoy being on medication constantly.
12003,I also don't enjoy the wave of anxiety that my medication was apparently holding back.
12004,I stopped taking medication and suddenly I was worried about everything and exploding at every single thing.
12005,"I don't want to start a debate about medication, thats not what this is about."
12006,"I hate being on medication, but it is sometimes a necessary evil."
12007,As of yesterday I am now taking medication again for my anxiety.
12008,"I have chronic pain, there's nothing that can be done besides meds, meds, and more meds."
12009,I'm going to see my Pain Management doc on Monday to up and switch my meds to something stronger.
12010,I don't love the idea of anxiety meds but maybe I need to go that route.
12011,"He said he felt in over his head and referred me to a psychiatrist to figure out

- are my symptoms side effects of medication
- or something else, concurrent and undiagnosed

I feel."

12020,"I really just want some help, and idk if medication is the way to go."
12021,From 20-22 I was okay and medication free.
12022,What medication is most appropriate for this?
12023,"My meds the primary care doc prescribed (Lorazepam, 1mg) don't seem to do anything (in fact, it sometimes makes my mind wander and the effects worsen)."
12024,"I've tried deep breathing, meds, massage, lowering stress, but nothing helps."
12025,None of the medication has worked.
12026,"The psychiatrist told me that if it's necessary, medication is an option further down the line but..."
12027,I am on my meds but I am having a resurgence in this anxiety.
12028,Is it something I will grow out of or should I take medication.
12029,Should I tell my doctor to higher my dosage or maybe switch to an other medication?
12030,I heard that adderal is the strongest medication for ADHD so if it doesn't work for me what is gonna work?!?
12031,I heard this can happen with these anxiety medications.
12032,she sent me to a psychologist and we started meds.
12033,I've switched medications twice.
12034,"I'd rather they just give me meds and send me on my way, with as little feelings discussion as possible."
12035,"I've been seeing an awesome therapist, I'm on great meds, and I basically just have a much healthier approach to stress."
12036,I was taking meds for social anxiety but they did not ever really help.
12037,"After stopping I experienced, and still am experiencing symptoms including working memory issues, fatigue/lethargy, lots of tension and anxiety that I never had before meds, and a feeling of being ""spaced out"", foggy thinking and having trouble concentrating."
12038,Is it possible to eventually reach a point where you can live a basically normal life without being on any medication at the end?
12039,"The best I ever see people talk about here are periods of normalcy while on medication, which eventually goes back to how it was before."
12040,"I have just been worrying about it a lot, because as I am now I haven't left the house since 31st December 2013, I'm not on medication, but I am stable."
12041,I am considering medication though I am somewhat skeptic about the benefits it has as they are temporary.
12042,"My mother suffers from Anxiety and is on medication for it but this was from a significant event in her life, my symptoms are just there."
12043,Apparently we're going to talk about the possibility of me starting medication for the first time.
12044,Isn't it weird or a bad thing to start taking medication before I know what's wrong with me?
12045,Does medication often make you gain weight?
12046,What's it like when starting medication?
12047,I'm worried that I'll become a different person when on medication.
12048,"last week his medication was giving him stomach aches,  or so he thought."
12049,so when i get up and it's time for work i can't even get out of bed i'm so dizzy and i begin to hyperventilate so by now i call my doctor who told me to go to the emergency room i might be having a bad reaction to the medication since it is working full blast now.
12050,when i get off the train i stumble my way to the ER and tell the woman i am having a bad reaction to my medication.
12051,he suggested i stay on my meds.
12052,"i am not taking ANY more meds, which i am told is quite hard."
12053,However my medicine/prescription is only $12 for a month supply.
12054,"I waited 25 minutes in the waiting room, and he only asked me 5 questions about the medicine, which took a total of 3 minutes with the doctor."
12055,"**I've been on this same medication for 2+ years, and wanted to tell him I didn't see the point in coming back every 3 or 6 months to talk to him for 5 minutes for a script that works for me, but costs me $300 every visit."
12056,Any advice on finding a new health insurance plan that covers my specific medication?
12057,My dad took me to the doctor and I started medication and therapy.
12058,I started medication again but I feel like it's different this time.
12059,So what are meds you guys are on?
12060,My doctor won't prescribe me a benzo (anti-panic medication) and I can't afford therapy right now.
12061,"So I am an axious person, I get panic attacks and have been medicated for my GAD (am not on medication at the moment) 
My mom is sick and I am flying from the states to canada to help take care of her, my flight leaves tomorrow evening and the longest I will be in air is about 6 hours."
12062,or will he switch me entirely so ill be on just one medication?
12063,I've noticed im sensitive to different meds (mainly SSRI's) so im always worrying what ill have to try next...
12064,I tried different medicines and therapy when I was a kid and they didn't really change anything anyway.
12065,I feel like even if i get medication how could these thought possibly get any less terrifying.
12066,"I feel ready to quit the medication.But I've gained 40 lbs over the last two years 
It works great a little too much ."
12067,My question would be: What is it that the medication did to me that my body wasn't already doing ?
12068,"So now my meds are relatively in order, but everything else is incredibly uncertain and up in the air which just makes my anxiety skyrocket."
12069,"My brother used to be on klonopin, alcohol withdrawal medications, etc because he has a history of anxiety, so it seems like that might be likely."
12070,"So I have a couple questions..

What are some ways you manage the health related anxiety that don't involve medication?"
12071,"If you're taking medications, what ones and do they help reduce the worry/thoughts about your health?"
12072,My doctor has suggested antidepressants but before I go back and talk to her about it more I'd like to know what other people with the same issue have experienced and if the medication really does help to reduce the thoughts of health related anxiety or if it just makes the anxiety itself more bearable.
12073,"Also, How do you guys feel about the medication Citalopram?"
12074,"I've been to the doctor to get diagnosed, been subscribed many, many medications (all had HORRIBLE side effects), and I've seen so many psychologists and even a psychiatrist."
12075,No medication.
12076,Would medication make this go away?
12077,"On top of this, my mother recently started dealing with her own life-long anxiety issues and then suddenly quit her meds and went right back to her old cycle of Tylenol PM at night, and 2 pots of coffee every day."
12078,I've been on various cocktails of psychiatric medications ever since.
12079,I hope I can avoid going on anxiety medicine.
12080,I plan to drink during this vacation and don't want to have a bad time or negative effects because of this medication.
12081,I feel like I'm slowly conquering my anxiety without medication and went to the doctor this past week just to make sure it wasn't my heart and thats when he prescribed me this stuff.
12082,"Any information will help, the doctor and the pharmacy told me two different things and websites list 5-15 symptoms alone so I'm looking for previous experience with this medication."
12083,I still have barely lost any of that contempt for SSRI's and psych meds in general.
12084,"For the past few days, even with medication, both self and prescribed, I have had an increase in mini panic/anxiety attacks in social situations."
12085,"I keep telling them that this is bullshit because none of it works for me, but they want me to jump through a thousand more hoops before I can have any chance of getting a medication that can ACTUALLY help with my anxiety."
12086,I hate to be negative but I fear that the only way I will get any relief from this is by an anti anxiety medication.
12087,Diagnosis and therapy and meds came soon after.
12088,I tried all the meds back in the day (mid-90s) and finally settled on Celexa 20mg and have been on that for the better part of 20 years.
12089,"Despite years of therapy and meds, I never could prevent or control my panic attacks."
12090,"Unmedicated, both of these issues are NOT mild at all and can have severe hypochondria, but meds work wonders for me."
12091,"I've always been a long sleeper since babyhood, I've been on and off different meds for 5 years, and I am 20 exiting the teenage years...so there are so many confounding variables, I don't know if they are related to medications or just other physical issues/poor sleep habits."
12092,Edit: Forgot to write this: he's not on any medications.
12093,"I haven't seen my therapist in over a year, and I have been (unwillingly) off medication for the same amount of time."
12094,He actually asked for more or different medication.
12095,"I am dealing as well as can be expected, I suppose, but after not having any emotions for the 10 years I was on the meds, now all my emotions are back."
12096,"I'm interested in therapy AND medication because the problem has gotten so extreme and is having physical effects (I can feel it in my heart, lungs and feel shaky, and constantly on edge) How should I go about doing so, and in the mean-time what can I do to alleviate the issue?"
12097,"I recently found the Goldilocks of meds/therapy for my anxiety, but I'm 34 and feel like I've missed all the important events in a normal persons life."
12098,"I saw therapists for years and was prescribed way too many anti-anxiety medications, all of which did nothing to help me."
12099,"The only thing is, there are three things that I've linked to my anxiety: alcohol, weed, and even a few medications I tried for anxiety and eventually trashed."
12100,"I've been stubborn about avoiding medications, substances and battling this anxiety with my mind."
12101,"I have a doctor's appointment in a couple of weeks and will definitely bring up my issues then, but I'm not sure if a need a therapist, medicine (which I'm a bit afraid of due to side effects), or a different diet perhaps?"
12102,"After completing it, he said he's going to put me on some medication."
12103,"I am so afraid of taking medication out of fear of the side effects, no matter how rare."
12104,I have read through almost all the threads on anti anxiety meds and libido.
12105,"I'm thinking about meds like Lexapro, celexa, and Zoloft."
12106,"I'm thinking I'll probably need some medication, and I have no real idea what my triggers are other than if you say the word ""money"" around me now after what happened to the apartment I start to feel tingly in the bad sense :( Sometimes they seem to come out of nowhere."
12107,"I've had a 2 week break from it and I'm now getting back on the meds since I'm having a full-blown anxiety relapse (insomnia has been gone during the break though)

A few people I haven't talked to for 10 years suddenly tried to get in touch with me (I ignored them) and this triggered a huge anxiety attack in me that's been escalating over the course of several days."
12108,I've been taking my meds...but they're running out soon and my mom (being the one to drive to the pharmacy) does not intend on picking up a refill because she wants to work on getting me 'normal.'
12109,"It's just so intimidating to me, it looks like once you start you're on meds forever."
12110,"Btw, meds in question are Prozac and Mirtazapine."
12111,"The meds that i took made me sick for a bit, which i was told was normal.. but all of the symptoms went away except drowsiness...   i was sleeping all of the time.. i gave it time, to see if that too would go away.. it never did... i really wish i would have noticed that this was not right... after four weeks... of sleeping about 14 hours a day, along with a nap... just watching tv all of the time.. too lazy to do anything, i finally went back to the doctor.. this was not right.. it was ruining my life even more then dealing with the anxiety in the first place was.. but i didnt want to go back to no life at all.. i finally got back to how i was before my anxiety go the better of me... dating again, being social, i was happy.. not spaced out as much...  

been on the new medication for a while now.. and i actually feel back to normal.. this is the first day that i got up early, had a full day of school, chores, and went back to parents for dinner, came home, still not tired...  up playing video games past ten thirty... it is weird to actually be productive... such a great change... i feel normal again... :)

i believe i have said thank you before..
but again, i may not comment on this sub, but, reading other peoples stories really has helped me the past couple months, getting up the courage to talk to someone, get help, realizing what is wrong and what is right..."
12112,"It's starting to wear me down physically, and I'm starting to distance myself from friends/family, but I am still hesitant about taking medications."
12113,I recently (about 6 days ago) discovered my blood pressure is high and I am now on medication.
12114,"Besides help with the meds (doctors can do that), any suggestions for the restlessness I feel?"
12115,Should I ask my Doctor to put me on Anxiety medicine to help clear my head?
12116,"Last PET scan I had they gave me meds that should've knocked me out, I had a panic attack in the machine and barely made it through."
12117,I'm on 10mg of paxil and I've gained forty pounds since I started taking the meds a year and a half ago.
12118,How have you guys handled managing weight gain on meds?
12119,My question for you fellow members is when was the right time for medication and has the medication been effective for you?
12120,"A few months ago I tried Zoloft for the first time, but went through some terrible side effects with it and it completely deterred me from trying any other medication leaving me to try talk therapy which was great at first but the anxiety just came back."
12121,"I know most medication with anxiety is a trail/error process to see which one best fits you, so I'm just wondering how/why you chose medication and if it's been good."
12122,It’s usually around this stage that I know I have to take my medicine or I will definitely have a panic attack .
12123,I take my meds and I start to feel like the thoughts are still there but they are muted.
12124,"Then when the meds wear off , everything comes crashing down on me ."
12125,Has anyone else experienced anything similar from this kind of medication (hypnotics/sleeping tablets) while suffering from anxiety?
12126,With the help of medication (Paxil for about 4 years and Lamictal for about 6mo.)
12127,"Since I’ve been on this medication, this constant edginess and feeling of being horribly unsafe in the universe has been muted to such a degree that often, it’s not even noticeable."
12128,I am 20 years old and have had social anxiety for about 6 years now with frequent panic attacks kept down to about once a week with daily medication and colonopin/xanax when needed.
12129,"I am scared to get on a bus, scared to be in a room of people, scared to take the medication that makes me better!"
12130,"I don't want to be out on meds or told by the doctor that they can't do anything again, more than anything I don't want to admit that there is anything else wrong with me, I already have a long list of problems with health which add to the anxiety."
12131,* What if they have to run tests and/or give me prescription medication?
12132,"I can't keep asking people to stay here with me, my husband going to a later shift is not an option, and we don't have the money for therapy or medication."
12133,"I take cetirizine daily (allergy medicine, think Zyrtec)."
12134,"I'm on ADHD medication and that helps me with work, but I also had an argument with my boss (over something stupid) where I amped up the aggressive defensiveness that I feel when I start to get really anxious."
12135,"I'm currently not on anxiety medications, became drug resistant and meds put me in a zombie state, not to mention massive weight gain.."
12136,"First of all, I'm new to this sub and I'm not sure whether you encourage or discourage the use of medication."
12137,How expensive are these medications?
12138,"Will I need to write down that I take XYZ every time I go for medical help and they ask what meds you are on, such as the dentists office?"
12139,"I pick at myself for hours then spend stupid amounts of money on makeup, creams, and medicine to cover it up."
12140,FYI: I'm not on any medication at the moment.
12141,"It helped, I'm not sure if it was the medication or just the knowledge that it was all in my head, or both (probably both)."
12142,I took the medication for about 4 years.
12143,"In January of this year, I wanted to quit the medication for personal reasons, so I did, with my doctor's approval and guidance."
12144,"I'm seeing my doctor early next month for my quarterly blood work, I think I'm going to ask him to put me on meds again."
12145,"As much as I'd like to be free of medication, I would like to go to sleep normally and not have to worry about whether or not I'll be dealing with this crap all night."
12146,"No medical tests have provided any conclusions, meds havent worked, CBT, counselling, acupuncture, exposure therapy."
12147,"After months of visiting a therapist with little to no progress, I went to the psychiatrist and was prescribed medication for my anxiety and depression."
12148,"Thanks guys and if any of you have questions about medication, feel free to ask!"
12149,I don't want to either be taking any medications for my anxiety either because I can control it and don't think it's necessary for it.
12150,"I say average because I understand everyone is different with heigh, weight, and the way our bodies metabolize medicine."
12151,I don't take any medications.
12152,I'm hoping that some positive results for other people will help me stay with the meds and not give up.
12153,"I'm looking to get off my prescription medications, there are just always so many side effects and I hate relying on chemicals to ""fix"" me."
12154,"I'm no longer taking any type of medication

After years of battling with anxiety, I'm better."
12155,I've been flat out refused medication for my anxiety.
12156,"Naturally, bipolar medication heightens anxiety (and vice versa; anxiety medication puts you into mania)."
12157,"* after my nervous breakdown i started to visit psychiatrist and i started to use perscripted meds 
* at the same time i resumed to studies (that i considered a step-down from a job), but i couldn't cope with increasing anxiety, so after three months i quit my studies and for 7 months stayed at home doing a heavy medication course with a hope to cure my anxiety (yeah, right) 
* after those 7 months i was ""encouraged"" by some of my relatives to finaly get back to earning money for myself, so i started to look for a job, hoping to find a ""simple and stress-free job - a first step in my recovery to a self sustained citizen"", 
* with the approval of my psychiatrist i took a postman job, 
* the ""first and easiest step"" turned out the most stressfull and intense experience i have had in my life (it was even harder that in my first job, where i ended in ashes), i was so scared of making mistakes and getting punished, that during the two month period, that i worked as a postman, i developed a lot security measurements and procedures (most of them were based on OCD patterns) 
* i left my job as a postman only after two months, because my body started to show buning-out signs again."
12158,"* at the same time, after consulting with my psychiatrist i quit using medication, because it didn't help me to recover, however they made me feel like a ""zombie"" with almost no interest in anything, i was just existing (It wasnt necesarily an awful experience using those drugs, but it definetly wasn't pleasant either)."
12159,"After ending using medication (and seeing the psychiatrist) i got a feeling, that the treatment i got was not so much to help me get better but more, so to say, to make me pleased."
12160,And I need to get back on meds to control them.
12161,"My mother is bipolar, not seeking treatment or medication, and taking out her frustrations on me."
12162,I've been put on a light dose of meds for anxiety but not for ADHD.
12163,"I took the meds, and they sort of calmed down that rising bubbly hysteria feeling, that out-of-control sensation."
12164,"When I told them no to things like wanting a psych just to get meds or wanting to hurt myself, they put words in my mouth and insisted that i was - suicidal or a pill pusher."
12165,"My sister was recently talking about how she takes medicine for anxiety but has never had or felt like she's been close to a panic attack, just feeling very nervous or scared at times, anxious I guess."
12166,"A few years ago I was on medication (Effexor) but as things were going well went through the long and difficult process of weaning off it until I was free of withdrawals, etc.."
12167,I definitely need some help in managing stuff right now but really don't want to find myself back at square one with medication...but as I said I feel really sad and scared right now.
12168,Not entirely sure what I'm looking for here - perhaps someone who has been through something similar - either as a new dad or needing to return to meds after being away.
12169,My sister (29F) has anxiety and depression which she's beginning to address through therapy/meds but needs to start applying for jobs so that she can pay rent etc.
12170,"Burning up, up up in flames

Try to put it out but it starts again

Something’s gotta give, something’s gotta give

Something’s gotta give, something’s gotta give


Someone’s gotta pull me back

Back back from the edge

Clean me up and refill my meds

Something’s gotta give, something’s gotta give

Something’s gotta give, something’s gotta give


Someone’s gotta tell my friends

“He’s so sorry, today’s not good for company”


You know what they say, you know you’re insane

When the voices in your head are starting to make sense

Every day you keep (burning?)"
12171,So I really need to get back on meds.
12172,"I used to take Wellbutrin for GAD, but I don't know what would be the best meds for me now."
12173,"I plan on starting to see a psychologist soon, but need to start medication immediately."
12174,"One thing that I have been told frequently from my doctor and therapist is that the medication I am taking to help cope with the symptoms of my GAD is really only a temporary band-aid, and that if I don't take care of the underlying causes of my anxiety Ill be stuck this way when the medication is over."
12175,"So, I tried going to sleep as well, but before I did, I had take my usual anxiety medication (Prozac)."
12176,I forgot that I recently increased the dosage so the medication ran out faster than usual.
12177,"I didn't take any medications for depression/anxiety, but I've read that there is something called Akathisia and this is due to medications."
12178,"I learned to deal with it without medication, and I can say that I have a almost 'normal' life."
12179,"I don't wanna take any medication again, I hate the way it makes me feel u_u"
12180,I am on medication.
12181,Maybe I'm not taking enough (I'm very conservative with taking pills/medications).
12182,"Is there any sort of over-the-counter medication that I could use to relax myself, or get rid of my anxiety?"
12183,"If it's a prescription based medicine, who should I talk to to see if it's right for me?"
12184,At this point I went to a doctor and after trying a bunch of medication the doctor thought that cymbalta was the best medicine.
12185,I finally went to someone to talk about my anxiety and see if the person thought I needed medication.
12186,"Since I've never taken any medication for my anxiety, I want to know how it will affect my thoughts that triggers my anxiety."
12187,That's why I need advice from people who take that medication.
12188,My anxiety felt slightly worse today and I'm not sure if that's from the medication or maybe that I've been alone most of today
12189,I have also been on various medications for my anxiety although none of them seemed to help.
12190,"I took myself off my last medication when I was 17 years old and have been handling my anxiety very well since then..up until recently it just feels like I'm just starting to unravel again, so I have gone back to therapy."
12191,I've had runs like this before and have gotten through it with relatively little or no medication.
12192,"Zyprexa seems a little extreme at this point, as I have gotten through runs like this without ANY medication at all."
12193,I'm not on any meds or anything so this period of not worrying anymore in between having constantly been picking apart every small symptom and thought in my mind for the past few months feels a little strange...
12194,"I've been a subscriber to r/Anxiety for some time, now, and I can't even count how many posts I've read that say something to the tune of ""I was fine... then, I smoke a bunch of pot and had another panic attack"" or ""Smoking's been giving me panic attacks... but, obviously, I'm not going to stop smoking"" or ""Can I smoke weed while taking [insert name of medication]""."
12195,I don't know what's come over me- I take my meds as usual (200mg Sertraline/Zoloft for 2 years) and make sure to eat/drink regularly.
12196,"Why am I so anxious even though I'm on meds and ""take care"" of myself?"
12197,That's why I want to stop using the medicine.
12198,"-my nickname once was ""stressful my_name"" ...i don't know why, i just become stressed with the little thing, if i go on a date to meet some girl, at the 1st time i can't even take my coffee cause im trembling so much that my coffee almost flies...sometimes im smoking,trembling, and eating my nails at the same time...
-i have capilar acne and some ""alergies"", i mean, i scratch my legs and arms all the time, i use a medicine to stop it but im good for like 2-3days and then the itch returns, dunno im it's my nervous system but no dermatologist could find what i have
-it takes just one simple case...like...me droping some shit, and getting instantly annoyed or angry...

wtf can i do?"
12199,I have been forgetting to take my meds as of late so that's probably exacerbating the problem.
12200,i posted a posted something recently asking about medication and breathing etc but i really think i need someone to talk to.
12201,I have anxiety medicine and am going to therapy and they only help so much.
12202,Should I get anti-anxiety medications?
12203,"Before medication, I had severe mood swings and sudden irrational anxiety that was interfering with my daily life and relationships."
12204,"So, after starting the meds, I pretty quickly felt a difference."
12205,"Since starting my meds, I've had a baby, something I wasn't sure I'd ever be able to handle before."
12206,I totally transposed my medication with another.
12207,"Been seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist for some time, and have also seen and been through a douzen or so different medications."
12208,Is this common for meds to suddenly stop working after a while?
12209,Should I try to get some medication?
12210,"The problem is that I need to be able to drive and not freak out, but I think most meds that calm you down also cause sleepiness and things like that, which might hinder driving."
12211,Are there any meds like this?
12212,Are there any meds that relieve the anxiety but still keep me in a clear state of mind so I'm able to drive?
12213,"So I've been on meds for anxiety for a few months now, after a series of panic attacks last semester."
12214,"So I moved to New Orleans 7 months ago, after having been off meds for about 5 months, (thus making it a year med free.)"
12215,"I've been coping with anxiety for the past couple of months, and I've tried everything, from meds to therapy to meditation, to make it less bad."
12216,And I don't take any meds at all.
12217,"My own mom refuses therapy and medication, and turns to my dad instead, and insists it won't help me."
12218,I'm very afraid that the medications i've been on and gotten off of before have permanently damaged me.
12219,I'm basically going to go with self-help and meds.
12220,"Here's the TLDR

**TL;DR**  My medications have sedated me to a normal functioning person again, and I am beginning to actually learn to emotionally take care of myself."
12221,I'm not on any medication nor have i ever been diagnosed.
12222,"The thing is, after realizing I didn't take my medication, I noticed I haven't had any withdrawal symptoms at all."
12223,I am able to adjust my posture because the medication relaxes my muscles.
12224,"She asked me what has helped before, and I told her I hated to go through the list, but I listed all the coping mechanisms alongside multiple medications (SSRI, SNRI, klonopin, and ativan)."
12225,"I thought it was depression, but I'm on super medicine now and still don't want to bathe."
12226,I got a referral to a psychologist but it's not covered by my provincial health care insurance so I didn't follow through - didn't want to waste my money on seeing someone if they couldn't prescribe meds or waste my time if they didn't know anything about anxiety disorders.
12227,I am usually very anti-meds but I was so desperate to feel better that I took them with pleasure.
12228,All of this can be attributed to my body adjusting to the new meds.
12229,Sometimes on the way home from work I'll get nauseous if i think about taking my meds when i get home.
12230,"Or if i start to think ""oh i should go get my meds to help"" ill get really nauseous."
12231,"and then when i actually go to take my meds i get extremely nauseous, especially when i put the pills in my mouth, and will sometimes even throw up while trying to take my meds."
12232,He recommended that I start taking anxiety medication daily and an SSRI.
12233,"Once I told my friends/loved ones that I had finally been prescribed medication, most of them flipped."
12234,"When I started taking my anxiety medication, when I felt anxious, I was able to calmly tell myself, ""It's no big deal, we'll figure it out, calm down."""
12235,I've been out of my meds for 3 weeks because I'm in the middle of finding a new doctor.
12236,TL;DR (don't blame you): I'm almost 25 and finally started taking anxiety medication 2 months ago.
12237,"Anyways, my point... 

Due to some recent events, I'm wondering if I should seek some sort of medication."
12238,"To be honest, the thought of medication starts to make me anxious."
12239,Are any of you strongly for or against medication?
12240,So I get to continue suffering and having paralyzing panic attacks every day because she's lazy and the time I spent waiting could have been spent getting meds but oops too bad.
12241,There seems to be a lot of negative associations that come with taking medication for anxiety/depression and it got me thinking how much this really impact our society and culture.
12242,I often hear on this sub and others about how adverse people are to resorting to meds and that they see it transforming them into an emotionless zombie.
12243,I also hear the notion that using meds is equivalaent to giving up on improving yourself through hard work and therapy.
12244,"While I obviously can't speak for everyone who has taken medication and the experiences they've had, I think this sort of negative stigma prevents people from actually exploring a path that could potentially help them dramatically."
12245,I think more education needs to given on how medication plays a role in getting better with these mental conditions.
12246,Sometimes medication may be the only way to help tame the beast so that you can have the chance to put in the hard work necessary to make lasting changes in your life.
12247,"Now of course, I don't want to sound like medication should be the first resort to treating any spectrum of anxiety and depression."
12248,I have been working nonstop on becoming more and more functional and recently gone from as needed medication to a less habit forming all day medication and then the previous supplimental medication as needed on top of that.
12249,Has anyone else had eye issues like this or had a new symptom manifest just as you manage to suppress the others through medication?
12250,I talked to a counselor who recommended medication.
12251,Does anyone have recommendations as to meds?
12252,I'm a university student and I feel as though the medication impacts my learning/test performance.
12253,"A few medications kept me going through school, until midway through my senior year I thought to myself 'I can't do this anymore'."
12254,"My anxiety is a bit better, panic attacks are few and far between, and I'm not on any steady medication (I do have a prescription of xanax that's for as-needed use only)."
12255,"Whether it be medication, therapy, or whatever."
12256,"I don't know what types of medication there are, how they can or can't help me, but I'm more than willing to try."
12257,"I am on medication for Bipolar Disorder [type 1, rapid-cycling], I was diagnosed a couple of years ago."
12258,"I just started a new medication a couple of weeks ago, so far things are going fine with that."
12259,"Also, it makes me feel like it doesn't matter what medication I take or how much meditation I do, if my brain decides it's going to throw a wobbler then that is it."
12260,"As it is now, I have been weighing the options to take meds for my ""disorders""."
12261,I get them out of nowhere but they're also triggered by certain things (specifically being out in the country away from emergency help and new foods/medications that may cause anaphylaxis) and I also have generalized anxiety disorder.
12262,"I'm not currently on any meds, and am an 18 yr old female, if that helps any."
12263,And which medication will be useful in treating these symptoms?
12264,"Well she is over 50 and doing totally fine, despite high blood pressure, which she gets medicine for."
12265,"I feel sick all day, my stomach is killing me, I'm itchy all over, I'm having trouble falling asleep 9with and without meds),having bad sleep, and having hard time waking up."
12266,"Now I'm meds free, and I don't have anything to treat my GAD."
12267,I do have a question though: what are things I can do to help my anxiety other than seeing a therapist and medication?
12268,"As a result, I now have to change the medication that I was FINALLY getting used to (after 3 months) because of tachycardia."
12269,"I feel like the anxiety is out of my control, even when it's tempered by my meds, and the only reason *I'm* not out of control is because I don't have anything to obsess about at the moment."
12270,after years of being without medication I'm coming to realize that my anger issues are causing alot of issues in my love life.
12271,But I have a fear that the meds have stopped working for some reason.
12272,"I figure that isn't the case, but I'd love it if someone could chime in and either:

A) reassure me

or 

B) Explain why my meds would stop working overnight"
12273,I am on no medication.
12274,"I'm on medication (celexa daily &amp; klonopin when needed), and the combination of the meds and therapy has me feeling great."
12275,"After many months of therapy and medication and searching desperately for the quick fix, I came across this site last week (http://anxietynomore.co.uk/), created by a man named Paul David, and read his book called At Last a Life."
12276,We're still working to see what meds will be best for me.
12277,I've always been one to have detailed and strange dreams but since being on my meds they have increased in number (I feel like I remember all my dreams from the entire night when I wake up the next morning) and they are so freaking strange.
12278,I'm not sure if I need to re-evaluate my medication with my doctor.
12279,I know everyone responds differently to medication.
12280,But I'm wondering if anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medication is supposed to be a very obvious/significant help or if it's just supposed to keep you functioning at a basic level.
12281,"I worked with mental health providers for years, and they provided me with a set of medications that for the most part helped - prozac, seroquel, and klonopin."
12282,"After a bout with having no medication left (no insurance, no money to get prescriptions), and going through a pretty awful withdrawal, I decided I wanted to wean off the meds with the help of a doctor."
12283,"This used to happen a year and a half ago, before I went on my meds."
12284,"I've been on meds since last summer, I did CBT, meditation, doctor visits etc - but I just felt like posting to say I was able to get back to my usual self and take on an adventure much larger than the one that brought my anxiety issues forward in the first place."
12285,"My medications definitely are helping with my depression, but my anxiety levels haven't decreased as much as I'd like."
12286,"I was put on a month's trial of medication and told to wait a month (for best results) to set up an appointment with a counselor because the Psych wanted to see how this specific medication affected me, especially it being my first time on medication."
12287,I'm embarrassed to say that I'm going to go back next week to talk about how the medication has affected me so far and know next to little about what afflicts me.
12288,If it happens again I'll heavily consider trying meds again
12289,"Even if it is, I just want to have some therapist of meds."
12290,I feel like I need medication because nothing makes me feel better and my condition severely impacts my quality of life.
12291,I've never tried any medication but I think it will be necessary to make this succeed.
12292,Any medicine tips?
12293,"ive been on 150mg effexor for a few years, whilst my anxiety has went up and down i do not think  it has worked particulary well and my counseller suggest i ask my GP to switch to meds more suiting my condition and with more sedative effects such as lexapro???"
12294,I've always had my general practitioner prescribe my medication.
12295,"So I was thinking, if I asked my doc for this medication, would they prescribe it?"
12296,"After being off it for two years, I've started experiencing GAD symptoms again and today started a new medication (Sertraline) for it."
12297,I was so proud of myself to get off the Effexor and live without the medication looming over my head.
12298,"Now my wife and I are trying to get pregnant and the meds have killed my sex drive and when I try, I don't feel anything (I'm a guy)."
12299,"Is there any everyday meds or should I go see a Docter so I can get a per-scripted pill to end this, because Ive talked to people about it and nothing has worked."
12300,Please someone help me (meds wise) Or if you got any tips that would be great too
12301,I'm currently taking meds (long term) for anxiety and ADHD.
12302,More info: Specific meds are Prozac and Concerta.
12303,Do any of you wear bracelets for your meds?
12304,"The things is... After I started experiencing attacks (and social anxiety that seemed to tag along..) I started to notice that I became extremely sensitive to any medication or substance, even food."
12305,"It started off with caffeine, which I hear is common for people with anxiety, but then it started happening with foods with high sugar, and any sort of medication."
12306,"I can't take cold meds, I have even felt high off of antibiotics."
12307,"I pretty much refuse any medications because I'm scared they will trigger anxiety or make me feel ""high""."
12308,"I've already taken my anxiety meds twice today, and I'm still not doing ok."
12309,"It's bad enough to the point where on days I know I'll have intercourse, I skip my medication."
12310,"I've considered stopping medication altogether, as well."
12311,I've been on anxiety medication for 6 years and was on 10mg of Lexapro.
12312,Is it common for a medication withdrawal to stop and then come back with a vengeance?
12313,I was on meds for a while but I don't believe in it.
12314,"I've had medication induced sleep hallucinations in the past, but this is really weird and I've never had my mind play tricks on me like this."
12315,What can I do to smooth out these symptoms when I'm not under medication?
12316,"I was on medication and missed almost all of my teen years due to anxiety, but I am not currently on anything consistently."
12317,"Even when I was a teenager and on meds, I couldn't go to school on a consistent basis because I would get overwhelmed and leave or just stay home (where I usually cried out of frustration, like I am now), so having a job was out of the question."
12318,Also I don't have medication as an option as I am pregnant.
12319,"Today though, I got on a plane to Denver and I've spent a full day in the city without taking any medication."
12320,"I don't believe I would be moved to read about others' anxiety if I wasn't seeking help - I think I've been crying out for help for over a year now, and my meds haven't changed, and I reach out to my supports/friends, and they don't help me."
12321,"I was on prozac and then had ativan as my ""rescue"" meds for panic attacks."
12322,"Well back in like, March, I decided I didn't need the meds, stopped taking my prozac(I still used the ativan when I needed it, but I didn't need it really at all, despite going through a really rough time), skipped my appointment with my psychiatrist, etc."
12323,"Especially the anxiety, but since I kinda skipped out on my meds and appointments, I'm freaking out about making a new appointment and I already have bad phone anxiety without thinking about how I broke the rules and such...."
12324,"TL;DR thought I could handle the world without meds, turns out I can't, too anxious to fix the problem."
12325,"this causes me to do many things i often turn over and over and over in my head when im trying to sleep
- I've seen about this- 2 therapists (one currently), 2 psychiatrists, 1 natropath, 1 Bio-meridian doctor (high-tech chinese medicine, they told me my biological pathways were inflamed, and that my body was so malnourished, it started to eat itself- this was when i really wasnt eating ANYTHING at all)
-My entire family has struggled with it at some point or another, my brother is a daily smoker for the same reason, my dad has told me a great deal about his experience, and it still affects him daily, my sister has attempted suicide because of it, and many of my mom's family members are affected by it."
12326,"and not having come up with a good conclusion, i am tempted to turn to medicine, which is something i don't believe in."
12327,I've been struggling with a severe anxiety disorder for almost fourteen years now (over half my life) and in that time have been prescribed to practically every anti-anxiety medicine that's been out since I've had the issue.
12328,"With or without self-medication, because at this point I'm hopeless."
12329,"Please, I've done everything... cbt/dbt/deep trance-state/medication/hospitlization/etc."
12330,"I see a specialist, I've seen 6+ counsellors and I take medication for these things."
12331,"When i try taking my prescribed medicine, I end up having a near panic attack so i just stopped trying."
12332,"I've tried medications, but even sticking with them for over a year doesn't really seem to benefit me."
12333,I'm wondering if the medication could play a role in it.
12334,"I've taken a few medications over a course of time, but nothing very strong."
12335,"Does anyone have experience with medications during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding, or should I just try and put up with it for now and return to the problem in a few years?"
12336,"I can barely keep a thought in my head, even with ADHD medication (Concerta 45mg) and Xanax 20mg, for anxiety."
12337,"I also started seeing a therapist by that time and I was responding better to therapy and medications (Wellbutrin)

Sorry if my post is getting too verbose."
12338,"I am gonna see my therapist soon bc Ive been off my meds and my anxiety is getting  worse again, but I don’t want to be prescribed xanax anymore after my experiences last year."
12339,"(BTW, I'm seeing a therapist and on medication."
12340,"Clearly things are worse lately, since I can't get meds until close to the end of the week."
12341,"For those of you not on meds, how the hell do you handle this??"
12342,"I'm clearly not functional AT ALL without my meds, but I need to try and work through the next couple of days."
12343,She hates the doctors and obviously wouldn't let me on medication unless it was really bad.
12344,"I lost my health insurance, so I've been off meds for about two months now."
12345,"Will I be taking the mind numbing medication forever or, one day, will I be that awesome kick ass spunky kid I was only a few years ago without any klonopin, or celexa, or atarax, or trazadone?"
12346,"I was in therapy and on meds (most you could name) for most of my teens, but gave them up when they weren't helping at around 18."
12347,"This summer at 22, being unable to go to school or get a job, and after another in a long line of family outings I ruined, I finally decided to try medicine again, because I had been at least a little better before."
12348,"He gave me blood pressure medicine as a rescue, to lower my heart rate to make me not panic, but it has little to no effect."
12349,My psychiatrist has prescribed me 2 different sleep medications but i stopped taking each one after one try.
12350,The problem was that i would feel the sedation of the sleep medication and it would send me into a panic attack.
12351,I struggle enough with just taking my meds everyday and remembering to eat and shower.
12352,The thought of not having my meds to control my anxiety is enough I'd probably throw myself off a bridge before trying to go back to controlling my anxiety without them.
12353,"I realize most people need some form of medicine at one point or another in their life just to make it day to day, but I still feel like such a failure not being able to just breathe normally without some pill to keep me relaxed enough not to immediately hyperventilate and have a complete meltdown."
12354,Few weeks later I returned with the same issues and felt no impact from the medicine.
12355,None of these medicines impacted my anxiety much.
12356,"I have tried so many medicines, (aside from Abilify which is what I was told would work, however insurance won't cover it and I can't afford $956 a month), and at this point I am unsure where to go."
12357,"I don't have insurance, so I can't get on meds."
12358,"Its not very bad, like I don't take medicine or anything, however its to the point where I decided to tell my parents about how I've been feeling different and now I go to like a therapist or psychologist once every 2 weeks."
12359,"When I'm on my meds, something dies, some sort of emotional depth, which I now realize I've missed, and I procrastinated getting my prescription refilled (which I could have done today), because, well, I get to daydream, and fantasize, and I keep wondering whether my future relationships (owing to a currently somewhat nomadic lifestyle, I'm not in the dating market at the moment) wouldn't be better off, deeper, more meaningful, more emotionally rich, if I went off the Zoloft."
12360,This happened almost every day for a few years and I feel like the medicines broke the motivation / dopamine part of my brain if that's possible.
12361,"I got off track though, so I eventually got put on a lowish - medium dose of a anti-anxiety/depression medication called Lexapro and it seemed to work."
12362,"About 3 months ago I decided it was time to try to get off the medication I had been taking for the last 3 years every day, so I went to my doctor and he had given me directions on how to come off of the medication, so I did."
12363,"Last month everything came back to me like it did 3 years ago, I tried to fight it but I eventually got back on the meds.. which I have been back on for a month or so now."
12364,Do I ask if I need to up the dosage of my anti-anxiety meds?
12365,"I stayed on my meds up until last year, because I felt that I had things under control."
12366,"After reading about how often anxiety medicine is abused, I'm scared they wont take me seriously or think that I plan on abusing the drugs."
12367,"To be denied medicine after 8 long years and wasting a little over $100 on the appointment, would be beyond devastating for me."
12368,So back to my question: Was it difficult to be prescribed anxiety medicine?
12369,"So, as an attempt to dig myself out of my little hole (along with seeing my pdoc and taking meds),  I've decided to pick up knitting as a hobby, since I can easily do it at home while watching tv (which is what i spend most of my time doing anyways)."
12370,"I want to ask you guys: Is cognitive therapy the way to go, or do I need meds as well?"
12371,"I had tried to commit suicide when i was on depression meds now,  depression is a taboo in my family they all hate that word every single day i am in some subtle way reminded how i am destroying my fucking life."
12372,"I am desperate so I came close to ordering Paxil @10mg from this site:
http://www.safedrugstock.com/medicine-products-anti-depressants-en.html

It claims no prescription is required."
12373,"Really needing to hear some stories about people who are successfully managing their anxiety, either with or without meds."
12374,"Fast forward to 2011, one of the therapist I was seeing at this point suggested that I consider medication, I was insulted."
12375,"Even though I'm not the ""taboo"" type, I felt like she was incompetant to suggest I should try medication."
12376,I'd like to spend the money on meds...but can't.
12377,Have to do that so I can have meds again.
12378,Need meds to feel competent enough to work online.
12379,"The doctors seemed to think I'd made progress, but taking me off of meds 1 month before starting a new school perhaps wasn't the best of ideas."
12380,"I've been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder in the past, but after some treatment I was weaned off of meds and therapy had become not as useful."
12381,So I'm transitioning from lexapro to zoloft to help with anxiety brought on by meds I take for ADD (80 mg strattera and 40mg vyvanse).
12382,"I'm not currently on medication, but I do have one."
12383,I don't want no medicine.
12384,"I tried getting some treatment when I was 18 - the dr. perscribed fluoxetine and citalopram, and I had no positive or negative effect from either, so I discontinued use, the dr. agreed I should just keep managing it on my own rather than with medication."
12385,I'm on anti seizure medication now.
12386,"Everything is going well for her in life, and she has been taking her medicines regularly."
12387,"As far as meds go, I have been on Prozac, welbutrin, lexapro, cymbalta, etc."
12388,"the meds made me worse, but also made it so i could go out of the house by myself and go shopping without freaking out and just sitting in the parking lot feeling fear."
12389,3rd day off the meds i heard the voices again.
12390,"told my person who prescribes meds, she freaked, gave me abilify."
12391,"i dont know if i should be taking any anti anxiety meds, i also dont know if i should be taking any meds for ADHD since that increases anxiety."
12392,These symptoms haven't been this bad since I have been seeing someone/taking medications for it.
12393,"I'm hoping this will last, but I really wanted to share because often times medicine is stigmatized."
12394,My parents were a little worried about me starting up medication because they feared dependency and side effects.
12395,"I'm having a much easier time with school and social situations and I'm glad I decided to seek out medication after a not-so-great experience with counselling (there were positives and negatives, but it was totally circumstantial)."
12396,"I was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder, they give me medications, but I haven't been able to get them filled or see a doctor since I lost my insurance for 3 months until my new insurance kicks in, and even then it scrapes the bottom of the barrel and they don't cover mental health services."
12397,"I'm hoping that i can go to a near by urgent care and they would be able  to help me not only get medication but resources for counseling options for ""low income"" uninsured types like myself."
12398,I feel like if I had these meds back then that wouldn't have happened and I could have lived a productive life.
12399,Now however it's like I become a completely different person... Can it be an added side effect of the medication?
12400,"I've gotten progressively more insane when I drink and want to know if this can be a side effect of medication mixed with drinking, or if I'm just an insane person."
12401,I am not in general one of those holistic medicine people but since I stared a stack of vit d magnesium and vitamin b12 my anxiety has reduced greatly it was worth a shot
12402,"Yesterday morning...I tried to let myself sleep a little late after breakfast/meds (ceiling fan squeaking, ugh) ...then got up, proceeded to change and wash bedsheets, put away dishwasher contents, and dusted/vacuumed the house...and obviously wore myself out."
12403,I've tried therapy and I'm on medication i take every day for it.
12404,Also I'm paranoid on these meds.
12405,"I live in a place where marijuana is illegal, and they also are very harsh on people who are caught with it, however it's what has helped me most through the years of different prescription medications."
12406,Plus when I met the doctor at the hospital for medication he was a total asshole (my boyfriend has actually met him as well for different reasons and the doctor treated him the same way) anyway basically Im unable to take medication so therapy was my only option.
12407,i have tried CBT and meds.
12408,"I also have the flu at the moment, and I'm actually scared to take my medicine as I'm scared I will have some allergic reaction or whatever."
12409,"I said ""screw you, anxiety"" got up, took my medicine, and got ready to go."
12410,I'm on medication so I don't get the full on anxiety attacks but I still feel generally anxious and depressed.
12411,I believe I have GAD and when I'm not on my medicine anxiety attacks.
12412,"I'm not on any medication except for the occasional xanax to manage my most acute symptoms, but I try to go sparingly with those."
12413,Are there any recommendations to dealing with anxiety that don't include therapy and medicine?
12414,"I'm not even on meds now, but will probably have to get some."
12415,"I have had a few drinks tonight, i know i shouldn't with the medication i'm taking, but it was the only way to get out of the house and go to class and participate in social interactions."
12416,"Given my anxiety issues (well controlled, actually, but with medication and decades of practice) I'm a walking fucking pharmacy so I give her a xanax in front of everybody and in violation of federal law I am sure (fuck you, Eric Holder)."
12417,"Anyway, I just completely stopped taking my meds two weeks ago because I had become so numb to everything around me that despite not having anxiety, I felt as if I was going through the motions with everything."
12418,Just a little rant for those who have been relying on meds and are thinking of stopping.
12419,"i went to the doctors for a checkup and she gave me some medicine, which helped with the stomach aches, but didnt really help with the anxiety as a whole, but i attempted to cope with it, as i did the last 3 years (the current time in the 'story' is me around 15 years old, maybe 14)."
12420,"from day 1 in the school year my medicine hasnt been helping, so i got new medicine that helped for a bit, so i thought everything was alright."
12421,I've tried taking a variety of medications to control my anxiety and depression but I hate being so dependent on the medication to be happy.
12422,"And I know that I could be on anxiety meds, but the one I take that actually helped really made sex not just dissatisfying but depressing."
12423,But when I am on my anti-anxiety meds I just can't feel anything and get really dry (sorry this is graphic but I need to rant) and then sex can't happen and I just feel like bawling my eyes out because I feel like a failure.
12424,"So, I was given some medication to treat my anxiety and depression (Zoloft, if it matters), and I started it very recently so, as the prescribing doctor said it would, currently it's doing more harm then good, but I have a question regarding how it'll work after it starts to do what it's supposed to."
12425,"My entire life I've wanted to be a social, friendly person; genuine kindness is a big thing I aspire in my life, and I view friendliness as a part of that, but, obviously as I'm posting here, my anxiety and other emotional problems didn't make it possible for me to be quite what I wanted, so, will the medication make it easier for me to be outgoing/eliminate the nervousness associated with conversing with people I barely/do not know?"
12426,**TL;DR:** Does anxiety medication make it easier to be outgoing or does that come later?
12427,"Maybe anxiety meds could help, but I've heard some bad stories about people dying from overdose or something related and I dislike taking constant medication when I can avoid it."
12428,"I've been on the medication for about 2 months, and I used to drink quite a bit before starting the meds, I haven't drank in about 5 months."
12429,This is the first time I've ever considered resorting to medication for my anxiety.
12430,"Over time, my Bipolar (Type I) SO's self-medication has turned into a full-fledged addiction."
12431,"Last time my nightmares got this bad was a few years ago, I was on no medications."
12432,I asked my Psych about Lions Mane and he said that would be a bad idea since it may interact with my medication(s).
12433,"He's getting professional help with both medication as well as therapy, and he is keeping up well with the doctors' advice."
12434,"I have never been offered or given medication, as my parents always accompany me to my first sessions (I would not be able to afford them by myself) and explicitly say they don't want to put me on medication."
12435,"I've been on depression/anxiety medication before for several years, but the side effects became too much to bear (I was tired ALL the time)."
12436,"I stopped taking that medication, and switched to another that also did not work (I got suicidal, which I had never been before), and stopped taking that medication."
12437,It has been approximately a year since I stopped taking any medication whatsoever.
12438,"I do feel that without medication included in my treatment, I am slowly retreating back into my anxious brain."
12439,I need help on asking for medication.
12440,"My doctor absolutely refuses to give me any medication that she deems ""addicting,"" saying that they do not give those out unless it is a ""special"" case (example: Xanax)."
12441,"Many of my friends are offering to refer me to their doctors, but I'm nervous that I'll be seem as ""shopping"" for doctors in order to get medication, and that makes me terrified."
12442,TL;DR: My primary doctor makes me uncomfortable asking for medication.
12443,I need assistance on how I can effectively communicate how much anxiety meds are necessary for my mental health.
12444,My therapist has given me options: medication or cognitive therapy.
12445,"At first I wanted to try both combined (medication and cognitive therapy) and would like to avoid benzodiazephies/benzos because of addictions in the family (specifically involving benzos) and I'd like something to be more long term and regular than a few weeks of medication and I have to go off of it (I like things to remain the same and be regular or else I begin to panic)

If anyone has had any experience with certain medications/therapies it would be awesome to have some opinions or suggestions."
12446,for the last six months the medication has helped but here I am today bawling my eyes out for no good reason.
12447,I guess it's time to have my medication adjusted.
12448,"After that, i realised i have to change something about myself, and i started seeing a psychologist (before that i was seeing a psychiatrist and i was taking meds, but i decided i don't want to take them anymore)."
12449,"Im really trying to avoid getting on medications due to the side-effects, but am starting to wonder if thats my only option."
12450,I started with medication 1½ month ago and have been feeling better.
12451,"Not sure if It is me getting better at dealing, the medication or perhaps the fact that I have started accepting my new situation, city and job."
12452,I was always against meds but I am so glad I took the plunge.
12453,Are there any good herbal remedies or over the counter medications I can take just for when talking doesn't seem to help and I just need to get out of it?
12454,My anxiety used to take over my life until I got professional help and the right meds (which was hard because I have anxiety over taking most meds!).
12455,My daily anxiety medication isn't working like it used to.
12456,I've been on different types of meds for nearly 10 years now for my anxiety.
12457,I'm pretty sure I need to stay on the meds because before them I couldn't even make a phone call without nearly having a panic attack.
12458,"I've been on plenty of meds, been to see cognitive therapists, counsellors and had visits with my doctor weekly."
12459,During one of our early dates he  mentioned he had anxiety (most likely GAD; generalized anxiety disorder) and he had been seeing someone for it previously (and was given medication which he now only keeps for extreme circumstances) but has since stopped doing so due to some issue with his insurance.
12460,I really want to add Klonopin to my medication but I don't understand how to bring it up to my psych without seeming like a drug-seeker.
12461,"I am going into medicine, so I have a really strong scientific background, and I always read things trying to dismantle any possibility for an afterlife, and it freaks me out."
12462,"I'm going to start tapering off the medicine by cutting the pill in half (I know 10mg isn't a lot to begin with, but it's worth a try.)"
12463,"He continues to brush it off as something my brain is reacting to the medication, and says I need to ""keep drinking to find my limit"" BUT WHAT."
12464,"Also thinks my manic episodes when drinking are just classic alcohol poisoning and not the antidepressant affecting my brain, but I never acted this way UNTIL on the medication."
12465,"The medications I've used before are sertraline, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine and escitalopram."
12466,"I just, want to try beating it without medication."
12467,"does anyone know of any methods/medications that allow you to feel normal, in control and not get overly excited."
12468,"without food, i cannot take my medication."
12469,"I got so anxious I couldnt calm down for about 1 hour, my mother gave me some medication to make me cool down but it did not help that much."
12470,"Regardless, I've been off my meds for the most part (other than the rare xanax for emergencies) and have been fucking great."
12471,But I just feel shitty and ashamed that I'm going to have to call him and set up another appointment pretty soon to tell him about this shit and get my meds refilled.
12472,So I was hoping to crowdsource some information on meds.
12473,"I have been on some anxiety medications, and am now on an antidepressant."
12474,And I am thinking about meds as a possible fix.
12475,I'm also re-starting CBT so the medicine would be in conjunction with therapy.
12476,They just assumed I was trying to take the attention away from my younger brother who is diagnosed with both an anxiety disorder and depression and is currently on medication.
12477,I just started these medications last night.
12478,"I thought now that the Dr put me on some meds, that I would become back to normal."
12479,You get all of the short term positive effects of anti-anxiety drugs without the long term negatives of taking that kind of medicine all of the time.
12480,"Thanks to my medicine and friends, I managed to go throughout the whole school day without the thought crossing my mind."
12481,"I don't exactly know where to start with this story, but I have suffered from generalised anxiety disorder for over four years now and ""minor"" depression for over two years and even though I'm taking medication for both and seeing a psychologist about it, I feel like I'm getting worse."
12482,I'm not a medical doctor but I believe that medication only masks the response to the trigger (numbing the effect) rather than clearing the root cause.
12483,"When I'm on my depression meds, I feel nothing."
12484,I have diagnosed anxiety and don't take medication anymore.
12485,"Do I see a therapist, try to handle it on my own with exercise and a healthy diet or maybe meds again...idk 

Please give me your advice."
12486,I just started half tablets of depression medication on Thursday and was told they probably won't kick in until two weeks.
12487,Has anyone had these reactions to certain meds and found success with another?
12488,I'm nervous about trying more medications at this point.
12489,"Long story short- during our time together she was usually unemployed and thus leaving me with all our expenses, I found out she had BPD and wasn't taking her meds, and that things were getting bad between us."
12490,"I was worried about bills, she was acting crazy without her meds, and I was stressed beyond stressed at times."
12491,I don't love the idea of anxiety meds but maybe I need to go that route.
12492,It worked really really well for me (haven't taken any other meds for my anxiety aside from clonazepam to offset a panic attack in the moment.)
12493,"Things I do are, watching when and what I eat, avoiding caffeine, anti nausea medicine(Works wonders) Acid re flux medicine, tums, and cold water."
12494,Months ago I realize that the prozac made me feel sad/low so I talked to my doc and switched medicine.
12495,"I was thinking that maybe the alcohol could have this effect, though ive been drunk multiple times on my medication and havnt had problems."
12496,Should I quit the medications?
12497,How/when did you decide to get off of meds and how did everything go for you?
12498,"I don't want to take medication unless it's the only solution anyway, and it wasn't helping."
12499,"Then I started seeing a new therapist who doesn't really use meds, and on his advice I switched from 300 mg XR to 100 mg normal Seroquel."
12500,"My therapist doesn't believe my panic attacks are being caused by medications or lack thereof, but nor does he have any suggestions for coping."
12501,I'm starting to wonder if it's really possible for me to be off of psychiatric medication.
12502,"I might be going to a therapist soon, my mother suggested it but she is strongly apprehensive and scared of medication or drugs so I think I'll have to bring it up again when I get back home."
12503,"I don't want to be dependent on meds for life just to feel normal, so over the years I've found ways to relieve it."
12504,"Ive struggled with anxiety and depression over the last four years, mostly untreated, never took medication before."
12505,I expected that I would be sent to a specialist to receive a proper assessment before being prescribed medication.
12506,The reason why it might be so bad right now is because I havent taken any meds for almost 6 months and I was seeing a therapist.
12507,This is my first time interacting with a guy since I have been off my meds.
12508,"I really dont want to get back on my meds.... 
Any help at all?"
12509,"For those of you who have had to make the decision to take drugs, would it be better to stick to his diagnosis and take the medication or would it be prudent to look into other alternatives?"
12510,"I feel like I have a good handle on my anxiety (meds that work, positive self-talk, supportive friends &amp; family), but there's one tick I just can't stop: twiddling my hair."
12511,I've tried medicine and meditation and all of that but nothing works.
12512,"Has anyone here found anything helpful for that, besides meds (already on them) and alcohol?"
12513,im starting new meds soon.
12514,I stopped my meds (Zoloft) because I was tired of gaining weight (15 lbs in two years).
12515,"How do you cope, or what medications do you take that help?"
12516,All I want to do is lose this weight and I am thoroughly convinced that my medicine is not allowing me to do so.
12517,"I pulled myself off of the medicine cold-turkey (I don't recommend) two months go, have been working my butt off and eating even better and cannot lose a pound."
12518,I really feel like the medicine screwed with my metabolism.
12519,"A lot of people will claim that this medication will not cause weight gain, but like I said, I didn't change a thing."
12520,I was just wondering if anyone else on anxiety medication (preferably SSRI's) have dealt with this and what they did to combat the weight gain?
12521,Does anyone have any better experiences with medicine?
12522,"Things are really tough, my parents have taken him to many different therapists, he's tried hypnosis, meditation, medication, CBT not a lot seems to be changing..."
12523,I have dealt with panic disorder for a while and I haven't had issues that lasted this long since before I was on medication.
12524,It is a major issue for me that went away when I started taking medication but has now returned with the rest of my symptoms.
12525,"He was just a family medicine doctor, this wasn't his expertise, but he was very helpful and gave me hope and started me in a path of recovery."
12526,"&amp;nbsp;

I begun to visit a therapist regularly, she prescribed me some medicines(citalopram 20mg, risperdal .5mg) taken in tandem worked well for awhile."
12527,"So I started my medicines again, this time only the citalopram."
12528,"&amp;nbsp;

Currently, I stopped taking the medicine again, because I think they make my heart feel flutter."
12529,"But now after stoping the meds, my fears have roared back into thinking i'm going to die of a heart attack."
12530,"&amp;nbsp;

I have scheduled an appointment with my therapist who prescribes my medicine, I am wanting to try something else, with less effects on the heart and maybe less of zombie feeling."
12531,And is it wrong to want to try other medicine?
12532,"This morning when I got up and started going about my business I started feeling anxious and thinking about all of the bad things I've ever done in my life (which is the typical spiral I go into when anxious), and had to take some of my panic medication, on top of my regular medication."
12533,Everyone is telling me medication is awful and won't help.
12534,"I've been put on medication for it, a decent size; I've tried 4 others before and they haven't had results."
12535,"I've thought about going back on medication, however each time i get close to calling the doctor i remember the terrible month of withdraws  that i had when cycling off."
12536,Other medications not relating to Anxiety that I take are: Sprintec (birth control) and Solodyn (for acne) 80mg.
12537,"He's been on several medications over the years, Lexapro, some other one, but none of them seemed to help."
12538,Often I have to drive long distances and I suffer from anxiety and do not want medication.
12539,Many years ago I had a bout of anxiety which led me to get on medication to help control it.. it worked for a while and then I decided to quit taking it and I ended up not needing it again until now.
12540,I don't want to have to get back onto medication for this so I'm looking for simple ways to help relax my mind and body.
12541,"I want to talk to my psychiatrist about it, but I am afraid she will just try to up my meds or add something."
12542,"Long story short, I'm just really anxious about medication and what it could do to me."
12543,"I have pretty severe GAD with hypochondria, I'm not on any meds for it except Xanax which I take sparingly (usually a half of a .25mg pill)."
12544,"I know I said in the title that I am running out of single meds, and that's because I don't consider Klonopin to be a permanent or long term solution."
12545,I could take all the side effects if the meds worked on the actual problem as well.
12546,"Also, I've been on psychiatric medication on and off since I was 12 or 13 (24 now)."
12547,I am (and had been) on a good dose of 3 medications that have really worked for me up until then.
12548,"I can't really take benzos - I used to have a really bad drug problem and my drug of choice was benzodiazepines and barbiturates - and in my opinion they are the only rx meds that work ""in the moment""."
12549,Do you seek the same treatment (medication or behavioral)?
12550,"Many people I know take anxiety meds, but I wanted to be strong and get out of this hole by myself."
12551,"Now my question is say I'm ""addicted"" and take 3 a day what's the big deal it's just like any other medication people Need to survive"
12552,"I am going into the doc on Monday to discuss this, but will generalized anxiety meds make me feel the same that Xanax has?"
12553,"She just took some medication, but it isn't working."
12554,I am drinking now to try and dull symptoms but I just don't want to be on the medication anymore even though I have severe panic attacks and anxiety.
12555,"Despite therapy and three types of medication (Cipralex, Buspirone, Quetiapine) I still have my ""off"" days."
12556,"After being off of my meds for 6-8 months, I haven't felt like this since I first had anxiety issues 2-3 years ago."
12557,"My doctor keeps decreasing my meds because I don't think he thinks I really have depression at all, and it feels like I'm just getting swallowed into a black hole."
12558,"So I recently started a new medication, totally unrelated to my anxiety/depression, for my rheumatoid arthritis."
12559,"Have a bad hip due to inflammation that made it hard to walk sometimes, and that has improved in the couple of months I've been on the meds."
12560,But my anxiety medication?
12561,"Anyway, I feel like I might need to raise my dosage of the anxiety meds at the very least."
12562,"And I'm expected to see a therapist and take meds, even though neither of my parents are willing to do either of those things themselves."
12563,I thought my experience might be helpful to anyone who is dealing with anxiety but is either reluctant or does not have the means to seek medical help toward the end of obtaining prescription medication.
12564,Where do I start to talk to someone about meds?
12565,"I'd rather be on meds and go to therapy at the same time, but I need meds asap."
12566,I have decided not to take medication anymore because I want to conquer my anxiety myself without medication.
12567,"I can function normally on medication for my everyday anxiety, but even that doesn't quell my fears at work."
12568,"He said it could be something else.. perhaps something treatable with medications, maybe colitis or something."
12569,"I've recently become ~~very~~ incredibly nervous in social situations, and no amount of medication or reasurrance will stop me living every waking moment in a state of constant anxiety and paranoia."
12570,"He is going to give me the medication I need to cope with my life, thank goodness!"
12571,"I haven't picked up or taken my meds yet, and I know it will be a long road ahead before life is ""normal"" again, but geez, the idea that that is even a possibility.. &lt;3

EDIT: I just realized I said ""today"" twice in the title.. annoying.. and unfixable."
12572,I was wondering what was better for anxiety medication.
12573,It just seems like meds can be dangerous and they should be only an extremely last resort.
12574,Next week I have two appointments one with the nurse for blood pressure and blood test and one to see my doctor about the panic attacks to perhaps get my medication increased and a new prescription.
12575,"I take my medication with food an hour after waking and it has made me a little better, it has made me have less attacks but the prospect of leaving the flat next week is something that is making me worry."
12576,"I've tried anxiety medications, but they only worked for a month or so and required me to take a higher dosage."
12577,"By the time the meds ran out, I was anxious again and afraid to go to the doctor."
12578,I just really feel like being able to have some control over my anxiety and overcome this obstacle was completely made possible by the medication.
12579,I do not want medication for every day and understand that I need to continue to work to overcome my anxiety but sometimes it gets too overwhelming.
12580,"I have done everything in the book from more exercise to less caffeine to yoga classes , st johns wort, hopps you name it which help somewhat but sometimes there are incidents in which I really feel like I benefit from anti anxiety medicine which I take non perscribed ."
12581,I understand that some people abuse these medications but I honestly feel like I would benefit from a moderate prescription of anti anxiety medication to be taken when things get too overwhelming so that I can continue to function and get though it.
12582,How do I go about trying to get these medications?
12583,"I've gone through this for 8 years, with 2 hospitalizations, 5 therapists over 6 years, and 4 years on medication."
12584,"I stopped medication and therapy right before turning 18, and arguably I was good for about 6 months, but then everything just started coming back and much worse than before."
12585,"Other than the medication that knocks you out(not suitable while I attend school), I seem to be extremely resistant to medication even at high doses."
12586,"I also had severe withdrawals upon stopping SSRIs, so I don't want to be on medication after the pain I went through with those."
12587,"She says I'm too old, and that if I go to a doctor they will just tell me I need medication, so it's not worth her taking a day off work to take me."
12588,I have been on the drug as part of a combined therapy/medication treatment for GAD and side effects of the drug have steadily gotten worse the longer I was on it.
12589,Should I try another medication?
12590,I'm so happy and hopeful and relieved that I finally got some help; and I'm really happy with my doctor- he's very kind and not one to really push medications on you.
12591,"Since a year ago I take Rendetil when I panic, its like a natural solution for anxiety (it has passion flower/valerian in drops) it kinda helps me in my moments, but a part of me doesnt want to depend on medication (althought it isnt like severe medication), i cant go out without my drops."
12592,I think if I do the endo and it comes back clear I need to seriously think about medication but I am scared to go on it.
12593,"My psychiatrist had the ""tough it up and get back as soon as you can"" mentality, of course with the use of medications involved."
12594,"After trial and error with one medication, I was recently put on a very low dosage of an SSRI a month after I started ""treatment."""
12595,"I figure I need meds, which kind?"
12596,"What kind of meds work somewhat instantly while youre panicking, if any?"
12597,I don't take medication.
12598,"I'm just tired of no medications working, no therapists doing their jobs, and nothing going the way it should."
12599,Should I consult my doctor and see if I could get ant-anxiety medication or what should I do?
12600,I have only one concern about the medicine and that's the suicide risk.
12601,"Also, how should I expect to feel on this medication?"
12602,Not everyone wants or is able to get medication for their anxiety.
12603,I'm posting this for those that are on the edge about looking to get medication.
12604,"I don't need medication when I should just learn to pull myself out of these situations."""
12605,I didn't want or even think I needed medication.
12606,"In all honesty, I don't know what he's been diagnosed with in particular, but he does take daily, physician prescribed medication and has a second medication for specific moments when he is overwhelmed."
12607,I have tried a variety of different medications with no results and no side effects.
12608,"All of this is extremely frustrating and discouraging I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here, to try all these medications and have no effect, side effects or withdrawal symptoms is mind boggling to me."
12609,I'm on two meds to control my anxiety.
12610,":(

If I go to the GP, would they prescribe me more medicine?"
12611,I'm highly sensitive to medication so if I take one I get too fucked up but it's the only thing that gets rid of my crippling anxiety.
12612,I started getting treatment about 6 years ago and have been on all sorts of medication as I was diagnosed Bi-Polar.
12613,Almost a year ago I stopped taking my birth control (Yaz) and was then able to stop all my psychiatric medications save for Trazodone for sleep and Neurontin because I felt like I was in withdrawal when I stopped taking it.
12614,I'm probably going to ask my primary care doctor for an increase in my medication that's for lowering my heart rate (Toprol XL).
12615,"Edit: I'm gonna add that I was doubtful about it, but I've been waiting to get on medication for so long that I thought I might as well give it a shot."
12616,So I started having anxiety for about a year now it started when I went to the hospital and had a really bad experience with the people before all this I was very active and out going many years in mauy Thai and mma so fear never really fazed me but now it's as  if I can't go a restaurant without having one I've seen doctors and all tht stuff but I don't wanna rely on meds and my family just get annoyed and say it's all in my head but they never had this so they don't understand and I'm the back bone for a lot of people and lately that's just been to much for me I guess what I'm saying is that it be great to have some friends that have anxiety as well who understand and have leaden to control it better to talk to thanks for your time guys
12617,I've been considering trying to find a counsellor as I really don't want to go the medication route.
12618,My doctor tried to humor me by giving my samples of some meds which I know are placebo doses.
12619,"I don't actually feel depressed just sometimes I have strange scary thoughts, or I can't sleep the neurologist gave me 0.25mg of clonazepam ,thought my family doctor recommended I take 50mg of Zoloft daily currently I'm taking neither I'm not sure I want to be dependent on medicine."
12620,"I have tried so many meds, different types of therapy and so much shit but I just cant to get past this stage."
12621,"Yes, medication does help to a certain extent."
12622,"I live with my mother (I am embarrassed about that), I have a boyfriend (also 26 and he lives with his parents)

I also thought nothing can be done, and in a way I still feel that way, because I am VERY sensitive to all medication I have taken throughout my life."
12623,I tend to have side effects that are worse than the symptoms the medication is meant to treat.
12624,That makes me VERY hesitant to try any medication.
12625,I really don't want to take medication.
12626,"But it still happen, and already tried with 7 different kind of meds too.."
12627,I'm reverting back to a bad mental state like before I started my meds (which I'm still on) and it's really taking a toll.
12628,They even doubled my meds!
12629,I haven't been on meds in ten years and my anxiety is catching up with me again.
12630,"Similarly, are there any medications that are known to ease up bloating and/or stimulate appetite?"
12631,I want to start new medicine right away.
12632,I struggled with panic and anxiety for five years before going on medication after a bad breakdown.
12633,"Originally on the medication, I felt relief from anxiety for the first time in years."
12634,"I took meds, for about two months, but they didn't help."
12635,I'm thinking of going on a daily medication and was wondering if anyone has any experience with daily medication and could offer some advice for going forward?
12636,"We ended up getting high, which only fucked with my head, maybe because of my meds, I don't know."
12637,Just wanted to share a positive story about being on meds.
12638,No meds?
12639,Attempted suicide at 10 with overdose of medication.
12640,"I don't want to get medication that just makes me feel nothing, and then makes me super-depressed some day when I drop it."
12641,"I'm a 22F, diagnosed with MDD recurrent non-psychotic, and OCD (which is the closest match, but doesn't exactly fit - it's more of a clusterfuck of obsessive/cyclical anxiety and intrusive thoughts)  I've been on meds like Prozac and Zyprexa in the past, so I've experienced the, um, ""fun"" side effects of withdrawals."
12642,"Right now, I'm back to having apocalyptic dreams ever night (I've had them all my life, but they subsided mostly with the meds)."
12643,"I want to make this work, but I don't know if my experience so far is a sign that I should try another medication."
12644,I had an emergency visit to my family doctor and she upped my meds and gave me a few days off.
12645,"I keep having this anxious feeling like I need to change friend groups or like I'm immature or like I'm not cool or like my hobbies are dumb and it just comes from so much confusion and I'm so stressed out over it and I'm afraid because I honestly don't want to change but the anxious thoughts and I've questioned everything, my sense of humor and my friendships and my relationship and my taste in music and why I do this or that or why I believe in this thing or that thing and it's so distressing and I keep telling myself ""okay I just won't focus on it"" but it's still there brimming on the edge of my mind and it's so hard to just let it go and I've tried taking my medication and it doesn't help and I just want to cry but it's so hard and I'm seriously freaking out right now

how can I accept myself it's all I want to do"
12646,Should I try medication?
12647,I've had medications to help me for the past few months and I was formally diagnosed by a psychiatrist last winter.
12648,Thanks to the medication I was able to walk in and talk about making an appointment.
12649,"Eventually, I think I just pass out from the sedative effects, but the panic is unpleasant and not what I was expecting from an anti-anxiety medicine."
12650,Any meds that just relax you without causing that lethargic feeling?
12651,Woke up late and didn't take me meds the time I usually do.
12652,"I'm on bipolar meds, and beta blockers for anxiety."
12653,"So, yeah, I was wondering if any of you had experience with this, for how long, what meds you might have been put on, your results, ect."
12654,Is there anything I can do to fix this besides resorting to therapy or medication?
12655,"I've been good about taking my meds, but for some reason today I am feeling particularly anxious and just full of rage."
12656,She advised that as I suffer with anxiety (not on any medication) that this sounds like a panic attack.
12657,"I found a new job at which i feel confident and relaxed and i feel the time is right to get off the meds, since i also take something for my migraines and for my thyroid and I feel like a walking medicine cabinet at times."
12658,What medication were you prescribed?
12659,I go to therapy and I'm thinking about going on medication but it scares me.
12660,"For those who take medication to help their anxiety, have you been told that you should no longer be feeling any anxiety symptoms?"
12661,I ask as I'm in between meds right now as my last medication wasn't working and my doctor wanted to try something new.
12662,"I'm still feeling a lot of panic symptoms, so I don't know if this current medication is helping or not."
12663,"I've tried switching medications, I've tried Viagra."
12664,My sister used to have anxiety and she had the same medication and (I know I can't base my experiences off of hers) she would take the Xanax if she felt a panic attack coming on.
12665,"I'm no longer on medication but I think I should be, I used to have clonodine to take when I had something anxiety-provoking coming up."
12666,My medicine isn't working.
12667,So I have the choice of that or side effects from this stupid medicine.
12668,I just turned eighteen a month ago so now I stay at my house and watch all my acquaintances having the time of their life for senior year while I wait for medication to kick in so I can get my GED and then get a job and live in the real world because now that I'm eighteen my mom's made it pretty clear I have to get a job or move out.
12669,"I have GAD, and take daily medication for it."
12670,I had my first trip after experiencing it a couple years ago and I got a prescribed medication to help.
12671,I went into it armed with knowledge and was ready to fight it without medication.
12672,"I know I have anxiety, but I feel that I'm not so bad off that I need medication."
12673,"I have been experiencing these issues for about ten years now, I think maybe I'm in denial that I really do need medication."
12674,"I am still on medication- the doctor helping me when I was covered by student care was kind enough to give me enough refills to last until the New Year, so I have time to get settled/get a job/maybe be able to cope with my anxiety well enough to the point where I don't need the medication."
12675,"I think this post is going to end up as mostly a huge wall of venting, but despite taking medication (Celexa) and seeing a therapist once a week, my anxiety has continued to go through the roof over Winter Break."
12676,"I can't remember how I ended up being referred to a Psychiatrist and a Psychologist (who happened to be our family preacher years before), but the decision was made it was time to try and get me on medicine and I was diagnosed with Panic Anxiety Disorder and slight OCD tendencies."
12677,"I was prescribed liquid Prozac, GOD what an awful taste, but medicine alone wasn't enough."
12678,Because of the pain I was causing myself from not eating they pulled me from school and put me in an out patient psychiatric hospital to monitor my medicine intake and get me eating again.
12679,Around my 10th grade year I stopped seeing the psychologist and psychiatrist and my family doctor took over maintaining my meds.
12680,When I take new meds I fixated on the 'possible' side effects on the box and am semi convinced it's gonna happen to me.
12681,"My Prozac ran out 4 weeks ago, I spent three weeks not taking ANY meds because I was worried about switching meds and side effects etc."
12682,After week three of no meds I called the doctor and told him the concept of switching to Pristiq was causing more anxiety than anything.
12683,"Middle School : panic attacks, out patient treatment, begin therapy and meds."
12684,"Basically, finally saw someone to treat me with meds for anxiety and depression because I was having constant panic attacks following starting college."
12685,"I've been in psychotherapy for 5 years now and I tried out different medication (Paxil, Prozac; but also Valium and Xanax and even got dependent on it and had to do a very unpleasant withdrawal) but none of it helped me to beat this tormenting disorder."
12686,"I started to smoke weed (from a bong) about three months ago and at the same time I tried out a new medication, Venlafaxine."
12687,* They gave me *three times* the usual dosage of medicine that clears it up *and it didn't work*.
12688,Did I mention the usual medicine wasn't working fast enough?
12689,"* So when the medicine didn't work the way it should the *first* time, the anxiety kicked in and started overriding the medicine to give me symptoms again because that's what my body thinks is an appropriate reaction to stress."
12690,If the medication doesn't work *next time* I can probably expect a tube shoved down my throat at best.
12691,but i also dont want to be on meds.
12692,I was off my meds for about 3 days.
12693,"Going for xrays, got medicine and referral for physical therapy."
12694,"When it is probably just related to the original pain, or the meds, or whatever."
12695,I'm so anxious and wondering if there is anything I can do to quell the anxious thoughts without medication.
12696,"Before taking the medication, I felt like I had loads of information in my head that makes it hard for me to concentrate."
12697,ive had anxiety for awhile and it mostly occurs right when i wake up for an hour or so until i take my medication (xanax) and it will subside until the next day.
12698,"my question to you all is first, does this ever happen to you (waking up suddenly in the middle of an epic panic attack,) and if so...since i've already spoken to my primary doctor and i'm on medication (clearly not working effectively), and each time i try to make an appointment for CBT/therapy there is a huge wait for new patients."
12699,When I first walked in the Doctor told me I probably wouldn't be put on medication but after a questionnaire and an explanation of my symptoms I was prescribed Citalopram (20mg).
12700,I would love to go on meds or see a shrink but its just not in the books for me right now.
12701,I feel the medication at its current dose is helpful.
12702,"I know there are meds, supplements, cognitive tricks, etc."
12703,"We can keep it under some control with medication and for smaller problems with breathing exercises [to an extent] but it is there and you are not FORCED to BEAT it, because you can't."
12704,"Despite medication (that was working), I can't stop my thoughts."
12705,"This medicine will not let me cry to release any pressure building up, alcohol isn't helping me relax at all, and prayer isn't doing anything."
12706,"Klonopins, pain meds and drugs aren't taking it away."
12707,I go there once a month to get my meds and they assign a counselor that I meet once a week.
12708,We talked and he asked if I ever wanted to try out medications.
12709,So I guess my question is what is it like being on meds for mild anxiety?
12710,I really just have images of me being dependent on them or taking it months before I get the right dose or type of meds.
12711,I know I am probably worrying about nothing but it's my first time being on any medication other then for my allergies.
12712,"Long story short, i've suffered of social anxiety disorder and depression since my early teens (I'm 22 now), been on meds for the past three years and they've really made a difference."
12713,What other medications/herbal remedies etc.
12714,"No one thinks I can get better and neither do I. 
Fuck my medication, fuck my shitty friends that don't take this seriously and fuck everyone that can go around their days without this feeling holding onto them."
12715,"Anyone know of any therapies, medications, and/or strategies that could help me and others like me."
12716,Right now I'm in between meds.
12717,what medication would you recommend for a returning college student?
12718,"Also, I am on Lexapro and Klonopin before anyone suggests medication."
12719,So when I could really be taking 1 to 2 different types of meds I'm really taking 5
12720,Maybe meds would help?
12721,I have generalised anxiety in addition to depression that is mitigated by medication which I only started about a month ago.
12722,"I almost feel like I don't deserve to take time off and get help, like everything I am dealing with doesn't warrant time off to sort everything out and get on medication."
12723,"I told my boss yesterday that I have anxiety and panic disorder, and that I needed some time off to get on meds because it was making it hard to do my job and making my overall personal life hell."
12724,"I need to get on medication that helps with food addiction, I've read that Wellbutrin may help with this."
12725,I'm scared I won't be able to get into see a psychiatrist within the time they need me to so they can fill out the disability paper work and get me started on medication.
12726,It has been extremely difficult to stop this medicine due to feeling sick/dizzy/etc.
12727,Long story short: I've been off my anxiety medication for about four days.
12728,"I know that it's not real and that when the medication kicks in, I'll be better."
12729,im taking an axiety medicine that helps and ive started an anti depressant.
12730,"I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depression a year and a half ago, but I hated the meds and my psychiatrist, I told everyone that I'll be okay I just need time."
12731,I don't know how I even survived without the somewhat helpful medicine I was on.
12732,I can only hope that the next medicine works better and has less side effects.
12733,"Luckily, new me called in on Monday and worked very little most of this week, napping throughout the day, taking medicine and going to bed early."
12734,"* taken medication in the past, didn't help, doing group therapy now

So I finally landed a job I think I MIGHT be able to hold down for more than a few days."
12735,"It's lessened with medication, but I'm hoping I'll pull out of it and my body will just go back to normal."
12736,"Thing is, it'll still be a couple of weeks before I get put on medication, and a few more for my body to adapt."
12737,"26F, cymbalta 60

I've been on Duloxetine (Cymbalta) 60mg for about 5 months, after failing other meds for 4 months prior."
12738,I have a few reasons for wanting off meds.
12739,"First and foremost, I've been seeing a therapist for the past 5 months with great success, and I've begun a regular exercise program, which has helped a lot on top of the meds and therapy."
12740,"I think I'm well enough with my therapy and exercise to talk to my doctor about cycling off my meds, at least so I can enjoy my anniversary in the middle of March."
12741,I'm not on any medications.
12742,"(Plus a handful, no literally, they fill my hand, of other various meds....)

Anyways, finally last week, a combination of hormonal craziness, therapy cutting deeply (yay tears!"
12743,"They are well aware of my anxiety issues, and the many changes in medications I have gone through in this past year."
12744,"They were aware of the conditions/medications leading to issues, but no formal requests for accomodations (other than exemption from the one duty) were made on my part."
12745,"Between medication, the support of my parents (who were absolutely saintly about the whole thing, even though they must have been going to pieces inside), and an inborn stubbornness, I got through it."
12746,There are troubles with the medication.
12747,I recently got diagnosed with General Anxiety disorder and have been trying to start dealing with it naturally before I turn to medication.
12748,"Anybody else dealing with this, battling medication?"
12749,"I would have a panic attack a day and need to medicate when I began to feel one coming on, if I didn't down my meds quick enough the panic attack would be so overwhelming I would have to take double the dose and lay in bed or a calm/quiet environment."
12750,Now I have to take my medication spaced out throughout the day as prophylaxis to prevent attacks from coming.
12751,"I spend most of my time at home studying, and when I'm home I don't have any issues with panic attacks as long as I take my medication around 9-10AM and again around 12-1PM."
12752,I'll admit that graduate school is more stress than I've had to deal with in my entire life but I really want to fight this beast and take less meds.
12753,I can tell it's an anxiety thing because I can eat if I take a double dose of medication before meals or if I go out on the town with friends and have a few drinks(I do NOT mix my medication with alcohol) I can happily enjoy pizza or whatever afterwards.
12754,I take low doses of most of my medications because I seem to be very sensitive to them.
12755,"When I try to bring up these issues with my psychiatrist, she doesn't have any real solutions for me except to try different medications."
12756,"She doesn't offer any explanations on which medications would be a good fit for me, trying to have a conversation with her about the difference between SSRIs and SSNIs is like pulling teeth."
12757,Does anyone have any experience with difficult psychiatrists or different types of medications for anxiety that might work for me?
12758,"In recent years I have been able to function OK without meds or weekly therapy, while in college."
12759,"so asking for help is a no go, because they'd think I'm over dramatic, or whiny, or a drama queen or trying to scam meds or something."
12760,"I take my medicine, but I also am prescribed ADD medication."
12761,I was supposed to be asleep already but instead my ADD medication gave me an anxiety attack  that's lasted for two hours so far.
12762,"Go away, I hate taking medicine for you every night, I hate the fact that you're in my life and that you're invading every single aspect of my life slowly, one by one."
12763,"I go to therapy, however I just started and no, I'm not on any medications."
12764,"So far I have tried these meds: Escitalopram(gave up after ~6months of no positive effects), Venlafaxine(gave up after ~3 months of no positive effects), Wellbutrin(currently on my 6th week), Mirtazepam(for sleep, 1st week), Quiteapin (only for a couple of days, for sleep), Imovane (for sleep, 1st week, wont get another prescription)."
12765,"I am getting real sick of these meds like Escitalopram, Venlafaxine and Wellbutrin."
12766,"I'm not bashing on medication, I'm just asking if anyone has ever actually felt better while using them."
12767,I still don't think I feel any differently now than when I wasn't on medication.
12768,I'm thinking of calling my therapist at home for permission to up my meds.
12769,"So I've been living with serious social anxiety for the past 3 years finally decided to get some help, I'm on medication, teaching myself CBT and have finally left the house and started talking to old friends."
12770,I never thought Id be prescribed medication since my anxiety symptoms are only really bad when Im trying to make friends or get to know people on a personal level.
12771,Going to University has my anxiety pretty managable as long as I didnt talk to anyone but I didnt want to have a lonely University expierence and opted in to try some meds to relieve some social anxiety and get to know people and make friends.
12772,I also feel like Ive failed but I think a large part of that thought process is because I have a slight taboo of medication.
12773,"Then there's this other thing, my breath, I can't breath whenever I'm anxious, it's literally suffocating I try to go to the balcony and take deep breaths but it doesn't help and I'm becoming hysterical...I read someone asking if meds can help them, I thought of asking too, 'cos I just can't take this anymore, I always shake, I can't type on my phone because the screen is small and my hands shake too much to type on it, sometimes I can't even hold a book because I'll drop it because of all the shaking."
12774,"I don't know what to do, can meds fix this?"
12775,"EDIT: The first time I went to get help my mom found me a psychiatrist and he just started lecturing about the difference between psychiatrist and psychologist and started saying that he can't give me drugs because i'm under 18, so will it be a problem to treat my shaking with meds?"
12776,"Recently he's been open to the idea of taking medication, but I'm hesitant to him taking anything and getting a dependence off of it (just from my personal experience taking medication for a mental disorder)."
12777,"I'm open minded however and because I'm just biased to medication, if anyone could weigh in and offer any advice on whether it's worth taking or not, I'd be happy to hear."
12778,I feel like unless I start taking medication he will leave me.
12779,"Things have gotten tough and through seeing a short-term psychologist, group therapy, and trying different medications (benzodiazepines work best for me), I have finally become able to control the monstrous state of panic that I used to let control my life."
12780,"I don't take medicine anymore for the most part, unless I'm feeling extra anxious that day."
12781,However sometimes panic attacks do happen and i am grateful for my prescribed medicine.
12782,"I don't think I need to be on my medicine regularly (I haven't been for months), but I don't want to have my doctor take me off the prescription entirely because it really is there for me when I need it immensely."
12783,"Having parents who ""don't believe in ADD,"" going to a competitive school that frowns upon such medicine and is very scrutinizing of it, and even my own prescription-happy psychiatrist has said ""No."
12784,I have tried different medications and they have made my thoughts so much clearer.
12785,"Once I get up and take my meds and go get an hour of sun I feel much better, but when I wake up life feels pointless and just doing those two things is so hard."
12786,I have been neglecting to take my thyroid medicine.
12787,I am sure that the fact that I have not been diligent about my medicine for a year and a half has really affected me.
12788,I have been researching ways to overcome my problems without relying on modern medicine and I wanted to see if anyone can shed some light on the effects of marijuana on someone with anxiety?
12789,"Hello Anxiety Gang,

I ran out of 2 medicines yesterday (or the day before?)"
12790,"After I graduated (and it didn't look like I was getting a job anytime soon), I decided that I was ready to go off of my medication, being back at home and with the support of family and friends."
12791,I am proud to say that I have been off of my medication for a month now and have been feeling very good.
12792,"Before I went on medication I would have really bad episodes, and this is only about 1/1000th of those, so I am not sure if these quick flashes are signs of improvement on my part or what."
12793,"I had fatigue earlier today after hearing about medication side effects, but not anymore."
12794,I understand that a psychiatrist is a medical doctor and would probably prescribe some medication while a psychologist would probably help me through therapy.
12795,"Are psychiatrist good at therapy, or they just prescribe medication according to your symptoms?"
12796,"EDIT: just to add, i'm currently in cbt, no meds"
12797,I don't really know how I feel about the medication.
12798,"I have seen therapists, and a general hold on my issues with anxiety that I've chose to live medication free."
12799,"Also worth noting that I am on medication for anxiety which I took before each test, so I have not idea why I am still doing poorly..."
12800,I'm open to medication but want to also try to take care of myself in other ways.
12801,I already am on medication which was working well.
12802,I have been on this mix since 2008 and have been on medicine since late 2006/2007.
12803,The medication was a success.
12804,"(I might not get replies on time) 

My boyfriend (a non-doctor) thinks it's irresponsible of my psychiatrist to prescribe me a benzodiazepine for sleep issues when I'm trying to quit pharmaceutical medicine."
12805,I want to be medication free because I feel it's the best option for me right now but I'm willing to try the Ativan.
12806,"Since we've been together, she recently lapsed into a big ""rut""
We've been going to therapy, she's on medication (for the first time ever) she's been officially diagnosed with Major Depression and Anxiety Disorder, but things have been getting better than they were right before we decided to go get help."
12807,"**Some background:** Many years on different medications, with different forms of therapy of varying effectiveness."
12808,"**On meds:** I tapered off of my medication and have been dealing with it alright so far, but have certainly noticed how my moods are more unpredictable (a lot of tearing up especially!)."
12809,"I have had to really tune in to what I am feeling and thinking at all times, as I have not been relying on medication to dull the anxiety for me."
12810,"I've struggled with anxiety on and off, most of my life, although it's only been about six months or so since I've been taking medication/getting treatment."
12811,"Though I had some minor setbacks with my anxiety over the years, my medication (Celexa) kept my head above water."
12812,I don't use meds and I don't want to.
12813,"If I don't take my medicine before a job interview, my heart will be pounding super fast, I'll get cold sweats, I'll feel light headed because I can't seem to breathe and thoughts rush through my brain like a highway."
12814,So now I take my medicine whenever I know I'm going to be in a nervous or scared situation.
12815,All of this makes me afraid of getting more and more addicted to my medicine and not being able to do anything without them anymore.
12816,I decided to switch my medication for something more effective.
12817,Is anyone here taking medications for anxiety and has found them effective?
12818,I've had my up's and down's throughout high school and collage and I am on medication.
12819,I've never taken any meds in my life.
12820,"I understand the medicine doesn't truly work until after a few weeks, but these introductory side-effects are almost enough to make me stop already."
12821,Anyways should I try using it again tomorrow with no anxiety meds or just stop all together?
12822,I'm not a very good person about medication and pills and often times I give myself an anxiety attack after taking any.
12823,"In that time I have become very suicidal, I have checked myself into a hospital, I have spent sometime in a day / in-patient program, and I have seen my therapist and gotten medication."
12824,I might call my primary care doctor and see if they can prescribe some more or a different medication.
12825,My brother is on several meds for severe anxiety disorder and my father started suffering from anxiety at right around the same age as I am (late 30's).
12826,"I have previously been opposed to medication, I guess I felt like I was strong enough to sort it out through other means, but I do not want to go to a talk therapist again."
12827,"Do you think a doctor would be opposed to this ""gimme the meds"" attitude?"
12828,"I didn't use the meds tag because I'm not really looking for advice on what med to use, I'll leave that up to the doc for now."
12829,"I'm really interested in seeing a doctor though about getting a formal diagnosis and seeking further treatment (I want to try medication, though I guess I'm still open minded about therapy... maybe)."
12830,"I'd rather try medication for a bit now, as I had a bit of a bad experience with therapy."
12831,Trying to imagine myself much more in control and anxiety conscious in the future without the meds was insanely difficult to comprehend a year ago.
12832,"But at the same time, my brother and mother are both on medication for anxiety related disorders so maybe there's a family history there as well."
12833,I've been off my medication for a while.
12834,Go back to my medication where I'm a more functional human that lacks any real joy and feels like a hollow shell?
12835,"or Stay off my medications, find a little joy here and there, be irritable, and deal with sleepless nights?"
12836,I want to see if I'm a good candidate for medication or possibly get a referral to a psychiatrist.
12837,"I was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago and although medication and therapy helped a little bit, I still found myself struggling A LOT."
12838,"It made me think of a friend from high school who took medication for anxiety, and then I got really suspicious and even more worried."
12839,"To get through college I was on a heavy medication, which I dropped once I graduated."
12840,It's causing things to spiral out of control for me but in my opinion going back on that particular medication is not an option.
12841,I've been in counseling for depression / anxiety for 10 years and I am on a couple medications.
12842,"I have had periods of more calm, I was given exercises by a pelvic floor physio, psychological help, some bladder relaxing medicine (which only works for a very short period and does bring some relief)."
12843,I've been taking my anxiety meds more than usual and masturbating more than usual to try to distract my mind.
12844,"* My parents (who I live with, and who would be driving me to/from my appointments) are on this huge ""natural cures are superior to Western medicine"" kick right now, and I'm afraid they'll disapprove of me seeing my gastroenterologist."
12845,Is medication the answer?
12846,"I've tried several medications over the past six or so years, but nothing has really had any effect from what I saw."
12847,"I'm on a couple things now which may actually be helping, but I honestly can't tell the difference between the medicine and life experiences right now."
12848,Maybe the medicine helped or maybe the change in lifestyle helped.
12849,The only thing that helps is taking a large(r) does of meds.
12850,"I am living with less anxiety, depression, and self hate because of medication."
12851,"However, the worst way this manifests is whenever I have to take medicine of any kind, except for maybe advil."
12852,"She's on new meds for anxiety (which take weeks to kick in, she’s been on them for a few days), and we give those to her about an hour before bed."
12853,"""I feel like a burden""

""I hear voices in my head""

""I think about hurting myself and here's how I'd do it""

 	""OK, you put the sharp things away, here's another way I'd do it""

		“You hid the medication?"
12854,"Her meds were adjusted and she was sent home, but tonight (4-5 days after inpatient) said that she thought she needed to go back inside for more ""work""."
12855,I've just passed a week on the medication and have been smoking weed all throughout and haven't noticed anything yet.
12856,"I didn't tell anyone about my anxiety until around the time I left school and since then i've tried medication and therapy, neither of which have made any difference."
12857,"Not so much in how I subjectively feel - honestly, the Effexor makes me feel very jittery and unfocused thus far - but my IBS has basically resolved itself since starting the meds, which suggests that something's working!"
12858,"Anyone else had similar effects on these meds, and if so, did they resolve as you adjusted to the meds?"
12859,"And now, a year later, I am on meds, which help me so much, but I am already getting a ton of anxiety from thinking about what this year is going to be like."
12860,"I've got serious inattentive ADD issues, I've tried focus exercises but I'm afraid the medication will be necessary to at least focus so I can get through the semester."
12861,"TL;DR Points:

* Husband is dealing with anxiety/depression 
* Current meds: Viibryd, Adderall, &amp; Lorazepam 
* On intermittently leave (FMLA) from work but hasn’t been back in almost a full month due to him not being able to deal with negative co-workers (I think it may be something more but he doesn’t want to talk about it) *Our funds are running dry 
* Can't afford a therapist 
* What else can I do to remain supportive and help him go back to work/make a new move job-wise?"
12862,He's back on his meds and although he claims they are helping with everything (I do see a noticeable difference as well) he still won't go back to work.
12863,"Personally, I feel like my anxiety could be controlled with medication and the more I read about it, the more I feel like that's the right answer."
12864,Anxiety runs in my family and I've seen medication work wonders for family members.
12865,"Yes, I was diagnosed by a professional, and I have been seeing a variety of different therapists over the course of 10 years, taking medication, etc."
12866,"I've been on medication for a while, upping my dose whenever I feel like it isn't working correctly, and trying to incorporate grounding techniques or techniques to distract myself."
12867,Recently I was given new medication Oxazepam 15MG (For Serax).
12868,Yet I don't want to take medication at the same time.
12869,So should I take the medication or should I try to tough it out?
12870,"I feel way better with it, but I don't want to be on medication at the same time..."
12871,I haven't seen any doctors yet and I would like to try with some natural automedication without side effects now.
12872,"I have been feeling pretty ""on the go"" ever since I started taking abilify-- I don't know if this is incidental or the actual medication."
12873,"I'm on prozac for social anixety, one of my roommates is taking like 4 different medications for anxiety, ocd, a sleeping disorder, and panic attacks, and the other two have never been to therapy or anything before but they clearly have a great deal of anxiety."
12874,"I have been on so many medications this past year, it makes my head spin."
12875,"Following a major depressive episode earlier this year, I pulled myself out of that dark place with the help of meds, lifestyle changes, and a good support group."
12876,"If so, are there any medications I can take to make them stop?"
12877,"The days are ok but the nights, without the meds are real bad."
12878,I have been on medication which has been upped recently (Lamotrigine 275 mg and 60 mg Cymbalta).
12879,"Let me be clear, I have no problem with prozac or any other similar medications and I have never had any negative side effects."
12880,I often wonder if prescription medication would help me manage my high anxiety situations.
12881,"would think of me for turning to medication to deal with anxiety, particularly because I am typically the calmer one in our relationship."
12882,"I can't sleep without sleeping medication and have lost over 10 kg, If my new psych doesn't know what it is, I feel that I'm only going to get worse."
12883,I don't know much about anxiety and anxiety breakdowns but I know she a) takes meds and b) went to a therapist.
12884,I am currently seeing 2 specialists in the psychiatric branch of medicine in parallel with my regular physician and a support group.
12885,"I powered through the last two days, and as soon as I took the medication again I was back kicking."
12886,"Crazy how that works... Nauzene, cold medicine, fish oil, and lots of soup really helped me get along."
12887,"I was thinking of trying L-Theanine, but I'm on other medications, like antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers."
12888,Recently it has been getting quite severe so i decided to try meds.
12889,"My SO has been on medication for anxiety for a long time, but recently has been experiencing a possible side effect of lowered libido."
12890,He suggested medication and a counselor.
12891,"I told him I wasn't ready for meds yet, and he was comfortable with that but still strongly encouraged a therapist."
12892,"I've been on medication for about a month now for social anxiety and while it's helped an immense amount, I'm not to the point where I'm functioning like a ""normal"" person."
12893,I have just started to take medication but still I have these out bursts almost daily now.
12894,"Recently, despite the medication the panic attacks and anxiety is coming back."
12895,I'm seeing my psychiatrist this week to see if I should adjust meds.
12896,"I have tried many ways to get my anxiety under control, none which have had any success and believe I've come to the point where I have to resort to medication, but I don't know if I can afford expensive prescriptions."
12897,"I've been prescribed three different medications, but don't want to take any of them."
12898,"I've never had good experiences with meds, and since I've overcome anxiety before I feel confident I can do it again."
12899,"It took a couple of weeks for the doctors to give me the correct medication but I was also offered citalopram, but skeptical about the effects I rejected it and took temazepam instead to help me sleep."
12900,I stopped the medication but felt well enough and did all my exams.
12901,I feel my life isn't that bad and that I shouldn't feel like I do and medicine will only give me dependancies on medication to make me feel happy.
12902,"I felt pathetic about crawling to the doctor for help, like I should be able to come out of this myself but with the constant background feeling of nervousness and the fact that this problem never seems to fully go away so I felt I had no option but to turn to medicine."
12903,"I need help now, I have a psychologist appointment next Wednesday, but I need to get back on medication quickly."
12904,I have GAD and panic disorder and am on meds for those.
12905,"I am going on a bit but my main concern about anxiety therapy or medication is that I can't see it making the issues that I do stress about going away, they won't get resolved unless i act on them and as long as they are there I will always fret on them."
12906,"I've been on many, many medications and am on 3 right now."
12907,"Nothing seems to have helped as far as medications go, so I am trying to find a Skype psychologist."
12908,Am I expecting too much from meds?
12909,The medications I've suffered through and the therapists that have quit on me.
12910,"When I first started meds, my mind had felt so clear and the world hadn't felt quite so scary."
12911,"I'm on meds and in therapy, but my parents antagonize me for not trying hard enough to make my anxiety go away."
12912,I went to a psych for a one stop shop of someone to talk to and for medicine if needed.
12913,I at first wanted to conquer this without the use of medicines but it's looking overwhelming now.
12914,"Anyway, I know nothing of anxiety medications."
12915,"So I met with a psychiatrist and we agreed that I would go all out on my medication the first few weeks (I was on 40mg citalopram, which was raised to 60, and I would take 0.5mg xanax every day)."
12916,"About 7 years ago I had some seriously bad things happen in my life, and that's when I started taking medication."
12917,"I have stopped taking my meds, because they had developed a lovely side effect of making me sleep 12 hours a day and I couldn't do that."
12918,"The meds helped, but that time wasn't very joyfull, because those pills made me  dull and emotionless."
12919,And the meds helped to keep overall calmness.
12920,"The progress was signifficant, and while the anxiety after quitting meds increased alot, for the very first time i was starting to have a different view of life, and i started to react differently to my anxiety."
12921,"I went to my doctor, but he said it's something that happens to many people at my age and that medication could help, but he did not suggest it (THANK GOD)."
12922,I took no medications at all.
12923,"Today I am physically sick, shakey, hot and cold, and almost passed out once or twice (granted I haven't eaten in 2 days), and just want to make it through this crap so these meds can kick in and I can start healing and making my life better."
12924,"My anxiety disorder has taken a turn for the worst and I cant afford meds or therapy, and the only anxiety books I have found have been too much I need simple quick and natural ways to help while experiencing a panic attack."
12925,At one point she suggested I see a medical doctor for a prescription for meds.
12926,I feel like it may very well be time for me to seek medication if a phone call can send me into such a state.
12927,The truth is I really don't want to take meds.
12928,I have friends who are trying to find the right medication or combo and sometimes they actually feel worse.
12929,I would love to hear about some other people's experience with starting medication for their anxiety and if anyone else struggles with the phone causing them extreme anxiety.
12930,My daughter has severely high anxiety imo along with ADHD and the meds she just recently switched to are making it worse.
12931,Currently I'm treating my bad attacks with Ativan because I prefer to not be on a daily medication if I can avoid it.
12932,"I have never been on medication, and I do not have the desire to start medication."
12933,I would just like to know if anyone else has seen improvements with anxiety without medication using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
12934,"I have a lot of faith in myself because I have managed my anxiety pretty well without the help of therapy or medication, but right now, since I am away from home, I could use a little help."
12935,"It l was a crazy year I went through till medication finally evened out my anxiety to make me feel normal again with my memories, but I feel I need answers as to how this happened."
12936,"He then told me they are permanent and there is nothing I or he can do.he then starts telling me because I'm worried about stretch marks, he wants me to take medication because I used to be on medication for anxiety."
12937,"However, I went on and off anxiety medicine with my doctor up in school we both decided I was better not taking it."
12938,But the guy kept telling me I was way too anxious about stretch marks and kept lecturing me to take medication.
12939,He starts telling me because of the way I answered his question (I said one arm was more flexible than the other) he wants me on medication for anxiety.
12940,he kept hounding me that I need to go on meds but wouldn't talk to me about the stretch marks!
12941,Maybe I'm a little insecure due to stretch marks but I don't see how that makes me need immediate medication.
12942,Which I found really rude because I WENT IN to the doctor's office for help and we both decided medicine wasn't the right decision.
12943,I felt really bullied by this guy and I think it is extremely unfair to say because I answered certain questions a certain way I need medication.
12944,I asked him on what medical basis could he tell me I need medication and he said it's because I worry about stretch marks and if I am not worrying about stretch marks I'll worry about something else.
12945,Should I go on meds or was this doctor an asshole?
12946,"I'm an adult, I have a career, I got myself off meds."
12947,Has anyone had any success overcoming these sort of symptoms without medication?
12948,"The meds helped my depression and agoraphobia, but I couldn't handle the anxiety well other than with small doses of xanax to curb the panic attacks."
12949,"I'm on new meds to help with the anxiety, but they aren't doing a ton."
12950,"I never stuck with the medications because I was a dumb teenager who felt they changed me into someone I didn't like (namely a bubbly, airheaded, person)."
12951,"I'm going to take her recommendations to heart: get out of the house more and get involved in a group somehow, get more exercise (since I desperately need it and I know, even though I am overweight/obese, I feel better after I exercise) in the form of swimming 3 times a week while my sister has afternoon classes at the University, take my dog for a walk at least twice a week, take the medication she prescribed me, and not weigh myself every day since weight fluctuations have been bringing on the anxiety and the negative thoughts in my head."
12952,"Alright so, to keep it short: I was on a medication for about 2 1/2 years, and recently decided to get weened off."
12953,"After fighting it for so long, fighting the stigma and what people would think of me being on the medication, thinking about how all of my friends aren't on any psych meds, I called my psychiatrist today and finally got a prescription."
12954,"Prior to getting off of the medication, my anxiety was relatively at the range of acceptable, and I would do well around others, amazingly actually."
12955,"For some reason, I'm having such a hard time shaking the fact that so many ""normal"" people I know aren't on meds, even my two brothers, who've had little trouble with social anxiety, or anxiety in general."
12956,"(It also probably stems from my two old roommates, both of which talked mad shit about the third for being on medication."
12957,Only problem with that is that I hate the way medicine makes me feel.)
12958,"My mom is an anxiety medicine addict who was recently cut off so she's no use to me and my dad's a narcissist, so naturally, my problems don't exist and are only in my head."
12959,"My psychiatrist said it's very common that people are able to successfully retire from these meds, so I do have good hopes of being able to live a normal and SSRI free life some point."
12960,"ANYWAY, I'm going to take some medication to help me sleep (gravol, probably, an anti-nauseate), but I just want to fix this bloody thing now."
12961,She has meds and they work perfectly but ironically she has anxiety about over-medicating.
12962,"My psychiatrist is amazing, I've been seeing him for 2+ years and he is *very* well respected, and at this point and with my panic attacks that end in me fainting, he trusts me with my meds and shit."
12963,"I've been stockpiling what extra meds I can, but it isn't going to be enough."
12964,"He did mention that, if we have to, we can have a family member airmail additional meds to me (not sure if legal, even if it's all under my name and valid US prescription etc."
12965,I have no idea what I'm going to do If I run out of my meds.
12966,My anxiety's gotten to the point where my 'normal' meds don't really do the trick anymore and it's terrifying me.
12967,The meds I got that were supposed to help me (truxal) are heavily fucking with me.
12968,"I want to help him find his solution, but I don't want to just throw prescription medicine at him and give him labels so he can feel like an outcast.I love my brother so much and I guess what I'm finally trying to say here is : has anyone heard of anybody going through this or have gone through this themselves."
12969,"((This metaphor would like to remind you that if during the time you are getting to a therapeutic level on medication you have thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself/others, or your symptoms get worse..."
12970,Transitioning meds sucks.
12971,On a more helpful note: what has helped you during medication transitions?
12972,"Background: been diagnosed with depression/anxiety since I was 12, medications starting 18, dropped out of college (United States) at 22 due to psychological burden, and back in school (part-time, part-time work) in my late 20's now."
12973,"I brushed it off, but knew I wanted to talk to my doctor about my recent anxiety since I had only been taken off medication a little less than a year."
12974,Should I get medication?
12975,"Stock up on your meds, if you take them."
12976,Now would also be a good time to check ALL of your medications to remove anything which has expired.
12977,I'm go to the doctor today to make sure there's nothing wrong but I'm probably going to get some sort of medication.
12978,"I'm 16, what medication would I probably get?"
12979,Should I get medication or see a therapist?
12980,Being given a low dose of a medication has cleared my mind considerably.
12981,"While I was able to focus on many things on my mind all the time before taking meds, I can't exactly say I can particularly ""focus."""
12982,"(I do have ADD that I am currently not taking any meds for, maybe thats why)."
12983,"For background, yes, I've taken meds, seen doctors, tried everything."
12984,I've consulted a doctor regarding the scalp condition but I refuse to take medication for the anxiety itself.
12985,"I went on medication and when I felt I was doing OK, I came off it and it got even worse, then from what I assume was the last of the SSRI leaving my system, depression set it."
12986,I'm not on any meds and don't see a therapist.
12987,I was diagnosed and started medication around 19.
12988,I have tried several medications and am currently on Celexa.
12989,I started medication last Tuesday and my psychiatrist said to take 5 mg (split the pill) for a week.
12990,"To be honest, I've never felt comfortable about medication, so I told her that I wouldn't want to do meds."
12991,And it would be much appreciated if you gave me some insight into other meds.
12992,"2) Hence, medication without therapy will not provide help in every case, because pills will not change your character, they will not give you the tool for controlling your emotions."
12993,I did not use any medicine.
12994,"If you are interested in methods which helped me to get rid of these diseases please read my article, how to get rid of panic attacks without medication."
12995,"http://nperov.com/health/how-to-get-rid-panic-attacks-without-medication/

Did my advice help somebody to get rid of panic attacks?"
12996,"It's kinda stupid, and while I don't think it's something that needs medicine for, since I don't usually dwell on it and these thoughts are actually quite rare, they're still annoying when I just want to talk to some friends!"
12997,"I know it's possible, but it started alot after then the meds started with their treatment."
12998,Should I look at trying to get a prescription for anti-anxiety medications or what?
12999,"I've tried medicine, therapy, nutrition, chiropractic care, journaling...."
13000,I've never really felt brain zaps before but I do know they can be common with SSRIs and anxiety medication.
13001,"The last few months I've been working on meds, upping dosages, and weaning off."
13002,is it the meds?
13003,"I went to the local student health center for sleep medication (doxepin), and it worked for maybe two weeks then it stopped."
13004,"I wanted Welbutrin,  but he suggested Strattera since it worked in a different manner, as in it isn't a stimulant like other meds."
13005,"I am so afraid to start meds, though."
13006,I love studying medicine but get so uptight when it comes to facing clinical examinations.
13007,I'm tempted to see a doctor about it again because I feel like I can't face going back to medicine.
13008,"I see a therapist and she is talking about putting me on medication, we didn't talk the specifics but I mentioned it to my parents who are extremely anti medication and think I just need to find a way to ""deal with it"" like ""normal people"" do."
13009,I think it will really help me if I get put on a medication because my anxiety gets me to the point where I get so physically ill and i'm extremely uncomfortable in even small situations.
13010,"So like.. for the average person, meds work fine."
13011,I don't think I need to go to the ER but I am wondering if anyone else is really sensitive to meds and if I fucked up big time
13012,"I have always been fat as I have been depressed most of my life &amp; the combination of weight-gaining antidepressant medications, emotional eating &amp; bullying has made my weight a continual challenge &amp; constantly impedes my sense of self worth."
13013,No medication.
13014,"If that means having a little back up from some meds, so be it."
13015,He initially refused to give me some meds because he is very much aware of the implications.
13016,"So now I'm divided, it kind of helped me yesterday night but now I'm really panicky and fearful about possible sudden death because of sleep medicine."
13017,The doctor prescribed my anti-anxiety meds and had me schedule an apt.
13018,I never took the meds because I was scared to take them and I canceled my apt with the psychiatrist.
13019,"I went in and out a couple of hospital holds, but all they did was give me medicine, and nothing helped."
13020,"I've been on several different meds before and they've helped, but since getting pregnant two years ago I've not been on anything and been able to cope."
13021,Anything to avoid while on the medication?
13022,I'm planning on continuing therapy while on the medication and am hoping it will take the edge off of the obsessive thoughts so I can implement what I've learned cognitively into everyday function.
13023,Any other info about the medication you feel is important would also be greatly appreciated
13024,"And then, I forgot to take my SSRI medication yesterady."
13025,Thankfully I have this medication.
13026,I may believe the medication has lost its effectiveness because I forgot to take it on time.
13027,"*Note: My Depression is now well controlled with medication, and no longer interferes with my daily life, though I still have the occasional ""bad day."""
13028,"I'm on medicine that helps me, but I don't want to be."
13029,"Instead, my anxiety is now surrounding thoughts and decisions about the medications."
13030,"I'm typing this because I want a second opinion, sometimes I think it would be better if I just dealt with my slew of problems without the medicine."
13031,"It helped me significantly with my anxiety, but I gained almost 20 pounds from the medication that I still can't get off with proper diet and exercise."
13032,These thoughts about having to take another medicine like this has my anxiety through the roof 24/7.
13033,"I don't know if I should give up on medication and deal with my constant thoughts and panic by myself, or get fat like my doctors apparently want me to."
13034,"Then I thought the medicine was on automatic refill at my pharmacy and I ended up missing a few days, and suffered some of the worst panic attacks I had ever experienced."
13035,"The doctor said these side effects are normal, especially when first starting the medication."
13036,"When the medication finally starts working, will I have an easier time calming myself?"
13037,"Been misdiagnosed a few times, tried all kinds of meds ect ect
Several years ago I developed agoraphobia and was helped through it by a very good/kind psychologist, she then diagnosed me with PTSD."
13038,I have not been seeing a doctor for the last 5 or so years and on no medication.
13039,So I am just starting to attempt to stop taking prozac to see how I feel without meds and because eventually I would like to have kids.
13040,I'm just feeling really hopeless that I will have to be on meds forever.
13041,"I'm starting to lean towards taking medication to help it but know it is not always easy to start an anti-depression or anti-anxiety medication or find the right one for said person,and quite nervous to start trying them out... any advice or encouraging words to help?"
13042,"So basically I have agoraphobia, and I'm looking at different types of medication (I've been stuck home for a month, had to quit my job)."
13043,"I have a therapist that I have been seeing who is close to my home, but she isn't a doctor and cannot prescribe medication."
13044,"it actually made it slightly worse so I went to bed and had a dream about a girl I liked who was a boyfriend and who I've had at least one dream about every month for about two years (I'm not sure why since I'm too fucking anxious to date anyone anyways) then I woke up and felt terrible and then far worse when I realized I have school tomorrow so I rolled out of bed and had another realization that it was later than I thought and I still hadn't taken my medicine (passionflower extract) so I started panicking (as you may have guessed) and frantically looking for the bottle and by the time I found it and took it it was WAY later then usual so now I'm sitting here feeling tremendously shitty, inadequate, depressed, and fearful of the panicked state that I'm about to have to endure."
13045,"In a good relationship now, getting married this summer, but my anxiety reached a point last year where I had to quit uni, get on meds and start seeing a counsellor."
13046,"The meds helped some, now I don't feel crushingly depressed (never been suicidal, just felt like my brain was trying to suffocate me), but still can't face leaving my house."
13047,"But, all today I have been feeling very, very anxious, more than I have since I started the meds."
13048,Just aftermath of the panic attack or is it a sign I might need to try a higher dose of meds/a different medication?
13049,This is the first time I have ever been on medication so I am not really sure what I should perceive this as.
13050,I stopped taking the meds by my sophmore year.
13051,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, from medications to hospital stays."
13052,I recently decided to go off my meds after being on SSRIs for a solid 12 years.
13053,I started withdrawing from meds in June and have been completely med-free for about 6 weeks.
13054,I remember feeling this way as a child which was why I was put on medication in the first place (I couldn't get through a day at school etc).
13055,I am considering going back on meds because while I am functional...I am not happy.
13056,"I've had issues with anxiety for about 12 years now, and for a while now I've had success in preventing and using methods to diminish how hard the attacks are; to the point I was able to wean off of my (latest) anxiety medication."
13057,"I am thinking that I might need to go on medication, since therapy alone isn't helping."
13058,And I don't know anything about anxiety medication.
13059,"I'm going to be scheduling a doctor appointment soon, and I honestly do think medication would benefit me."
13060,I know I should be on some sort of meds but I hate that thought.
13061,I hate taking all this medication bc I takes feel out of it and weird all the time.
13062,Am i just having a rough couple of days or has my medication stopped working?
13063,"As a child I have been drug up and down stairs, beat beyond recognition, had my stomach pumped because the only food within reach was in the medicine cabinet, watched my mom black out and try to hurt herself, and have been in protective services numerous times."
13064,"I thought I could deal with It on my own (which I did for a bit) but with college and other stress factors, I am starting to consider medication."
13065,"I want to find proper help, but I can't afford it, and I'm scared of medications."
13066,"I have been going to therapy, and it is somewhat helpful, however we have been discussing maybe taking medicine."
13067,"I do not want to just jump to medicine, however, I am not sure what to do."
13068,"I also cannot get medicine without going though a psychiatrist, and all my counselor can do is refer me."
13069,"I do not have great insurance coverage, and I wonder if anxiety medicine is really worth all these steps to get because past the stressful situations I feel somewhat ok."
13070,I guess I just want some help and insight on anxiety medicine.
13071,"He was treated for depression (various types of medication, therapy with a lady he really liked) long before I knew him, eventually came off of medication to try to manage it on his own, and since then has done really well."
13072,"By that, I mean has been seeing someone to prescribe ADD medication, and just recently mentioned to her that he was feeling some increased anxiety and was interested in changing up his ADD medication, which they did."
13073,"He's also afraid that if he opens up too much, she'll want to take him off of the ADD medicine, and then he'll struggle more in school."
13074,I really don't want meds.
13075,"I don't really want to go on any medication, because accepting it and realizing that I can get through this has saved my ass so much and brought me a lot of new perspective and has rid me of some of my previous symptoms of anxiety."
13076,"**Negatives:**


* Difficulty with sleep (still working on it, but I take my medication in the evening)."
13077,"* Stomach Aches (small)

* Occasional surges of Anxiety/Panic, but I figure this is just my body adjusting through the meds."
13078,"That being said, I know getting on medication can be anxiety inducing and nerve racking, but it's worth a try, especially if your doctor is confident in its ability to help you."
13079,Does medication help at all with not having so many intrusive thoughts?
13080,"I have depression and anxiety, however I'm a bit nervous about taking medication and I wanted to know if Elavil helps or if anyone had bad/good side effects and results."
13081,"I've always thought I could figure this all out myself and didn't need meds, but I've recently started thinking it doesn't hurt to try."
13082,"My SO's mother whom is a head nurse specifically asked a clinical doctor to prescribe me this medication, and to my fortune has become the only medication that has actually worked for me and not against me (been taking it for a year)."
13083,"I'm 25, female, and currently not on any medication."
13084,"I've never been on medication for it &amp; I may have Herpes as a result of the abuse but haven't shown ""symptoms"" for about 2 years."
13085,Before I go in I want to read up on different medications so I know what to try and what not to try.
13086,Are there any that are more recommended than others or certain meds I should steer clear of?
13087,"Went to therapy, was on meds, etc."
13088,"I have been on medication before, and it never really seemed to help."
13089,"Psychologists haven't helped, medication hasn't helped, and now I'm lost and don't know how to fix this."
13090,"I forgot to refill my last prescription before it expired (how I managed to forget is beyond me, since running out of meds is one of my worst fears, see: addictive behavior 101) and I won't be able to see my doc until Tuesday at the very least, so I'm on my own until then."
13091,I'm a 20 year old girl and have been on antidepressants/anxi anxiety medication for around 5 years.
13092,I took my second dose of my medication and I feel better now.
13093,"When I was 12, I was put on a medication for my acid reflux and I was actually allergic to it."
13094,"I've never had any sort of anxiety medication before, I've just been dealing with this each day as it happens."
13095,"She suffers from some health problems herself, which are real, organ things which is bad but she copes with medicines."
13096,"I was a sobbing mess the whole time and I'm sure that the cops thought I was trying to get out of something, and they wouldn't give me my anxiety medication to calm down."
13097,"I saw psychologists and psychiatrist, I got on medication."
13098,The rest of my family is on medication and I've always prided myself on not needing to take any meds every day (other than birth control) but I've slowly realized that i need help and it all kind of came to a head in the past couple days.
13099,I really have not wanted to go on meds but I think I need to.
13100,Has anyone else been adamant about not being on an SSRI/other anxiety medicine and changed their minds?
13101,Ironically going on meds for anxiety is making my anxiety worse.
13102,I've been on some anti-anxiety medications for a few years.
13103,"I was at the point where I was just kind of tired of taking meds every morning, and thought that I could get it over with by cutting it off cold turkey, and getting over the side effects."
13104,"After about 2 weeks and feeling like the pain would never end, I caved and went back to taking my meds."
13105,"If your taking anxiety meds, for the love of god don't quit them cold turkey"
13106,"I take medicine for depression, yet I don’t feel a difference anymore."
13107,I make excuses not to change it because I am scared of the process of finding a new medicine or that I won’t find anything that works and will be aware of my helplessness.
13108,"My own dad told me that instead of taking medication for my depression, I should pray and God would take care of it."
13109,Also i should note that i usually don't have panic flair ups unless i'm stressed and i'm also on medication to help control it.
13110,Also I have been having some stomach discomfort after a take the medication.
13111,I changed meds a couple times and I am still on Lexapro even though I do not feel like it helps me as much as it should.
13112,"I'm currently on medications that are working fantastic, and am in cognitive behavioural therapy."
13113,"And yeah, meds and therapy are already in the picture."
13114,"Now to get to my full on rant


I started medication months ago."
13115,"Coincidentally, my medication should start taking effect in the next few weeks."
13116,Is she not available just so I don't have anxiety around her and can actually be myself once my medication kicks in and we go on dates?
13117,I'm starting to get adjusted to the medicine and I'm also sleeping better.
13118,I'm worried I will become dependent on my anxiety medicine.
13119,"But for the last 2 weeks I was a without meds and I was absolutely miserable train wreck having panic/anxiety attacks daily .I need this medicine to function at work properly (call center job) and function in life

Im just worried I will be dependent on it forever."
13120,Is it bad to need medicine?
13121,"What I'm asking is, is it OK to need medicine."
13122,"I'm new to taking medicine :/

I was also prescribed the generic of Prozac (Fluoxotine) 20 mg to take once a day, I assume that means in the morning...

Not sure it matters, but I'm taking Clonazepam temporarily."
13123,All I can do is just rant online because counseling didn't help and it's too late to get medication and have it work properly in time and I just.
13124,"Therapy hasn't ever helped, and I don't want to rely on a medicine, homeopathic or not."
13125,I have zero tolerance to this medication so I'm confused.
13126,She recommended over the counter sleeping medicine and scheduled other appointment for the first Saturday in March.
13127,"I don't know if it is due to the medication, or just due to the fact that I haven't been seeing my friends, but I have felt a bit depressed lately, which is an emotion I haven't felt since my mid teenage years."
13128,"I can understand being upset about things that were big fuck ups, but I obsess over small things like: words I wish I had said differently, or papers that I wrote late yet still turned in on time, and even really dumb things like accidentally bumping into someone in the hallway...

Not in therapy or on meds currently because of insurance issues, so I feel kind of alone in this."
13129,I was able to get help from programs to get my medication at reduced cost.
13130,Therapy along with medication has been a huge help for me.
13131,I really don't want to take meds for this because I'm a nationally competitive athlete and do not wish to have any meds influence my performance in any way.
13132,I started taking medication that doesn't help only a tiny bit but not enough.
13133,My doctor suggested that I could experiment with stopping the Paxil as I'm on another medication (Wellbutrin) that may be well enough  for handling the anxiety.
13134,He's been taking this dose of this medication for about 3 months now but has been on Citalopram for over a year.
13135,"Whenever we suggest changing the medication the doctor simply says to up the dose and my partner has to go along with it because we have NO clue whatsoever about what to ask for; saying ""this isn't working it think it might be time to try a new medication"" just isn't working and so i thought it best that at the next appointment we go in there prepared with the names of a few types of anxiety meds."
13136,I think i'm digressing a little bit here but the point of my post was to see if anybody could suggest the names of medication they've taken or take for anxiety that has worked for them.
13137,I understand that every medication works differently with each individual and we will bear that in mind when discussing with the doctor but we really need a starting point.
13138,"I've experimented with al sorts of supplements, have gone to therapy and even tried medication (currently on zoloft)."
13139,"But now with all my meds done, I'm back to my anxious self."
13140,"My boyfriend also expressed that he'd like to learn how to help me, maybe even talk to my therapist (who I see about once a month for social anxiety and bipolar disorder, as well as a psychiatrist who prescribes me meds)."
13141,"Only left the house four times (baring the occasional walk) in the past 5 months, which were only because I had to (saw doctor to get another medication script, saw my mum in hospital after her cancer surgery, managed to go to one of my psych appointments, and went to centrelink so I could finally get my measly $75 a fortnight)."
13142,I was just prescribed Ativan/lorazepam by my doctor as a temporary medication to take as needed (when I'm feeling really anxious) until I can get an appointment with a therapist and psychiatrist.
13143,"i take medication + go to therapy, but i find that i'm actually quite in love with a lot of aspects of my anxiety."
13144,Anyone else drank on meds related to anxiety/depressiona and what are your experiences?
13145,"I've been working with a therapist and while I've made great progress with coping skills, I can't help but think I'll never be in control unless I go back to medication."
13146,"It's not bad really..I was having anxiety because of work last week, but I went to the doc and got bloodwork done (for thyroid) and some meds for my anxiety again."
13147,I've been managing to function better lately because of some new meds but I'm having a hard time with this.
13148,I've been heavily pushing towards trying a new medication since I feel Zoloft just isn't the one for me.
13149,"However, with them both being SSRIs, I wonder if it has the chance to affect me a ton better than Zoloft, or if I should try another classification of meds next (ex SNRIs)."
13150,"For those of you who have had a ton of success breaking free from social anxiety, what meds helped contribute?"
13151,Haven't been able to fall asleep without medication for a month now.
13152,"The first few days I felt very strange, disconnected, but kept with the meds and then my days started to become more focused and I was not sweating the small things so much, my enery skyrocketed during the day and at work I feel great."
13153,"The meds I have tried were Lexapro and Zoloft, neither of which I took for the recommended time because I do not believe they work."
13154,"In my opinion, and not to offend anyone who uses/relies on them for help, I don't believe meds are any good."
13155,Like I've not had anxiety in about a month or two and was considering coming off the meds.
13156,"I don't know what to do I feel so sad, how can my medication go from working wonders to me feeling like this."
13157,Back and forth in my mind I often banter about whether or not I have severe enough anxiety that I would benefit from anxiety medicine.
13158,Too often I feel that doctors slap a label on people and feed them medicine without really checking to see if the person actually does have a disorder.
13159,Could it be true that maybe my anxiety could be defeated without medicine and that taking meds could be a cop out?
13160,"When I am with friends who have anxiety and I refuse to take medication, I refuse, I think it is like giving up - well, friends who do scream and say I do't really have it then."
13161,I told my mom about it who also suffers from anxiety(she is on medication for it) and she said it could just part of me being a teenager.
13162,"She says she doesn't think it is a brain tumor and prescribed me acne medication (ever since this anxiety disorder developed, I have also developed acne on my neck and back :/)."
13163,Fast forward to monday and now I am on a Beta Blocker to combat both the anxiety and blood pressure as well as some anti anxiety medicine.
13164,Is this normal for starting meds?
13165,I've had anxiety and depression for years now and have tried various medications with little success.
13166,"I haven’t been able to afford professional help and therefore have never seen anyone, have no official diagnosis, and have never been treated or taken any medication."
13167,"I went to a Depression Bipolar Support Alliance meeting once with my fiance’ and didn’t really like it…It was kinda scary which I can understand but everyone there was talking about their therapists and their medications and I felt like I didn’t belong or that they wouldn’t accept me if I didn’t have those things…
I’ve been having a very hard time with these things."
13168,"I was just wondering if you guys thought I should talk to my doctor about changing my Zoloft to a different medication or changing my dose, or if you think this is a problem that doesn't really have to do with the medication."
13169,Is this the best I can expect from the medicine?
13170,Ive decided Im going to stop taking all anxiety medications and deal with this through cognitive behavioral therapy but Ive been feeling like SHIT that last few days.
13171,"im not on any medication, back 10 years ago when this was a big issue I was on celexa/wellbutrin, but I would like to think that at this point in my life I should be able to take charge myself and control everything"
13172,"I chose not to go on medication, and take a more holistic path."
13173,"I am taking my meds like I'm supposed to, as prescribed."
13174,Who should I specifically talk to and what type of medication is most likely going to be prescribed to me?
13175,"I have taken medication in the past with success, but never refilled my prescription when it ended due to fear of looking like a drug addict."
13176,"I have bad anxiety, spent time on and off of meds, and have battled with alcohol and drugs."
13177,I've been eating benadryl like crazy and decongestants/cough medicine for my throat and it doesn't seem like it helps.
13178,"Then I wake up about 2-4 hours later with all those symptoms, get up, take more allergy meds, etc, and try to fall back asleep eventually if I can."
13179,"I'm currently on anti anxiety meds that slow me right down, but they don't help me get to sleep."
13180,"And no, I don't work for them or any other industry even remotely related to medicine/drugs/whatever, I just haven't tried any other place -- haven't needed to cuz the stuff works (for me)."
13181,I have never been on anxiety medication.
13182,I have been seeing a psychotherapist for changing around ADD/ADHD meds (the one that prescribes and diagnosis?
13183,"I ended up going to therapy (which did help with my recovery, please do seek professional help if you feel similarly), I turned down the medicine for personal reasons."
13184,I currently live without medication or therapy and neither are very financially accessible for me.
13185,I saw my doctor and got a referral to see someone about medication.
13186,I started feeling more negative side effects of the meds and stopped right away and saw my doctor about it.
13187,"I have anxiety, it used to be crippling to say the least but im slowly getting better on my own (no meds or therapist) but one thing I cant seem to shake is my breathing issues (hyperventilating)."
13188,"I was going to seek out some anxiety medication but I think my problem is deeper than that, I believe I may also have depression.."
13189,But i only realized this after a friend suggested I look into ADD meds before liking into finishing my AA and I actually took a good look at myself and my behavior.
13190,"This all started a month ago, and the meds are helping, some."
13191,"He's on strong meds, but still isn't quite 100%."
13192,I think it might've had something to do with the medication.
13193,Edit: I'm a 23 year old male that is not currently on medications of any kind.
13194,dont have any meds.
13195,Until this new dosage of meds kick in can y'all give me words of encouragement to help me realize that they don't care at all about what I'm doing and to help me not give a fuck?
13196,"All I want to do is just go with him to a park and just take deep breaths, after I've taken my allergy medication of course."
13197,"The T4-only medication (Eltroxin) was working great for me, until February when I was overmedicated."
13198,"and I just wanted to holler, ""WELL YEAH, because I was overmedicated on thyroid medication goddamnit!"""
13199,Raves: I went and saw a psychiatrist yesterday evening for a psych eval and meds.
13200,"I got some emergency Valium for short-term use until we solidify a long-term treatment plan, an anti-depressant, plus a blood-pressure medication that is used off label for treating nightmares in PTSD patients."
13201,"Diazepam (Valium) is also a skeletal muscle relaxant, so for the first time in the last year I can walk up the stairs without tearing up from the pain and my GI tract already feels better because I'm not flooding it with OTC pain meds."
13202,"He even sat down with me to make a list of possible medications that we can try in the future, and mapped out the best schedule for trying them in succession to ensure that he can justify coverage of the more expensive ones to my insurance company."
13203,"I'm not taking meds though, and never have done, so I was just wondering if maybe along with meds I might get the most help?"
13204,I can't afford therapy or medication.
13205,"Hi all, for a few months now I've been taking Venlafaxine (75mg), but I forgot to take my dose this morning and won't be able to take it until tomorrow afternoon at the earliest, meaning I'll have gone 48 hours without any medication."
13206,I must have done something wrong or I am the worst at filling out those tests..  what I did was that I took my meds before bedtime(100mg nortriptyline) and then 4 hours later in the middle of the night I couldn't sleep and my heart was pumping so hard because of the meds so I couldn't sleep so I filled out the test which I had postponed for a couple of weeks.
13207,Now I've switched medications for migraine prophylaxis to topamax  and I'm not supposed to be using nortriptyline anymore so nowadays it feels like I'm being in flight-or-fight mode all day and night and I have pretty bad insomnia.
13208,It is my understanding that he looks at problems and discusses with a psychiatrist for meds or do I just speak with my doctor or psychiatrist for meds?
13209,"I am finally on the right combo of meds, I have an amazing fiance, our own house and I haven't had a panic attack in 3 years."
13210,Should I just go for medication?
13211,"I've gone to about 6 or so sessions with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and today my therapist suggested I explore meds to help ""take the edge off""."
13212,She wants to continue seeing me and helping me with my anxiety but feels the meds will help with the process as I've become a shell of my former self.
13213,Up to this point I've been against medication because I've had a negative connotation with them.
13214,I am afraid of relying on meds for the rest of my life.
13215,If you think I should stand by my belief of not taking meds.
13216,And if CBT should be enough without meds.
13217,Is the numbness from the depression or the medication?
13218,Obviously my stability is the most important thing to get through this all and I don't want to quit the meds because they're helping so much but since i'm not me I worry about beginning a relationship with someone since I feel as if I can't really connect with anyone at the time.
13219,I really need to keep this job so that I can support myself and have health insurance for my medication.
13220,The attacks stopped eventually with medication but I remained constantly aware of my heartbeat and jumped at every little abnormalilty.
13221,"After a while the only emotion I was left with was sadness, emptyness, as if the medication had drained it all away."
13222,"But with my medication making me feel ever more empty and unmotivated, I dropped out and returned home."
13223,At this point I stopped the anxiety medication because I couldn't take the lack of motivation anymore.
13224,I'm scared to go on anxiety meds because a few family members have and they caused more problems than solutions.
13225,"I should also note that my dad has panic attacks from time to time (he is on medication for it), and anxiety does run in my family....."
13226,So apparently my anti-anxiety medication (Buspirone) causes me to have nervous tremors.
13227,"After 20 years of having the same symptoms brought on by anxiety, is it time to talk to a doctor about anti-anxiety meds?"
13228,"I told her everything about what I've been feeling and thinking, and she told me that I should start medication and therapy as soon as possible."
13229,I start my medication tomorrow and I cannot be more excited about that.
13230,"Before meds, we were having sex 4-5 nights a week."
13231,"Over the five years that I took that medication, I was able to work myself up to about 3 times a month with lots of planning and psyching myself up for it."
13232,I decided that I would try to be without meds to see if I could renew our sex life and live using only the coping mechanisms I've learned through years of trial and error.
13233,"Having taken other meds in the past that didn't work, I'm afraid to try and end up feeling worse."
13234,"I'm currently under medication and I've had anxiety for 7 years now, I think."
13235,"Did everything before medication to help solve the problem: change in diet, exercise, sleep patter, meditation, to-do lists, etc."
13236,I do my own research and it seems these medications will do the opposite affect of what I was hoping for.
13237,"I've been consistently dizzy, but that may be from the medication I'm taking."
13238,"To comply with the rules with this sub, I'm mid-20's, male, Filipino, taking no medications except vitamins, family insurance coverage."
13239,Or is it advisable to skip the meds that day?
13240,"I have tried anti anxiety medicine in the past and it never worked well with me, as I also have a fear of medications actually being poison (my brain is a dark place)."
13241,"I've been slowly coming out of it, without meds, and hopefully a good experience with this minor surgery will serve as another positive reenforcement that anxiety is easy to battle."
13242,What is your opinion on this medication?
13243,Did you find better luck with a different medication?
13244,Side note: I'm learning other coping methods and I intend to use the medication only for breakthrough symptoms.
13245,"She gave me some physical excercises, encouraged me to do more sports, and seems reluctant to prescribe any meds."
13246,I have recently realized that although I do not take all of the klonopin or the propanalol I am prescribed (two .5 mg klonopin/day of which I take approximately one and two 10 mg propanalol/day which I take approximately every other day) I am still taking more medication than I would like... especially when it started out as 'emergencies only' in my mind.
13247,My ADD meds seem to not work when im in this state/mood as they only make me evern more tired and lethargic.
13248,"I can't do anything without medication, now, and I'm still incredibly limited."
13249,"In fact, I have to take at least twice the amount of any anti-anxiety medication to see any kind of effect, most likely due to a very rapid metabolism."
13250,"I've tried various different meds, CBT exercises, relaxation methods, etc."
13251,I dont have any meds.
13252,I'm F(20) and am currently not taking any medication.
13253,Today I had an experience that showed me that I wasn't okay and perhaps I was wrong to go off my medication.
13254,"Diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and anxiety almost 4 years ago, different cocktails of meds, 2 attempts resulting in hospital stays."
13255,"Get home and think ""shit gotta go fill my meds""."
13256,"Out of meds, out of green."
13257,If anyone could offer some insight on the medications that have helped their agoraphobia/panic disorder I would definitely appreciate it.
13258,TL;DR - Good medication for agoraphobia/panic disorder?
13259,"I've been seeing a therapist every week for these past few years and, unable to truly cope with it with many other resources I've exhausted, we both decided it's best if I go back to something I wasn't very keen on going back to, which is medication."
13260,"I'm a server at a busy restaurant and being ""weird"" because of my medication increase is a pretty big fear of mine."
13261,"In detox I was given 10MG Diazapam to help me sleep and relieve the anxiety and it worked great, but they control meds severely in detox."
13262,"I was only open to trying it because it's the only thing she offered me that isn't an SSRI, but I've already lost all interest I had in using this medicine."
13263,I need medication.
13264,Also I've read how hard it is to quit this particular medicine once you start and that the sexual dysfunction typically does not improve over time?
13265,I went to my GP who didnt think I needed medication but suggested CBT which I start on the 25th of this month.
13266,I am not on any medication because I don't wanna become dependent on a chemical.
13267,"My question is basically, are there medications specifically tailored for anxiety as opposed to being a combined anti-anxiety anti-depressant that could potentially help me?"
13268,"(I can masturbate ok with porn, so I assume this is psychological)

* Doctor diagnosed me with depression, however I feel I was giving her the answers she wanted to hear to diagnose me with this as I really wanted to try the medication."
13269,My grandfather is totally against medicines.
13270,"My mom takes medicine, so when I started taking medicine, he got angry."
13271,"He used to shame me because I took medicine, so reluctantly I got off of it (celexa)."
13272,"Aside from the weight gain, I LOVE this medication."
13273,3 years ago I was put on effexor after a long period of medication trial and error.
13274,I went off of it because I wanted to quit taking medication.
13275,Now that I have been off of meds for several years my doctor has prescribed me Effexor again.
13276,"The last time I took this medication it didn't cause me to gain weight, but I have heard of people taking the same med again after time passes and gaining weight when they didn't before."
13277,"I'm taking Ativan and would like to get off it so, I'm wondering if it works well enough to not take meds anymore."
13278,"For those who have tried it or currently use it, would you recommend it while still taking meds?"
13279,I'm not on medication because I want to beat this naturally and I can't afford a doctor.
13280,I have GERD and the reflux is horrible but usually okay with the meds.
13281,I want to ignore it and hope he doesn't text me again until I get meds and feel like my old self.
13282,Usually my medicine helps me more quickly than that but I think it was only partially responsible.
13283,I've been on anti-depression meds before and I didn't like them because they made me feel extremely jittery and it kept me from sleeping.
13284,"Last year I went to a psychologist to see if I should get some kind of medication, but he said that I wasn't a clear case and that maybe I didn't need any meds but maybe they would help and that he would prescribe them if I wanted that."
13285,"Now every time I cry, I wonder what if I would have gotten the meds?"
13286,He would love to go to a doctor and try to get some sort of medication or something help him but we are very very tight on money.
13287,I tried sooooooo many different medications and combinations.
13288,My psychiatrist and I find a really good combination of meds.
13289,"Option 1: Stay in school, and take medication (SSRI) or Option 2: Drop out of school and figure out my life and what's causing my anxiety."
13290,"I knew however, that unless I planned on taking these meds for the rest of my life (which I didn't) that this was only a temporary fix."
13291,"SO after 2 months, I decided that I was feeling ok enough to get off the meds and continue on my own."
13292,The meds gave me the freedom to work on my thoughts.
13293,"If anyone has questions about my therapy, medication ( i was scared shitless to start a SSRI), meditation or anything else."
13294,But do I want to take medication?
13295,"I go to the gym 5-7 days a week, making good money working a job I actually like, bought a nice new car, have been on a good amount of dates with women and even got sexual with some, came to terms with being bisexual, have been with a couple of guys sexually, I recently started making some money with my hobby, updated my wardrobe, kicked my depression, and have even started medication for anxiety."
13296,I really hate this thinking about meds.
13297,The anxiety which made me start taking medication in the first place seems pretty mild compared to what I'm feeling right now.
13298,How sure are you that these medications aren't simply chemical lobotomies?
13299,"First a bit of background information: I'm 25, female, GAD, no medication history, seeing a psychologist for two or so months."
13300,I have been off my medication for awhile now since my doctor is in Pennsylvania.
13301,"Even after I took my medication, I was on pins and needles."
13302,"I am very cautious about medication, so I try to take it only at night when I really need to get to sleep and push through everything else on my own."
13303,"I have since stopped all daily medications, because they think I might've had a reaction or something."
13304,"I see a psychologist weekly, a PA occasionally that prescribes my medication, and my GP as needed."
13305,For the past couple days since the surgery I've been staggering my meds (taking 0.5 mg Klonopin and 20mg Celexa at 5am and Lortab at 8am) but today I took them all together.
13306,Then stupid me looked up the drug interactions between my meds and Lortab and now I'm freaking out.
13307,I keep trying to tell myself if there were any danger my surgeon wouldn't have prescribed Lortab or told me to keep taking my meds but of course my inner voice is not helping.
13308,Anyone had any experience with hydrocodone and anxiety meds?
13309,I tried medicine.
13310,"I’m functioning much better now with medication, but over a year later this experience haunts me."
13311,"I’m finishing up college and getting ready to go to grad school now, and in general my meds are balanced enough that I can function and be outwardly “happy,” but I don’t feel like I will ever be able to get over this."
13312,"Things may be a bit over the place, for that I apologize

I stop taking a low dose of medication thinking that I don't need them while talking to my psychiatrist (it also felt awkward when i have to discuss to the psychiatrist or student helper about it every time I see the psychiatrist for other reasons.)"
13313,"-----------------------

I'm contemplating going to see if I can schedule an appointment again....  the medication I had made me sleepy most of the day, which is one of the reasons why I don't want to take it (besides me thinking I don't need it.)"
13314,(Very inexperienced regarding anxiety medication so forgive me if that sounds ignorant).
13315,"My parents also don't believe in taking meds, so they wouldn't allow me to take any prescriptions."
13316,"Excruciating headaches, insane joint pains/aches for which I have to sneak pain meds."
13317,I ended up praying to whatever higher being was listening to me because I need this medication to work.
13318,"I'll try to keep this short, I have been on vyvance (amphetamine) medication since I was 16, I am now 24."
13319,Its pretty common for individuals with anxiety/depression or any mental health problem to have very strange reactions under pain medication.
13320,However the combo with the pain meds and everything else going on had me freaking out a lot over the sensation and I screamed at a nurse that my arms were coming out of socket.
13321,"She then preceded to ask me if I have a history of anxiety attacks (i leave that bit out of my records when i can, i know its not good but i don't like judgmental looks) I confessed that I did and then they added an anxiety medication to my list, that was then given with the pain meds."
13322,Will any pharmacy be open today or will I just have to deal with not having my meds until tomorrow?
13323,"I have pretty severe depression, but am not taking medication for it at the moment."
13324,**Edit: I've never taken medication for it but have been diagnosed with GAD.
13325,I knew she had some anxiety issues and took some sort of meds for it but I guess I hadn't really considered it that big of a deal.
13326,I was on meds for 6 months with no CBT or any other counselling.
13327,I am in counseling and also doing medication management with a psychiatrist.
13328,"This means, when my prescription for my anxiety meds runs out, I am pretty much screwed."
13329,"Did you get referred to another doctor or a psych, did you just talk, did you opt for meds straight up - can you even do that?"
13330,"I have panic attacks from time to time, but for the most part, I am able to handle them without medication (have not had medication for about 6.5 years)."
13331,After showering I went and took my daily medicine .25 of Xanax (I take it 3 times a day) 75 mg of Zoloft and 36 mg of Concerta.
13332,She has meds that relax her but she can start to feel 'out of control' and it can make everything worse.
13333,"I had a month's supply of meds when I got here, and tried to make an appointment right away to get established."
13334,I got my meds again and started improving.
13335,"Then the doctor can help me figure out what to do- whether to change meds, take more time off work/school, or move back home."
13336,I've been on and off medications since then and had gone almost an entire year without a single panic attack.
13337,Any tips on how to get through this and live a fairly normal life without medication?
13338,I was busy the two weeks and hadn't been taking my medication regularly plus I had a few drinks negating the affects of the medicine but having the dog around I felt really helped.
13339,"I would like to try medications, to see if they help, but I don't have a psychiatrist...my question is this:
Is it ok to make an appointment with a family doctor and just ask for a prescription without seeming like I just want drugs?"
13340,"I've been considering just making a regular doctor's appointment and asking for medicine, but I don't want to seem like I'm just trying to get drugs to sell or something."
13341,I have a great fear of trying to get medicine ever since my friend showed me John Mulaney's bit about trying to get a prescription.
13342,"I had meds prescribed to me before but they were just for sleep, which is super hard for me."
13343,I've always struggled with depression but I am not on any medication for it.
13344,"As far as meds and therapy go, I hate having to be dependant on medication, and the therapy I have tried in the past didn't work, because all I could think of was, ""this person doesn't care about me, she's just getting paid for this"", so it didn't really help."
13345,"I mean, if meds are the answer, then maybe I need to lighten up about that, but really, I'm just sharing my story here to see what you guys think."
13346,It's been ruining my life for a long time and whatever has been holding me back from getting proper help has gone away and I really want to try the medication route.
13347,We were going to try starting out some medication when I got back from winter break but I didn't go back to the school and instead moved back to my home state.
13348,"What's most important - in this ""hard period"" medicine wasn't helping me - I can say it confidently because I've tried plenty of different doctors/pills/therapies/etc."
13349,"I know there are hundreds of types,but I was just curious if there was a really common medication that some or most of r/anxiety takes."
13350,I know that some of you are adamant against medication.
13351,I'm not on medication or anything (but I'm looking into it.)
13352,"Obviously, my anxiety wants to point me to a heart condition but my logical side tells me that I never once had these palpitations prior to my anxiety/medication after years of playing organized basketball."
13353,For example I told them I hadn't been taking some of my medications when I had.
13354,"I’ve done medication, meditation, reiki, healthy eating, not-so-healthy eating, journaling, hundreds of dollars on self-help books, and drawing my feelings."
13355,"I’ve found medication, over the years, to useful."
13356,"I'm usually not one to take medication but at that point, I would have done anything to feel normal again."
13357,"Now my problem is that my meds make me feel like I'm not here, that I'm not myself anymore."
13358,"Now, my being the stupid person I am I decided that I was tired of feeling like that so I didn't take my meds for a couple of days, and again the freak out happened."
13359,**Tl;dr: 17 year old with Anxiety and Depression decided to stop taking meds and then had a freak out.
13360,"when they first started i suspected they were caused by one of my daily medications (ie birth control/ allergy meds) things that COULD cause increases in anxiety, but probably not if you had already been taking them for years."
13361,"Since this incident, i've had a really hard time taking medication of any kind."
13362,I have used cold medication while having anxiety but a recent bad reaction had put me off another brand.
13363,Or have suggesting for of cold meds they use.
13364,I have a therapist and psychiatrist and am on some meds but now I'm getting afraid of what the meds are doing to my brain and body.
13365,I currently go to therapy but am not on any medication.
13366,I won't have a therapist at school but I have the university clinic open to me for meds.
13367,"I've never taken medication for anxiety (it's been an issue like this for a couple of years, but had phobias and stuff since I was little), the idea of becoming reliant on them scares me."
13368,Any medications that have helped?
13369,"The person who diagnosed me was a psychiatrist, and it took kind of a long time, though trial and error, to choose the right medication for me (venlafaxine)."
13370,"my  symptoms have gotten much better and I want to begin to go off the medication, but my medical doctor wants me to wait another year or two - he says that lots of people go off their meds and them come back three months later when their symptoms come back and they need to go back on the medicaiton."
13371,"But if I change meds now, it's gonna take a long time to go through the process of finding the right one again, no?"
13372,And it takes months and months to get an appointment with the psychiatrist I saw originally - or is my normal medical doctor qualified to help me find a different medication?
13373,Has anyone else had these experiences with Venlafaxine or other meds?
13374,How do i know if I can be ok with medication?
13375,"Currently in therapy, just made an appointment to talk with a psychiatrist about medication (which is a whole different beast) but have been struggling the past few months with pain issues."
13376,"To say that I'm not a big fan of alt medicines would be an understatement, but since that shit is ruining my life, I'm exploring everything I can."
13377,I've never taken any sort of drug before besides pain meds.
13378,i've struggled with anxiety for a very long time and take medication currently.
13379,"PS was on medication previously, stopped due to terrible side effects and money."
13380,I also have ADHD which I am taking medication for.
13381,"My doc increased my meds since I'd been on Zoloft for 5 years and prescribed me 25mg  Xanax for emergencies and whatnot, I never even took a xanax."
13382,"Now I have anxiety medication to knock me out if I need it because my panic attacks cause my heart rate to speed up over 200 bpm, which isn't particularly healthy."
13383,I don't want meds or therapy.
13384,I never took any of the meds prescribed to me because I have a strict no-antidepressant way of life.
13385,"I HATE taking pills or medication, and I've read that SSRI's can fuck you up pretty badly, so that plays right into my hypochondria."
13386,They did a blood test which was normal except for my thyroids which I take medication for now.
13387,My biggest phobia is throwing up - and right now I fear I will from the medication reduction or from being sick.
13388,"Often I'll be feeling this type of anxiety and want to take medication, then I'll think, do I want to medicate away my excitement?"
13389,I used to take medication for anxiety.
13390,I have gotten meds (ssri and beta blockers) with my standard insurance but I really want therapy so that I use my time on the meds to build up better habits.
13391,"Some of my direct and extended family members also experience it, but as far my direct family goes, only my dad and I have been severe enough to have been diagnosed, prescribed meds, and sent to therapy."
13392,"(I'm very susceptible to any type of medication, and the effects always last a long time on me)."
13393,"What's available to me, medicine wise?"
13394,"I'm a bit afraid of using medication as a crux, but by god, the difference was like night and day."
13395,"I have been diagnosed with GAD, and tried talk therapy and multiple rounds of various meds, but I did not find either approach helpful (actually I found both seemed to make the anxiety worse, and not in a worse-before-better progress sort of way- just worse)."
13396,"None of the meds I've tried except sedatives/hypnotics that work immediately have any positive impact, and I'm not willing to use sedatives or hypnotics nightly (plus, I know they would lose effectiveness if I used them this way, and I'd rather reserve the option for nights I MUST sleep well)."
13397,"Now it's been rather calm, since I take a kind of herbal medicine that is supposed to help me sleep."
13398,Has anyone started having panic attacks after starting a medication?
13399,"I have had therapy on and off, medications (that work) on and off (I'm hoping to go renew my prescription soon)."
13400,"Unfortunately, the attacks persist, occasionally even if I am on my medication (usually if I do not exercise and self-medicate in addition to the prescription)."
13401,I'm not looking for advice or coping as I've become fairly well-versed in the most popular self-medications and self-help.
13402,"I'm currently on no prescribed medication, I don't do much other than listen to music and game so I don't get out all that often (my most recent major incident was on the way home from the latest Batman movie a couple of days ago)."
13403,I finally took the next step of treatment and decided to get some medication to beat this disease.
13404,"I wish I still had my emergency meds, but I haven't been to the doctor in a very long time."
13405,"Considering I sucked at my last two jobs, I don't know why the hell I thought managing people's medicine was a good idea."
13406,I used to go to Therapy with a Psychologist and he told me that in the state I was it was better for me to go to a psychiatrist to judge if I needed meds.
13407,"I have been to doctors since high school, seen therapists and have been on many different types of medication for depression, ADHD and Anxiety."
13408,"I'm pretty sure I have Anxiety as it most accurately describes what I go through on a daily basis but ADHD medication seems to work the best for me, let me explain..."
13409,Some background info on meds: I currently take 50mg Amytriptyline at night and 3 x 40mg Propranalol throughout the day.
13410,I disagree with medication because it just numbs the problem it doesn't solve it but i'm seriously considering it.
13411,"I have thought about getting on medication for awhile but I just wasnt sure what they could possibly prescribe, when Im having my panic attacks they weaken me and leave me feeling like I just got done running a marathon when in reality, all I did was go to Wal-Mart."
13412,So what have you guys done to make things easier or what medication have you been on that actually worked?
13413,"Ok, so I think I've reached the point where I'm seriously considering taking medication."
13414,Right now I feel like I might have to start taking medication though.
13415,"I don't take things like medication lightly so yeah, I'd appreciate your opinion."
13416,- Do you reckon I should try medication?
13417,- What if all my fears are legitimate and things get worse while I'm on medication?
13418,- Do you reckon my psychologist would stop seeing me/stop caring about me if I took medication and perhaps felt a little better?
13419,"- I'm aware medication works differently for everyone but does it normally make things a lot better or ""just"" bearable?"
13420,"- Can medication help with the feeling of being completely and utterly overwhelmed by stress, anxiety and life in general?"
13421,"- Can medication help my cognitive functions (memory, ability to focus etc) get back to normal?"
13422,- Will I experience any difference straight away or does it always take weeks for the medication to kick in?
13423,"There are three things I'm really afraid of when it comes to medication:

1."
13424,That my therapist and people working within the field of psychology will stop trying to get to the root of my problems if I start taking medication (I know this might sound weird but I sort of like the attention I get from psychologist because I've *never* had anyone try to understand the way I think before.
13425,"EDIT: Oh and I should probably add that I also find it very difficult to accept the fact that I might have to take medication to be able to function ""normally""."
13426,I went to my primary care doctor 2 weeks later and he gave me some anti-inflammatory medicine.
13427,They gave me some medicine for that.
13428,I never wanted to be on medications but lately i have been seriously considering talking to a doctor about my anxiety.
13429,that maybe they made it more difficult to get anxiety medications.
13430,"I am currently not on any medication, never have and 25yo male."
13431,"Is there some sort of medication, or therapy?"
13432,"I'm concerned about dealing with a new medication with the stresses of class, losing friends or a boyfriend from side effects and personality changes..?"
13433,"medication, sleep, exercise, diet, toxic substances)."
13434,I'm actually feeling somewhat decent and the medication is helping but my problem lies with Clonazepam.
13435,Not on meds (yet) besides the inhaler I occasionally use.
13436,"I'm no stranger to anxiety; I'm on meds that work most of the time and I have a therapist who is fantastic, but I'm not doing too well at the moment and I know the exact reason why."
13437,"I do have a history of depression and anxiety, but I've been on medication for years and I'm totally fine."
13438,I'm not currently on any medication or have anything to take to calm me down.
13439,"I am also on no medications for it and my parents would rather me not take any so kind of out of the question, or after talking with my therapist would she be the best to call it."
13440,Now I am living a shell of a life without medication.
13441,"It seems like my only option is back on medication but like I said, they don't settle with me."
13442,What if the only thing that is helping me is the medication?
13443,I don't care how afraid I am about telling someone or how I might forget to take my medication.
13444,"Current meds:  Klonopin, 3mg/day

Past meds:  Paxil (two rounds, 40mg and 60mg), Lexapro (20mg), Effexor (350mg)

Here's the problem."
13445,How many meds have you tried and in what classes before you found the combo that worked for you?
13446,I'm curious if eye twitching or muscle twitching in general is common for anyone else dealing with their anxiety/panic attacks or if anyone experienced anything similar to this in using Zoloft - especially while their body was still in the adjustment phase of the medication?
13447,What do you guys think I should do about my meds?
13448,These meds have ruined my life and nothing that I do seems to make any positive difference whatsoever.
13449,"Wondering if its worth easing off the meds, or is it simply the cost of not having bad anxiety episodes?"
13450,I am still accepting &amp; managing living my life with PTSD and though I have been better than ever (no meds/flashbacks/night terrors for almost a year and a half!
13451,"It is somewhat relieving in my mind to know I have backup plans with the meds and therapy, but my mind keeps telling me that I'll have to live like this forever."
13452,"I've had an anxiety/panic/depression disorder since I was about 15, i went to therapy for a little while, took medication for a bit and for the most part things have been okay I suppose."
13453,"I have suffered from anxiety for a very long time, and, even though, I'm on medication, some days get really bad."
13454,Without going on more medications what can I do?
13455,"Between good meds, a good therapist, and a year of practice coping, it's coming together."
13456,[meds] Hello friends I had a question for anyone who has taken celexa before.
13457,I've tried 8 or 9 other medications in the past and none have been a good fit.
13458,"I'm on anxiety medications and have been to therapy, but when it comes to directing my own life, I take a backseat and let others do it for me."
13459,"I'm 19 year old female with a mix of ADHD and GAD, both for which I've been taking meds since 4th or 5th grade."
13460,So I had originally posted asking about peoples experiences on these medications and got some good feedback.
13461,"[This is the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1m5209/meds_i_am_about_to_start_effexor_and_xanax/) 

So this is my update."
13462,just wondering if anyone can relate or share an experience where they have been stable on meds then get hit with extreme situational anxiety.
13463,I've tried so many medications and I'm bad at therapy.
13464,I guess I should feel lucky but honestly it makes me think the medicine either isn't working or that I'm not actually sick and this is all a big mistake.
13465,"I don't want to take medication, mostly because I feel like I would be wasting peoples time, but also because i feel like it would change me too much."
13466,"In the meantime, I got a referral to a psychiatrist from said psychologist and have been prescribed ADD medications: Strattera."
13467,Has anybody had luck with such medication?
13468,It also makes me question if I should treat my anxiety instead medication-wise.
13469,I'm moody and even more anxious than I feel without meds at all.
13470,"I guess it's possible that  I just need to find the ""right"" meds and the ""right"" therapist, but I don't know how to do that when even just going to the post office or answering emails is almost as much as I can bear."
13471,I'm on the wrong meds and have the wrong therapist.
13472,Are there any good long-term medications for anxiety/panic attacks?
13473,I would like to get some names of some good long-term medications that you guys use and bring them up to my doctor.
13474,"Treating Panic Attacks in Children


Panic attacks in adults are often treated with medications such as SSRIs (Zoloft, Prozac) or benzodiazepines (Xanax); however, these medications are not generally recommended for the treatment of children."
13475,"I’ve had counseling, I do self talk, I’ve tried everything but medicine."
13476,"I made a post on here earlier, but I have a small question: I'm going to see a psychiatrist soon, and I have a grocery list of meds I absolutely refuse to take."
13477,Can I recommend or request a specific medication?
13478,"I'm hoping CBT will help me alone, as it did before, but I'm looking at a medication now to quell the worst."
13479,I've tried therapy and several medicines and I can't seem to beat it.
13480,She wants me to see a mental health counselor because she wants me to learn some coping skills before trying meds.
13481,"I was told by my mother that I was ""more logical"" than that, to receive medication, and by others I loved that I should just ""deal with it"" on my own."
13482,The stigma on medication was very negative from others in my life.
13483,"It didn't go too well (I fell short of the reference marks, but not too short, and I did react to one of the medications I inhaled, but not until the second-highest dose showing that I was sensitive, but likely didn't have severe asthma), but it didn't say that I had a severe problem either."
13484,"My boyfriend, initially against the medication, suggested I take one pill."
13485,"I get it, 'white-man lab-coat medicine bad' is what I've been told all my life."
13486,I've taken ADD medicine in the past and had great results but stopped in favor of anxiety medicine (you really can't mix the two) and I have terrible insomnia issues with those medications as well.
13487,Felt present and motivated on my medication.
13488,"I was doing good with my medication when I was feeling good, got stuff done, then when this happens I can't focus one bit."
13489,"I think I may want to see her either more often, or find a new psychiatrist who I can see more often if she can't, and I think I may need to go on medication for anxiety."
13490,Will medication help or should I maybe consider inpatient treatment?
13491,"Do any of you have routines that make sure you get your meds, or suggestions on how to remember them?"
13492,"I'm scared shitless of that though, because my mother had a growth on her thyroid and my step father had his removed and now has to be on medication."
13493,I had to have an upper endoscopy and wasn't allowed to take any of my medication.
13494,Now I ask her if she considered taking medication for it and she dismissed the idea.
13495,"I know it's her body and her own responsibility to choose to take meds, but i'm just worried about her mental well-being."
13496,For a while I was on Citalopram and one other medication that I can't recall the name of and neither ever ended up working (I'm terrified nothing's ever going to work).
13497,I've never had good experiences with meds and want to overcome this with CBT and my own will!)
13498,"With a little bit of mild medication to help take the edge off physical symptoms I couldn't control, I was on top of the situation only after a year."
13499,"Thankfully, I've also found a lot of comedy in my anxiety; humor being one of the best medicines I've found to cope with everything."
13500,"I immediately took my medication, sat down and focused on my breathing, and called a friend I trusted to help listen to my dilemma."
13501,The meds are working.
13502,"I started medication, but it just doesn't help."
13503,It takes time on each medication to evaluate whether it's working properly or not.
13504,I'm not on any medication.
13505,"I've been seeing a therapist and I have an appointment to see a doctor about meds in a month which hopefully is going to help me cope, but the type of career I have been looking at that would be something I could be happier doing is working with animals in some capacity."
13506,"To be fair, the whole situation was a major undertaking considering a) I had never lived away from home longer than the month and a half I studied abroad and b) I took myself off of my medication before leaving because acquiring the medicine while abroad would have been a really messy process."
13507,Is this normal/has anyone experienced this with these medications?
13508,"But I have worked myself up into such a state, thinking that accepting medication is a ""failure"" (ridiculous I know) and that they will just make me sicker, that I worry I won't be able to make myself take the first one tomorrow morning."
13509,Tl;Dr - Scared of my new meds.
13510,I sometimes wonder if my anxiety meds make me apathetic to things I should feel something for.
13511,"I've been on and off various meds over the years, and am currently on Zoloft, Adderall, Klonopin, and Ambien, and seeing a psychotherapist."
13512,I've been off meds for a month or so.
13513,"Commercial about side effects of medicine, panic."
13514,she believes I need medication (which I am not against) This anxiety and panic is hard guys.
13515,"I'm not on any anxiety meds, though I do take kava tea on occasion."
13516,"My main issue is that she sees therapy and medication as personal failings, and doesn't acknowledge anxiety and depression as legitimate medical problems."
13517,My doctor recently switched my medication from citalopram to pristiq after some allergy issues and I feel quite well other than the whole body numbness I just developed.
13518,DR told me he had a very bad reaction to the meds.
13519,"The morning of this incident, I'd had plenty of sleep the night before, eaten breakfast, taken my meds and didn't feel any fear or anxiety prior."
13520,"He's on medication and has seen therapists, but he never had a handle over his anxiety."
13521,"I exercise, see a therapist, and do take meds."
13522,"Unfortunatley the medication I was on was not the right one for me and it wasn't until two years and a lot of issues (including a few panic attacks) later that I stopped taking my medication and tried a new medication that I actually feel in control and for the lack of a better word, normal."
13523,"But now that it's been a year on this new medication all I can think is, I was at times actually happier with anxiety than I am now."
13524,"It *does* something to you, to know that you take the same medications, at the same dosages, as people who are telling you their anxiety is so severe that they can't hold down any kind of job at all."
13525,"When you're taking *more* meds than your clients, that does something to you too."
13526,In the past my doctors have recognised that i have anger problems and anxiety however no medication or therapy has been given.
13527,I've also seen a lot of over the counter medication to help with stress.
13528,"I've used weed for the past few years which was great but have built a tolerance toward it, no longer as effective, and its not the best thing to rely upon as a functional medication, affecting you cognitively."
13529,Is medication the right move or therapy?
13530,I'm just taking a minute to say that this finding balance between my thyroid condition &amp; medication for that..... fibromyalgia related symptoms ...... and depression &amp; anxiety medications ....it just seems to be a big damn trade off.
13531,"I'm exhausted from the low thyroid and whatever else,  when the thyroid meds ""work"" I have the side effects of anxiety surges and those are counter productive (my anxiety is crippling), then my depression is worsened,  then I feel awful and give in to a klonopin or half of one and I'm back to being sleepy."
13532,At least when I'm not on medication I know what to expect.
13533,"So my psychiatrist prescribed Celexa to me today, it'll be the first mental health medication I've taken since I was ~16 (I'm going to be 20 next month) and after reading up on the side effects, I have to say - I'm incredibly nervous."
13534,I now have a new psychologist and he wants to put me on medication.
13535,I really don't want medication because the side effects scare the crap out of me.
13536,I am at home now and i am freaking out over school tomorrow and my parents want me to take the medication my psychologist suggested.
13537,I have read online that every medication has tons of side effects and can even be addicting.
13538,I would love to know about any alternatives to those scary addicting medications.
13539,"I don't have insurance of any sort, I'm self-pay and currently in-between doctors since I refused to accept a woman who's 'uncomfortable' prescribing me anxiety medicine as my doctor."
13540,And Sunday I'm told that my 91 year old grandmother is fighting pneumonia.. since last week I've been drinking pretty heavily since I'm not on any meds at all.
13541,"I understand that there are a lot of changes that go on in the brain at the start of taking medication, but I just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this."
13542,"I was depressed, on rough medication that made me feel numb all the time, and was just really desensitized to all this stuff."
13543,"About two months ago I quit using anti-depressant SSRI, medication which I've been using on and off for about 3 years."
13544,Could really use some useful tips about coping with anxiety without medication.
13545,"I used to see a therapist during a period in which my depression was really bad, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but never given any medication."
13546,"In a perfect world, I'd take meds and be at least a bit more confident, but I don't know if that would help?"
13547,"However, the other concern I was having with Lexapro was the fact that the bottle has a warning saying not to drink while taking this medication."
13548,"I asked my doctor about this and said I wanted to switch to something I could have alcohol with, and he dismissed it saying all of these types of medications have that warning on the bottle, and to just be careful about drinking."
13549,"I've been blackout drunk once and that scared the living shit out of me, and actually caused a **lot** of anxiety for me for a few months (before I started taking meds), but that let me know my limits, and ever since, I've been much more careful about pacing myself and cutting myself off when I've had enough."
13550,I didn't even consider that I shouldn't start a new medicine before a night of drinking until right after I swallowed the pill.
13551,"I have depression, and don't take meds."
13552,"I've never been on any kind of psychiatric medication before, so I'm not sure how I feel about this yet."
13553,"Also, a current option is medications is anyone actually on them and advise using?"
13554,I've attempted to go on medication to get the anxiety under control to no avail.
13555,My friend has been dealing with anxiety and depression for some time and just a few months ago started medication.
13556,It's not as though she doens't still deal with any anxiety though and I fear for a time where she may build up a tolerance to her medication.
13557,How do you keep the ball rolling in a positive direction once medication has put you in the position to do so?
13558,I'm on 45mg of Fluoxetine and some other medications.
13559,"I told my psychiatrist and he said it doesn't seem like an issue, and if the meds are working to stick  with  them."
13560,"Psych appointments thus far have just been medicine pushing, which works but also causes me to forget most of the very memories I was trying to experience."
13561,I want to be able to lead a least a semi-normal life without needing to take medication for anything social.
13562,My medication is levelling out and I even spent some time after the funeral with the family and their friends at my brothers place.
13563,I have ativan for panic attacks and I've tried taking other meds but they make me too sick.
13564,"Yes, I am taking medication, and no, I'm not TOTALLY sure if it's working, but I'm talking to my doctor about it as soon as I can."
13565,Three weeks ago my doctor prescribed a new medication to hopefully help with the panic attacks.
13566,"Tonight I told my mom (who btw, directly witnessed the catastrophic, life-ruining panic attack) I started a new medication and that I was anxious about it."
13567,"I've tried lots of different meds (paxil, prozac, celexa, zoloft, and ativan for my really anxious days) I've been on 75 mg of Zoloft since December 2014 (previously on 100mg) I wanted to start tapering since I was worried about being on an SSRI since my husband and I want to start a family in the next year or two."
13568,"I'm going to try medication next, but I don't know which type I should use."
13569,What are your experiences with these types of medication?
13570,"It's too late to have medication prescribed to calm me, but what are some things I can do to have a good flight?"
13571,I'm constantly tired and was just attributing this to my anxiety meds.
13572,My anxiety meds have helped me be calm and Im able to go through the day without a problem but now Im wondering if I just have an overactive thyroid.
13573,"Well, maybe the truth will suffice: I could really use some support from people here for a few days, especially if anyone knows about K. 

My partner/roommate doesn't have exp w/meds, and anyway has her own probs right now (dad is very sick and days are probably numbered)."
13574,You would get lost in my medicine cabinet.
13575,"**

**What I would like to accomplish here is to get opinions on what is happening to me, my meds, coping mechanisms you may have developed, and just to hear from people who experiences the same symptoms that I do."
13576,"I have been seeing him for over five years, and while the meds I am do help, I am hoping there is something more I can do, because life at times is still pretty shitty."
13577,"Here are the meds I am in case it might be helpful: Wellbutrin XL, Lexapro, Lamictal, and Adderall."
13578,The medication had begun to do its work and I could definitely tell a difference.
13579,"My meds were eventually change from the Zoloft, which I didn’t feel was being as effective, to the meds I listed above."
13580,I was wondering if anyone has found any relief through OTC non-holistic medications?
13581,I no longer can afford my doctor and antianxiety meds and desperately need some relief.
13582,It probably doesn't help that I'm scared of any and all medications.
13583,He takes anxiety meds and doubles it up around travel time.
13584,"However, my anxiety is problematic enough that I would like to give the medication more of a chance to work."
13585,So far every medication has drawn no results.
13586,"These medications are (each one was taken 1.5+ months at max dosage):

* Effexor
* Zoloft
* Xanax
* Prozac
* Lexapro
* Cymbalta
* Buspar

**I don't even notice I'm taking the medication, I feel absolutely no different in any way."
13587,"**  By ""noticing nothing"" I'm not implying that I'm simply not noticing ""good effects,"" I literally mean I notice no difference - at no time during any of my 6 trials could I even tell I was taking the medication, it felt the exact same when I was taking the medication as when I wasn't (heck, I even quit some of the medications instantly when my trial was done rather than taper down as an attempt to really confirm my suspicion - I felt the exact same)."
13588,It's for this reason that I've long been wondering about the noticeable effects of medication.
13589,"Most of all, **would a non-depressed/anxious person notice anything if they were to take the medication?"
13590,Instead I'm genuinely curious if one without depression/anxiety would have any noticeable effects from medications.
13591,"I'll likely be meeting with a psychologist soon, and possibly my doctor to discuss options/suggestions for medication."
13592,I had just started medication - I'd been on Citalopram for a week or so.
13593,What medications can I take for this?
13594,"Like I said, I've only been on the meds for 10 days, but the change in mood is very apparent."
13595,"In fact, he upped the dosage on my meds."
13596,"I didn't want to die, but my medicines were pushing me in the wrong direction and I didn't have anything left to support me when I finally hit the breaking point."
13597,It got bad enough she got medication.
13598,I can't tell if the perceived numbness and weakness in my left arm is purely a symptom of anxiety or my body wasting away from the toxic neurologic effects of that medicine.
13599,"At first, the medicine seemed to working fine and all, but now I am having serious mood swings."
13600,I would like to know if this is a normal side-effect of the medicine or if it is something I need to see my therapist about.
13601,"I recently restarted my anxiety medication, previously I was on 20mg celexa a few years back."
13602,So all throughout high school and college almost all of my friends didn't have a clue that I had anxiety/depression issues and that I was taking medication for it.
13603,My parents were the ones to take me in to the ER and basically that led to word getting out that I was on medication and that I had bad anxiety and depression.
13604,I am taking some medication (Lansoprazole daily and Buscopan when necessary) but they rarely make a difference.
13605,"This mindset along with me already having social anxiety and a workload from school has made me just shut down from thinking about making the speech altogether and now that I have told my mom, she believes i should go to the doctor today and get prescribed anti anxiety medication so i can work on my speech today and give it tommorow."
13606,"I am going to be seeing a therapist or someone of the like soon, but my question is, should I take the medication or not?"
13607,"I don't know what other questions to ask before deciding to take the medication and feel like a wretch right now for even considering medication to ""fix me"", so I would be very grateful if someone could help me out."
13608,"I recently have decided to try to sleep ""naturally"" aka without the use of meds."
13609,What are some of the ways that you have managed your sleep without the use of medication?
13610,We're trying to get her hooked up with a therapist and new medication.
13611,"On Monday morning I couldnt take it anymore and decided to either kill myself for good or check myself into the mental ward, or at the very least get some meds to try and hopefully break the cycle for good."
13612,"But we dont think its in your best interest to give you any medication right now as we dont want it to interfere with your exposure therapy, and we think admitting you would be worse for you right now."""
13613,"I have decided to take a break from Exposure Therapy and Group Therapy for a month or two, find a different GP, get my meds sorted with a different Psychiatrist, and never go to the Mental Health Services if needing urgent assistance again."
13614,Will I be taking mental meds until I die?
13615,"I'm taking medication  for anxiety, but it's not really helping much."
13616,"Scared seeing a psychologist wont help, and getting medicine will make me dependent on it or it wont help at all."
13617,"Hi everyone,

I'm seeing my psychiatrist on Monday and am going to request starting some anxiety medication."
13618,I'm asking what medication do you use and how do you feel now that you're on it?
13619,"My head was a chemistry experiment for years, but I finally found the right medicines that weren’t a volatile mixture and was experiencing a nice degree of normalcy."
13620,"I’m currently only on one medication and it’s only for DEFCON 1 level emergencies, but being positive and finding the strengths in my weakness has been the best medicine I’ve tried."
13621,"I (F24) use to have bad social anxiety, but I slowly grew out of it due to therapy and medication."
13622,I am no longer in therapy nor on medication and I haven't been since around late 2011/early 2012.
13623,Now he gave me Pristiq a week ago and if this doesnt help then psychiatrist time ok that the back story of the medication.
13624,"She is on meds although I am not sure exactly what but she is generally ok, however she does have moments of anxiety."
13625,my meds make me feel like I need to be doing something with my hands and feet when I'm sitting down.
13626,"A little more info (probably some red flags here)

* dad of 1yr old

* recently quit smoking for like the 3rd time (few weeks ago)

* starting to exercise but it's been on and off

* job is a bit stressful not not like a fucking air traffic controller or whatever

* happy marriage, happy home

* do not drink or use any recreational drugs

* I do not take any regular medication, and am not really comfortable doing so, even for the anxiety."
13627,When I first started taking paxil (about a year ago) it was really easy to remember to take it first thing when I got up every morning because I wasn't feeling well and I didn't start feeling better until I had a consistent stream of the medication in my system.
13628,This ends up with me having erratic inconsistency on when I take my meds.
13629,"I'm going to try and shift taking my meds to around 11pm and see how that helps, but I was wondering if anyone else had any pointers."
13630,"Hey there,

I've been struggling through a two month-long anxious/depressive episode and after getting back into the psychologist's office during that time, he thought that it might be a good idea for me to see someone about meds."
13631,I am looking forward to seeing what good (if any) this medication will do for me.
13632,"I guess I'm just so scared of continuing to feel uncomfortable and sick (my anxiety makes my stomach sick and generally makes me sleepy and shaky) that, knowing these symptoms may continue even with the meds for a bit is freaking me out."
13633,Is this the kind of thing I should be seeking out medication for?
13634,Was wondering if anybody had any success stories of getting in good shape while on anxiety meds?
13635,"I feel like if I felt good about my body, it'd be easier for me to get off medication and control my anxiety."
13636,"I've heard being on meds slows down your metabolism, but haven't found anything definitive."
13637,Since then he's been on medication and is still working on finding a therapist that will will work with his insurance.
13638,"The medication helped with combating mental anxiety/depression, but considerably worsened my physical anxiety."
13639,"Even though the medication lowered my social inhibitions and made me more comfortable around other people, my sweating worsened."
13640,I had originally sought out medication in an attempt to *curb* the sweating.
13641,"**TL;DR**: what medications, other than SSRIs, alleviate the physical symptoms of anxiety, namely sweating?"
13642,How did these medications affect you?
13643,This will be my first time on medication for my anxiety.
13644,I weaned myself off of medication and was able to fight the anxiety and fears myself and eventually be okay.
13645,"I'm laying in bed right now, miserable because I live with a family I hate, I'm in pain from a canker sore (I get so many from stress and tired of hearing my family ask why), and I'm waiting for my sleep meds to kick in because I'm afraid to sleep."
13646,"I'm failing college thanks to this shit, If I take meds I'm unmotivated, if I don't I smoke more cigs then a 50s dad."
13647,"I figured this would be a good time to begin the meds, as any effects from marijuana would be minimized."
13648,I just started therapy again and will hopefully be on some meds soon.
13649,What if the medicine and therapy don't work?
13650,"I have to wait until Friday to see my therapist and psychiatrist again, but I only see them once a week I feel like I need to see them sooner and be put on meds asap because of school, I already missed two classes."
13651,Even the medication I took was just masking my situation temporarily.
13652,"I don't notice negative side effects of taking this, but there is a stigma for taking this medicine because there absolutely is a potential for addiction/dependence/abuse."
13653,"I'm glad that I can get some benefit from the medication, but when I talk to doctors about it, I'm always afraid of talking to new doctors about my history of taking it long-term because I'm afraid of being labeled as a drug seeker."
13654,"They take weeks to make an effect, and I never know if it is the drug or the therapy that gives me a small boost, because usually when I'm changing meds, I'm also seeing a therapist more often."
13655,"I will say that I've had some very irresponsible insurance companies who have refused to allow me to taper my doses when I switch meds, and some irresponsible doctors who have switched me around so fast that there would have been no real way of knowing if the drugs were working because they hadn't had time to take effect."
13656,"I'm afraid to go off these meds because the withdrawal is so terrible, and I also believe that I genuinely should be taking them."
13657,"I get suspicious that free, grow your own medicine could be a big threat to business that wants you to depend on buying the drugs they make and profit from."
13658,"This is a bit of a rant, but I want to know your thoughts, and experiences with anxiety meds."
13659,"If you had any of these symptoms, what did you find to be the best medication?"
13660,After reading up on old posts on how people feel after finally getting medication for anxiety issues..
13661,"*edit* I am seeing a therapist regularly (just recently, my fourth session is coming up) I haven't talked to her about meds yet, this just popped into my head today


Thanks"
13662,I got her up to date on my treatments/medications which did nothing but seem to scare her.
13663,"I have had GAD for my entire life, diagnosed when I was a teenager and have been on anti-anxiety medication for 8 years."
13664,"I am currently on Xanax which helps the majority of the time, but as most of you well know, an anxiety attack can come out of no where even while on the medication."
13665,"My job in retail requires I deal with people constantly but I feel like I need to see my doctor and get off medication, then go from there."
13666,"I'm still in school (last year) and I take medication (betablockers, they're not from my doctor though because I haven't seen one about it yet) just to function in the classroom."
13667,I go through serious depressive episodes every so often and I worry that taking a medication will trigger one.
13668,He gave me medication and it was better.
13669,"I still felt tired and derealisation (at least I think that's what it is)

So after two weeks I stopped taking the medication and the I felt worse again."
13670,My diagnosis was colitis and they gave me meds saying it would go away after I take them.
13671,I took the meds they gave me and I felt that the symptoms still persisted.
13672,I don't want to stay on meds because I know how bad they are and I don't want to be dependent on them.
13673,"And I'm going to cardiologist to prescribe me some meds for my hypertension, but I was wondering what if he'll prescribe me beta blockers and they calm down me only temporally ??"
13674,"Back to the point: I'm wondering if meds for hypertension:
a) help my body with preventing adrenaline rushes and controlling my blood pressure and I gain massive confidence and calmness OR
b) what if they help only temporally; it will be ok when I will be taking them, but if I'll be going to cancel them, my anxiety will go worse??"
13675,"I need your opinion should I take meds for hypertension or should I wait few months, get rid of those adrenaline rushes and then go to Doc??"
13676,My doctor prescribed me Xanax and I am a weird person I don't like taking medication unless absolutely needed.
13677,"I have tried not eating for a couple days, smoking weed, taking my grandmother's Ativan medication and tums directly before I go out - doesn't help."
13678,The second day after I began my medication I experienced a *horrid* heat flash.
13679,"Could things eventually get better if I keep taking the Escitalopram (I know these medications can take a while to kick in), or should I ditch it and ask the doctor to start me on something new?"
13680,The meds I'm on.
13681,"I'm on two different anxiety medication, my mom is with me, it's a very trusted airline but I'm still shaking and have an awful need to vomit all over the place."
13682,"So I can't get any medication until I have been to a therapist (on waiting list), so I decided to go down to my local pharmacist and ask for something natural for anxiety, she gave me rescue remedy spray and was wondering if anybody had any experience with anything like this and if it worked, something tells me I just wasted €8 but thought I would ask about it."
13683,Do you guys know of any medications that I can take as soon as I feel I am having an attack come at night?
13684,I’m on medication off and on and I struggle to find a good therapist.
13685,"Hey all,

So I'm on some medications as of around 5 to 6 months."
13686,I've made great strides and I know that the medication won't fully walk me through everything... so I push myself.
13687,"It's been about two years since I have met with a therapist, and I have been off medication (prozac) for about six months now."
13688,"Since I made the stupid decision of quitting my meds without consulting my doctor, well, I feel great."
13689,"I've had anxiety for a while now, and panic since last December, and it's been getting better with medication and therapy."
13690,My cousin has told me to wean off my meds before.
13691,I also felt I was mentally ready to commit to the challenge of being medication-free.
13692,PS: I don't use any medication.
13693,"Granted, I went off my meds without the supervision of a doctor and paid hell for it, but is it EVER easy?"
13694,"Finally, I'll (hopefully lol) be getting some diagnoses and medication."
13695,What can I expect from this medication?
13696,I want to hear it from people who have experience with being treated with these medications.
13697,"I haven't been in a situation yet that would normally make me extremely anxious, so I can't say whether or not the medicine works, but I have noticed a side effect."
13698,"Is it worth it to try and get on different medication (Going on day 4, I'm thinking it might be)?"
13699,"I decided last night I wanted to stop taking my antidepressant medication, a generic for Lexapro, escitalopram oxalate 10mg (taken once daily)."
13700,It's a long story but while on the medication I left Christianity.
13701,"I'm scared the medication is hurting my sex life with my SO, though I have no previous sex life to compare it too."
13702,So I can't say the medicine caused my lack of emotion at times.
13703,"I think I need meds and counseling because this is also affecting my job search and just about every other area of my life, but short term - how do I send that stupid e-mail?"
13704,I am so happy and relieved right now as I was totally worried about switching meds.
13705,Is there anything I can do aside from seeking professional help or taking medication?
13706,"So, (I see a therapist and do not take medication) I'm hoping that I can make a change in my life that will alleviate this anxiety."
13707,Other second I'm convinced I need these meds.
13708,"I'm afraid I'm gonna avoid it all if I don't do meds, but the prospect of needing meds to do it makes me uncomfortable."
13709,The only medicine that actually makes any noticeable effect on my anxiety is illegal and frowned upon all over.
13710,"I started to dress more feminine, I am on a diet, I take my medications, and I try to stay active."
13711,I was on a medication once but it made me feel weird and i havent tried another.
13712,About a month ago I noticed I started to lose my appetite but figured it was from coming off some medication called [Ranitidine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranitidine) for stomach pains.
13713,I figured I'd stop the medication and a few weeks later I'd be better.
13714,"I have been on over 40 different medications for psychiatric purposes since I was 14, mostly for anxiety-related disorders (GAD, OCD, Panic Attacks, &amp; Anorexia Nervosa), and also other diagnoses (MDD &amp; BPD)."
13715,"I am aware that everyone responds to medications differently, but if you have any insight that may be of benefit, I'm sure I won't be the only one that is grateful."
13716,"I went to the hospital and didn't really receive any other information other than a severe reaction to the medicine,but now almost 3 weeks later, I experience some facial twitching and signs of those same tremors from before even though I had immediately discontinued the medicine after one pill."
13717,Going back on the meds probably by the end of the week.
13718,"Obviously no one can offer medical advice on a forum, but I would like to hear from you about your experiences with various medications and whether they worked."
13719,Looking to learn from others' experiences with various medications.
13720,He currently takes meds for it but has slowly been weaning himself off and tells me it's causing fluctuations in his moods.
13721,I was put on some meds and have started a bit of therapy but have yet to get far.
13722,"I've also tried medication on and off, but it felt very *artificial*."
13723,"I've been on medications for 5 years now, starting with citalopram for 3 years, Lexapro for 1.5, and hopping between Prozac, Mirtazapine, and now celexa again in the past year."
13724,"I'm starting to feel like I don't want to be on medication anymore- I have IBS, and I feel like the medications, particularly celexa, are making my digestive issues worse."
13725,I'm getting sick of the side effects and am also feeling that the meds aren't really doing much to help me.
13726,"I'm scared, though, to go medication-free."
13727,I feel like most people in the anxiety communities I've seen are using medication as their main help (I could be wrong!!
13728,"I'm scared that I'll go off my medication and realize I was better off on it, and then have to go through the whole hell that is medication startup side effects again."
13729,"I was prescribed Celexa and will start taking it tomorrow at a low dose (10 mg.) I've been reading reviews of the medication online and am starting to get scared... a lot of people say that the first couple of weeks are really rough, with a lot of additional anxiety, dizziness, loss of appetite, etc."
13730,"I used to have a serious addiction problem before I started the meds:

Eating: I'd get hungry at odd times of the day and night and start pacing around while devouring snack foods."
13731,I'm very pleased that my meds have evened me out enough that I now tell myself in the moment that it is time to stop at the right time.
13732,"hello all,
I posted here a couple times when i first started my meds back in jan/feb."
13733,"this medication has helped me greatly, but I'm concerned with the growing weight."
13734,It never occurred to me that anxiety to the point of throwing up so violently that I lacerate my throat would be an indication of needing medication for emergency situations.
13735,"I feel like the future could be bright, even if that means medication and clinging to my laptop."
13736,"As the title suggests, I recovered from Generalized anxiety (GAD) and Social anxiety (SAD) about 6 or 7 years ago (I am 31 now) without the help of medications."
13737,"I tried dozens of medications for the first couple years, but nothing really treated me effectively, and many made things worse."
13738,I'm not suggesting that CBT will work for everyone and that medications are useless (they are extremely beneficial in certain situations) but I want to share my story in hopes that some people will benefit.
13739,"I'm on Zoloft for both, and when I drink it intensifies the effects of my medication."
13740,I've been dealing with major depression/anxiety for past 5 years and have been on medication for it (Celexa 20mg).
13741,"Two weeks ago, I forgot to take my meds in the morning, and I noticed a dramatic increase in mood, confidence, and sports performance."
13742,"Over the summer, I started seeing a doctor regularly again and decided a few things: 1) to go on the pill to get rid of hormonal migraines; 2) to go on antidepressants to help the anxiety; 3) to go on sleep medication so I could sleep like a normal human being."
13743,I kept up the SSRI and sleep meds.
13744,Fast forward through some medication changes and therapy and things get better.
13745,"He thinks I need to go off all of my medication -- currently Effexor, Trazodone, and Camila -- because it exacerbates all of my problems."
13746,Boyfriend thinks it's because of all the medication.
13747,It's a lot of fun and I'm getting a little upset that sometimes needing a medication during work will keep me from having fun at night.
13748,All this came shortly after reaching out to my family for help and starting medication.
13749,They stopped her from checking and asked her to go to a dr. for meds (escitalopram).
13750,"She has been fine until now where they talked to her, found out she wasn't taking her meds, and now they are forcing her to go back up to check."
13751,But I do not want to be reliant on this medication.
13752,"I started seeing a doctor, eventually started meds and gradually leveled out."
13753,"Like most people, I don't like the idea of taking medications on a daily basis."
13754,"Now, I realize I was dumb to decide to ween myself off medication on my own, but what's done is done at this point."
13755,"I started to feel like I was doing so well that I didn't need it and for over a month, I felt great and I felt even better that I felt great without taking medication."
13756,"I realize I need to make an appointment asap (and get a referral to a recommended, more accessible doctor), but was just curious if anyone else has experienced something similar and am curious about anyone who has successfully weened off of medications."
13757,TL;DR: Has anyone else decided on their own to limit/stop their medication?
13758,"I was on anxiety medication for awhile, but stopped about a year ago."
13759,I'm not meds but they don't work.
13760,I have been dealing with a severe anxiety disorder for 8 years and have tried many different kind of meds.
13761,"I want to know what to look for when I'm on the medication in terms of side effects and the positive, desired effects."
13762,"I recently got on meds and it's helping a lot with my anxiety, mood, psychosis, and the physical pain I was having from anxiety."
13763,Compared to not being on meds I feel amazingly good.
13764,My meds (esp antidepressant) seem to be helping my mood and anxiety.
13765,"I've suffered with anxiety for 15+ years, and tried a few medications, paxil which I didn't like and celexa, which was also just OK.."
13766,Does anybody have an experience with this medication?
13767,I've not taken medication for it but have tried CBT and deep breathing exercises that have helped immensely.
13768,"I used to take a SSRI-medicine called Sertalin, I took it around 2007-2009 but I got some very nasty side effects so I had to quit it."
13769,thanks to this medication.
13770,So my question; is there any medication that is **not** a SSRI that could help against anxiety (WITHOUT making me a careless zombie)?
13771,Does anyone take a daily medication that works in settling their anxiety?
13772,"I'm considering seeing a psychiatrist to talk about meds instead of my GP, but I'm a little worried about how it will go/what to expect/what my parents will think about it/costs/etc."
13773,"Particularly, I'm hoping that my psychiatrist can prescribe me a medication to take ""only when I need it"", because my anxiety comes and goes in waves and when it hits, it hits really hard and usually leaves me extremely depressed for a few days."
13774,Is an immediate relief medication appropriate for my situation?
13775,"For example recently I've suffered oral thrush (which I did go to the doctor for once, got some medication, and the hospital twice after the fact, because it wasn't working and was told to go home and that it was healing), mouth ulcers, and now what looks like and sure feels like Perioral dermatitis."
13776,She's on her second day on meds right now but don't think she can hack more than a week of these side effects.
13777,EDIT: Thanks for all your comments - my GF went to see her doctor today and the severity of her side effects was unusual so she's been prescribed some different meds now.
13778,"Hi Reddit,
So I have been diagnosed with PTSD about a year ago and am on medication."
13779,"Also, not sure if this is too much to ask of you guys also but my family is having a hard time with my diagnosis, they keep asking when I'm going to be off meds and are pushing me to see my doctor to get off them."
13780,"So I guess I have a question for myself: in terms of meds, how long is too long?"
13781,"I have anxiety about being taken off my meds, I also have depression although not as severe as the anxiety, and can't picture not taking them."
13782,"It's weird that my benzo's will take away the physical pains while they're in effect, but not any type of pain meds."
13783,"I realize the difference as far as Psychiatrist being MD's and focusing on medicine, etc."
13784,I've read to start with a Psychiatrist to get diagnosed and be prescribed medicine if needed and then follow up with a Psychologist for longer term therapy.
13785,"I want to get on medication, but I'm worried it's something far worse than Anxiety."
13786,"I've considered asking about medication or something, but I just don't know."
13787,That was successful in terms of my body adapting to the medication.
13788,He doesn't take any medications other than smoking weed because he does not have a job.
13789,He was prescribed medication but now cannot get it.
13790,Since we both have disorders we are completely different and I have no clue how to help him until he can get a job to get on some proper medication or see a therapist.
13791,"At this point I'm crushing, cutting, and opening all my medications."
13792,Here I am still with no medication because the pharmacy said insurance is refusing to pay for the new pills until November because they just paid for the old pills that they denied.
13793,"I have battled depression for around 8 years, doing much better without medicine the last 2 and not having any true bouts of anxiety any of that time."
13794,"The anxiety continued on from there, I was diagnosed with GAD and tried three different daily medicines before my doctor concluded that my body does not work with having its serotonin levels messed with and he has gone back to the drawing board with trying to figure out a daily pill I can take and leaving me with Xanax for spot treating severe attacks."
13795,So I finally decided to at least try medication.
13796,Do you use meds?
13797,I missed my medication because of this.
13798,I happen to not be taking any medication currently do to the loss of my insurance.
13799,"My own mother had to sneakily do it years ago (she's been taking medication since then, and she hasn't told him about either), and she could possibly help me get an appointment, but I don't know yet."
13800,"Well I decided to go off the meds and let me say this first, THIS IS NOT A HORROR STORY, this is a story of a confused lost kid who went through withdrawals and then started self medicating and is now at a point where I need help and support."
13801,So here goes the story I went to see a psychiatrist to get off the meds.
13802,"Having this time off has made me realize that I DO NOT want to go back on meds, they are scaring me, the only thing I can tolerate well is xanax for panic attacks."
13803,"I need help and I'm sorry if this is TLDR, but to summarize: Went through a ton of bad shit, started feeling enhanced depression/anxiety with pain, broke down, took time off, scared to death of meds anymore."
13804,My anxiety has gotten pretty bad - to the point where I'm contemplating going on medication to help.
13805,"The thing is I'm already on medication for bi-polar AND ADHD/ADD so don't really want another medication, esp."
13806,What types of anti-anxiety meds have you tried/taken and what have the results been?
13807,What of they take my meds off me?
13808,"When I had anxiety symptoms before meds I would think ""aw my man my anxiety is getting bad, but i know im okay"", but sometimes I did worry that I was dying or about to have a heart attack."
13809,"But when I feel my symptoms now that I take meds I think, ""my meds are making my anxiety worse"", ""what if Im allergic to my meds and they make me die?"""
13810,Basically my point is that meds only give me more things to worry about.
13811,Therapy is a fucking God send and some meds should help you tackle the physical symptoms so you don't sweat like a peadophile in a nursey every time the pressures on.
13812,"My family doctor presented me with my options, but I've always felt like I had excellent coping mechanisms and never thought medication was the right path for me."
13813,She is also planning on putting me on an adhd medication like vyvanse after a few weeks if the other medicines work out ok.
13814,I feel like this is a lot of medication to be taking?
13815,"I'm also really worried about the side effects of these medications, and if there are any long term/permanent side effects."
13816,I just want to be a slightly above average person in life and the fact that I have all these problems/take medication disappoints me.
13817,"I go to counseling weekly, and take meds for the anxiety, and it feels like the only thing that is helping is Lorazepam."
13818,Also do anti anxiety medications make you feel less anxious/are they worth it?
13819,"Even if at first I was reticent, I now consider getting a medication to help me out a bit, probably Zoloft."
13820,What are your experiences with medication?
13821,How do you feel under this medication?
13822,"Working on the whole Obamacare thing...I think I need medication, because it's consuming every second of my day."
13823,"Hey guys, considering meds."
13824,I'm curious how you were before vs after meds.
13825,I wanted to ask about medications.
13826,In what ways could my mindset change after starting on these (or similar) medications.
13827,If anyone has used these medications I would appreciate hearing your experiences.
13828,"I've looked into CBT and I would much rather just go about my day with a kick in the butt from some meds than have to go to a therapist on a regular basis while I'm busy with work, school and planning for the future."
13829,"If you are switching between meds, please make sure your Dr checks for interactions between the medications, and make yourself aware of the potential for serotonin syndrome."
13830,"It is not very well recognised in the general medical field, but it is becoming more common with the release of new anxiety meds coming into the market."
13831,"Check for interactions yourself online, look for the half life of your medications to be sure they will be cleared out of your system before starting a new medicine."
13832,I have had to stop all meds until Monday to allow my body to recover and rest.
13833,"So, yeah, if you are changing meds, make sure you have all the information."
13834,"So, like the title says, I forgot to take my meds today."
13835,"(For those who are wondering why I didn't just take my meds later than usual, I didn't realize that I hadn't taken them until after I ate lunch, and I've found that taking my meds after I eat lunch tends to make me throw up, and I just didn't want to have to deal with that today.)"
13836,"I'm trying to make it through today as best I can (which I know I'm capable of, since I've forgotten to take my meds before), but it's tough."
13837,It's almost enough to make a person try to buy meds in Mexico...your thoughts are appreciated.
13838,"I know they say not to trust the internet blah blah and everyone's different, but reading all the negativity about medication is making me nervous."
13839,I finally picked up my Rx and now i'm debating starting the medication until next week because this weekend I have a lot of things planned with friends.
13840,"I'm looking for homeopathic ways of relieving anxiety, since I really want off my medication."
13841,"Then there is the select few, when CBT and medication doesn't seem to have an effect and you're constantly told that it's all in your head and it has to come from you to block the thoughts that consume your life."
13842,"I also feel afraid that there's no medication out there that can make me not depressed, but that's beside the point."
13843,I have had major issues with my sex drive since going on medication.
13844,"She's known me for a majority of my life, so I trust her opinion, but one of the things I'm most afraid of is medication and drugs."
13845,"The only medicine I take is benadryl for my allergies, and ibuprofen if I get a migraine."
13846,"I tried reading other threads, but I'm so unfamiliar with *any* medication, I just got overwhelmed."
13847,Or is there another anti-anxiety medication that goes better with alcohol?
13848,"My anxiety revolves around a phobia of vomit, so I have a constant fear that any medication I take is going to make me feel/be ill."
13849,I feel like I'm crazy but I could really use someone just to tell me that it's ok and that I'll be better in the end when I take these meds.
13850,I forgot to take my meds for a few days (citalopram 20mg) and noticed I was feeling fine.
13851,"I don't know what to do, I don't want to go back to my meds but I'm feeling like crap, I am anxious and angry and sad And I feel like crying (didn't cry recently, though)."
13852,"(sorta unrelated: when I stopped taking my meds I noticed I was sleeping less... 8 hours or less, while before I could easily stay I bed for over 10, 12 hours and still get out of bed feeling very sleepy."
13853,Is this because of the meds?)
13854,"UPDATE: I know, I know I should have gone to a doc first, but I forgot the meds and thought there was no problem..."
13855,"Because he already prescribed my meds reduction once, and things didn't go much differently."
13856,"Frankly, my last attack when I wasn't taking medication was MUCH, MUCH worse than the one I am currently having."
13857,"And last time, I did go to the doctor before stopping my meds."
13858,"I am tired of taking meds and wondering ""is this problem right now... is it me, or is it a side effect of the meds?"
13859,"I always had anxiety issues and by that age it got so bad I would look down from high places and think ""hmmm, what if I jumped from here..."", so, yeah, I went to a doctor and started medication."
13860,"So I have been takings meds,on and off, for over 10 years."
13861,"And have even skipped out on meds thinking I'm better off (awful I know)

Since being medicated I've found an awesome gf (I'm also a girl FYI) who supports me fully."
13862,"I just dont talk to her about my mental health, my meds or my therapist appointments with her."
13863,"This definitely fixed any dehydration issues, but my heart was still racing out of anxiety so they injected a small dosage of lorazepam (an anxiety medication) which calmed me down almost immediately, but had an effect on me for the rest of the day of drowsiness minus the feeling of tiredness."
13864,I need medication or something.
13865,"I suffer from mild anxiety, and I'm on an anti-anxiety medication as well as a benzo (which I don't use often)."
13866,"It's very painful, nauseating, and I'm headache medicine isn't working."
13867,"I'm taking my medicine as normal, and I'm not actively thinking about anything anxiety-inducing when this happens."
13868,"I've tried taking headache medicine with/without caffeine, my normal anti-anxiety medications, tea, sleeping more, exercising, but nothing's working!"
13869,Hello all this isn't my first time posting but it is the first regarding my weight issues.I say it's due to all the medication I'm on but my dr's swear they are all weight nuteral medications.
13870,Either either way I'm on a bunch of meds I've just recently turned 20 and I'm on more pills than most people over 70 I have gone up 6 waist sizes in just over 6 months and I think that this is more depressing than my actual depression.
13871,I even asked my doctor is the medicine would numb me and he assured me it wouldn't but that's exactly what it feels like.
13872,I've lost 30lbs in the last three months from my medicine and from anxiety.
13873,"Basically, over the years I've tried all kinds of medications and tried all kinds of therapy, CBT, hypnotherapy, etc, for depression and severe social anxiety/""AVPD"", and it never helped."
13874,I had four good days and was really hoping that I had finally found the medicine that was going to work for me.
13875,Ive been on a couple of medications throughout the last year but they didn't work that great.
13876,(I am trying to beat these attacks without meds) so about a half hour goes by and I won.
13877,"I've also stopped taking my adhd medication, not because it makes me more anxious, but because I'm too afraid to ask to doctor to start prescribing it again because of the way I may be judged as seeking a high."
13878,So here I go shelling out 300 bucks to see if I get my meds.
13879,"(No insurance)

A good friend of mine is a RN and says the first thing they will do is change my meds."
13880,I'm not a rude guy but I'm simply wanting the current medication without a long process and bill.
13881,"TL;DR : going to psychiatrist for first time, what to expect and will my meds change for sure?"
13882,I would hope to get some sort of situational medication like beta blockers to take before making presentations.
13883,"I make very little money so I think paying for a doctor's visit or even a lot of prescription medication would be rather difficult, but again since I haven't had health insurance for years I have no idea how the process works."
13884,Does the medication help?
13885,My meds do nothing.
13886,"I keep trying and trying, medication after medication, counselor after counselor."
13887,"Another plus, the side-effects of the medication have been almost non-existent."
13888,For years I was very hesitant to look into any medication because I'd heard nothing but horror stories.
13889,I have a check-in appointment in a month to see how I'm doing with the meds.
13890,*tl;dr:* Started anti-anxiety meds.
13891,I don't take meds and normally it's controllable as long as I'm not hungover.
13892,"My question, and hopefully someone can help me out here, is what can I do to bring my anxiety down, I'm not on any medication because everyone thinks this is just something I'll get over."
13893,Just wondering if anyone else has ever felt these symptoms..not necessarily because of medications but just because of their anxiety?
13894,( I know its not from my medications because they have been there before and they are still here).
13895,"I'm going to a therapist, who suggested that anxiety medicine will help supplement my therapy."
13896,"My boyfriend is from a country that views going to the therapist or taking any anxiety/depression medication as only someone ""crazy"" or ""weak"" will do (his words)."
13897,How do I tell him that I want to start taking anxiety medicine and explain it in a way that has him really understand why I'm making this decision?
13898,I'm afraid to  try to take it quickly so I won't worry about it the build-up because I may worry after and make myself short of breath and then blame it on the meds.
13899,I feel better but I feel like I am to young to be needing this medicine.
13900,On my senior trip it happened and I had to bring a mattress into the bathroom and sleep on the bathroom floor when I could finally calm down with no medicine.
13901,He gave me a few options and I chose to do a combination of medication (anti depressants of some kind) and CBT.
13902,I'll be starting those in a few weeks (I'm having surgery and he wants me to wait until after to start the medication).
13903,"I was wondering if anyone wanted to share any tips/experiences with either medications or CBT, as this is all really new for me."
13904,I have a strange anxiety/fear of taking new medications.
13905,Even meds I have taken before without any issues I am still anxious about taking.
13906,Cbt didnt help and meds make it worse.
13907,"My brother has an extremely severe case because anti-depressants completely fucked him up and made him so much worse, so taking any kind of medication is out of the question."
13908,"I am currently conducting some research (For my Postgraduate MSc HPaB Psychology degree) on Depression/Anxiety and I would be very, very grateful if members who are currently taking medications would take a moment to complete the survey in the link below."
13909,"The broad goal of my research is to examine the different classes of anti-depressant medications in relation to side effects, specifically addressing the severity level, type and tolerability of side effects in relation to medication BNF classification (the pharmacological body which classifies antidepressants into categories depending on the primary proposed mechanism for how the medication works)."
13910,I have been on medicine.
13911,"I was diagnosed with anxiety problems at a young age, and I've had huge avoidance problems ever since, so much as destroying my school career, and I was on medication for a long, long time for both anxiety and depression."
13912,"I got off of the meds a couple years ago and I feel like I'm much better off, the weird thing is I have a hard time remembering most of what went on during the time I was on the meds, but I know my behavior had gotten much better."
13913,"It's to the point now that, while I remember in the past not having any problems just saying ANYTHING to people I thought were my friends, to a degree that I regret it and I blame on the meds I was taking (since I was an awful freak holy shit), but I don't feel comfortable asking my parents for help."
13914,"I've tried meds, but in the same classes - MAOIs interact with my other meds and SSRIs don't do anything, good or bad... which is apparently a fault of not being on the right one or for long enough... but it leaves me wondering about the significance of side-effects, in particular."
13915,"After about an hour on the road, I realized I forgot my meds - Wellbutrin 300mg."
13916,"I considered turning around, but thought I would just have my girlfriend FedEx the meds to my destination rather than add another 2 hours of driving onto my trip."
13917,I'm back home now and have taken my meds and am thinking more rationally now.
13918,My father doesn't know I have been taking meds.
13919,"so my doctor prescribed me buspar for my anxiety, and my mom said I shouldn't take it everyday, like other medications."
13920,"My concern is that this medication has been a lifesaver for me, and I want to use it responsibly."
13921,Has anyone noticed a difference with heart beat while on medication?
13922,"When I give them medication, I stay awake all night checking that they are still alive."
13923,Is this developing into *another* fuckin' mental disorder or do you think this is just the medication fucking around with me?
13924,How different are the meds ?
13925,"However, I am particularly apprehensive about being overwhelmed with anxiety next semester, and am considering taking meds to get a better hold of my life."
13926,I know only my therapist would have the best idea whether meds (and which ones) would be a good choice and each individual's situation is unique.
13927,"However, as I have never taken medication for any reason in my life up to this point, I was wondering if /r/anxiety could give me any idea of what to expect, to do, and possibly avoid."
13928,TLDR; I am a mad stressed out college student who had never taken anxiety meds.
13929,"I suggested we see a psychiatrist and she said, ""All they do is prescribe medicine, you need to talk to someone about your problems""."
13930,I improved a lot over summer and got on medication and then felt ready to come back but now I can feel the stress creeping back in.
13931,"I'm not sure what to do, I'm going to see my uni doc to tell her I'm on medication so she can monitor my dosage (saw her for anxiety last year but was prescribed meds at home) and I'm seeing my tutor next week for advice on support the uni can give me (she knows the score and I had special circumstances in last year which gave me consideration on borderline pass grades, extensions and uncapped resits) 

The feelings of worthlessness and of ""omgicantdothisiwanttorunhometosafetyevenifitmeansbeingaNEETwasteofspace"" are creeping back and I'm scared."
13932,Taking meds is not an option.
13933,I am seeing a psychiatrist this week but really don't want to go back on any meds since it's been maybe 3 months.
13934,"I tried medication, and it gave me such a severe anxiety attack that I became delusional and tried to kill myself."
13935,I stopped taking my meds for awhile (they were low dose to begin with) but plan on going back on them because I'm still having problems with my social phobia.
13936,What I'm wondering is what are things you do to deal with your anxiety other than using medication?
13937,tl;dr - what are other ways of dealing with my anxiety in addition to medication.
13938,"Being that I'm a bit skeptical of psychiatric medication, I chose to ""train"" myself to be able to talk myself down from panic attacks and they eventually went away for a while."
13939,"I expressed my desire to take a ""rescue"" medication on an as needed basis."
13940,I don't want daily medication.
13941,"Any and all thoughts, opinions, advice on this medicine would be appreciated!"
13942,So today i decided to reset my sleep schedule because it was effecting the times i was taking my medication.
13943,I didn't understand why medication for ADD could help me to deal with my anxiety.
13944,I'm completely off any meds for three months now and I'm not too good.
13945,"I started seeing a succession of psychiatrists and trying various meds, few of them helped, but it did help to feel like I was doing something about my mental illness."
13946,"it's so odd... it could be because of meds I've taken, I've taken a lot over the past few days."
13947,meds I've taken...
13948,"Aside from anxiety medicine, any tips or tricks?"
13949,I do have anxiety and I am taking medication for it which seems to help.
13950,"However, now I'm pregnant, so any meds are completely out."
13951,I've been exercising and taking medication from my doctor (gone through maybe 7 different pills) and I still feel like I'm dying.
13952,Looking for peoples experience with medicine to combat anxiety and depression that won't cause horrific side effects.
13953,I went without meds for a few months until I decided to go back to him and he gave me bupropion/welbutrin.
13954,"She got me a laptop desk since I don't have one,  a cellphone case and helped me get my meds."
13955,"i saw my doctor last week and he suggested i get a companion animal to help with the action plan we made to tackle my anxiety (which also includes taking medication to help me)

my husband and i do not yet have an animal of any kind, as we are not allowed to have one in our rented home."
13956,"I’ve been on medication before, and it has worked *fairly* well for me (Zoloft with a Xanax on the side for really tough days), although I’m a sexless, useless zombie during the first 4-6 weeks."
13957,"I take a drug that has a rare side effect
	They tell me it will help me sleep through the night
	They tell me that it will calm me down
	They tell me that it will all be okay
		Just take your medicine
	I walk when I am feeling low
	Just to a park around the corner
		It doesn't attract a lot of people
			There are corners I can hide in
				I write there."
13958,"after experimenting with a few different meds, my new psychologist just prescribed me Zoloft."
13959,"I don't want to start right with medicine, and I started therapy last week with my next appointment this coming Monday."
