As if being stuck in a living hell constructed in my own mind would be a much better alternative...\\n\\nSo anyone else has experience dealing with close family members insisting on not following doctor's instructions? I have a feeling that this will only get worse from now on since she's also looking up all sorts of alternative medicine bullshit for OCD now...\", \"I'm not sure where to start. I've been lurking here for a while and I guess I finally felt the need to post. I'll start by saying I'm 34 with 2 beautiful daughters. They've helped me more than anytning.  I've had several failed marriages. They ended either from them cheating or abuse. I always tried the best I could and it was never good enough. I'm not very social. My anxiety creates facades that no one likes me or judging me. The relationship I'm in now has created a few anxiety problems for me once again. With everything I've been through I keep worrying about us too. Whether he's happy and if he'll stay. If he wants to marry me even down to if he likes my kids or cooking. I don't know how to explain it. I just know I'm tired of living with the burden of constant worry. I've tried medications but they only made me feel like a zombie and going to sit down with a therapist only increases my anxiety. The thought sucks. I don't know what to do but the constant checking on my boyfriend with worry hell be like the rest or looking for problems when there isn't any is driving me crazy. \", \"I'm a 23 year old female and I've been battling severe anxiety (and depression) since I was 10. I got my first anxiety attack when I was 11 and it has been a downhill road since then. \\n\\nI've been through my share of doctors, therapy, emergency room visits, diagnoses, breakdowns, etc. I was severely crippled by my anxiety and depression throughout my college career. I finally received my degree but I'm paying for my past mistakes. \\n\\nI finally found a psychiatrist who realizes how my bad my anxiety and OCD is and he prescribed me ativan (0.5mg, as needed). I'm supposed to take 1 tablet every 12 hours (as needed). I'm against taking medication after what I had to deal with in the past but I realized this is my only option to get better.\\n\\nHowever, I feel like it's not really helping me. I'm going through a really tough time in my life right now and I've been crying almost everyday. I can't deal with this along with the shaking, grinding my teeth, repetitive thoughts, you name it. I'm getting so sick of being like this. Anyone who meets me can sense my anxiety. I'm a damn mess and I don't know how to fix myself.\\n\\nI always have that sense of impending doom. I hyperventilate a lot. When I get really bad I experience hypervigilance after. The nightmares come and go, but I always have trouble sleeping. \\n\\nI don't know where I'm going with this. I guess I'm progressively getting worse again and I don't know what to do. I have no friends. I have no job. I have nothing going for me after years of battling mental illness. I'm still broken and I don't know what to do next. I see my doctor next week and I don't know what to tell him about these meds. He tried going me SSRIs before the ativan, but I had REALLY bad side effects within the first week and had to stop.\\n\\nWhat the hell do I do now? Thank you for reading this. :(\", \"A bit of a strange question, I suppose, but here goes:\\n\\nI've been really trying to focus on getting off of any anti-anxiety medication and overcoming/dealing with this in a more natural way and I really think I've had a lot of success.  Today I woke and realized that the last few days I haven't had to be thinking of ways to deal with panic and anxiety - *because I've been feeling much better!*  ...This thought somehow made me more anxious.  It's like part of me is afraid to let go of this anxiety - I've known it all my life and it's such a different way to think that somehow it felt unnatural and therefore wrong.  How do I break out of this?  I feel like this is one of the key pieces to really being able to let this go.  It's just such a strange sensation... and I'm not sure many people without anxiety would understand the feeling.  Hell I don't even understand it.\", \"Has anyone ever had this experience that nothing seemed real? I'm currently getting off lexapro and I've had this happen to me before I was on this medication.

My sister died of a long battle with cancer when I was 12. I didn't really like going to therapy, I felt it didn't help me. About 6 months ago, my parents told me they're getting a divorce, and that's made every single family situation awkward. I hardly see my dad much anymore.\\n\\nRecently, I've been getting horrible anxiety attacks. Most happen in school. It'll start with a back pain, or a headache, and work it's way into `oh fuck now i have cancer i'm going to die`.  It's interfering with my schoolwork, too. I'll get attacks in most of my classes, and it's a battle to stay focused until I can get up and leave and just walk around to calm down. Sometimes I shake so bad in my seat, people will start to look at me.\\n\\nI don't usually eat, sometimes I go a day without eating at all. And most of the time when I do eat, I get really nauseous. Bright lights also bother me now for some reason.\\n\\nI've been going to another therapist I kind of like, I've gone twice. Though, it isn't really helping. I honestly think the only thing left that would help me is some sort of medication. I've talked to my mom about it and she says that I probably don't need it and if I do, the therapist will prescribe some to me.\\n\\nHow can I make it clear to whoever can actually give me them that I want to try medication? Do I even need it?\", \"I've always what I'd consider moderate anxiety, I don't need medication, but I'm starting to consider it.

Does any one have any advice to help myself from falling off the 'cliff'?\\n\\nI'm currently seeing a doctor, but it doesn't seem to be making a huge difference. \", \"Hey everyone. I've been lurking here for around a month or two now, and I've made multiple threads on throwaway accounts.

I think without all the encouragement and support here, I'd be in a much worse place right now.\\n\\nI scheduled a GP appointment last week and he diagnosed me with anxiety and panic disorder and referred me to a psych for further evaluation and medication and a therapist. My first therapist appt will be next week and I'm sure it'll be a long and hard journey, but I'm super excited! \\n\\nI feel like I'm finally getting my life on track again in terms of emotional health.

Some anxiety I will last a day with  one anxiety lasting a few months that is my main focus until I can sort it out and it goes away.

My old doctor told me I had no other mental health issue and I had been doing much better, but now to why I am really posting. \\n\\nRecently my husband and I have been struggling with bills, getting school stuff together and saving to move out of the south soon along with that has come a new anxiety. I have been worried if I am happy enough in life, am I depressed, will I be one day, what if one day I kill myself at some point in life, something I hate the thought of. My husband (who has mild depression) says I am not depressed because I always want to go and do and can't stand laying about the house, and I am never sad until I think about these worries. I can't afford a consular right now or medication. So my question is do other people have this sort of anxiety because I haven't seen any post similar to this, and it would just comfort me to know others feel the same. I just can't tell if I am making a normal small worry huge or if I am truly becoming extremely unhappy, its hard to find reality in anxiety sometimes.\\n\\n\", 'I have a nearly impossible time saying no to anyone asking for my help. Over the last few years I have babysat for several of my friends that have children (my husband and I do not have children, although we would very much like to. It just has not worked out for us yet.) I have a friend whose children are a bit out of control. The last time I watched them the two year old split her head open because she jumped off a box while I walked to the kitchen to get the older child (5 - boy) a glass of water. While trying to assess the situation the older child kept demanding that I take care of his needs (wanting a glass of water) with no regard to his sister at all. I called my friend to let her know what was happening, but instead of coming right home she stopped to have dinner with her husband making her hours later than she told me she would be back in the first place. This also ruined my weekend plans as I was planning on leaving town that night but that is a different story all together. I do have extreme social anxiety to begin with (which is part of the reason I find it near impossible to say no) I have also felt guilty babysitting for other friends in fear that it will get back to her. I know that most of my anxiety is irrational but I feel that in this one instance it is justified anxiety. I do not want to hurt her feelings, and especially as a non parent come off as judgmental of her children or her parenting. This last time she asked I explained that I was getting my anxiety medicine adjusted a few days before she needed me to watch them and maybe it would be easier for me. Honestly, I thought she would tell me not to worry about it and to just feel better and let her know if I am up to it anytime in the future. Of coarse that is not how it worked out. So I am here ranting :) If anyone has any advice, I would love to hear it. Otherwise, thanks for listening to me rant!! ', \"I've been working with my doctor over the past few months to treat my anxiety. I first went it wanting to treat my anxiety which has plagued me for a while but only recently got worse, and he prescribed me some meds. Since then each med I've tried has given me some side effect and when I go to talk to him he gives me another to try.\\n\\nAfter about the fifth med he said lets just throw that all out and go for psychotherapy. Problem being, the area I'm in is extremely underserved for psychiatrists and therapists and I have to go with a hospital group that has pay on a sliding scale for uninsured/poor people, and the only one anywhere close is apparently booked for two months.\\n\\nI've put thought into it, and I still want to attempt to treat it my anxiety with medication, if the option is still viable.\\n\\nMy question is: should I wait until a psychiatrist becomes available, two months from now and go talk to them? Or should I go back to the doctor and tell him I want to keep trying medication? Or, perhaps, should I try and find a different doctor in the area and get a second opinion?\\n\\n\\nThe medications I've tried are\\n\\nFluoxetine: Horrible nausea: lasted all day and interrupted work. Though were I not working I might've been able to put up with it for a while.\\n\\nBuspirone: Caused me increased heart rate and anxiety, headache and light headedness, though only once I moved up to 15 mg after starting out on a lower dose and gradually moving up.\\n\\nTrazodone: Started at half a pill, moved up to full pill after a week. Caused me panic attacks right before bed.\\n\\nParoxetine: I don't actually remember why I stopped this one. Might've also been nausea, but I can't recall.\\n\\nCymbalta: Awful nausea and extreme drowsiness. Basically slept for two and a half days after one pill.\\n\\n\\nI'm currently taking clonazepam whenever I have a panic attack and just going about my daily life. But I'd really like to feel like I'm at least taking steps towards improving my life.\", '**Actual experiences with meds will be quoted, background story will be in regular text. **\\n\\nHey guys, I\\'m a victim of hereditary anxiety. I\\'m guessing the right term would be GAD because I have no reason to be anxious, life is going dandy for me. Nothing great, but nothing bad at all with it. And I was/am chronically anxious, every single day. One day it would be the shaky nervous anxiety, the next it would be the \"I\\'m about to throw up/diarrhea\" anxiety, and then the next would be the \"Where am I, why are the walls moving, am I in a dream?\" anxiety.\\n\\n&gt;Anyway, I only took clonazepam because my mom had it on hand once when I was having a really bad attack and near forced me to take it. I was worried it would make me feel even worse. To my surprise, it worked. With no side effect other than feeling sedated a little bit. Now I know that clonazepam is not something you take everyday ( I mean you can.. ) but it\\'s something more for emergencies/situational use. Plus I knew I was building a tolerance fast. Only after 5-6 dosages of 0.25mg\\'s, what used to make me feel sedated and crash out now doesn\\'t even affect me. So I had to get onto a maintenance pill. \\n\\n&gt;Paxil was my doctor\\'s first choice. I don\\'t know how many mg\\'s the pill was but I took half before bed. I fell asleep, and within an hour I woke up like I was on crack. (I\\'ve never used before, I\\'m just assuming.) My whole body was one giant tremor, I stumbled to my parents room because I thought something insane was happening. They calmed me down and let met sleep on their floor in case I had more trouble. I just remember being eyes wide open and my mind just racing. I tried very hard to fall asleep, I closed my eyes and in what felt like a blink 1am turned into 6am and I was wide awake. I did not feel groggy, I didn\\'t feel like I slept at all. The next day was spent not being able to close my eye lids for more than a couple seconds and constantly shaking a limb. Mentally, this medication made me feel like a zombie. I couldn\\'t be depressed/anxious because I couldn\\'t focus on what was making me sad at the time. In fact I couldn\\'t think about anything for more than 2 seconds without my mind switching to some other topic. I couldn\\'t be sad, but I couldn\\'t be happy either.\\n\\nThis all was when I was about 17. Today I\\'m 20, near 21, and my anxiety has come back full force. But in a different way. Over the years I\\'ve noticed myself being sluggish, feeling like my brain wasn\\'t on or something was wrong with me. But I didn\\'t associate those feelings with anxiety since the only anxiety attacks I\\'ve had were panic attacks. Feeling nervous and shakey. Now my anxiety attacks are mellow but not in a better way. Everyday for a couple weeks I spent in bed feeling ill to my stomach. I was very dizzy and lightheaded, and confused at times. I had this feeling that you get right before you\\'re about to puke and you want your mommy and daddy. The feeling that didn\\'t know that paper was due or that the final was today. Constantly scared, but for no reason. I\\'ve been a vegetable in my bed for the passed few weeks. I never registered for classes next semester, because I couldn\\'t even fathom going to class in the state that I\\'m in. And I\\'ve been avoiding going to work a lot. (I have a very tolerant and flexible boss and little financial responsibility at the moment, thankfully)\\n\\nSo I went back to the doctor, said I\\'m not having that Paxil experience again. He prescribes me Buspar. Many hate it or don\\'t care for it, and little love it with a passion. It has many reviews, and they are so mixed. Some people it made nervous and even more anxious, some people said it made them pass out into a pool of their own drool, some say they hallucinated. But whether people said they hated it because of bad reactions, it did nothing for them and they think it\\'s a sugar pill, or it was a miracle drug that turned their life around, they all had one thing in common. It made them incredibly dizzy. I absolutely did not want this, dizziness to me is like being on a roller coaster you can\\'t get off of. And if I was dizzy, for sure I would be nauseous.\\n\\n&gt; So, being so traumatized by Paxil and not wanting to be dizzy, I literally took a chip off the end of the 5mg pill(The lowest dosage it comes in and I only took half of a half, of a half) and tried to keep my mind off the potential side effects. I was on my phone when I noticed it sort of \"hit\". The phone\\'s colors were a little more vibrant and exaggerated and everything just felt a little odd. Nothing enough to make me freak out yet. I then began yawning over and over for a good 5 minutes and felt like taking a nap, so I did. I woke up from this nap incredibly energized almost like I was on Paxil. But it didn\\'t make me freak out like Paxil did, I just felt like I drank a ton of coffee and I could run 10 miles. My jaw was a little sore though, I think I was grinding my teeth while I was sleeping which has never happened. And while I was awake I caught myself chewing the inside of my cheek or my tongue quite a few times. But the anxiety and dizziness/confusion was gone. I thought to myself, this drug isn\\'t addictive, it\\'s very cheap and if I can build up a tolerance to where I\\'m not being shocked by overwhelming energy, then I\\'ll definitely enjoy life again while on it.\\n\\n&gt;This feeling lasted all the way until night time, but wore off a little. I actually had no trouble going to sleep though. The next day I was still feeling it (I know it has a short half life, but I\\'ve never had energy like this, I wan\\'t to believe it was this med) and being at a lower level of unnecessary energy, I was feeling actually really good. No more confusion, no more dizziness, I felt almost euphoric. Grin from ear to ear. I thought to myself, \"Is this how normal people feel? Have I just been mentally suppressed my whole life?\" I did have a moment of sadness though, because I thought for a second about how this may not last. How tomorrow I may feel just as bad as I felt a couple days ago. I did not take a pill that day, because I still had a lot of energy from taking the crumb of the pill the day before. Needless to say, I was back to square one the day after. I took the crumb again, and the anxiety went away, I got really happy again and motivated, but the power rush didn\\'t come back. It did give me energy, but not overpowering how it was before. Like mentioned above, I was in my happy place. The day after that is today. I took another crumb, a little bigger this time. And felt happy and motivated with no anxiety. Although this time within 7-8 hours the anxiety was coming back, where as it lasted 2 days the first time, and all day the second time.\\n\\nNow I have an issue.. It\\'s depressing me a lot to think that for me to be happy in life, that I\\'m going to have to take this pill every single day. That I\\'m not the reason that I\\'m happy, it\\'s these pills. I\\'m not truly happy, it\\'s just artificial. It\\'s not fixing my unbalanced chemicals, it\\'s synthetically boosting me and it\\'s not natural to feel this euphoric. What if I forget my pills on a trip one day? Why can\\'t I be happy.. by myself? These are questions that are sort of putting me down.', \"I am a 19 year old female diagnosed with a GAD and depression. BUT I currently do not take any medication at all for either.

I start getting anxious, avoiding my classes, avoiding my professors, generally running away from help.  The anxiety is only heightened by the lengths I go to in order not to confront it.

I went over to my male companion\\'s apartment to watch fireworks and things between us just felt weird. We haven\\'t been dating long and we\\'re certainly not serious, but the weird feeling got to me.\\n\\nMonday, I went back to the lab I work in after being off and my professor is pressing me to get my paper published. Stressor 1. I also recently found out my first deadline for applying to medical school is August instead of October. Stressor 2. When I asked my professor if he can write me a recommendation letter and review my personal statement, he asks for my deadline and I reply August. He says that he would normally want TWO MONTHS for revisions. But just get all my materials to him ASAP. Stressor 3. After all this and being on the verge of a panic attack for 2+ hours, I have to go around and ask other professors for recommendation letters. Stressor 4.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the last couple days I have been really high strung. In the back of my head, I am sure male companion is tired of me and doesn\\'t want to see me anymore. I know that\\'s not true, but that doesn\\'t matter. He\\'s leaving town this week and when I asked if I would get to see him before he left he replied, \"If you want to.\" IN my brain that meant I was twisting his arm behind his back to get him to see me, that it was a chore to spend time with me. Then I get back to my apartment and get an email from my professor after he read my personal statement. He started out saying it was readable and entertaining. But then he goes onto say that it doesn\\'t really get to the heart of why I want to go into medicine and then questions why I want to be a doctor. Cue downward spiral of negativity and self-loathing.

I should not be this stressed out.\\n\\nTL;DR - I\\'m stressed please give me internet hugs.', 'Two years ago I started seeing a psychiatrist because of panic attacks.  They started when I turned 30.  The first doctor that I saw gave me Klonopin as well as a few other drugs.  A few months later I moved and found another doctor.  That doctor did the same.  My doctor gave me Klonopin and other drugs for 2 years.\\n\\nLast week I had a discussion with doctor about marijuana.  She told me that I had THC in my drug screen.  I reminded her that we had talked about marijuana multiple times within the past few years and that I was happy it actually made me feel good.  \\n\\nWell, the doctor didn\\'t remember any of those conversations (even though they were all in my medical records that she typed herself) and began to scold me for using what she called, \"the joint\".\\n\\nShe then went on to tell me that I do not have anxiety or any type of panic disorder.  Instead she said that every symptom I\\'ve ever discussed with her was because of marijuana and that she would no longer give me any medication.\\n\\nI was dumbfounded, I didn\\'t know what to do.  I smoke marijuana, it makes me feel a lot better when I\\'m tense, when I have headaches, when I have chest pain, etc, etc.  I don\\'t smoke it very often but it\\'s nice to have around when I want to ensure I have a relaxing evening.\\n\\nRegardless of that, I\\'m now someone who has taken 3mg of Klonopin a day for two years and has been forced to stop taking it cold turkey.  I am afraid of the withdrawal side effects which has made my anxiety much worse.  I\\'m going to do my best to find another doctor but I\\'m afraid that I\\'m going to look like a shopper and they are going to deny helping me.\\n\\nWhat can I do?\\n\\nAlso, do I have a leg to stand on in regards to marijuana making someone with anxiety feel better?  I know it makes me feel better and I\\'ve seen people here discuss how it made them feel better but is there any medical documentation anywhere discussing this?  I\\'ve seen medical studies that showed marijuana increased anxiety for some patients.  I understand that.  I\\'ve smoked too much pot before and it made me feel pretty shitty.  However, it never made me feel like I feel when I have a panic attack.  \\n\\nI don\\'t know where to start with this thing and any advice would be greatly appreciated.  ', 'I\\'ll make a long story short. \\n\\nI have Pure O and generalized anxiety.\\n\\nFrom 2005-2007 I dated a girl who was my first love.  We started college together.  But we broke up in 2007 because she thought we were fighting too much.  (I honestly can\\'t remember in retrospect).  I was heartbroken, though, and I never remember being that happy in my life since then.  She started dating and went on to marry one of my best friends.  I don\\'t have contact with her or him anymore.\\n\\nWe broke up in January and I was devastated.  In October of that year (2007) I started dating someone else after having lost about 60 lbs.  We got engaged the following summer.  The idea that I was still in rebound never hit me, but we grew apart as she wanted to party and I had quit drinking.  \\n\\nI was single for the next two years and then I started dating my most recent ex.  She has severe anxiety issues, a history of drug abuse, etc.  She was a wonderful person.  But we, with our anxiety and problems, ended up being emotionally abusive to one another.  It got to where I felt I couldn\\'t get out and had to involve an outside party and the police.  I developed stress-induced hypothyroidism as a result and I took about 6 or 7 months to recover from that (my weight had gone up about 80 lbs since my initial loss so I got up close to 290).  \\n\\nI took time off from school and work after the relationship ended and my parents were a big help to me as I got my thyroid meds in order and started losing weight.  I\\'ve lost 50 lbs since the middle of this past December.  \\n\\nI went on a first date with a girl I met from Match.com last night.  It was amazing.  I felt like I was with my high school girlfriend all over again.  We talked for seven hours.  She normally goes to bed at 9.  She stayed up til 2 and we just talked to one another and it was awesome.  I gave her a hug and we talked about going out again after she gets back from a trip she is taking this week (she leaves tomorrow).  \\n\\nShe texted me good morning today and told me that even though she was gonna be busy she wanted to just say \"have a good day :).\"  I texted her back later and told her I was gonna be at a local coffeehouse if she wanted to stop on her way out of town and grab a cup with me in the morning.  She didn\\'t text back for about 5 hours and I sent another that just said, \"If not its not a big deal, just figured since I would be in the area I would ask :) and how did packing go?\" or something along those lines.  She texted me back later telling me sorry she had been busy and was now at the concert she had planned on going to with her mom, etc and that she \"definitely would like to\" get coffee but she \"didn\\'t think she\\'d have time :(\" in the morning.\\n\\nShe stayed out super late talking to me and we couldn\\'t stop laughing and being goofy with each other all night, and I haven\\'t had that much fun with girl since almost 10 years.  Today, I just couldn\\'t stop obsessing about it.  Thinking how I had fucked things up somehow or that I was being an idiot or that something terrible was going to happen.  \\n\\nAnd then it hit me today that I hadn\\'t even been in love since that first girlfriend.  That I just wanted someone to be with or accept me and that the girls I was confiding were just getting more and more damaged and broken [not that there\\'s anything wrong with them].  And then here I am today, having lost 50 lbs, out of an abusive relationship for almost a year, and I am absolutely fucking terrified I\\'m going to destroy it.\\n\\nI can\\'t focus on exercise or my little schoolwork I have left or just take my mind off of it because I finally have something like I used to have and I\\'m scared its all going to end.  I just want it to be okay and I just want to not worry about it.  \\n\\nEnd rant.\\n\\n', 'I really hate doing this but it seems like anybody that i talk to doesn\\'t really understand, so i guess I\\'m just going to go off here.

It is really difficult for me to hang out with friends not just because im at work half the time but just the thought of going out to a party or anywhere full of people makes me freak out.

I have xanax from a friend so I was taking quarter of a bar when I woke up in the morning before work and I had a small hour long window where I was a little sleepy and loopy and then I was fine for the rest of the day. I wake up 2 hours before I go to work to get ready and the xanax times perfect so I'm not feeling like that right as I'm leaving for work. My doc said she doesn't want me driving within the first 4 hours of taking the klonopin because it will make me drowsy. Would you guys recommend taking it before bed at night and see how it carries over the next day? Or should I set my alarm an extra 2 hours before I usually wake up to take it and then go back to bed? I'm sure I'll have to try a few things out and see how I'll feel but I could use advice on how you guys time everything with your meds so you're not feeling like a dopy mess at the wrong time. Thanks!\", \"Hi guys, \\n\\nI've had an acute (but severe) anxiety disorder for about 15 years now (I'm 30). I have been with my partner (who's also 30) for for 12 years and married for 7. \\n\\nMy disorder is really only an issue going into new workplace environments, however these attacks are incredibly severe, almost to the point debilitation. This is due to some very traumatic experiences I had entering the workplace as a teenager. \\n\\nOn the plus side, during these past 12 years I have overcome my anxiety and successfully held down a couple jobs for some significant periods of time. \\n\\nOn the negative side, due to the severity of this disorder I have also let some of other jobs go as I was simply unable to cope with it. Overall I think my disorder has cost me 5 or 6 jobs.\\n\\nUp until recently my wife has always been a never-ending source or strength, love &amp; support for me. However a couple of years ago I had a particularly bad attack when I was about to start working a new full-time job. Long story short, I ended up not getting this job (because of my anxiety) &amp; my wife not long after had a nervous breakdown. She has always been the main income earner in our relationship and after not being able to keep a good-paying full-time job it all became a bit too much for her. In her words, she broke. As she explained to me not long afterwards she is desperate for me have to a consistent income. She was then put on some pretty strong medication.\\n\\nFast forward to this year and things have slowly grown more distant between us. I have started working what is essentially my dream job however it is only between 15-20 per week and the pay isn't that great. So, I went out to find another casual job to help bring in that little extra. Sadly, when I got this other job I yet again had extreme anxiety for a few days. It was at this point my wife gave me an ultimatum that I needed to make this job work or our marriage maybe over. \\n\\nAs I'm sure most of you will understand having that added pressure hanging over me made the task of starting this new job made it that much more difficult. But, after a few days I did overcame my anxiety and am now currently work 2 jobs and bringing in a relatively regular income.\\n\\nI was so proud of this achievement and thought that this might be the start of a turning point for us.  \\n\\nHowever after a long and difficult discussion last night my wife confessed that while she is happy about me overcoming my anxiety and sticking with this job she no longer feels she has anything more to give me in terms of support and patience when it come to dealing with my disorder. On top of that due to my sporadic incomes over the past 12 years she does not ever see us being able to have children and on top of that she feels a big part of her breakdown &amp; subsequently being on medication is because of me and the trauma she's experienced watching &amp; having to constantly support me having such horrible panic attacks. She told me that whenever she thinks of a future with me, she is now filled with sadness &amp; insecurity.\\n\\nWe do both still love each other intensely but I just don't think she  can see a positive future with someone like me. She is making an appointment to see a psychologist today in the hope of helping her clarify her thoughts and then we will go from there. She has also suggested that we may need to separate temporarily for now, while she gets herself together in this way. Which I said I was willing to do.\\n\\nSo that's it basically. I am absolutely terrified by the thought of losing my wife, to the point where it makes me physically sick. I cannot imagine my life without her but her happiness trumps all of that and maybe we would be both better off in the long run to go our separate ways permanently if she cannot overcome how she feels about a future together with me. I'm doing everything I possibly can make things better but right now it just doesn't seem like enough and I don't know what to do.\\n\\nThat's it, any feedback or advise is of course appreciated.

I had what I guess was pure-ocd. I got really bad attacks because I thought I had contracted horrible diseases, and then once I'd learned to control that, I got attacks because I thought I was somehow gay without my knowing.\\n\\nI learned to control that too I guess. But then a year or two later, around two years ago, I started getting pretty bad general anxiety. I started getting what I guess is agoraphobia, I'd get really panicky if I felt I couldn't easily escape from somewhere, even just hanging out with friends.\\n\\nThis culminated with a really bad panic attack when I went out of town by myself. Long story short, it convinced me to seek professional help and I started antidepressants.\\n\\nIn January of this year I stopped taking them. I don't know why, really. I guess I'd started to feel too comfortable on them, started to take how I felt for granted. Depression came back hard, but also the anxiety, which I've always had more trouble dealing with.\\n\\nI'm lonely, I've always been lonely. Today I saw this girl I fancy probably for the last time. I couldn't make a move. And I'm losing sleep over it.\\n\\nI've been having a lot of anxiety about how I've wasted my youth. I'm 24 and I have nothing to show for it. No degree, no social life, nothing. It's been keeping me up at night. I'm planning to spend the next 4 years getting a degree, but now I've started getting anxiety about that. I'm going to be almost 30 when I graduate. Christ.\\n\\nThe health anxiety has been coming back too. A few years ago I learned I have mild Tourette's. It waxes and wanes but it causes me some anxiety, like I'm afraid it'll get worse one day and I'll be full blown like the people in those shows. Swearing uncontrollably. Anyway I saw a movie earlier and I think another person in the theatre had Tourette's, they were coughing and clearing their throat through the whole movie, and it got me thinking about my tics, and then the cycle started and I was pretty anxious through the whole movie.\\n\\nI'm back on my meds now, but a lower dose. I'm hopeful that the anxiety will subside, but holy fuck. It's brought me nearly to tears. Something I'd hoped was behind me for good.\", \"I spent my morning in the ER today because I woke up with extreme back pain and was unable to feel part of my left leg. It's all numb in one area. The ER doctor gave me muscle relaxants and some pain meds and referred me to a neurologist because they suspect I have some nerve damage. My partner is out of town for the week and doesn't even know whats going on because he doesn't have access to internet or phone until after 8. I feel like I'm all alone right now with no one to comfort me. All of my friends and family live hours away and aren't here to support me. Does anyone else crave company when they're having an anxiety attack creeping up? I like being around others as support and a distraction. It makes it easier to keep those negative thoughts at bay. I just keep obsessing and worrying what if it's something serious? My mind is racing and jumping to all of these ideas, each one worse than the one before. Being around people or having a distraction helps me ignore those intrusive thoughts. Anyway, I guess I'm rambling now. Sorry.\", \"So I lied to my girlfriend. I know its wrong.

I have been having disruptive bouts with itchy skin for about 8 months. There have been times when I\\'ve felt about [ ] this close to a breakdown over it, and have often ended up crying and in a panic attack. \\n\\nI\\'ve gone through all the possible causes I can think of:\\n\\n- I thought it was dry skin for awhile, but no creams/soaps/lotions/etc. help even a little bit. \\n\\n- I thought it was environmental, some allergen at my home, so my husband and I gutted our apt. had the carpets cleaned, washed everything with sensitive laundry soap, and still no luck. Also made no sense that my husband has no symptoms like mine.\\n\\n- I finally went to my dr. and she thought it could be something I was eating... however this seemed very unlikely to me, as I have an extremely varied diet and I thought for sure I would have noticed if there was a link there. But, I did try to eliminate things I\\'d been eating more of, like coffee, and still no change.\\n\\nSo, long story short, I mentioned it to my sister, who replied, \"OH I had that too! It stopped after I finished school and quit my stressful job.\" !! \\n\\nI have had a pretty intense year... over a year ago, my other sister left home and cut off our family, so that has been stressful. I\\'ve felt very discontent at work for over two years, and finally decided to go back to school online to get my degree and get out—which hasn\\'t really helped with the situation presently, but has added extra stress/time constraints. I also recently saw my doctor about depression, probably induced by all these factors, and she subscribed 5-HTP which I have been taking for nearly three weeks now. \\n\\nSo with that new suggestion, I\\'ve begun to see strong links between my stress and anxiety level and the itching. Since taking 5-HTP I\\'ve still had some itching attacks, but they are much more manageable. When I can get out of my situation, take a walk, drive, watch TV, BREATHE, I start to feel better almost immediately. When I\\'m in the middle of an attack, I notice my breathing becomes short and I cannot concentrate. The one time I had significant relief with no attacks for a week was when I was sick on the tail end of taking time off from work—so I was out for almost two weeks straight, and NO itching during that time. \\n\\nMY QUESTION IS THIS: I find relief from taking Benadryl, because it calms me down, but makes me VERY drowsy. And I do not want to take it for a long period of time. I am taking the 5-HTP and meeting with a therapist to try to help, but this week after my first meeting I have had even more attacks of itching (even reading this group to find some answer had me scratching all over). \\n\\nTLDR: So what do you (those who have these same symptoms) do to manage it in the meantime? Topical medications? Oral meds? Something else? Is it OK to be taking Benadryl consistently for this? I just need some relief so I can work on getting to where I can manage this anxiety. \\n\\n', 'OK I am going to go ahead and apologize for the long wall of text you are going to get.  So I start off the day yesterday at about 5:30 am.  I get up and eat two bowls of cap\\'n crunch (I know, razor blades!!!) and everything seems ok.  At 7 am I take 30 mg of Vyvanse that my doc prescribed last week on Monday for anxiety and 500 mg of nabumetone for some pain I am having in my back and legs.  Again, everything seems ok.  Day isn\\'t bad.  Wife gets up and gets ready for work.  Everything is ok between my wife and I.  No problems there (that I know of) and she goes off to work.  \\n\\nAt about 8:30 or 9:00 am I go for a walk (about 1.5 miles) and talk to my mother (mostly just listening to her go on and on about nothing).  I get back from the walk feeling sweaty and take a quick shower.  So far I am feeling my usual anxious self and some depression but nothing really bad.  I am functional.  I am ok.  \\n\\nAt 10 am I take my \"morning medicine,\" which consists of 1 mg Xanax extended release, 40 mg of prilosec (for my terrible stomach acid), 800 mg of Gabapentin (again, for anxiety), and 25 mg of Seroquel (anxiety).  My day goes on.  Nothing bad happens to me.  No one yells at me.  Nothing goes wrong.  I am doing research on the internet, playing my 3DS, playing around with Blender 3D.  \\n\\nAt about 11:30 am I eat a bag of Reese\\'s cups.  I didn\\'t intend to eat as many as I did.  Probably 5 and a half servings of them.  I usually eat candy but not that much.  I am trying to cut back on sugary things because of my weight (about 210 lbs).  I think this was my obvious first mistake.  I don\\'t eat anything for lunch.  Just the candy.  \\n\\nAt 12:30 pm I start to feel tired.  This is when I do something new.  I drank an orange flavored \"5 hour energy.\"  I usually feel tired early afternoon and my doc didn\\'t have any advice for me so I went this route.  My wife thought it was a good entry point for someone who doesn\\'t regularly consume caffeine.  I feel ok.  I don\\'t go to sleep or anything.  I don\\'t feel super jacked up.  I just feel a little tired but nothing too bad.  My anxiety still isn\\'t over the top or anything.  The day goes on.  I spend time with my 3DS and talking to a friend on the internet. \\n\\n At about 3 pm I start experiencing pain in my pectoral area.  Not sure if it is muscular or what, but whenever I moved just a little bit I would feel pain on both sides.  I also notice that I am feeling a little more jittery than usual.  Anxiety is starting to build up.  I try really hard to focus on my game.  I think maybe it is just the caffeine (again, not that much.  Less than a cup of coffee) and go on. \\n\\n At 4 pm I take my day time medicines (seroquel 25 mg and gabapentin 800 mg again) and keep playing my game.  The pain is getting worse.  the anxiety is getting worse.  Everything is getting worse.  I am having trouble focusing.  Having trouble concentrating.  Not feeling well.  \\n\\nMy wife gets home at about 5 or 5:30 pm and is super happy that she got me some xmas presents from Target for a super good deal.  Wife is in a great mood.  She seems happy.  She is being super nice to me.  For some reason, though, every word she says upsets me.  I feel like even the smallest move she makes is going to make me start yelling.  I am super irritated and aggravated.  The pain is getting worse now and it is starting to move to the center of my chest.  I tell my wife I am not feeling well.  I try to just let it go and think about something else.  My wife has me put a pizza in the oven for her.  I didn\\'t put one in the oven for myself because I wasn\\'t feeling well and I didn\\'t know what was going on.  I keep stressing to my wife that I don\\'t feel well.  I tell her that maybe I want to go to the emergency room after I think about it for a minute.  She goes, \"that bad?!\", and then doesn\\'t really talk too much about it.  She does ask, \"what do you think they can do?\", which is something that has been going on in my head for a while now.  The pain is pretty intense now.  The anxiety is way high.  Every small sound and movement in the house seems like it is specifically engineered to infuriate me.  I sit down on the couch and watch Hotel Impossible with my wife.  The pain is bad.  Strong burning sensation in my chest.  I feel like maybe I am dying.  This doesn\\'t feel like heart burn.  I know it can\\'t be a heart attack.  I start to think that maybe I am having a panic attack.  My wife looks over and sees me in pain and checks on me.  I tell her I want to go to the emergency room.  \\n\\nWe end up going.  The ER is only about a mile from my house.  We get in there and it is a long wait.  I tell them I am having chest pain and I feel like I am dying.  They take my vitals and hook me up to an EKG and check on my heart.  Everything is normal except for my blood pressure.  It was a bit high, but the nurse said it was normal for someone in an agitated state like I was.  Then I wait.  I am starting to feel some discomfort in my stomach now on top of the pain in my chest.  I ask my wife to find me something to eat.  She disappears for a while and then comes back with a small bag of chips, a pack of crackers, and a bag of cheez-its.  I eat the bag of chips and some of the crackers.  After eating, I was starting to feel a little better.  The burning in my chest was starting to go away.  I wait in the emergency room for hours.  No doctor visit.  I play my 3DS for a while.  I realize that I could probably just go home now and call my doctor tomorrow. \\n\\n After waiting 3 hours to see the doctor, I end up leaving the ER and just going home and going to bed.  This wasn\\'t heartburn.  I have had heartburn before.  That is not what this was.  I don\\'t think being hungry had a causal link to all the shit I was experiencing.  I have been hungry before.  This hasn\\'t happened before.  Did the panic attack pass as I was eating and calming down?  Was I suffering from low blood sugar?  High blood sugar?  Was it the 5 hour energy?  Was it the Vyvanse?  Why would I have chest pain 5 hours after drinking a 5 hour energy.  Why would I have chest pain and all these problems after I was getting near the end of the half life on my Vyvanse.  Why did I start to feel better?  What the hell happened?\\n\\nI am a 30 year old man diagnosed with a bunch of psych stuff.  I live in the US (if you couldn\\'t tell by my measurements in the post).  My doctor told me in my last visit (monday last week) that I was going to start ECT soon.  The Vyvanse was an attempt by the doctor to at least hold me over until the ECT got started.  I hadn\\'t taken a psycho stimulant before.  I am not taking any recreational or illegal drugs.  I am taking my medications exactly as prescribed by my doctor.  I do not smoke.  I do not drink alcohol.\\n\\nWhat happened?  Thank you for reading my insanely long post.  I apologize for the typos that you will read.  I hate proofreading.\\n\\nEDIT 1: Formatting to make post easier to read.  Also, I have contacted my doctor\\'s office and am waiting to hear back.  I spoke with his medical assistant who said I had a panic attack and to stop taking the Vyvanse.', \"I was on Klonopin for a while, it seemed to really help me with my anxiety. (It was a yellow pill, this might not be important, but I've also had white kolopins and they didn't do anything is there a difference or am I crazy?) I felt very relaxed while on my anxiety pill, BUT I felt like I wasn't myself. I was also on an antidepressant at that time. Now I am off both things and only taking birth control. But here is my problem, I don't leave my bed. I mean it, I don't leave my bed unless I am getting food from the kitchen or going to the bathroom. \\n\\nI just feel like I am too scared and crippled to do anything now and I'm not sure if I should give anxiety medicine another try. Please don't tell me to talk to my doctor about this, all he does is suggest different medicines for me and doesn't listen to me at all. \", 'First off, I sincerely apologize for the wall of text, but there is quite a bit I want to get off of my mind. I have talked to people I know, and I would like thoughts from a broader audience, and I just found this sub.\\n\\nI am a 24 year old male. I have a girlfriend of six years who makes a decent living and everything about my life is above average. I\\'m finishing up my first year of law school. I\\'ve noticed that, within the past year, my anxiety has hit an all-time high. I\\'ve always been an anxious person, but it has been generally manageable. This is different. This is affecting my grades and my relationship. I should also note, for the sake of disclosure, that I have been diagnosed with ADHD when I was seven years old. I did not receive medication until I was 22 because of my parents. At 22, I received a low dosage of Adderall, and I went from a C student to a straight-A student. I could actually focus. It was amazing and has been extremely helpful. I should also note that my anxiety is still there if I don\\'t take the Adderall (I tried this because I thought the Adderall was the culprit). I have also done recreational drugs before. I smoke weed once in a while, and it helps me relax. I have done Acid once, years ago. I have done a few pain killers recreationally, but nothing recently. I smoke cigarettes occasionally, and I like good beer. I hardly ever drink during the week, though. I have also, in the past, had a prescription for Ambien and Xanax to help me sleep. I have had sleeping problems for as long as I can remember. I like being awake at night, which screws me up when I have to wake up at 6:00AM for class.\\n\\nOk, first off - a year ago I had just graduated with my bachelor\\'s degree. I had a hard time finding a job, but I finally found one working in tech support for a company that treated its tech support staff like garbage. But, $9/hr, even if I was being treated like crap, was better than $0/hr. I spent six months at that job, and progressively got more and more unhappy and anxious. I felt like I was going nowhere and nothing I could do would make my supervisors happy, so I stopped doing any more than the bare minimum. It was during this six months that I decided to apply to law school, which I ended up getting into. So I quit that job. Not long after I quit that job, I had a huge falling out with a good friend of mine, who \"took\" three of my other friends with him, which didn\\'t help things. But I just told myself that I knew who my real friends were, and let it go.\\n\\nNow to law school. Law school is hard, and there\\'s a lot of homework and social interactions. The insane homework load caused me to literally freak out if I didn\\'t get it done RIGHT AWAY because I was afraid that I would forget something if I didn\\'t. Normally, this sounds like a good way to do your homework, but it quickly got to the point that if I didn\\'t get EVERYTHING done RIGHT AWAY, I would fret over it to the point of loosing sleep or becoming irritable with my girlfriend, which caused fights and even more lost sleep and anxiety. This anxiety about my homework has spilled over into every aspect of my life. I get anxious about unimportant things that I need to do, because I feel like I will forget about them and they will never get done. I would become anxious that I would end up pissing my girlfriend off if I did something, anything, wrong. When she acted at all abnormal, I would freak out and demand to know what I did wrong. This usually doesn\\'t end well and I hate it. We love each other very much. I seriously don\\'t know what I\\'d do without her and it kills me when we fight over something I can\\'t seem to control. \\n\\nNow, on top of these problems, my social anxiety has hit an all time high. I have an insanely hard time talking to anyone outside of my girlfriend, my close friends that I\\'ve had since high school, and my parents. The best way I can possibly describe what goes through my head every time I have a conversation with anyone outside of my normal circle is\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say something stupid. You\\'re not talking enough, no talk more. It\\'s silent, stop the silence. Now stop talking, they obviously don\\'t like you. But they have to like you. Don\\'t bring up that topic, why the hell would you do that? Now they think you\\'re stupid. Wow your voice sounds really weird. You just mispronounced that word. What were you thinking about just now? That one word, oh yea. Now they don\\'t understand what you were just saying. Holy fuck man can\\'t you even finish a simple thought? No wonder everyone you meet thinks you\\'re retarded. Does everyone really think I\\'m retarded? Now it\\'s silent again and they think you\\'re an asshole and don\\'t want to talk to them. Wait, were they talking to me or someone behind me? Ugh, I really would like to weigh in my opinion but they\\'ll just think it\\'s stupid. You should make small talk. What is small talk? The weather? That\\'s stupid. Whatever. Oh yes, the weather. Ok that\\'s over with, what now? Awkward silence. Holy shit, this is awkward. Look at the ceiling. Look out the window. Pretend to check something on your phone. Oh wait, that will make them think you\\'re rude. Put your phone away, even though they probably just noticed I didn\\'t actually check anything on my phone so now they think I\\'m just rude and now it\\'s been awkward for like ten minutes.\" when in reality it had probably been all of 30 seconds. \\n\\nAnd this is what happens almost every single time I\\'m trying to talk to someone I don\\'t know. I have rare times of clarity and anxiety-free social interactions, but they are few and far between. People have noticed that I\\'ve gotten worse at this, too. The one thing that has been making me worse has been when people ask  \"why?\" or tell me I need to \"confront my fear,\" like I haven\\'t tried, or that I \"should be ok\" or \"you\\'re life is so great. It\\'s so much better than most people\\'s lives. People would kill to have what you have. Why are you so anxious? What do you have to be so unhappy about?\"\\nIt\\'s like, yes, I get it, I suck at interacting with people. I suck at being normal. I can\\'t make small talk. Yes, I know that\\'s a bad thing. Yes, you\\'re right, I should try harder. I\\'m not doing enough to fix this. Yep, you\\'re right, I can\\'t be a lawyer if I can\\'t talk to people. Yes, I understand that I\\'ll never get ahead in life. Yes, I basically suck as a person. \\n\\nAnd then I tell myself, everyday, that the stuff I\\'m worrying about is normal. That I shouldn\\'t worry so much. I have a good life. Stop thinking about that. That won\\'t happen. Stop being sad, you have nothing to be unhappy about. Look at your life. You\\'re fine. You could be poor. you could have a crappy car. You could have shitty parents. You could have a terrible girlfriend.\\n\\nYet, all the logic in the world doesn\\'t make it go away.\\nAll I want to do is enjoy my life again. I remember enjoying life, and I\\'m not right now. There\\'s ups and downs, but it used to be normal for me to enjoy life.\\n\\nSo, I\\'m sorry if this sounded like a rant or something, but I would just like to know if I\\'m seriously messed up or if I\\'m normal and have nothing to worry about. Any responses are appreciated. Thanks!', \"I have had bad anxiety/depression since I was a child and have been on and off tons of different medicines, when I was around 19-20 I started having panic attack often and it cost me a job or two. I got it under control by going on different medicines. About a year ago I weened myself off prozac because I was feeling depressed anyways and the side effects were too much, including feeling numb,emotionless and zero sex drive. Since then I have been fine albeit some depression bouts.\\n\\nHere's the weird thing that I need advice on- I've been having some medical issues lately with my stomach. On the 20th last month I ended up feeling faint at work and having maybe a panic attack or maybe a dizzy spell I don't know what it was. I was sent to the ER and decided to take a medical leave to figure our my medical issues once and for all because my stomach problems were keeping me from preforming at work and school. So since the 20th I have been staying at my moms and having an endless amount of panic attacks, when I was previously not having any at all! Out of no where I am anxious all day, I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown. I feel like I am dying and every weird little symptom is convincing me I have a brain tumor or stomach cancer or that I'm bleeding internally etc. I have no slept at all. I've been waking up with nocturnal panic attacks and generally haven't left the house. I feel like my life has been totally taken away from me and I am at the mercy of these panic attacks. I was scheduled to have a endoscopy is figure out whats wrong with my stomach on friday but I had a panic attack and they took me to urgent care instead of preforming the operation. (I have emetophobia so anyone sticking anything down my throat and into my stomach, while i'm conscious is my worst fear) But I have to have it to know whats wrong with my body and to get healthy. So I have some questions for you guys..\\n\\nHave you ever had a insanely strong resurgence of panic attacks and GAD out of seemingly nowhere?\\n\\nWhere you able to move on and return to normal life in a timely matter?\\n\\nHow I stop myself from having panic attacks about medical symptoms?\\n\\nHow can I make myself have this endoscopy without having a panic attack? (they do not allow anti anxiety meds before the sedation.)\\n\\nany help with amazingly appreciated.Thank you\", 'Hello everyone.  I just wanted to share with you my experience of anxiety and how I feel like I\\'m starting to take control and I hope that some of it will benefit you all.  \\n\\nI never really had anxiety much until I was 23 and in the military.  Believe it or not, I feel like most of my anxiety can be traced back to when I was getting promoted at a ceremony that was supposed to be exciting.  I never had an issue with crowds or being the center of attention- I was so excited for this event!  So I\\'m up there in front of approximately 100 people standing at attention (Standing straight with arms to the side;not moving).  I start shaking a little bit; I\\'ve had my normal 5 cigarettes and Monster energy drink by this time of the day (9am).  I think nothing of the shakes and continue to wait my turn to get promoted.  As I\\'m waiting I notice the shakes get worse- it\\'s not just my legs anymore, now I can feel my back starting to quiver, taking away from the picture perfect sailor (spare me the Navy jokes, I\\'ve heard them all :D) I had always been.  I break my thousand-yard stare only to see other people watching, nudging the person next to them to look at me, thinking WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY??  I fight this feeling I have, heart racing, breathing constricted- determined to stay as still as possible for this event.  At this point my back is spasm-ing, legs shaking- I\\'m a fucking mess.  I made it through the ceremony somehow, as people walked by to congratulate me some asked if I was okay, some smirked, and of course all my friends teased me relentlessly about it.  This small event will go on to define the next few years.\\n\\nThe teasing subsided after a few days, and it was business as normal.  Other people got awards in front of the squadron and I stood at attention just fine for them in the crowd watching them, wishing I could have kept my composure for my big day.  I was then due to receive an award for my outstanding service for an inspection we had.  Many others were to receive commendation as well, so I was in the third row receiving the award.  I stood there anxiously while everybody crowded the hangar to observe the ceremony.  My heart started racing, muscles shaking again- I knew this dreaded feeling all too well.  I had to leave.  Luckily I managed to get out of it by telling my superior that I could NOT stand there, and I was allowed to wait outside.  I went to see a doctor after this incident.\\n\\nThe doctor told me I had an essential tremor that was made worse by stress and anxiety and I was prescribed propanolol.  I didn\\'t notice many benefits while taking it but I could tell by the horrible feelings when I missed a dose.  I continued taking it regardless.  After disgracing myself twice through these awards I started thinking that \"What if I have a panic attack simply watching others get an award\".  The Captain Picard of my brain replied \"Make it so\".. and simply from thinking that thought I caused myself to have anxiety while not being the center of attention.  Damnit, Picard.  \\n\\nEvery time an award was to take place, I was nowhere to be found.  Avoiding the feelings I dreaded most.  At this point, I ONLY had anxiety at award ceremonies. \\n\\nFast forward 4 years, I volunteer to go to Iraq (to avoid doing another deployment on a boat).  No anxiety that any normal person wouldn\\'t have during this deployment.  Everything was business as usual for me.  Turns out the U.S. was leaving Iraq 5 months after I got there.  We were faced with the choice of either going back to the U.S. (where my Navy contract would expire and I would be a civilian again), or take reassignment to Afghanistan.  I chose Afghanistan.  While in Afghanistan I was able to take 2 weeks of \"vacation\".  The military puts you on a plane and sends you where you want to go.  I returned home.  Spent two weeks with my family and on my flight from XXX-Atlanta (where I would return to Kuwait, and ultimately- Afghanistan) I had a panic attack on the tarmac headed to the runway.  My irrational mind contemplated telling them to turn around, or even just running out the emergency exit.  I was terrified.  \\n\\nI arrived to Atlanta airport and sought the doctor there, as I had 9 hours until my next flight.  I kept thinking that if I had a panic attack on my last flight, this next leg of my trip would be unbearable as it was a 14 hour flight.  I was prescribed Xanax.  ZZZzzzZZZ all the way to Afghanistan.\\n\\nWhile back in Afghanistan all I could do was dwell on this horrible incident.  Why did this happen to me again?  Was this going to be a recurring event?  I\\'ve wanted to be a pilot since I was a child and planned on flight school after this- can I still do that?  Hundreds of questions about myself ran through my mind.  I met with a counselor in Afghanistan and was prescribed Prozac.\\n\\nThe counselor helped a little bit, and I\\'m not entirely sure if the medication helped at all because I still felt anxious.  Keep in mind that I was never involved in a direct gun fight with the enemy.  Once again I felt horrible because here I am in this horrible place and I have anxiety not war-related.  Granted there were a few close calls- a group of rockets passed between 10-20 feet over my head while I was working at a guard shack.  I calculated that from the distance they were fired from had they aimed just a few centimeters lower, I might have been hit.  I\\'m thankful that I wasn\\'t.  We also got mortared- a lot.  That\\'s scary because you never know where they are going to hit until they land.  Your body adapts and you become used to it to a certain extent.  I did receive my award for service over there though with the help of Xanax.\\n\\nThe flight to the U.S. did not bother me when I left.  I guess I was so excited to come home that I forgot that I was supposed to be afraid of flying now.  I returned home and everything was fine and I separated from the military and returned home for civilian life.  I had big plans though.  \\n\\nMy fiance and I moved to Florida where I would attend college and take flight training to satisfy my goal of being a pilot.  While very heavy on the wallet- I flew.  I was very good at it and not once did I experience the anxiety that I once knew all too well.  Life was great.  \\n\\nUntil Christmas break.  During the few weeks off of school from the beginning of December until early January I had time to think- too much time.  I played a lot of video games and didn\\'t really do a whole lot with myself except think.  I was in the Navy Reserves and had a similar panic attack at an award ceremony one weekend- can\\'t stand still, back tremors, the works.  This got me to thinking.  If I still have that issue, what if I have a panic attack on the plane?  What if I have a panic attack while getting a haircut or something crazy like that?  Well, the good ole Captain Picard \"made it so\".  I could barely keep my head still getting my hair cut that weekend, and I was heavily medicated on the flight to and from home.\\n\\nBack to Florida, time to fly again.  I flew once, when I got back and decided I could not do it anymore.  I was on the verge of a full blown panic attack for the entire training flight.  Much to my dismay I dropped out of the flight training course citing \"lack of funds\".  So here I am in Florida, not flying, embarrassed, ashamed.  What was I to do?  I kept going to school and thought of back up plans.  \\n\\nNavy reserve weekend again, it was a Sunday and I was determined to get the hell out of the place before I had another panic attack at the normal ceremony.  I said I was sick and left early.  On the 2 hour drive back home I had a panic attack on the interstate.  Great, now I associated driving, getting a hair cut, and a slew of other things with fear.\\n\\nI missed a lot of class that semester, failed a class, and was actually house-ridden for about a week and a half.  I refused to get in a car or go anywhere.  I decided to call the local VA Hospital and schedule an appointment.  I need help and I knew it.  The first thing the VA wanted to do was give me medication.  I didn\\'t want to take medication as the onset of the problem was quite rapid for the most part, so I was determined to get through it without medication.  But they prescribed it anyways and I took it home and took 1 dosage of this SSRI.  They also set me up with an appointment at a Veteran Center- not run by the VA, but there to support Veterans.  I went to this appointment the next day and met with a counselor there who has thus far given me so much help I don\\'t think I could ever repay her.\\n\\nShe was an alternative-medicine type therapist and helped me talk some things out and give me some coping strategies.  She taught me a technique called EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) that involves tapping on certain points to calm oneself down.  It actually works, sometimes fast, sometimes it takes time, but it works.  That, combined with the coping strategies, got me on my feet and out the door again.  \\n\\nFor the year or so after that, it was a combination of meeting with her, but also trying to find \"The Cure\" to my problem on the side.  I think we\\'ve all been there.  The Cure, doesn\\'t exist for most.  I tried looking at vitamin deficiencies, random herb pills that worked short-term at best and all sorts of other things.  I didn\\'t find my Cure.  If you\\'ve read this far, I doubt you have either.  \\n\\nThe past year or so has been a rollercoaster- some days I would be on top of the world, others- anxiety through the roof.  Through 2 books I\\'ve been reading, and my counselors help, I have finally got on the road to recovery.  The books are called \"At Last a Life: Anxiety and Panic Free\" by Paul David and \"Hope and Help for Your Nerves\" by Dr. Claire Weekes.  Just for the record I am not affiliated with them and am not making a cent should you buy their E-books on Amazon (which you can read on your cell phone, as well).\\n\\n I know I\\'ll have days where I am an emotional wreck but through these books and my session, I have learned to not fear fear.  It has been my biggest struggle.  That, and projecting my fear onto future events which eventually come true because that how I pictured they would.  Now, I welcome every bit of anxiety because it gives me another chance to prove to myself that I can do it.  Every time I welcome these feelings, I feel them lose their strength on my life just a little bit.  All of this didn\\'t happen overnight.  Some of it did, after reading a few chapters of the books before bed I would feel more equipped to handle the day\\'s stresses and challenges but I faltered occasionally. \\n\\nI\\'m not 100% and I\\'m not sure if I ever will be.  I\\'ve given up on trying to be \"the person I was before all this\", because that person doesn\\'t exist any more.  That person hasn\\'t gone through the trials that I (or you) have.  All we can try to do is be a stronger person than we were yesterday.  I will warn you, though- it involves getting out of your comfort zone.  Take baby steps.  For me it was like \"Okay, I\\'m going to find a barber I\\'m comfortable with, and go there for a while\".  Believe me, once you start doing things that you never thought you could do again, you will realize how little power anxiety has over you.  \\n\\nI haven\\'t done any more flight training- I have a baby on the way and realized that everything happened for a reason.  I like to think that God planned it out for me that way, or the universe knew that being a pilot wasn\\'t a sustainable career for me at this point in my life (new FAA laws/subpar pay).

I realized I was trans at 16, came out to my mother and father at 17, and started Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) at 18. It's been a year since I started and I love what it's done with my body. I look like a girl in every way, I have a feminine shape, boobs, hips, and a girly face. I have a feminine voice that doesn't make anyone suspect a thing when I speak. I'm young, pretty, and attractive (or so I'm told). I pass as a girl without a second thought. \\n\\nI did well in high school and am going into the honors program of a good college.\\n\\nMy depression and anxiety are fairly well controlled, I am on meds that help me significantly. My last year at high school was a bit of a mess mentally, I was really depressed during first semester, and my anxiety kept me from finishing assignments and scoring well on tests. I was suicidal for most of the time, but never attempted, though I did select a method and started writing a suicide note.\\n\\nI saw therapists and a psychiatrist, who put me on Lexapro, which has helped me tons. I also have a supply of Xanax for anxiety-ridden periods.\\n\\nI came out as MtF (Male to Female) in December, to a mostly supportive school, with surprisingly supportive facalty. I lost one of my best friends, but aside from him I still had a close-knit group of friends to be with. I made good friends with some former acquaintances who had new incentive to get to know me better. I became almost popular in my peer group of nerdier kids. People said plenty of things behind my back, but never to my face. I still got an awkward question now and then, but I was fine. My depression and anxiety seemed to go away, and I finished the year academicaly strong, and got the IB Diploma I had worked for through high school.\\n\\nCollege starts next month and I've had some time to think. I've realized something. This physique I've worked for my entire life isn't something I can give up. This will surely sound quite vain, but now that I have beauty I can't bear to lose it. Aging terrifys me and I'm scared of what the future will bring.\\n\\nHonestly the way I forsee my life going is that I finish college, find a nice guy to settle down with, maybe adopt a kid or get a surrogate, and then kill myself once my body starts to fade. I feel so selfish that I could just turn my back on my family and friends like that, but I feel like that's how it has to end. I don't feel like there's much of a point beyond that. I don't want to sit by and slowly watch my body deteriorate. I just want to end myself at a high point in my life. Death doesn't really seem so bad to me either, it's like a final peace and calm.

Apologies if this is a bit verbose or rambly for this sub.\\n\\n**tl;dr: I think it's working, despite a big low point at the start, and continued issues getting to sleep.**\\n\\nFirst, some context: I'm a [28m] grad student who's pursuing a master's after spending 4 years working at a startup which was very fast-paced, and essentially took over my life. My research is extremely unguided, hazy, and open-ended, so it's very hard for me to gauge if I'm making 'enough' progress.\\n\\nThe weekend of 3 weeks ago marked an extreme low point for me. I had set a deadline, and been telling everyone that I would finish the master's by September, but started to realize that sticking to this plan would take a huge toll on my mental health, and the few coping strategies I'd developed for my anxiety &amp; depression would probably fall into significant disuse.\\n\\nUp until this point I was strongly averse to medication, and had put all of my energy into trying various mindfulness or cognitive techniques (quite a lot of meditation, have been reading about ACT, but have never made a strong attempt at CBT). Finally, over that weekend I re-watched [this video](http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/drugs) and decided that my current attempts weren't getting the results I had hoped for, and so it was time to try something new. On the Monday I scheduled an appointment with an on-campus doctor. She initially (without a whole lot of inquiry or digging) wrote up a script for Zoloft, but I mentioned that I had read up on Lexapro, and wanted to try it, so she wrote a new one without giving it a second thought. I had my first dose by 7pm that night.\\n\\nThe first week that I was on 10mg of Cipralex was really, *really* shitty for me. I was sleeping in past 10am (which is easier because I almost always work from home), and had zero motivation to do any sort of work on my research. I cancelled several social activities, including plans for the coming weekend, and looking back it's hard to even remember what I did, besides feeling like crap and beating myself up for feeling like crap. \\n\\nI think 3 things kept me from giving up on the meds at that time:\\n\\n* Hearing some stories, either here or on other forums, about people having really high stress/anxiety when they first get on the meds.\\n* Not being sure if this was caused by the meds themselves, or if I'd starting taking them just the nick of time, and that first weekend was just the tip of a particularly depressing &amp; shitty iceberg.\\n* Hearing the guys from Penny Arcade talking about how it changed their lives (and their co-workers').\\n\\nSo that was Week 1. And throughout that whole time, I don't think I got to sleep before 1am, and would often wake up 3-4 times a night, which was extremely unusual for me. I was also getting some mild stomach issues for the first 2-3 days, where I was only eating about half of what I usually do, then feeling full/gassy. \\n\\nBy week 2 I stepped up to 20mg as per my prescription, and was starting to accept that I probably wasn't going to finish the master's by September, and that this is going to be a time when I need to seriously shift my priorities, and focus on getting better. Still having difficulties sleeping, still sleeping in just as late. Still making little or no progress on my research, but starting to change my mindset and not be so hard on myself about that.\\n\\nBy last week I started taking my dose in the morning instead of dinner time, with the small hope that that would reduce the insomnia. It didn't. I met with my doctor and explained the low mood I'd gone through the first week, and she suggested upping the dosage to 40mg, which I told her I wasn't really comfortable with, so she kept it at 20. By the end of the week, when I got the new prescription I mentioned to the pharmacist that I was still having difficulty sleeping, despite the morning dosage. She suggested switching to late evening, and I've been trying that since Friday, with no real change in ability to get to sleep (which, if you haven't already picked up on, is a bit of a concern for me). \\n\\nOn the bright side, this past week the amount of worrying, and random thoughts going through my head *feel* like they've gone down substantially. I'm noticing this when I do sit down to meditate, and I find that I can read a page in a book without thinking about what I should eat for lunch next Thursday. So there are some definite pros, to go with the main downside of not getting more than 4-5 hours of crappy, intermittent sleep, and often feeling like I just want to snooze for another 2-3 hours when my alarm goes off.\\n\\nTwo questions I have for you fine folks:\\n\\n* Has anyone experienced insomnia, but had it subside over time without the addition of some other medication?\\n* Is my concern about my doctor's willingness to change prescriptions at the drop of a hat (which I perceive as a lack of scrutiny), a valid one, or am I just getting anxiety about the person who's trying to help me be less anxious?\", 'So I\\'ve dealt with intrusive thoughts every now and then and they\\'ve always been terrifying, but most of the times after calming myself down I\\'d be alright, but recently this past week these intrusive thoughts have caused so much anxiety it is almost unbearable.

Honestly I feel a little ashamed of myself that I may have to depend on something just to get through a normal day without having extreme anxiety. My social anxiety is gradually getting worse, I just got out of a 3 year relationship not too long ago (I'm 21) and the dating world terrifies me. Meeting new people is something that I never had to worry about, but now I think I'm ready. It would be nice to be able to be a little more social without completely freezing up, my anxiety turns me out to be a completely different person than who I am... College has been a huge stress factor lately and it's not helping my anxiousness at all.

My doctor last time said my bp was fine and sent me home ignoring my symptoms I listed.  I don't drink caffeine, soda, tea, I don't take salt and I am not overweight so my BP is very stable and just spikes when I am having panic so probably is fine when I am at the office, I guess.  I would rather it looks bad when I am there so they can at least take me seriously.\\n\\nI guess this sounds like an odd request but I am desperate, this is my third try.\", \"Are you a hypochondriac? I am. What does it mean to have hypochondria? Hypochondria means taking health issues out of proportion. It is a constant state of vigilance. It is noticing things about yourself and attributing them to illness.\\n\\nThat stringy shape in your stool? It must be worms. A tension headache from the stress you are giving yourself? Must be an aneurysm bursting. Irrational, but real feelings of danger.\\n\\nEver since I was a child I was always extremely cautious of my health. I would go to extremes just to avoid pain and suffering even if it was trivial. I wear gloves whenever I deem an activity unsafe, just because they protect my hands from injury. If I get a cut on my hand, the first thing I do is rush to get a disinfectant and bandaging. If I can't get those, I stress about how unsanitary my wound is and mentally exacerbate the pain I am feeling. It only got out of hand when I came back from a hemorrhoid check that turned out to only be a fissure. I saw my own life as vulnerable, and the doctor's office as a sanctuary of sorts. The one of few places that could make me healthy, cover for my weakness of mortality.\\n\\nInstead of white collar syndrome, I feel safest and least anxious in the presence of medical professionals and most dangerous by myself.\\n\\nEvery little pain is magnified beyond reason. A small poke feels like a stab, and dizziness practically becomes vertigo.\\n\\nLiving with hypochondria is like being a prison guard at a maximum security penitentiary known for its prison breaks. Having google as a medical guide at your fingertips does not help, either. At least temporarily. Like OCD, if they are different, confirming or denying my fears only gives me relief for the moment. Eventually I will recede back into my worries.

I live in the northwest so he said that most of the people he sees are deficient to some extent and he recommends it to most of his patients. We were talking about the various benefits which include improving brain function, possibly preventing neurological disorders later in life, it acts as a mild anti-depressant, among the obvious known benefits. So i told him i would try it and he wrote me a prescription for 50000 ui capsules once per week for 12 weeks. This seemed like a lot to me considering that most supplements are around 400 ui per day. So, naturally i did some research and found that this is a normal amount given to people who are deficient and because it stores in fat and releases over time that you only take it once per week. Also, in my research i read about the rare bad things it can possibly cause, even people reporting panic attacks from taking it. Great. Now, like every medicine i get i don't want to take it. Even though the possibilities of it working great or even just doing nothing at all far exceed the possible verrrry rare negatives im having a tough time. Shit it took me a long time to even try diazepam, the very thing that helps me with my panic attacks.\\n\\nMy questions are as follows...\\n\\nHas anyone tried vitamin D?\\nIf so, have you taken a weekly large amount like i was prescribed? \\nDid it work?\\nDid you have any negative side effects?\", \"I'm scripted Ativan 1mg as needed (along with a cocktail of other medication for my many disorders) and last month I needed to take it (on average) about once every 2 days.

So my question is, how often is too often and how should I take it to avoid physical dependence?\\n\\nI used to have a physical dependence with opiates, which sucked, but I've heard that with benzodiazepines it's much worse (like the w/d's causing seizures and what not).\", 'Ok so for a couple of years maybe I feel like I have become very anxious, maybe I have always had it and being busy with studies and sports just kept it at bay, but ever since Ive had less time to do things like sports because I work a lot, I feel very insecure, anxious and depressed. My insecurities have almost led to me destroying my relationship with my incredibly loving boyfriend, but thankfully his support and love has made us more stable than anything.\\n\\nLooking back I have had three instances, where I have out of nowhere just fainted. The first time was on holidays, I was standing by a bus stop several years ago with my father and suddenly everything just went black and I fainted. after a few minutes of resting everything went back to normal. I cant recall the onset as it was so long ago but it was quite unexpected, my father just assumed it might be from the heat (38 degrees celsius) and being dehydrated.\\n\\nThen comes another few instances, all in a social setting, most of the time alcohol was involved or even marijuana but both in moderation. Around friends I wouldnt call myself insecure in the slightest, so the one time I do believe it might have been too much marijuana and my body just temporarily failing. Again, after 10 minutes I was fine. (I do not use it anymore, as my anxiety keeps me away from smoking it nowadays, which is ironic because in places of legalization many people take it as remedy for anxiety.)\\n\\nThen another time after a couple beers and having a marijuana joint, the same thing happened, all went black and I fainted for a good 3 minutes. My friends immediately put me in a cab home thinking I had drunk too much.\\n\\nHowever, the reason I believe it is not CAUSED by , but merely made worse by alcohol &amp; marijuana is because one time it was without any intake of substances;\\nI was simply having a shower and freaked out because i thought i had noticed an abnormality on my body (which turned out to be nothing), My heart started racing, I freaked out and once again everything started to go black. I quickly sat down in the shower and after a couple minutes of breathing slowly I was all fine. \\n\\nNow having looked a bit into Anxiety disorders, it does sound a great lot like I suffer from it. I have always been very good at school, never had issues making friends and am not horrible looking either, but somehow I am extremely insecure and have no self esteem...I believe the neglect of hobbies plays a large role since doing things you enjoy and are good at and where endorphins are involved would certainly prevent such anxiety.\\n\\nBut as of right now, being aware I should increase hobbies such as sports, I would really like to know if I need to be worried. Sometimes when I overworry about something my heart starts racing and racing and I actively have to calm myself down.\\n\\n\\nA friend of mine who has similar issues has a psychiatrist for a mother and has been taking anti depressants and said they have greatly improved her quality of life, i am just interested what you all think, how do i go about this, it really does impact my life as my self esteem is just..awful and despite having supporting family and partner who tell me how good I am at things and how pretty I am those things just dont have any effect on me. \\n\\nI noticed I am over observant in social settings, as to how people act, and i think the fact that i am extremely empathetic is a key factor as well.

I\\'ve been lurking on this subreddit for a couple of months now. I actually didn\\'t know it existed until pretty recently. It\\'s been great reading other people\\'s posts and knowing that what I feel isn\\'t something that only I go through. Because of this, I decided I should reach out.\\n\\nFor reference, I\\'m a 22-year-old female living in the USA. I am currently taking Lexapro. The best definition of the anxiety I have faced throughout most of my life has been contained in the descriptions for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. However, lately, things have been a little different.\\n\\nFor more context, I\\'ll kind of go over what anxiety has been like for me. As a child, my family moved around relatively often. I didn\\'t notice how quiet and nervous I was until I was around 10. Everyone always said I was just \"shy,\" etc. By the time I reached high school, what had started as just a general inability to speak to most people (extreme social anxiety) had become more like depression. I felt that there was something wrong and broken within me and didn\\'t know what to do. I often thought people would be better off without me, or that if I was gone, no one would miss me. This did not make my crippling social anxiety any more manageable.\\n\\nThis kind of went on through my first year or two of college. Though, I managed to make a little progress with the depression. It helped a lot to have such a caring support system behind me. But I still maintained the social anxiety, and actually began to have a lot of trouble sleeping, and be terrified of germs. The thought of even leaving my room was sometimes too much for me to handle. Going anywhere where there might be people sneezing or coughing made me feel intense panic, which made school difficult, and bus rides practically unbearable.\\n\\nBy January of 2013, it had all become too much. Friends could always see that there was something wrong, but finally, one close friend told me he was worried for me, and that he knew how I felt was a burden on me, and that I shouldn\\'t have to manage so much alone. After this conversation, I talked to my mom, and we decided I should go to our family doctor to talk about what I was going through. He asked me a lot of questions, and ended up prescribing Lexapro. \\n\\nThe Lexapro has honestly made such a difference in my life. I am much more willing to talk to people now, and have been able to make my fear of germs and infection at least manageable. Things were really looking up for a while, since the medication was prescribed. I do realize, though, that the pills are just a tool to help me find balance. They don\\'t magically make everything better. I have to be willing to work on things too. And I have been.\\n\\nAs I said, things had been a lot better. That is, until I graduated from college last May. I am currently unemployed and am having a lot of difficulty in finding a job, especially one related to my degree. I\\'ve noticed a switch flip in me the past few months. I feel like I have reverted back into feeling depressed about 60% of the  time. I sleep for hours upon hours every day and have a lot of trouble getting up. It always seems like a better option to go ahead and aim for 10 or more hours of sleep, or even to just stay in bed rather than start the day. I\\'ve also been having panic attacks and getting angry. I\\'m not generally an angry person. I\\'ve always been very chill and calm, but lately I lash out at people for no reason, especially my poor boyfriend, who is so supportive, and someone I\\'m so thankful for. I find myself feeling so unreasonably angry for even the smallest reasons, that would never have usually made me upset. I feel immense guilt, and like a failure, over not being able to find a job, even though I realize that this is actually quite common anymore. \\n\\nI guess I\\'m just here hoping someone may have some advice for me. I\\'m wondering if this is just temporary, from my life changing so drastically recently (graduating, entering the \"real world,\" being unemployed and alone at home all day), or if it might be something more serious that I should do something about. I know no one here can tell me that for sure, or give me medical advice. But does anyone maybe have any tips for dealing with things like I\\'ve described, short of therapy or more/different medication? Anything you can say would be much appreciated. I know some people have worse problems than I do, and that I\\'m lucky to have what I have.

So here\\'s the back story: I recently started a relationship with a girl who used to simply be a friend that I made up every which reason for not being able to chase after her (was secretly crushing on her and we were close friends) and then she came and showed interest in me and I went right for it. I am madly in love with her and find her to be the greatest thing ever and know I am also a bit clingy. Anyways we\\'ve been together for almost two months and in the last week or so I feel like she\\'s distanced her self greatly from me and is overall irritated by everything I do. It feels like she\\'s degenerated from being my significant other to a simple acquaintance. I\\'m assuming this is a trigger for me as I\\'ve been in a relationship before where they showed interest and I perused to be lead on then dropped like a bad habit and blamed my self for it thinking i went wrong somewhere. Now I have a feeling of inadequacy and have that whole \"I\\'m doing something wrong and don\\'t know what\" feeling and its acting as a trigger bring multiple break downs a day which I have been free of for about 3 years now. I have already talked to her about it and she told me that its not anything I\\'m doing things are just bothering her and she prefers not to talk about it. Regardless I cannot shake the feeling I\\'m whats wrong and every little thing she dose that feels like she\\'s trying to distance herself from me acts as a trigger, it could be anything some thing as little as no response to a text I sent to her, or even receiving a one word response to a text I sent to her expecting a larger response. Anyways I cannot think of any solutions aside from breaking up with her which is the last thing I want to do and want to ask for any ideas on how to cope with this (no meds please). If you have no ideas but took the time to read thanks for listening. Other general info if needed: Age: 16 (Junior in High School), No meds or any drug use.

I just tend to treat everything like it's a new symptom of my anxiety. This past few months, however, my symptoms got slowly worse until they were totally out of control. When I finally did go to see the doctor about it, it turned out that I had developed vertigo due to damage to my inner ear from a car crash I was in about 20 years ago. The vertigo was causing some of my symptoms directly (dizziness, lack of balance, and loss of coordination) as well as triggering a whole bunch of other symptoms due to the unsettling nature of feeling like everything is spinning around me. If feeling like the whole world literally just turned upside-down several times each hour won't make you feel anxious, nothing will.\\n\\nHas anyone ever worried that their anxiety symptoms might be masking or hiding other issues like this? I know that I tend to obsess about every little symptom, worrying that it might actually be MS, or a stroke, or a brain tumor, or a heart attack, or whatever. It's not that I think I do have these things, but that I want to rule them out, because the symptoms are very real.\\n\\nBecause of this I procrastinated going in to get my symptoms checked out, worried that I would be perceived as just a hypochondriac, and it turns out that I had an actual medical condition all along that I probably could have gotten treated months ago rather than enduring for so long. It is even possible that what could have been treatable if detected right away might now be a permanent condition due to the months of neglect.\\n\\nHow do you deal with the naysayers who think you're imagining everything? When do you decide to go in and get checked for symptoms which could potentially be due to nothing more than anxiety? At what point do you justify the cost of tests to make sure that you haven't developed an actual heart condition instead of just chest pain due anxiety-related muscle spasms and tightness, or to determine whether your shakiness is caused by anxiety or some physical disorder, etc.?\", \"After looking through this subreddit a bit I'm quite sure that I'm having panic attacks but I would like insight if maybe you think I'm not. I would really appreciate resources if anyone has any. Also, here's why I think I have anxiety...\\n\\nOn the 17th of December I stayed up all night and in the morning I think I had a really bad panic attack, my first one ever...I kept feeling waves of heat inside of my head and that's how I knew that it was more of a mental thing, I started shaking really bad, frequent urination, weird breathing and I've had two more since, it's sounding like panic attacks to me...I have never had this issue before, I've been talking to friends and they usually help a bit in distracting me from whatever is bothering me. My second panic attack happened immediately after I was meditating which makes me really adverse to trying it again...I've completely cut sugar out of my diet, I'm scared to eat it because I assume it makes them worse. I have trouble sleeping, it seems to get worse at night but I've only had three. \\n\\nI think I was triggered by thinking about manual breathing the second time, in meditation as some of you may know, it's important to concentrate on your breathing and in doing so I think that I may have triggered it but I'm not sure because it happened after I got done meditating. \\n\\nthe third time it was triggered because I was worrying about whether or not I was bothering someone. Third one has been the easiest one to deal with so far. \\n\\nIt's really hard for me to relax after I have one, I start stimming in order to keep them at bay and I eat less and it's incredibly hard to fall asleep because sometimes the feeling of heat starts to seep in. When that happens I usually hop up and pace around the house. It was really bad after my second one because it was suddenly a reoccurring thing, I didn't think that I was ever going to feel that again after the first one. \\n\\nThinking that birth control may have started all this but I don't know for sure and I don't know when it will get out of my system...\\n\\nthank you guys for reading, I'm sorry...I'm very new to all of this, I don't know if this is a lifelong thing or a temporary thing, it freaks me out that maybe I messed myself up for life...is there a diet you recommend that I go on? I'm going to start working out every day or at least most...I have been to the doctor, got blood work done, waiting for the results and going to try to discuss that I'm pretty certain I have been having panic attacks...don't know what he's supposed to do about them, do I just ride them out for a few weeks to wait and see if maybe they go away? Do I even want medication since it seems like you have to kind of shuffle through them to see which ones work and which ones don't...?\\n\\n\", \"I'm having some sort of life crisis at the moment. I saw a really old colleague that's grumpy and I think jaded about her job (she's been teaching for 30 something years). I don't know why, but that made me realize that I don't want to be that person. I can't picture myself working just as a teacher for 30 years and then retiring. Not that there's anything wrong with doing that, but for me, it seems so unfulfilling. \\n\\nHaving said that, I've never had much issues with anxiety. But this realization has made me sleepless and anxious, leading me to go to the doctor. I recently had to take some melatonin to improve my sleep quality as well as other medication to calm myself down. I'm not sure if it's working, but I still feel nervous to go work every time I wake up. I feel so stressed, helpless and I feel like I've wasted my own time and it's my own fault. I should've kept more doors open for myself. Help.\", 'I have depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I have never taken prescription medication before until July 2014 I started on 1mg lorazepam (Ativan) once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and then .5mg at night. I also take 15mg of escitalopram (Lexapro) at night. So I\\'ve been on these meds for about four months now. In the morning when I wake up I am very anxious and don\\'t feel \"normal\" until I take my first Ativan. I start feeling a little anxious around the afternoon and take my second and the last one right before I go to bed. I am dependent on this Ativan because once I skipped 3 days of it and had a severe panic attack that was the worst I\\'ve ever had in my life. ', 'I [29f] am in the process of moving in with my SO [29m]. He has ADHD and can be extremely disorganized and cluttered- the clutter from all his impulse purchases and disorganization from his scattered ADHD brain. I am realizing that his disorganization and clutter is a HUGE trigger for me. Because of that, this move is making me completely balls-to-the-wall anxious. I know the move in is the right step for our relationship, but the stress is driving me crazy and I am having a hard time dealing with it. \\n\\nOn top of the fact that I work for a civil litigation firm that is neck-deep in trial. Last week, I worked 12 hour days EVERY day, plus 6 hours Saturday. I have NO time or energy to move and get things organized and getting my SO to help has proven to be difficult. A lot of my stress comes from the fact that his things are all over the house (he\\'s lived there for a year) and its difficult for me to find room for my things. I dont know what of his I can toss, move, whatever, to make room for my stuff. \\n\\nFor example: we share the master closet. His clothes took 2/3rd of the room even after he \"cleaned\" it out. I pointed this out to him and asked him to make more room for me. He told me just to throw his stuff somewhere to make room for my stuff. While I am happy to have my clothes in their place, there is now a large amount of his clothes sitting on the dresser for DAYS now. I don\\'t want to remove his things to make room for mine, only to have his stuff clutter the space instead. I am becoming a nag because I have to constantly ask him to clean stuff, make room, etc., and even with the constant reminders he still wont do it sometimes. I HATE feeling like a nag and I don\\'t want to be in a relationship where that\\'s the role I have to take. I\\'m worried that this difference in living styles is going to be the thing that breaks our relationship. We are great partners in every other way, though, and I dont want my anxiety over his living style to end things. But honestly, I seriously cannot live like this. I hoping that once things are moved in and organized (and trial over at work) that my anxiety will be much better. I am not on meds currently, because I had to go get a blood test before my MD will give me meds. However, with my job being nuts, I haven\\'t had time to get the necessary blood work, which is also stressing me out that I cant get the help I need right now.\\n\\nAnyway, I just needed to vent so thank you. \\n', \"Hello, everyone. This will be my first post on Reddit. I've always found it cathartic to write my thoughts and have them read, so I hope you will be able to offer me some advice. I have always dealt with anxiety, primarily health anxiety. I tend to worry about that which I have no control over. My earliest memory of anxiety was worrying the roof of my mouth was eroding: I was four. I've been seeing specialists since the fifth grade, but I don't feel I've made much progress at all. Up until last year, my anxiety had been tolerable. I was able to suppress it and actually enjoy my life to some degree, I very rarely had panic attacks and only became anxious when in crowds (a concert, movie theater... I did not enjoy gym class). In January of 2011 I became concerned with my environment and the effect it may have had on my life. I live in very close proximity to a main road and an oil refinery, and I have neighbors in my area who use a fireplace to heat their homes. I obsessed over organic food and detoxification, I demanded to know the source of my vegetables and whether they were treated with pesticides and I began to withdraw from friends. I became less interested in school and here is where I believe my anxiety amplified.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n For some incomprehensible reason, in May of 2011 I decided I could no longer live at home. Home was creating my anxiety and I needed to leave immediately. I decided to live with my aunt and uncle for one month as an intermediary before moving into my godmothers (I will not touch on this much, but I will say this was one of the worst months of my life. There was an incident involving an oil furnace, and since I have hypersensitivity to fumes I nearly went mad). I saw my godmothers home as a utopia, an environment where I may finally focus on schoolwork and seek treatment for my mental health. I finally moved into my godmothers in June of 2011. I enjoyed my summer, granted my anxiety was inhibiting me from enjoying it to its fullest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI began a ritual where I would leave my home every third day, because I felt this would minimize my exposure to environmental toxins. I became obsessed with achieving optimum cognitive health and I started to take several supplements (wheatgrass, spirulina, omega-3 fish oil, acai) and go on daily hikes. I was doing well. September introduced the new school year, and as luck may have it I suffered a fall a couple of weeks into the month, nearly suffering a concussion. I was not injured, though my anxiety was leading me to believe I was having secondary effects (intracranial pressure, perhaps a subdural hematoma). I was constantly feeding my anxiety by researching symptoms and complications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n My relationship with my godmother became increasingly negative over the course of the next several months which lead me to moving out in January, earlier this year. I was placed in a shelter while my social worker searched for a new apartment for me. I began to skin pick (my acne), almost unconsciously, and I would do so for the duration of my stay (five weeks). The notion of infection did not cross my mind, I thought what I was doing was harmless. I ended up leaving awful, awful scars over my chest, shoulders and spanning across the entire top of my back. I did not suffer an infection, but I realized the severity of my behavior and told my mother I wanted to schedule an appointment with a doctor. This lead to me moving home with my parents once more, I'd not been living there for seven months. It did not take long for my anxiety to manifest into something more dire. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n I now had an entirety of time to myself since I was not attending school. I used this time to research symptoms and illnesses, all relating to skin infection. I became so frightened that I completely stopped skin picking, and as of now I have not picked for over four weeks. I have been to the emergency room three times in the past month due to fear of infection, and I have been reassured ad nauseum that there is none. I am not overly concerned of whether I am already infected; I am concerned with my susceptibility and risk of infection. My back, though healing, has open scabs and I cannot even shower anymore without noticing blood on the towels. I notice blood on my pillows. I notice blood on my T-shirts (Actually, I should note, I have been prescribed minocycline and a topical cream for my acne, so yes, I have been given medication). I try to treat my wounds as best I can with an antibiotic ointment. Others find my hygiene to be obsessive. I am doing everything I can to prevent infection. Yet I still worry. There are three infections that I am most concerned with: Necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis and cellulitis. I have read all three are mostly found in individuals with compromised immune symptoms, and one of these is actually exceedingly rare, yet my anxiety is convinced that I will become a statistic. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Since I always have minor breakages in my skin, and since these diseases are so opportunistic, seeping in at the slightest trauma, I worry that I will eventually suffer from one of them. Using last night as an example, two scabs broke and bled and I began crying, applying polysporin like a damn maniac. Pathetic imagery, huh? It's gotten to the point where I cannot even enjoy a book anymore. I haven't been to school in over two months because my anxiety has completely consumed me. I am on my sixth day of anxiety medication (celexa) and I am seeing my family doctor once every week, in addition to my psychologist once every week. I'm actually meeting with a psychiatrist this month as well, so I am seeking support. I just need to know what to do in the meantime. I feel like I'm being crushed by my anxiety.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n All I do anymore, really, is lay in bed and sob. just waiting for infection to set in and ravage me. It's funny to note that just under two months ago I'd been digging my dirty fingernails, that I'd not washed in days, into my flesh and freeing the pus from beneath. I've never been so scared of anything in my life, but this has just about ruined me. I feel like I'm missing some things, and this may not be very cohesive, but please, Reddit, help me. If there is anything you are wondering, I will be glad to answer your questions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------\\nAge: \\nTypes Of Anxiety: Health Anxiety -\\nMedications: Stieva-A Cream, Minocycline, Clonazepam, Celexa -\\nTrigger examples: I have a hypersensitivity to pain.

That\\'s about it.  I have no work ethic and I\\'m pretty shy.  The thought of going in somewhere day after day and sitting there makes me immediately depressed and then come the panic attacks and pain issues.  The only reason I got my current job is because my dad worked there for 30 years and got me in.  Now, I\\'ve got nowhere to go and I\\'m too depressed to take some menial job.

I spend my nights writing out what I'm going to eat, the calorie count, I create diet plans, work out plans, then I stew and worry about what I ate and if I ate too much. I will sometimes rewrite these things over and over. I'll stay up worrying about how much I ate the previous day, I'll worry about talking about it to someone and getting help, becasue I'm afraid to get treatment becasue I don't think it's that bad. Some nights I'll stay up and binge and purge, and stress that I didn't get it all out.

I\\'m not sure of a diagnosis, because at any given time I can meet the diagnostic criteria for at least two (possibly three) disorders--so I\\'m not sure how I\\'m classed. My armchair opinion (and that of a couple therapists) is that I\\'ve basically had pretty severe GAD my whole life, and when you combine that with stuff that\\'s happened through my life, I\\'ve picked up the symptomology of other disorders.\\n\\nI\\'ve been on multiple medications. With the exception of benzos, nothing has worked. When I\\'m in therapy, I\\'m always at such a crisis point that the therapy has to focus on the immediate need, and not on long-term. I\\'m constantly so strung up that I cannot focus on learning coping skills. Every session is \"talk her off the edge of a proverbial cliff\". Trying stuff at home is a battle between motivation, and then becoming so anxious I cannot concentrate on the activity (like yoga). Distraction is my main coping method.\\n\\nThe absolute *biggest* trigger for my anxiety is the unknown. It can be in any area--social, my pets, work, etc. The biggest trigger lately has been finances. I spent some time unemployed, and money was a huge issue. So now I have a hard time spending money, make decisions are large purchases impulsively (because the anxiety is so great I just want to get it over with ASAP), and constantly worry about having enough for the future..among other things. \\n\\nI\\'m in the process of (probably) trading my car.

This is a decision I have again snap made because of anxiety, but everyone (except reddit) agrees this is the right decision.\\n\\nSo here I am sitting on the internet looking up every bump and clunk and whine that the car makes, self-diagnosing every single awful thing that could be wrong with the car. I\\'m convincing myself that the dealer will come back and say \"Yeah, we told you we\\'d give you $X for the trade-in, but we really are going to give you $0.\" (Dealer provided a trade-in value without seeing it). \\n\\nAnd I know this isn\\'t rational. I\\'m getting rid of the car because I\\'m not going to spend the money to fix it. The car is at the point where shit starts to go majorly and expensively wrong. And I\\'m certainly not going to basically overhaul the car to get a couple thousand extra dollars in trade-in. But as soon as I convince myself of all of this, I see/hear a new thing and start the whole process over.\\n\\nBut this is only a symptom of a bigger problem. If I\\'m not worrying about the car, it\\'s my cat (he\\'s got a chronic illness), my financial solvency, the fact that I think I spend too much on groceries (but hate cooking), my health/teeth, my job (no reason to worry, they love me), my (non-existent) love life...it goes on and on and on. \\n\\nI\\'m tired.

I could really use them.\", \"Last year I entered college out of state. I have had longstanding problems dealing with depressive episodes and moderate social anxiety. When I got there, the anxiety and depression intensified greatly. On the surface, I was successful; I joined a fraternity, made friends, and aced 20 units of classes. But in reality I felt like I didn't have the support network to maintain meaningful relationships. I also had a roommate I didn't particularly care for, and as someone who was already very introverted and anxious, it was very difficult to ever feel calm considering that there were ALWAYS people around, even in the library. I had difficulty fostering my passions like playing guitar and writing because I felt that I could never do them without the privacy of my own space. A lot of times I would just lie in bed with headphones on and listen to music and pretend that nothing was there. I went to counseling for several months, which helped, but only depressed me further when I was cut off by the university and referred to an outside source. I visited a psychiatrist, who gave me general health tips and told me to get over the counter lithium. I didn't try it out of health concerns and reading about the risk of kidney problems online.\\n\\nI decided to transfer back to go to a state university. I'm already so much happier now that I'm back home for the summer. I still sometimes feel very depressed, but it's mostly subsided compared to what I went through last year. I can just spend my days indoors drawing or playing guitar or reading. It's great. I hang out frequently with a few of my closest friends whenever it strikes me.\\n\\nThe problem is that while the depression went away, the anxiety didn't. It's hard for me to ask anyone outside of my 3 closest friends to hang out. Even replying to emails or sorting out my affairs for enrollment at my new university gives me intense anxiety spells. There are days when I can't leave the house because of the fear of having to ask someone if they want to get lunch. These aren't strangers either; these are some of my best friends for years. The problem is either A) big group gatherings, even if they are all friends, or B) individual meetups with people who I am only okay friends with. Either one of those scenarios results in me making a million excuses and then staying home. It's not even that I say no, it's that sometimes I just get so anxious I can't even reply to a text message inviting me to hang out. I haven't seen some of my best friends all summer out of this anxiety. Today, I was invited to one of my friends' birthday gatherings. I'm trying so hard to get the courage to show up. But I can already anticipate some of them asking me where I've been all summer, or what happened that made me transfer universities and I have no idea what I'll say. I'm still trying to decide if I should go, so if you have any advice on that end, let me know. I've always had this anxiety, but back in high school it was only mild to moderate. Ever since last year, it's been severe and never slowed down. I'm wondering if I should seek medications from a psychiatrist again, at least so I can get it under control in these types of situations and learn how to function again. I have no idea how these medications work or if it's worth starting up during a transition period like the new few weeks when I start classes. I'm honestly a little afraid of going back to classes in a couple of weeks; my anxiety might prevent me from getting help from others in my classes, or making friends at my new school. Any thoughts of advice?\\n\\ntl;dr -- Got over depression, but social anxiety has intensified to the point where I can't leave the house, which I'm worried is going to make me more depressed. Advice?\\n\\nEdit: One thing I'd like to add that I was just thinking about. I gave up drinking and smoking pot. It wasn't doing me any favors for either my anxiety or depression, and I was getting sick of feeling shitty because of it. My friends, however, didn't, and have very much ramped up their alcohol and weed consumption over the past year. Now every moderately sized social gathering seems to have drinking or smoking at the center of it. I don't have any problem with people drinking or smoking in a relaxed environment, but it's a little alienating for me to always be sober at these gatherings.

I am very aware of what a lot of my issues are, and am aware of why I have these issues, which is more than I started with. In that regard, talk therapy has helped. \\n\\nOn the other hand, I have not had much success actually altering my behaviors that are symptoms of my issues. I still have unexplained anxiety, and try to diagnose why I am feeling anxious, but most of the time I cannot. For example, a couple weeks ago, I was driving to a department store to purchase a new set of cooking pans. I was calm, happy, etc. Out of nowhere, I just felt overwhelmingly anxious. I asked myself why. Was it because of traffic? No, it wasn\\'t. Was it because I was worried I was going to overspend? No, I had the means to make my purchase. I was unable to figure out where the anxiety came from, and all I could do was simply wait it out. My irritability is a smidgen better, but not much. Small, petty things still make me angry/tense/irritable, and my temper flares up. A lot of times, I can\\'t catch myself before my temper flares up to figure out why I\\'m so tense or irritable and to consciously talk myself down from it before I react externally (usually getting terse or angry with my partner). I am also still having problems with my mood in general. It varies greatly from day to day. Sometimes I am happy. The next day I could be sad or tense for literally no reason. I\\'m tired of the variance and unpredictability. \\n\\nAt this point, I feel like I know myself well enough that I realize what my issues are and why I have them, but I also know that they are so deeply ingrained in myself that I don\\'t think talking about them by itself is going to help. I would really like to ask my therapist about medication, but I\\'m scared. I\\'m scared that she will say she doesn\\'t recommend it. I don\\'t want to be the way that I am anymore, and I don\\'t think I can change myself without the help of medication. I don\\'t want to stop therapy, but I don\\'t think it\\'s enough. I\\'m also scared of the potential side effects. I already struggle with weight, and I don\\'t want to gain weight. I don\\'t want to lose my sex drive, etc. I don\\'t want to become numb. My boyfriend is on SSRIs for his depression, and he has the common side effects, and has tried different medications, but eventually just settled on one that made his mood feel the best, regardless of the side effects.\\n\\nDoes anyone who\\'s gone through anything like this have any advice or words of encouragement? ', 'I\\'ve been on the medication since January and fortunately haven\\'t had any anxiety attacks for several months now. However recently I\\'ve noticed that my overall anxiety level increases sometimes and that I still feel not my normal self since I started having issues with anxiety over a year ago. The doctors, mental health professionals, and a psychiatrist that I\\'ve spoken to have all recommended that I increase the dosage of my medication as they believe that changing my medication is the only solution to me getting better.\\n\\nI\\'m quite worried about this for several reasons. One is that my anxieties have centered around whether or not I\\'m in a \"normal\" state of mind and if I still have control over my thoughts and emotions. And I also have anxieties about psychoactive substances like my medication having control over my mind and making me unable to exercise free will over my thoughts and emotions and instead making me into someone that is unhappy but still functional in society. Another worry that I have is that changing the dosage may make my mental health and mood much worse to the point where I lose control of my mind and/or become actively suicidal.\\n\\nSo I\\'m just curious as to other people\\'s experiences regarding dosage change on this medication. Although I know that my mental health could be much worse than it is right now and I\\'m still able to function somewhat normally, I\\'m terribly worried that I will lose all of this if I follow the recommendations of others and increase my dosage.', \"I've been taking Zoloft for over two years but I'm December my dosage was increased from 50mgs to 200mgs. Since then I've out on almost fifty pounds and it's all right in the belly area. I really look like I'm pregnant. \\n\\nReddit, how do you deal with the weight gain from your medication? I knows weight gain just adds even more to my social anxiety. I really want to lose the weight but I have no motivation. Any tips?!\", \"I know running isn't for everyone, but i swear it fixed me. I'd been on antidepressants my whole adult life, &amp; struggled with extreme anxiety issues since i was a kid. I bounced around from one anti-anxiety med to another &amp; i didn't like any of them, &amp; none of them really worked. They just knocked me out &amp; turned me into a zombie for long enough to calm down.\\n\\nA few years ago after a terrible breakup I started running. A lot. And i started feeling better &amp; getting over the breakup. And so i ran more. And more. And then one day i realized I'd been so much happier &amp; less stressed lately, &amp; that I hadn't taken or needed any of my meds in months. I guess i'm just burning off all of the extra energy that was building up &amp; making me antsy &amp; anxious, or something? I dunno. I just know it's working. Now I run anywhere from 3 to 10 miles a day (or longer on weekends) whenever possible. And believe me... whenever i have to go a few days without a good run the anxiety does creep back in. I've been off any &amp; all anxiety meds &amp; antidepressants for going on 4 years now.\\n\\nI'm just putting this here for anyone who's having trouble treating their anxiety or doesn't want to have to take meds long-term...

It won't work for everyone, i'm sure, but i feel like it's worth a shot.\", \"So I work full time and my job pays very little and doesn't offer health insurance. I was lucky enough to get state aid for the past year for my prescription medications and the discount helped a lot because otherwise I would be paying a ridiculous amount. However, I've now been told that I make too much money and will therefore no longer be able to receive the discount on my medications starting April 1. (I didn't have a job at all last year at this time so that's how I qualified.) The thought of not being able to get my meds is making me really anxious and last time this happened I ended up in the hospital. I can't go through that again-- the emotional toll on me and my family, the money, missing many days of work, etc. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Can anyone help?\\n\\nTL;DR My discount for my meds is ending soon but I need the meds to function. I have no insurance. What can I do?\", \"I've read a lot of threads on here about Klonopin vs Xanax, and having taken xanax as needed for panic attacks, I recently came off some light painkiller use and had started taking more xanax (still less than 1.5 MG/day) as I've been rather stressed lately. \\n\\nI went to my DR and basically said I didn't like the high/crash constant pill popping of xanax and wanted something that I could take in the morning and be good for...a while. Keep in mind, I've never taken SSRIs as I don't feel I have a chemical imbalance, but mostly that I am under a lot of pressure most of the time and get overwhelmed, not depressed so much.\\n\\nI got a precription for Klonopin 1MG twice a day (I only use it either 1 MG per day or .5, I just like being overprescribed so that I don't have to pay my psychiatrist each month or if I forget to make an appt I don't run out). As well as some xanax for breakthrough anxiety as needed.\\n\\nI have to say that I'm really liking the klonopin. Here's my breakdown as I see it, and again, this stuff works totally different for different people and I'm not a doctor.\\n\\nXanax (alprazolam):\\n\\nPros-\\n\\n* Great for breakthrough anxiety attacks\\n* Great for knocking yourself out on a airplane, although there will be a hangover\\n* Fast acting with a bit of a rush to know its gonna be okay\\n* Great to keep in your pocket to ward off anxiety because you know you can diffuse it\\n* If you smoke trees or do psychadelics, invaluable for getting you out of a freakout\\n\\nCons\\n\\n* Very short acting, meaning re-dosing often and riding a bit of a roller coaster\\n* Very tough on memory, even .5 mg means I might get some brownout retrograde amnesia about what I did the previous day while on it.\\n* Makes my stomach feel kinda weird, like empty and just a little uncomfortable\\n* I don't drink much, but be careful with booze around xanax\\n\\nKlonopin (clonezepam):\\n\\nPros-\\n\\n*  Don't feel medicated, just feel rather normal and somewhat more confident, good for social anxiety\\n*  The long acting properties means you don't think about it which (if you have an addictive personality) means you just kinda take it occasionally, but there's no reason to be popping these more than once or twice a day (morning and night is a popular regiment)\\n*  Takes less than an hour to kick in, don't really notice it\\n* Great for productivity, doesn't cloud thinking in smaller doses and lowers inhibitions in a good way.\\n* Cuts off anxiety at its source, just seems to stop the worrying cycle\\n* Takes the edge of smoking trees without totally killing your buzz\\n* Nice warm feeling and relaxing\\n* Less amnesia\\n* Easier to get off of as it is longer lasting and tapers itself nicely\\n\\nCons\\n\\n* Not great for instant panic situations, although you'll have less of them.\\n* Not very useful recreationally (yay!)\\n\\nHaving been using it for a few weeks now, I really really like it and how it helps me be the person I knew I should be. Meditation and talk therapy are also part of my regiment, but this is one medicine change I've been very happy with.\\n\\nI find the strength to be somewhat comparable, but to me 1mg xanax feels like 1.5-2mg of Klonopin.\\n\\nBest of luck out there, it's going to be okay.\\n\\n\", \"Hey all,\\n\\nI've had a really bad week. Last Saturday I collapsed and had to go to emergency but they found nothing wrong with my heart or brain. All week I've been slowly getting over the headache from hitting my head.

It's hard sometimes to sort feels.\\n\\nI've been chronically depressed for about 8 years, with a rather severe anxiety disorder.\\n\\nFor years, I assumed the depression was the major problem, that the anxiety was just a part of it, I hardly even saw it as anxiety. When I was in college, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and at that point, I felt like someone had taken all my years of sorrow and just told me they were irrelevant, and that it was just anxiety. I had become so protective of my depression. It had and has made me who i am &amp; ultimately, I liked that person, and she wouldn't have existed without that depression and the anxiety. I know they didn't say 'just anxiety', but that was what it felt like, since I had no personal  conscious experience with it yet. My sad had been dismissed, I had to rethink a lot of things. But with a new look at my issues, and the awareness of my anxiety, I really saw what I had been going through, how persistent, and hellish and how somatic my anxiety and my depression had been. I remembered anxiety attacks, I remembered feeling helpless and just crazy, a little. But now, I could focus on that, I could focus on it because I knew what it was.\\n\\nI have anxiety attacks sporadically. Sometimes I get them once or more a day, every day, sometimes once a week, sometimes once a month, sometimes every few days. Recently, I had gone 4 months without one severe enough to require my medication, I was really proud of that. The key was that I was with someone who made me feel valued, safe, comfortable, and happy. That's not something you can prescribe though, and it's something I was ridiculously lucky to find. Today, that changed, I woke up with an anxiety attack that didn't let up for hours on end. It hurt, I cried, I hyperventilated, I continued to cry, my mind snowballed everything out of proportion, and I couldn't speak anymore.

I’ll try to keep it short.  She had an ear infection and the doctor gave her a prescription for hydrocodone but told her to use it sparingly because it is addictive.  Because she didn’t want to get addicted she then decided to use Klonopin for the pain in her ear instead.  (Yes, we know this was now a mistake.)  She was using the Klonopin for 2 weeks when she started feeling heaviness on her chest and that lead to panic attacks.  The doctor prescribed Zoloft 100 mg which made her feel awful and then Lexapro 10mg which also made her feel awful.  \\n\\nShe went to a new doctor.  This new one had her continue taking the Klonopin 0.5 mg three times a day and added propranolol to help with the heaviness in the chest.  They checked out her heart and it was fine.  Then she was switched over from Klonopin to Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day to help with the nausea she was experiencing.  She felt like “an elastic band that was stretched and then plucked” so they started her on Buspirone 30 mg a day.  This seemed to help a little.  Then they upped it to 45 mg a day and she had extreme nausea.  She can’t eat any food and only has protein like shakes for the past 5 days.  \\n\\nThey cut it back to 30 mg three days ago and the last three days have been hell.  She feels the most anxiety that she has ever felt and would do anything to get the pain to stop.  She is not suicidal, reports no depression and I am keeping a very close watch on her.\\n\\nMy questions:\\n\\nWhat is happening?\\n\\nThe only meds she is on now is Buspirone 30mg and Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day.\\n\\nAre these meds making her nauseas or is it her “nerves”?\\n\\nShe has tried Zofran, which didn’t work, phenegran, and reglan which both had “twitching” as a side effect.  She takes Benadryl which helps a little.  \\n\\nIs she now addicted to the Ativan?\\n\\nDoes she need a different anti anxiety med?\\n\\nI know that no one wants make medical advice without having more information but I really could use some guidance here.\\n\\nCurrent Meds: Buspar 30 mg, Ativan 0.5 mg, Benadryl 50 mg \\n\\nThank you so much in advance!\\n\\n\\n', 'Hi,\\n\\nSo my friend has been suffering what I possibly think is an anxiety disorder. It started around mid-August, and she would ask me things like, \"Hey, do I look different?\" and \"Is there anything wrong with my face?\" and \" Does my face look fatter than before?\" Mind you, I am male, so there\\'s obviously some bias. I honestly didn\\'t know what she was talking about because she still looked the same to me. Little did I know, this was the beginning to a very slippery slope. I then found out that over the months leading to now she had been asking various friends that she had about it, she went to a doctor\\'s clinic to get it checked, she has been calling various medical professions about it, etc. And they would giver her answers like, \"Oh, you\\'re losing weight..\" \"Your face is changing as you age\" \"Your face changes with your environment\" etc. The problem with this is that this obsession about her face has been ruining her life. She\\'s not the same person anymore. She\\'s usually really out-going, friendly, attentive. But now, because of this intense obsession over her face, she has been doing things that she normally doesn\\'t do. She was supposed to go out for a retreat the past weekend, but instead decided to sleep all day. On her birthday in October, we were supposed to go hiking, but she called it off because she woke up with panic attacks pertaining to her insecurity about her face.\\n\\nLast night, I had to calm her down. I drove to her place, picked her up, and brought her to a park to just talk, and what we talked about just ripped me to shreds. I felt like I had no answer to everything she was asking. She\\'d say things like, \"I don\\'t know if I can live with this face!\" and \"I can\\'t live anymore! I can\\'t live for myself! I can\\'t live for my loved ones!\" and \"This thing is ruining my life, but I don\\'t know what to do I am so helpless!\" I\\'d say things like you have to keep fighting, but she\\'d just say that she couldn\\'t and that she\\'s giving up. Last night, as I was dropping her off back at her place, I felt so defeated. Usually when I talk to her I could calm her down, but this time I just... couldn\\'t. It really sucked. And I realize that I don\\'t have all the answers, and all I could do is be there for her. \\n\\nThe thing is, she\\'s been seeking professional help, but it hasn\\'t been doing anything. That really concerns me. I don\\'t want her to be reduced to a pill bottle and a prescription. This face obsession makes me think that this is a mental problem from all the overwork she\\'s been experiencing (btw she\\'s a college student that interns and has a job), but I can\\'t  put my finger on it for sure. I\\'m no psychiatrist. \\n\\nTL;DR - My best friend has been having an intense anxiety problem about her face and she\\'s losing the will to live because of it', \"Hi. I'm a 29 year old male who has suffered from varying degrees of anxiety for as long as I can remember. It used to be social anxiety, but once I got into my late teens and more comfortable it really became just constant worrying. Looped thoughts, time wasted spent obsessing over uncontrollable variables while pressing issues are ignored... That kind of thing. I really seemed to have gotten a grip of everything to the point that I had started to forget what anxiety even felt like. Then I went from a steady relationship to a somewhat fast-paced and chaotic dating life.\\n\\nThe one thing that absolutely turns my world inside out is dating. Something about the uncertainty involved with dating really cripples me emotionally. I spent most of my teenage years into my early twenties either in committed relationships or having casual sex.\\n\\nAn example would be with a girl I've been seeing for about a month now. She seems to be really into me. We always have a great time. If she doesn't respond to a text message, anxiety completely cripples me. Why didn't she respond? What did I say? Basically worst case scenario obsessing. I'm not a super alpha male type, but I'm fairly confident and don't think these thoughts are consistent with how I normally carry myself.\\n\\nI can recognize that this is irrational and I don't do anything stupid (other than obsessing over it) like text her 1,000 times. When I'm dating, rather than in a committed relationship this type of thing really cripples me. I don't do as well at work, I let everyday things slide because I'm obsessing over little things.\\n\\nAnother thing is when I have to make plans. For some reason I'm obsessed over what I come up with as if it's going to be awful and ruin everything. Again, I know that's irrational and I'll force myself to just come up with something, but when I'm experiencing these things it's all I can focus on. My thoughts loop over the same thing again and again. If I'm seeing someone and we have established plans in the future this crippling anxiety immediately stops. I mean it completely goes away the very second plans are established.\\n\\nThere is not a single other thing I can think of that brings this out in me. Just dating. I feel like I could be told to learn a new language and give a 15 minute speech in that language on a subject I know nothing about with a gun to my head and I would feel less anxious.\\n\\nCan anyone relate to this at all? Am I just insane? I'm considering going to see a psychologist about anxiety meds, but it seems so weird to me that dating is the only thing I can think of that brings this out in me. Any input would be appreciated.\\n\\n**TL;DR Thought I had control of my anxiety, but realized when I'm dating it cripples me when communicating and making plans.

I was diagnosed with IgA Nephropathy, which is an autoimmune kidney condition 8-9 years ago (I\\'m 26 now). Thank God it has been mild for a long time after being medicated after my initial (severe bout), and my kidneys have been in stable condition. Several doctors have told me that I can live a long, \"normal\" life with this condition, but it doesn\\'t change the fact that I can\\'t live a 100% normal life, and it will get harder as I get older, and that I may not live as long as I could potentially.\\n\\nI\\'ve posted previously on this board about bouts of prostatitis and stomach pains that I\\'ve had in the past that would last for about a week or so, which in themselves have caused me significantly distress thinking I had cancer or some other auto-immune disease. During my last semester abroad in graduate school, I was living independently, long-distance with my girlfriend, taking 9 courses in school, and was given news before arriving abroad that my kidney condition, although stable, was acting up a bit, but not enough for him to say I definitely needed medication. In panic, I tried to contact my specialist before I left, only to be told that I should go see a psychiatrist/therapist instead. I felt discarded. I saw a couple docs while I was living on my own, and was prescribed benzos for anxiety (first ativan, then klonazepam). I took about 20 or so doses during my time there, when I felt I needed it. I also increased my paxil from 20 mg to 25 mg, which wasn\\'t stabilizing me, until finally I gave in to 30 mg at the tail end of the semester.\\n\\nThose 4 months were hell, and passed. It was 2 weeks of complete hell and existential crisis, followed by two weeks of relative normalcy. This process repeated the entirety of the semester. I went to visit my girlfriend in Japan after the semester for 3 and a half weeks, and I even had a bit of anxiety for four or so days there over some joint pain I was convinced was gout, an auto-immune disease, or kidney problems (I did take some benzos on the plane). However, I started feeling the 30 mg shift (either that or I really was just enjoying myself to the point that I felt very comfortable and could care less about my condition). I made the decision I wanted to move down to 25 mg when I was in Japan again. This was a horrible mistake.\\n\\nAs soon as I came back home (Toronto), I was happy to see my family, to give them souvenirs, to show them my pictures, to unpack.

However, I fear so much that she won\\'t put up with my anxiety, and won\\'t put up with my health problems if they are to worsen. I love her so much that I don\\'t want her to have a hard life. Because of this, I pity myself. I hate myself for having this problem. I feel like I should just get this all over with and die. Why do I have to go through this long, slow process of losing an organ, and dragging the person I love most along with me?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the future holds. I don\\'t know what advances technology will lead, but I wish I was ignorant about my condition having anxiety and all.

I\\'ve reverted to having to go sit in the car when a store is too loud, I\\'m spending more and more time in my pajamas and using it as a reason to not leave the house because I have \"standards.\"\\n\\nI\\'ve been hanging out with my boyfriend for an hour at a time, max.

', \"hi guys, I hope I'm writing this in the correct subreddit. I'm new here. but I'm hoping I can get some advice:\\n\\nI suffer from social anxiety and have tried multiple medications for this but they all failed (I am currently prescribed 100mg lamictal &amp; 30mg adderall which I have been on for years) but I never tried benzos until yesterday when I was prescribed .5mg of clonazepam from my psychiatrist. \\n\\nI took my first .5mg dose yesterday to see how I would react to it (as opposed to first taking it when I am forced to socialize). I woke up feeling very calm... I'm usually very anxious upon starting my day. and throughout the day I also noticed I felt very mellow. in a good way. \\n\\nI took my second dose today except I broke it in half. so I took .125mg at around 5:30pm &amp; the second .125mg at around 7:00pm. \\n\\nI still feel mellow but I keep wondering whether or not this will work this weekend (forcing myself to leave my cave and socialize ha ha). I want to be able to just be okay in a social setting. even if I don't interact with anyone.... haha if that even makes any sense...\\n\\nso can anyone tell me your thoughts? or experiences? I would really appreciate it. I'm new to this medication and would do anything to get rid of this social anxiety so I could use all the advice I can get. \\n\\nthanks guys\\n\\n\", 'Fuck yeah.\\nI am introverted. I don\\'t like large crowds, feel myself tiring easily when being with more than 2-3 people, I don\\'t get joys from drinking and being loud. I might be wrong, but anxious people I know are usually introverted, including myself.\\n\\nHowever, I should say that being introverted is only a part of who i am. The reason you shouldn\\'t obsess over it is just that. You are many other things. You are maybe left handed, maybe kinder than other, maybe you\\'re good at cleaning or you write well. Yes, the western society (I am not saying all societies because I am not sure) is made so that very few introverts can \"succeed\" socially. What I mean by that is that many jobs are \"handed over\" from connections to connections made by after-work drinks parties, \"Social Networking\" parties (soooo many of those nowadays). People in power like extroverts, they appreciate their qualities and their social abilities. Introverts are also less likely to suckup to bosses. That\\'s okay. You probably noticed, if you\\'re working, how some people have been working for 3 months and are much more liked than a quiet dude who\\'s been there for years. That\\'s okay too. \\n\\nI have struggled for years in my youth to try and be like others. It was difficult, but I don\\'t see it as a \"negative\" aspect of my life anymore. Listening a lot, I learnt how to read people\\'s emotions. I was able to tell when someone was uncomfortable, angry, happy, whatever and be receptive and helpful towards that person. It\\'s not something taught in school. I think maybe its something you learn from growing up in a highly tense home environment. Gaging your parent\\'s moods, checking quietly to see who is in a bad mood today at home, who will throw a punch to whom, trying to avoid that punch or that slap or that abuse. Then comes being poor, not being able to afford medical care, the constant near-PTSD actions I still sometimes do (check my bank balance every day, being paranoid although I know I have some money).  Being a minority, facing racism on the daily, feeling isolated from the mainstream was a thing. Knowing you have money in your account, and still sweating when pressing the PIN at the grocery store, as a video of your previous experiences of your card being rejected plays in your head over and over and over... That\\'s okay. it heals. It hurt, it dug inside me, it bled me dry in my teen years. But time passed and I don\\'t know if it\\'s from conscious or unconscious decisions but now they are pale in my mind, despite the fact that i still face some difficulties.\\n\\nSuffering can evolve, if you give it time. Don\\'t react immediately, don\\'t be harsh on yourself, refrain from self-destruction. Easier said than done, I know. Yet who else will do it if not for you? Yes, I have baggage, like everyone else in this world. I have suffered. Not only emotionally but physically. I have endured years of abuse, years of poverty. I\\'m not some silver-spoon person with anxiety. I suffered and had recurring anxiety and depression. We are all unhappy or depressed because of different reasons. That\\'s okay. My past issues has made me a different, evolved and a more thoughtful person. My present issues will hopefully also be a stepping stone for me to look over the pain and isolation of my future life. \\n\\nBe kind to kind people around you... it\\'s a personal thing I have but when I was pointy and angry, my attitude didn\\'t help at all. I am not a religious person, but this passage I read from the life of the Buddha has really been helpful.\"You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection.\"\\nIntroverts are important in society, although they aren\\'t recognized for it very often. They are the confidants, the thoughtful friend, that buddy you go see in their comfy home for some quiet time and support that cannot be found anywhere else. Introverts might not be a \"mainstream hero\". You might rarely see introverted \"superstars\" getting love and attention from the mass. We don\\'t need to be perfect. We don\\'t necessarily need love and support from thousands of people. We need love from ourselves...Remember that we are what we are, and the changes needed to be made are from within ourselves. \\n\\nMy suffering has set me apart from other and has perhaps made me lonelier, but I do sometimes meet that 1 person whom I can connect to, online or in real life. I still don\\'t have money (or good health), but I have perspective. I know my fate isn\\'t \"the worst thing ever\", even though it feels like it. I still have anxiety, but I know what causes them and I am able to if not avoid, at least lessen them through self-taught behaviour therapy. I wasn\\'t dealt the best deck of cards, but I found support firstly through myself, then my partner, and now here.\\nIf I can do it, you know you can too, because I am not special or some underdog, I am just someone who decided that I won\\'t quit. I decided I would cope, rebuild and try. And no one will know all these things I think of, all the feelings inside. I won\\'t have a huge ritz-carlton party to celebrate the day I will be finally less anxious, but I will have myself, my accomplishments and my partner. But even without these, I would be okay. I am an introvert with anxiety, and it will be alright.', \"I was let go from my last job because my boss had an extremely confrontational interpersonal style-she would berate me in front of others and basically make me feel like there was literally nothing I could do that was right. I was so riddled with anxiety that I couldn't even perform the basic functions of my job, and I was let go. I managed to land a new and better job with a better boss, but a few careless mistakes in the last few months have really strained things. I'm trying as hard as I can to have a dialogue with her about how I'm doing, I'm working on my weaknesses, and I'm trying to learn from and not repeat mistakes. I'm also on medication for anxiety, and I'm seeing a therapist. But I'm still spending most of my day in panic mode because I think my boss is getting fed up with my mistakes, small and infrequent though they may be. At this point, it isn't out of the question that I could be fired although it isn't a certainty by any means. \\n\\nBut if I do get fired, this will make 2 jobs in 2 years that I've lost because of my anxiety. I'm in a high stress job (lawyer) and my boss is trying to help but she gets frustrated with my lack of judgement or insight into our work. What she fails to mention is that everyone else in the department has multiple years there, I've been there 13 months. But if she knows that, it doesn't seem to matter. I'm terrified I'm going to lose this job, and I will feel absolutely worthless if I do. Add to that the guilt I will feel because my wonderful girlfriend would have to pay all of our bills, and I'm pretty much a wreck most days. I hate feeling this way, and I hate knowing that the people I work with see me as incompetent or high strung, or just an idiot.  Bottom line, I'm frustrated and I'm scared. \\n\\nSorry for rambling.

I was watching a youtube video about these glasses that can help some colourblind people see colour properly, and this guy got so overwhelmed and was just fascinated by the fact he could differentiate red and green. I just started welling up and happy crying for no reason, other than this guy was so happy. I haven't happy cried in a long long time, I think since before I even realised something was wrong in my head. I think this has helped me realise that the medication I'm on, while dulling the anxiety and depression, also dulls the good feelings sometimes as well. I think I'm going to mention this to my doctor and see what she says about it, because if there are other medications I could try that dull the anxiety but don't necessarily dull the happiness as much then I'd like to try them. \\n\\n**NOTE: I in no way condone or encourage people to take themselves off antidepressants without first speaking to their GP about it, and getting their opinion of it, and doing it in a safe and controlled, usually gradual, way.

Took a few and added in my own info. Maybe someone can sympathies with me or help me understand that I\\'m not alone in this.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n* **Excessive worry**\\nConstantly, all the time... about everything. I don\\'t think I get more than a few minutes at a time where I\\'m not worrying about something. Its so hard to deal with. My SO notices this, A LOT. Its incredibly emotionally and mentally draining.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* **Sleep Problems**\\nUsually a nightly thing. Worrying keeps me awake. I end up not sleeping well a lot of the time and I end up being easy to upset. I\\'m constantly cranky and can only seem to shut my mind off if I take sleeping pills to rest. Those nights when I take pills, I\\'m less cranky the following day. The pills however leave me with a cloudy feeling, Sleeping pills always do this to me.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* **Irrational fears**\\nCrowds of people are one of my biggest worries. I don\\'t handle them well and just wish I could vanish. I live in MN and going the mall of america can be overwhelming.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* **Muscle tension**\\nMy jaw and leg muscles give me alot of grief. Also my back.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* **Chronic indigestion**\\nA lot of times If I become panicked or stressed, my stomach starts to turn. I feel like I\\'m going to be sick.

And if they do manage to go through with it, they tend to be deeply uncomfortable and may dwell on it for a long time afterward, wondering how they were judged.\"\\n\\nI quoted that because yeah, all of that. Most situations I run into end up turning into a huge ordeal when they shouldn\\'t be. If I know a date is coming, its like a dooms day count down.

The closer I come to the date, the whole indigestion thing flares up and I\\'m easily to panic if thing get knocked around in my schedule.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* **Self-consciousness**\\nI have asthma and I\\'m really overweight. I put on a lot of weight when I found out my mother had a series of medical issues. She eventually passed on and the weight just came on with a vengeance. When I was 175 pounds and fit, I would say my anxiety was still there, but manageable. I still hated crowds and such, but I was able to manage it all and even enjoy life a lot more than now. Right now I\\'m aware at how bad I look physically. It makes the constant feeling of people looking at me (even if they aren\\'t) all the worse.

Once I had a gun pulled on me and was hit across the face with it. I don\\'t have flash backs while I\\'m awake, but I relive those moments when I dream, more often than I wish.

Combine any of the above with a depressive episode and I\\'m a wreck. I\\'m good at masking it at times, but not always. Bless my SO\\'s heart, he deals with a lot. My previous relationship was to someone who was very emotionally/mentally abusive to me. It left me a mess and I wouldn\\'t leave the house for months at a time. This last roughly 10 years.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nThe issue of work has been brought to the forefront in mu current relationship. My SO is having a hard time maintaining us and I need to help him out. It was fine for a time because I basically kept this place up, cooked clean and did all the household chores. I need to beable to help them financially though. My question is, how?\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nI was hired at walmart, but left. It was a two part issue.

I can\\'t even tell you what my anxiety did. Greeting people, dealing with money, learning registers... worrying if i\\'ll screw up... making sure I have eye contact. It all just wrecked me. I am fine if left alone in my own world, given a task. Dealing with the general public though minus the stray person and things become unbearable.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nSo... now we\\'re at the end of this. Do I sound like I may have anxiety? I\\'ll soon find out, next week for sure. Like I said before, I just don\\'t want to feel alone in the world and at the moment, I kinda do.

Sometimes this is brought on by the usual reasons (outside stress/exhaustion/not eating properly), but sometimes there are specific triggers and I've actually had to leave the theater.

It has been 5 days now since I started taking them and although I still have social anxiety, I no longer have the constant nagging anxiety that was haunting me before. I look forward to bedtime now and I get delicious sleep. I am in a good mood, smiling, and laughing and making jokes. I no longer have the nausea, diarrhea, headaches and everything else that came along with the anxiety. I'm starting to feel like myself again. I highly recommend this formula!

My social phobia has prevented me trying to achieve a lot of dreams, instead if has let me become isolated and watch netflix and play hearthstone all day.\\n\\nNow, me and my therapist and my psychiatrist talk alot, and we agreed that a stimulant of some sort would be beneficial for me to become more extroverted and talk to people. I got prescribed 90 20mg IR pills for a month, which is 60mg of Adderall per day. Now, I know what you are thinking. Who starts on a dose of adderall that large? Well no worries, I have only taken about 10-20mg and plan to not go overboard. I mean, my insurance covers it so why not get free pills?\\n\\nSo, it's been day 2 on adderall for me. I have been feeling more motivated and talkative. The crash was kind of bad yesterday though and I threw up because I took too much, around 30mg... \\n\\nMy question is, do you think adderall can help me overcome social anxiety? It isn't just a tool for ADHD/ADD, I don't have either. I have done lots of research on forums and many people say it has helped, and I think I can be one of those people. Benzos lower my anxiety but make me feel foggy and not sociable. Adderall can do the opposite. Combined, I think it will be perfect.\\n\\nWhat do you guys think? Please only answer if you are open-minded and have had experience or know someone w/ experience for adderall as a medication for anxiety and being a more productive, better person.\", 'Does anybody know about this anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication?

I am a 19 year old female college student, by the way.\\n\\nThanks!', \"So I have SEVERE anxiety. To the point where I sometimes have panic attacks while driving on the freeway or I start hyperventilating in the checkout line at the grocery store. I am dating this guy and do not want to take it further with him because I am scared. I have also gone through periods of agoraphobia where I don't leave the house for weeks. It got really bad about 6 months ago when I went to rehab. I had been on klonopin for my insomnia for about 4 years but I became very addicted to it and was on far above the legal dose. I was weaned off of it and over the months I became more and more paralyzed by fear. I have never known anxiety of this caliber ever before in my life until now. I didn't realize how much the klonopin affected how I perceived the world until it was no longer there. I've tried alternative treatments such as biofeedback and other forms of mindfulness, yoga, supplements, etc. Nothing is providing lasting relief. I also see a psychiatrist for psychotherapy every two weeks and he is amazing. He does help some but it's not enough to get through the every day trials I deal with in regards to my anxiety. I asked him if he could prescribe an SSRI or something to take the edge off just for now but he refuses because I have been to rehab. It's frustrating because I am not asking for a medication I could potentially become addicted to, I am just asking for something to improve my functioning. I am miserable. I cry every day and can't handle having relationships. I am scared to be alive, genuinely. So I am thinking of finding another doctor. If I do, I'm just curious what medications worked for you guys, if any? Obviously I know that just because it worked for you doesn't mean it will work for me but I just need some comfort that there is something out there that might make me feel a little bit better. I desperately need some hope right now. Also, any other alternative therapies you have tried that I didn't list. Please, tell me more about them. I am interested. \\n\\ntl;dr I need some hope right now that I can feel better. Share your stories of what has worked for you medication or otherwise. Thank you!\", 'I\\'m at the point where my anxiety is taking over me every morning. \\n\\nI make donuts,  so I\\'m the first person in every morning. Anyways,  this morning when I walked in and just looked at the boxed glazed donuts, it hit me like a bag of bricks. I almost couldn\\'t breathe. I\\'m so glad nobody was around because I probably looked stupid staring at those boxes for a full minute or so. \\n\\nThis is getting to be a daily occurrence.

I called my doctor last week and asked for an appointment to see what I can do,  maybe get referred to a therapist. The receptionist was a real bitch.

I don\\'t know what to do now :/', \"I'd like to start off saying that I do not suffer from anxiety, so my understanding of this is fairly new with dealing on a personal level.\\n\\nI have been with my girlfriend for a few years now and it has been amazing. She is a wonderful person who I admire greatly and wouldn't change her for the world. But there is one thing I feel helpless about sometimes and it is her anxiety. It isn't a huge deal for me, and it is not a daily crippling struggle for her. She is still able to complete her days when she is feeling the weight of the world on her shoulders and I can't imagine how hard it is to struggle with daily tasks while suffering from anxiety and continue to push through the day.\\n\\nThis being said I sometimes feel lost in my ability to help. I am not an clueless and can sometimes tell she is holding back all these feelings and emotions cause I can imagine she doesn't want to feel like she is burdening me with her life problems. WHICH IS NOT THE CASE AND I HAVE TOLD HER THAT lol....those pesky over thinking minds :)  As someone who has no prior experience with this situation I do what in my mind is the best thing I can think of. I put myself in her shoes and try to treat her as if I was going through these problems. I motivate her and give her the best advice as I possibly can on how I deal with stressful situations. I hold her when it gets to bad and tell her it will be okay. I comfort her as best as I know how and it usually tends to deescalate the situation and everything calms down.\\n\\nHowever, sometimes I feel trapped in a corner when these situations happen. Since I have no form of anxiety, I often run out of things to say and it doesn't help that sometimes the triggers are repeated experiences. I don't like feeling like I'm a broken record with advice when I run out of things to say or do. It can feel like I'm a doctor giving Motrin for every gripe, ache, and pain no matter what. \\n\\nI have told her to find more hobbies and continuously harp on exercise as a huge stress fighter. Because I don't want her to always rely on the meds and only take them when she needs them, but I have already told her that she needs to have them with at all times in case it gets too bad. In perfect world I would love to see her off meds and be able to not be bothered by all these things but I know that might not ever happen, which is okay. I am a her shoulder and open ear and I just want to have good advice to reply back with....I don't want her to feel like she has to hold things in, or go to other friends before coming to me. And I know that not all things she will talk to me about and I am okay with that too lol. \\n\\nIdk I guess I'm wondering if there are other people out their in my situation that have advice or things that they have found that help. \\n\\n***Sorry for the length and if it seems like I rant***\\n\\n \", \"Hello, lately i have been feeling anxiety and it's dealing with small stuff.

Short story about my current situation:  \\n\\nI have never been the type to have many friends. Mostly the uncertainty of social experiences has scared me away from them entirely. If you saw me you would never know. A few months back my 2 year relationship with a girl I met in high school and went to college with ended. Had I not been afraid of what the outcome would be I likely would have ended it a year earlier. I have put up with anxiety symptoms for years, but lately that combined with depression or loneliness has had me sleeping in as long as I can, not wanting to face my life as is. There can be hours at a time where I am playing video games with friends and am happy as ever, but any trigger or stray thought to my current state has me shutting off the computer and laying in bed for anywhere from minutes to the rest of the day. Consciously I am well aware I am glad the relationship ended. Yet I cannot keep myself from thinking about the \"what ifs\", and part of me convincing me to be sad for myself over it.  \\n\\nI am looking for any advice going forward. Personally I have tried to avoid getting medication, as I don\\'t feel risking side effects is worth it. I will look into it if it is thought to really help.', \"I'm an adult now but I'm still very dependent on my parents.

I'm enrolled in an online course and I'm almost done. I'm struggling with something normal people would find easy even with the correct dosage of medication.\\n\\nJust thinking of how much struggle I'll have to face in future makes me even more anxious and afraid.

I want to do things and have a life but I'm scared of rejection and scared of being used again.\", 'This is going to need a little background. five years ago i had an experience where a girl told me she was pregnant. She and i had hooked up during the senior summer before i went abroad for a gap year and study. While i was there, she played me for 8 months and left me expecting to be a father that would be giving his child up for adoption. Low and behold it was all a \"practical joke\" and i was left with no explanations and some pretty severe mental distress and trauma that persisted for the next few years. I have suffered from physical anxiety attacks, cyclical depression for the past several years, but this experience elevated it all to a whole new level. It led to the general inability to trust someone in a relationship without inuring the aforementioned issues.\\n\\nIt has been almost 5 years since i have been able to trust someone enough to pursue a relationship. Previous attempts left me suffering with physical anxiety attacks that were an almost daily occurrence. Recently though, i have been able to move beyond those terrors and to ask a gal out for a date. She and i have been together a little more than a month and it was fun, but now she is incredibly distant.\\n\\nShe and i are going to talk next week once we are back from spring break, but in the mean time i am left with my thoughts and fears. It is absolutely terrifying me.\\n\\nWhile i know that i\\'m probably freaking out about nothing, my previous experiences are weighing on my mind. I am terrified that something is wrong, not so much that the relationship might not be working out, but rather that she might be pregnant. I am having flashbacks to the last time before i went abroad and its tearing me apart. I dont know if this is something i can go through again. Even though the first time was all a lie, for 8 months it was very real.\\n\\nIt terrifies me that after receiving counseling and being treated for the physical anxiety that it could be happening all over again. My first time removing the barriers that i put up to relationships, not allowing myself to focus wholly on work and school, and that it could be happening all over again. I just dont know.\\nShe and i will talk and im sure its nothing, but like i said, i cannot silence my fears.

Two years ago I was diagnosed with [Supraventricular Tachycardia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraventricular_tachycardia) and my cardiologist decided it was serious enough to have an [ablation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter_ablation).\\n\\nThe procedure went well and it wasn\\'t until two months later when started having palpations, skipped and fastened heart beats, ect ect.   \\nIt really started to take it\\'s toll on me. I was so outgoing and carefree before everything happened and now I can\\'t do most of the activities I used to love- out of fear of having anything stated above.\\n\\nI saw my cardiologist but he\\'s very dismissive. I get it, he deals with people going through heart transplants and major heart problems but to me this is the most important thing happening in my life...the one thing I can\\'t stop thinking about and it\\'s destroying me. He suggested I see some psychologists and whatnot for relaxation techniques. I don\\'t have anything against getting help but I can google \"relaxation techniques\" and find a ton of ideas (plus I do yoga which helps)\\n\\nFast forward: I\\'ve been on 10MG of Valium for about a year. I take it at various times when I\\'m anxious or have palpations or fluttering and it doesn\\'t help at all...Unless I have an empty stomach, then it works for about 10 minutes and I go back to feeling anxious and whatnot.  I don\\'t take it everyday. Sometimes I take it a few times a week and other times around once a month. It never helps.\\n\\nA few months ago I went to the ER with an episode of SVT (which is now an undiagnosed heart condition according to my cardiologist) and after it subsided the doctor noticed I was anxious and gave me a one off dose of Xanax.

Perhaps so that others wouldn’t do the same things I am doing now. \\n\\nActually, nothing is too bad. I do have a supportive family, a couple of friends, and I’m studying to become what I’ve always wanted, which is translation from foreign languages. I would never go to a therapist because nothing is bothering me on the inside – or more likely because I don’t want to admit I have any problems speaking to a doctor. It might all be just my imagination, after all. \\n\\nI’m 20, male, and I have Cystic Fibrosis, a chronic illness that is incurable and leaves me with a somewhat shorter lifespan than usual, but if I eat all the pills and do all the treatments, it’s going to be alright for quite a bit more years, aside from coughing a lot every single day. I’m living with my Mom, who has sheltered me from most of human interaction on the good grounds of that the more exposure to the outside world I get, the sooner I get ill and the shorter my life is. I’ve never talked to a cashier to buy anything, I’ve never went anywhere outside the house alone with only one or two exceptions I will tell later, I’ve never went to a school to talk with the kids.\\n\\nI did, however, have three or four good friends in the summer, when Mom and the grandparents were at the summer house, since I was 5 or 6 until around 15. Thanks to CF, my hormones are a little bit off, and the puberty started quite a couple of years later than usual, and my peers mostly used me as a source of toys and an easy target for bullying. One day, they stopped coming to my house for there were other entertaining things, such as flirting and girls and booze and smoking, of all which I didn’t join them. Roughly that time was when I got my first computer and switched from teachers coming home-schooling by foot to teachers coming home in a computer screen. Obviously, I got some friends as a bonus as well.\\n\\nNow, what’s the problem? The problem is, I’m dead scared to talk to any kind of people I have to talk to. I got a dog to go outside alright, and I was walking him almost every day (except for extremely high or low temperatures, or the sick times), up until some old lady said she didn’t want me or my dog walking anywhere near her cats, which is at the entrance of the house (and that’s a very urban city for you). Then, I never walked with the dog again, except for when Mom agreed to walk with me as well. \\n\\nThen, there is the university, which also is going strong through the Internet, and all the fellow students and teachers. I’m both extremely jealous of all them because they talk freely at the lectures and even communicate one another outside of them, and angry at myself that I can’t belong to the group, too, and be the cause of laughter, source of knowledge, or just a general student. A year ago, when the first year started, I talked with everyone at the lectures, and everyone seemed to love me, only that my heart was pounding and my feet and hands were dead cold every time I had to talk, and then, well, I just stopped talking. I'm still going to the lectures, but whenever my name is mentioned, I shut off the computer and just sit there not even feeling awful or guilty that much. I guess that as far as I do the homeworks meeting all the deadlines, they won’t kick me out (I’m still the best student out of the group, as the teachers say), so it’s all good, but I still wish I could be re-plugged into the network of other students again, or something.\\n\\nI’m not at all concerned about relationships, but, sadly enough, I attracted a very nice guy to myself, and even though he’s great and very caring and passionate, I don’t feel anything back to him. Might be because I’m not gay (but most likely I am, because I’ve never ever talked to girls in my life or felt the need or desire to do so). We talked a lot, and I reciprocated his “I love you”’s and other things because I didn’t know what they really meant. He loves me utterly and completely, and I have no idea what to do about it. Therefore, instead of watching movies or TV series or playing games together there is that same outcome: I stopped talking to him using my voice, and am avoiding talking to him in text, even though I know that’s not fair at all concerning him and how he cares about me.\\n\\nSo, here I am, not talking to anyone but my family and one single best friend, being angry and confused since I can’t find a way to be more talkative and not shy again (even though I am on Atarax, the medicine one doctor prescribed me to use against the anxiety, it doesn’t seem to help much so far). I’m probably not even intelligible and talk rubbish and not what you really want to hear. Oh well, can’t help that. Maybe one day I will ask the doctor if I might have Asperger’s, since my AQ score is way over the top, but I don’t think that will be any soon. I’d better be off living as it is now than talking about myself and what I might feel and what opinions I have on things to any person at all. \\n\", \"I have just graduated from university and I'm now working full time.

She's currently staying at home 24/7 whilst I'm working, so I'm not sure if there are any jobs that she can do whilst at home.

No matter what I get on my SAT I feel like it isn't going to be good enough for me. I got a 26 on my ACT (while having a panic attack during testing) , but I can't seem to forgive myself and am afraid to take it again because I feel like I will fail myself again. I don't even have a target score for either of these tests, but every time I see my scores I feel like I am nothing, but a number. I am that score. My grades don't matter because I'm that score. Everything feels like it is going to fall apart because I didn't score a few points higher and I know that if I did score higher it wouldn't matter because I would feel the same way. My constant desire to improve myself is causing me pain. I was hard on myself about low A's. My transcripts don't even show percentages! Just the letter grade. Straight A's feels like nothing special to me and one B feels like my world is crumbling apart. My family is proud of me. My friends are proud of me. Everyone in my life believes that I'm doing great. Except the only person that needs to believe it, me. Instead of being happy with what I am doing with myself I get myself worked up and when something falls out of place I feel like everything else is falling out of place too. I feel like this is not only my best, but also my worst attribute. Ideally I can make it into only my best, but until I learn how to accomplish that, I am my harshest critic and form my feelings of anxiety through my harsh criticisms of myself how I only see the worst case scenario and never the best.\\n\\nThanks for letting me rant. I'm going to try and sleep now.\\n\\nSide note: I do receive profesional help and was diagnosed with a GAD and given meds just looking for support or someone similar I guess.\\n\\nTL;DR : I beat myself up over accomplishments probably worth being proud of it and cause myself anxiety by feeling like my world will crumble apart for not being perfect.\", 'Hi All, 23/f panic disorder/PTSD.  I\\'ve been in a highly stressful, dead-end job for 1 1/2 years now and I should have left long ago.  My boss is insensitive, rude, and insecure.  The work is largely administrative but also a lot of \"outside of the job description\" duties like project management, event planning, student supervision etc.  Basically it\\'s a job for 3 people and I\\'m expected to juggle it all. Needless to say, this job has been TERRIBLE for my anxiety.  I\\'ve had to go back on medication... I am in the middle of a big project and the new school year starts January 27. I\\'m hesitant to leave before I finish the project, but I don\\'t want the next 9ish weeks to be extremely painful.  I don\\'t have a job to go to yet, but honestly I just need to get out (luckily, we can survive on my partner\\'s salary and our savings if need be).  Any suggestions on how best to approach my boss?  He NEVER takes anything well and I\\'m concerned about backlash/not getting a good recommendation for other jobs.... :(  The anxiety about confronting him is almost so big that I just would rather tough it out another year.... ', 'so i was wondering if any of you have gone to the hospital for a panic attack. so what had led up to me going to the hospital was i had a really bad panic attack and i couldn\\'t get over and it was going on for about an hour. whenever i\\'ve had a bad panic attack that\\'s latest for a while i would just go and lay down and listen to my music, and i did that and it didn\\'t work this time. what led me to the hospital was my heart was racing and i was feeling really faint and like i was going to die. so i did what my heart doctor told me to do which was go to the hospital if i ever feel faint. so i did and this is where things got interesting, so there i was with two of my friends with me and (oh most of the staff that night was student doctors) the first \"doctor\" comes in and talks to me and says i\\'ll be back. okay, so the next one comes in and talks to me and asked me how did the panic attack feel and i said my heart was racing i felt really faint and like i was about to die. and then the next thing i know i\\'m heading to the psych ward all because i said i felt like i was going to die (i have really bad depression as well), so they took me saying that and with my depression as i was going to kill myself. so i spent almost four hours in the psych ward just for them to tell me oh you have a really bad panic disorder and agoraphobia. which is pretty stupid because i already knew i have really bad panic/anxiety problems, i feel like i should\\'ve never have gone because they didn\\'t listen to me. i felt like they jumped to conclusions and the trip to the psych ward was really not necessary, i really feel like i shouldn\\'t trust anyone in the medical field or that works in a hospital for that matter. has this ever happened to you, and how did or did it change your view of doctors. \\n- sorry if this post was long, really didn\\'t know how to shorten m experience. ', \"Hello I have had these issues for around 5 yrs now. It started as a bad time of the month (cramped and bled everywhere 2 hrs from home and panicked.) I am currently on meds now plus birth control since I believed it was hormonal. Anyways almost became an agoraphobe, but thankfully I don't let my anxiety control me like that. So fast forward to present...I have been good for several years give or take a few lingering anxiety attacks once or twice. (usually lasts like a week or two) and last year it hit me hard again, but it was a really stressful time since both me and my fiance both lost our jobs and money was running out fast. Either way after 6 months of no SSRI's I had to be put back on them (I kind of could not afford them so I decided to quit on my own.) \\n\\nAnyways a little over a week ago I got really sick and bedridden for 3 days in which caused my anxiety to sky rocket because I never had to call out of work once (other than earlier this year when I first started due to getting bad attacks and to get put on meds to control them better) and I never sat at home that long before in a looong time either. \\n\\nOkay to the point. I kind of think I screwed myself this year because when I get anxiety I get terrified of being home and especially being home alone so I always went out to stores after work and shopped around until a certain time then I would head home. I didn't want it to control me and make me stay home so I always went out, but I think this time I need to try and stay home more often in order to be more comfortable at home. Then on days off go do stuff (what are ya'lls opinions on this?) I have noticed the past two weeks that drinking so much coffee does mess with my anxiety a bit. I always drink it before work and sometimes a few cups at work and maybe half an energy drink. I also was drinking 2 beers a day almost everyday of the week. Now that I quit caffeine I notice that I am calmer although I do miss how hyper it made me and it brought my mood to good lvls. I also decided to quit drinking as much and only during social gatherings or something I might have one beer.\\n\\nSo I guess what I am going at here is that do you guys think it might be a good idea to spend a little more time at home learning more hobbies and bonding with myself better so being bedridden wont do this again? I am scared of becoming an agoraphobic so I always force myself out if I have anxiety attacks in which leads me to being scared of going home.\\nI am forcing myself to go home after work well after going to the gym so I can learn to not be bored at home. (in which I think being bored is another trigger and with drinking coffee making me hyper and not knowing what to do with myself)\\n\\nAlso I did get my meds changed from citalopram to the generic of zoloft because of the attacks last week. In which I have noticed that citalopram did make me soooo sleepy all the time and so far zoloft only makes me sleepy a little after I take it then I am fine. So theres a plus haha. \\n\\nSorry it was a random post, but I would love to hear some opinions though :) I am okay now although a little zoned out due to the new meds.\", \"I'm not sure if it has ever been worse than this. Maybe, since I've had anxiety for four years now and I do remember experiencing crises but things passed. Now I'm going through a crisis again.  \\nMaybe it's this depressing weather. Maybe it's low hemoglobin levels. Maybe it's vitamin deficiency. Maybe it's because my period is about to start. Maybe it's cancer. Maybe it's heart problems.  \\nI almost fainted in a bus last week (not sure if it was because of anxiety, it felt different, so maybe it was due to hunger or temperature) and now I'm terrified of buses, especially crowded ones. And fainting.   \\nSitting through lectures in university has been the hardest thing these days. I can't give you a solid reason why I'm so anxious during lectures. I can't control it, I'm afraid of everything. I guess most of it is health anxiety though.  \\nI started taking meds again two weeks ago. Not working yet, I suppose. I can't afford therapy, I'm a student, and I'd feel terribly guilty asking my parents money for therapy.  \\nI'm exhausted from biting my nails until they bleed, biting my lips, adjusting my hair 548 times per hour, feeling derealized, my heart pumping, the weird pressure in my head, feeling dizzy, tense legs, pins and needles, shaking; I'm exhausted from the constant fear. I don't want to go anywhere, I just want to barricade myself in my apartment and safely stare at the monitor.  \\nI'd like to cry right now to make things look more dramatic and just let out some emotion, but I can't. I'm just really tired.\\n\", \"I work for a school district, so I had the summer off. I'm not too excited about having to dealwwith a hundred new faces, and I'm starting at a new school this year. I recently switched to an extended release anti-anxiety medicine, so I'm really hoping to get through this day with no attacks, or at the very least, few tears. \\n\\nAny kind words or encouragement would sure help this day be a lot less stressful.\\n\\nOff to work, I go.\", \"So I've been on 75 mg of Zoloft for the past two weeks, and it seems to be helping so far. However, nearly every morning I notice the same thing- disorientation, slight shakiness, just feeling overall not put together. I take my medicine in the mornings and after about an hour I'm more stable. It's just weird.\\n\\nDoes this happen to any of you? Could it just be morning anxiety or possiblly medication related?\", \"Using a throwaway in the off-chance she comes to this subreddit. Also may be a bit vague due to this.\\n\\nMy girlfriend is in her mid 20s while I'm a couple years older. She moved in with me a couple of years ago. Before moving in with me I knew she had some anxiety problems, but once she moved in I noticed how much worse it really was. She understands that she has more anxiety than usual and I'll put some more details below so you can see it isn't passive every day anxiety that anybody faces. However, she is really afraid to seek professional help. She says her fear is of taking medicine that might make her want to kill herself, but I think it is also the anxiety of going to a doctor that prevents her from going.\\n\\nShe often worries about things that are incredibly unlikely to happen, and is constantly worrying about death (for any reason). Sometimes the reason can be understandable. For example, while driving, another driver may do a near hit and that can scare her, but there are other times which she'll just be afraid of any random thing crashing into our house or that she might suddenly get cancer. If the topic of death ever comes up, more often than not, she will have a panic attack later in the evening. I'll stay up as long as she does, keeping her company and consoling her as best I can.\\n\\nWhen we are at home, I always have to make sure she knows where I am or else I'll startle her. If she thinks I'm in the restroom and happens to see me in the living room, she'll scream.\\n\\nWhenever we do go out, she is often easily irritated at the presence of other people. She is always paying more attention to what other people are doing rather than what we're doing and either worrying about their actions or judging them. I feel like that may be what she does to herself, judging every action she makes.\\n\\nThere are even some days where she'll just be sad and moody all day, crying for no reason. It even gets to a point where she'll just sit on the couch and stare off into space with a blank stare, with tears running down her face. I try to talk to her and console her but she just won't react in any way, no talking or moving or acknowledging my presence. I stay with her though, even just sitting next to her because she usually later tells me that it helps a lot if I'm just there, even if she doesn't react.\\n\\nHowever, there are also days when she's in a great mood. She will be happy, excited, and without much worrying. She will be motivated to go do things or continue with some of her hobbies. It really makes me happy when she has her good days and I want to see her like that more often.\\n\\nTo me, all of these are signs of Anxiety and it affects her every day life so I want to help her. Have any of you had friends help you with getting help? What did they do? And how do you think I could help her?\\n\\nTL;DR How do I convince somebody to seek professional help when they really need it? Also are there any minor herbal things or meditation techniques she can try until I convince her to seek help? Afraid of medicine but not herbs.\", \"It's my second year of college. I've always had anxiety, but other than being a huge obstacle to socializing, it hasn't hindered me in many other ways.\\n\\nMy first year of school was great, and I was really excited to come back. But the combination of me having too much work and my realization that college has no meaning or value for me whatsoever (along with a number of other factors) ruined my mind. I was always anxious, sometimes because of something in particular and sometimes for no reason at all.\\n\\nI was talking with someone who is into herbal remedies, and I eventually ended up buying some holy basil capsules (Organic India). I'd tried St. John's Wort to no effect, so I figured I'd give this a shot, but I had very little faith that it would help.\\n\\nI was taking two of those capsules twice a day, and a few days after I started, I walked outside, saw that it was a beautiful day, and for the first time in a very long time, I felt absolutely overjoyed. I couldn't stop smiling.\\n\\nFor about the next month, my mood continued to be much higher (though I still had my moments, of course). It didn't really help me to do better in school, but when I messed up, I was able to brush it off and not get upset. I felt grateful to be alive, and nothing could stop me.\\n\\nThen I started feeling worse. The anxiety began to return, and as it continued I decided to myself that I should stop spending my money on those pills. I figured the effects were probably all in my head anyway. So I stopped.\\n\\nThings continued to worsen, but I was still functional. At some point last week, I had a lot to do and found myself unable to do any of it. I felt totally paralyzed, and all I could do was sit and cry. I told myself I'd go to therapy the next day (for the first time). In my desperation, I took two capsules. Within an hour, I felt incomparably better. I actually felt *good*. I still wanted to go to therapy the next day, but I felt unable to because I wasn't really upset. So I decided that this time I'd stay on it. It was obviously helping.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the past two or three days have been the worst, ever. I am a total wreck, really miserable, and I can't seem to do anything, which is just fantastic, seeing as the semester is ending and all the papers are due and exams are beginning. I have made up my mind that tomorrow I am going to go to counseling at my school. Sticking with the holy basil for now, too.\\n\\nMy advice to anyone considering it: give it a shot. I wasn't confident about it at all, but it has definitely helped me a lot. If it works for you, it will be well worth it.\\n\\nI'm not sure if the return (and subsequent worsening) of my anxiety is a result of becoming tolerant to the medicine. Maybe I'm doing better than I would be without it. I don't know. It does seem to me, though, that when I am in a really terrible state and I take some, I generally feel a lot better within a couple hours.\\n\\nI think maybe a better idea (at least in my case) would be to take a lower dose (half of what I am taking now) and take more when I'm not feeling okay. It's something that you'd probably have to experiment with to see what helps you.\\n\\nWhile my experience has been mixed, I've been able to spend a lot of time feeling really good that I probably otherwise would have spent very upset. So I definitely think people with anxiety should give it a shot!\", \"So I've always had anxiety problems, i had my first panic attack when i was 6.

All started when I was having odd pressure in my chest, thought it was heart problems. After a few more doctor visits, she told me it was anxiety. As it progressed things got weirder, weak feeling in my arm and shoulder blade, a feeling like someone is tickling the inside of my head, a feeling like my head is numb or someone is pulling my hair back when I touch my scalp, nausea that came for about a week at a time, and odd visual symptoms that made me blink a lot and made it hard to focus (that one is really hard to explain).\\n\\nWhat made the \"anxiety\" diagnosis harder and harder to believe is that I was never anxious and am not an anxious person.

I was peeing in bottles so I could judge the colour of my pee because people with diabetes inspidous have no colour to their urine (disgusting I know, but at the time it felt like a necessity to do this, to prove to myself I was fine).    \\n\\nLast year I was convinced I had Gastroparesis, a really fun ailment where your stomach stops moving, there\\'s no cure, and you wither away until you get a stomach tube in you so you can get nutrients. I was convinced I had this because after every time I ate I would reflux it up, I\\'d burp 4 hours after eating something and it\\'d taste like what I ate before, and I looked at stomach emptying times and I saw two hours, so I was convinced my stomach wasn\\'t working properly. I lost a ton of weight because I wasn\\'t eating well, and eventually I got over this somehow just by eating more and not puking, because a lot of people gastroparesis vomit, and i wasn\\'t vomiting. \\n\\nThis year\\'s it\\'s been Reactive Hypoglycaemia. I\\'m always looking for answers as to why I feel the way I do. My anxiety feels physiological, like something is setting it off, I feel like it\\'s not my thoughts, but my body, if that makes sense?  I noticed, or think I notice increased anxiety after eating a very sugary meal, I had one of the worst panic attacks ever after eating a bunch of cookies my roommate gave me. Doing research I came across Reactive Hypoglycaemia and I\\'ve been glued to my blood sugar monitor ever since. Spending so much money on the strips, anytime I\\'m low I freak out, if I\\'m too high i freak out, I try noticing trends but it\\'s hard. I do get really low sometimes, and i get this hungry but nausea feeling, I\\'m obsessed. Last night I found an article though that helped ground me a bit, because it described exactly what I was going through with Reactive Hypoglycaemia. Here\\'s the article...\\n\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fighting-fear/201405/conditions-linked-and-confused-panic-disorder\\n\\nAnyway this is just the tip of the iceberg for me when it comes to my health anxieties. Throughout all this I\\'ve been a major cardiophobe, I\\'ve been taking my blood pressure every day, multiple times a day since 2012. Now I take my blood sugar so many times a day that my fingers are sore typing this. I also check my temperature a ton, I\\'m pretty much a mess. \\n\\nBefore you mention it I\\'ve tried the medication route with horrendous results, Zoloft made me have extreme Akathasia, so much so I was almost committed, one of the worst experiences of my life. Lexapro caused documented heart skipping, prozac made me suicidal. Benzos help but make me depressed and give me rebound anxiety. I have some beta blockers for when my heart gets too fast but honestly I\\'m afraid to take them. The SSRI\\'s i\\'ve been on feel so similar to speed, my anxiety started when I was in highschool after doing too much ecstasy, and I\\'m just really med sensitive. \\n\\nI\\'m envious of you all that get on a drug and start getting your life back. Fuck I don\\'t know whether to feel happy for you, or hate you. Because I wish I could have that, but it\\'s not a option. I feel like some of you go on about how it\\'s the *only* option, but meds are a big no for me, and others like me. \\n\\nAnyway, this post kind of lost it\\'s point, I just needed to rant a bit.\\n\\n**TL;DR How do you convince yourself that there is nothing seriously wrong with you? How do you beat anxiety without meds? Is there hope for us? Will we ever feel better?**', \"When I was born I had a twin brother born with me! He's name is depression. He has followed me like my shadow on any sunny day and like a blood thirsty wolf on any given night.\\n\\nI take meds. Sometimes they help sometimes they don't. The struggle is always there. Any one with depression will know how difficult it will be to deal with himself when u r in a stressful situation. I survived a 8 year long PhD. Now I am in a job but I can feel that once again the depression is looming over me. I am doing a Post Doc (some might consider it a suicidal decision). I am worried that this is hampering my work flow and performance.\\n\\nI was wondering whether I should tell my boss about my situation or not! Any suggestion guys?\\n\", \"For some reason (no external factors or anything obvious) by anxiety has been really high the last few weeks. I have found myself thinking about dying. Not suicide but just thinking the world would be better off if I just wasn't in it anymore. Like if I got in a car wreck or something. I feel like a constant drain on my family (wife and 9 month old) friends and loved ones and coworkers. It's a very sad way to live life and I am hoping the meds and meditation will help snap me out of this a bit. \\n\\nHas anyone else experienced similar thoughts of passive death? Any words of encouraging that helped you would be extremely appreciated. \", \"Hey,\\n\\nAmong everything else I'm anxious about I also have a phobia of flying. I've been very scared of that for as long as I can remember.\\n\\nI lived abroad for two years and during that time I had to force myself to fly quite a bit to visit family etc., and things got a little better. I got over my fear of airports after a while and even flying got a bit easier. Not easy but easier. I no longer panicked, even though I was still very anxious, and didn't really experience the physical symptoms of a panic attack.\\n\\nHowever, a couple of years ago I had a bad flight and that completely ruined everything I had worked on (when it comes to the phobia) for the past three years or so. After that flight I was right back to square one. I think I might even be more scared now than before it got a little better. I've been avoiding all air travel since then.\\n\\nAnyway, I unfortunately *have* to fly in the beginning of September and around Christmas and only thinking about it is enough to trigger a panic attack sometimes. I feel like I can't and won't set foot in an airplane unless someone drugs me so today I got some medication. The doctor prescribed 1 x 10 mg of oxazepam (maximum 2 per day). I've never taken anything stronger than beta blockers and hydroxyzine before (both for other kinds of anxiety). Certainly not benzodiazepines. I've got some questions that I hope someone might be able to answer:\\n\\n- The doctor told me to try some medication at home to see what kind of side effects I can expect, so I'm thinking about trying one tomorrow. The thing is I'm not always super anxious when I'm at home so how will I know if it works or not?\\n\\n- How do I know if 10 mg is enough for me not to panic when it's time to fly? I'm really worried I'll get to the airport and board the plane and realise that the medication isn't working. Then I will, seriously, think I'm going to die and thinking that you're going to die isn't pleasant so I'd like to avoid that.\\n\\nThank you.\", \"**Just** **some** **general** **info:**\\n\\n21, Male\\n\\nGeneral anxiety, been taking medicine\\n\\nDon't have anything that triggers it\\n\\n**Symptom:**\\n\\nI'm transferring to a new university for several different reasons and I don't know but one or two people there.

Now I\\'ve been at my boyfriend\\'s parents house for 2 days. Yesterday, I had accidentally left my meds at home.  It had been years without them, and I had a crazy meltdown, which involved taking a nap, where I apparently yelled at my boyfriend.  I hate showering at other people\\'s houses, and this is frustrating him as well, because I don\\'t want to go shopping or anything.  I also have a special needs dog who really can\\'t be left alone without pissing all over their house. He had wanted to do something, but didn\\'t because he couldn\\'t get an answer of me.  I, of course, feel horrible.  \\nToday his mom asked if we wanted to go do something, like go for a walk or borrow their bikes. My boyfriend looked at me, and I shook my head \"no\".  His mom looked like she never would have expected that reaction in a million years.  I enjoy derping on the internet.  It\\'s what I do.  As a child, I was an indoor kid; I would pray for rain so I didn\\'t have to go outside for recess.  I like playing Sims and watching Law &amp; Order.  That\\'s how I enjoy a weekend.  But she keeps saying like \"Oh, well you won\\'t be depressed if you go out and do something\".  (My mom learned to stop asking long ago.) My boyfriend said very little.  He has still never told his parents about my anxiety and mood disorders.  So I\\'m hiding out in the spare bedroom with a book and my laptop.\\n\\nI would go to my mom\\'s but it\\'s far away and I have to work in the morning.  All of our food will be spoiled.  At this point (5:00pm on a Sunday), we likely won\\'t have time to buy food before tomorrow.  I have so much I want to do at home.   I feel like shit, because I know I\\'m disappointing everyone. I wouldn\\'t be that bothered, if I could just relax and do what I like to do. \\n\\nTL;DR  At someone else\\'s house, feeling trapped.  Just want to read and derp on internet.  Constantly being asked \"Why don\\'t you go...?\" ', \"Hi Reddit,\\n\\nSo yesterday after having a bit of a break down, I realized I might have to back on my meds. I've been feeling depressed for about a couple months although it wasn't a constant thing... when I left my house I was fine, but as soon as I'd come home, the soul crushing sadness would be there waiting for me. \\n\\nLast night I totally broke down because of a thousand different issues swarming me all at once. I never cry because I like to fight whatever I'm feeling, so losing control like that made me take a hard look at myself again.  I have anxiety/panic disorder and agoraphobia, which I have been medicated for and have overcome (which subsequently led to me stopping my medication. I've been off them for over a year now), but I think it's coming back.  \\n\\nI'm starting school in September, and it's almost like I've subconsciously forced myself to not think about it.. but now that it's approaching so quickly, I'm feeling depressed, I feel sick to my stomach whenever I think about starting, my heart starts to beat quickly, I feel helpless and frustrated which is something I end up taking out on my family by being a bitch... I don't know what to do and I don't have much time to properly deal with the issues.... right now the only thing I can think of is going back on my meds and hope that I can manage it when school starts. \\n\\nIt's like a vicious loop... thinking about school makes me anxious, and because I feel anxious i start to worry that my anxiety will be unmanageable and I'll fail school again which makes me even more anxious, rinse and repeat. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think? Should I go back to them? Should I try to tough it out? I can't fail again. I'm 22 with nothing to my name. I know I'm young but I'm so sick of feeling like a failure and working at a shitty part time job. \\n\\nI just hate everything right now :(\\n\\nEDIT: I should also point out that I haven't even bought my books yet and cant bring myself to because I guess I'm in denial about going back. No idea how to deal with this. It's like a crazy immature kid took over my brain.\\n\\nTLDR; going back to school is making me feel depressed and bringing back my anxiety, wondering if I should go back on meds. \", \"Title basically says it all. I was laid off from work a while ago and used up the last of my meds (prozac). I was even given a month extension but that's already come and gone. Towards the end I was trying to space them out by taking one every other day. I can now feel the anxiety coming back as well as the early onset of withdraw symptoms. Is there anything I can do? I simply can't afford to be seen by my doctor right now since I'm on unemployment and it's about $300 just to walk in the door. If I just call the doctor's office and explain my situation is there a chance they'll write me a new Rx? Any help would be appreciated.\", 'Hey all,\\n\\nI know that a lot of you guys are feeling like crap right now. I know that many of you are worried about the future, and may think that you might even not have a future due to anxiety and panic disorders.\\n\\nThe reason I am writing this is to tell you that your anxiety and panic disorders *can* be cured, and it doesn\\'t require medication, or endless doctor/ER visits. It only requires time and desire to rid yourself of this disorder.\\n\\nSecondly (and sorry if this gets a bit long), I am writing this because this disorder has captivated my life for the past 8 years. I was always prone to anxiety and depersonalization, and it became full blown after I decided to take up weed/extacy. It came to the point where I became extremely agoraphobic, and my life came to a full stop.\\n\\nThere weren\\'t many groups like this 8+ years ago, and for the longest time I thought I suffered alone, and had a serious mental condition (brain tumor, insanity, bipolar, [insert random weekly disease scare]) It was absolutely chaotic. My mind constantly raced at negative thoughts, and my heart was permanently beating at 100 bpm.\\nI hit rock bottom when I would get full blown panic attack for doing anything as simple as getting the mail from the front door.\\n\\nI was exhausted both mentally, physically, emotionally, it was a disaster.\\n\\nI atleast found out what the name of my condition was, and researched the crap out of it to try and find a means for an answer, try and find a \"cure\".\\n\\nThere was no magical cure. We all know that this isn\\'t Strep Throat, you can\\'t take 5 antibiotics and feel better.\\n\\nAt around this time, something was around the corner that I had completely forgotten about. My family trip to Costa Rica. \\n\\nNow, if you can, imagine yourself suffering from something so atrocious like Agoraphobia, you\\'re 19, you\\'re \"supposed\" to be in peak physical and mental condition, but you feel like a 70 year old with a botched up hip replacement (no offense to anyone) and slowly feel that you\\'re caving in. Needless to say, I pleaded to stay and not go on this trip (keep in mind I kept all of this away from family and friends for over a year). After startling the crap out of my mom and seeing her in tears on the morning we had to catch our flight, I sucked it up and stepped out.\\n\\nLet me just cut this a bit short, and simply say that the trip was no pleasant. In the time it took to get tot he airport, get on the plane, fly, get out of the airport, get to hotel, I must of had at least 50 full blown panic attacks.\\n\\nThis wasn\\'t a leisurely \"relax by the pool for a week\" vacation either, this was a tour of CR (which, by the way if absolutely beautiful) We were constantly traveling, walking, moving, site-seeing, etc.\\n\\nAnd it started to occur to me, very slowly but very surely, that the panic, anxiety, stress, that I\\'ve been having all of that time, didn\\'t actually do anything to me. It felt extremely uncomfortable, it constantly put me in a state of absolute horror and fight or flight, but in between these attacks, and whenever I had my mind off of anxiety (as rare as it felt), I realized that It never actually brought me any harm.\\n\\nBy the end of my trip, when we had a few days left at the hotel, I felt so much better. My fear had gone down substantially, I was out and about doing regular stuff like a normal person.\\n\\nUpon coming back home (the trip back was *a lot* smoother) and for the next few weeks afterwards, I was able to go out and about with minimal issues.\\n\\nDuring that type, I would of nipped the whole problem at the bud, had I actually went through with ridding myself of this issue, but instead (I had a lot of down time during that time, just out or college, etc.) I decided to go back into the lifestyle of gaming and being lazy, and my disorder slowly, but surely, crept back.\\n\\nI didn\\'t want to deal with what had happened, and decided to take medication (zoloft, started at 25mg) and it seemed to take the edge off, but it never truly helped me. My doctor bumped it up to 50mg, but again, it only took the edge off and allowed me to do certain things, at certain times, without full blown panic attacks. I then began to restrict my life as a means to coping with the disorder, instead of dealing with it head on.\\n\\nOnly until about a year ago did I actually (and *finally*) deal with the issue head on. It was a tough ass battle, and the war is still quietly raging, but I am winning it, and I know because I haven\\'t had a full blown panic attack in months.\\n\\nI was able to do this because I realized one very important fact: **The anxiety and panic that you suffer is self-induced.**\\n\\nI know this sounds obvious, but for all of you who are reading this and are sufferers - I want you to truly dwell on this idea for a minute; maybe 10 if you have to.\\n\\nThe simple fact of the matter is, regardless of where you are, or who you are with, what you are doing, the triggers of your anxiety and eventual panic are all perpetuated by you. *if you take your mind off of anxiety for even a minute, it will evaporate*. I\\'m sure you have all noticed this, but just don\\'t know how to control it.\\n\\nYou don\\'t control it. You laugh at it. You welcome it until it becomes weak, you realize this, your subconscious mind realizes this, and it becomes that much less significant.\\n\\nI don\\'t want anyone to think I\\'m writing this to make a pitch or anything, but I found out about the fundamental ideas of this through something called the Linden Method. I strongly suggest any sufferer to check it out.\\n\\nAs it stands now, I cannot say that my panic/anxiety have completely went away. I do try to make progress on it every day, but I can safely say that the few anxiety triggers that I still have are purely the act of the subconscious mind, and it will be dealt with.\\n\\nI would be more than happy to answer any questions if anyone has any, and I truly hope that I have helped in me posting this. I have only recently seen this /r/ subreddit, and wish I would of found it sooner.\\n\\nThank you very much for reading this extremely long post!\\n\\n', 'I have some things to \"rant\" about but I\\'ll put the question parts up here. My school offers counseling services and lists \"anxiety\" as one of the reasons we should see them. I\\'m going to try to set up an appointment to start seeing a counselor the earliest I can, which is Monday. Does anyone have any experience with college counseling like this for their anxiety? Will it be just a \"I talk to them the whole session every time\" thing or will they be actively working with me on solutions for lessening my anxiety?

I\\'m just stuck in this house and feeling miserable. \\n\\nThey don\\'t really know what\\'s going on. They think the reason why I puke sometimes is because of the fucking drugs, or the reason why I can\\'t eat anything in the morning is because of the drugs, or the reason why I\\'m smoking weed is because of them so I can just fucking relax for half an hour. \\n\\nNow I just don\\'t know how to deal with this. I started taking venlafaxine on a low dose about 3 months ago, stopped taking it twice for a few weeks because I thought that there is nothing wrong with me and I\\'m just taking these because I was told by my doctor but 2 weeks ago after not taking venlafaxine for 3 weeks, My symptoms got worse but it\\'s been a few days that I haven\\'t woken up from stomachache at 3 in the morning but that has moved to 8 which is a nice change... \\n\\nI\\'m just tired. I\\'m devastated. I keep having this fake fucking smile on my face whenever I\\'m with my family but deep down I\\'m a wreck. There is just so many things going on with my life that I don\\'t know how to deal with them all AT THE SAME FUCKING TIME. I just don\\'t know what to do and how to go on with my life. \\n\\nI hope I can get some feedback from you folks but this felt really good writing out my life story sort of. \\n\\nI also hope that y\\'all have a great day, week and just a great life ahead of you.

I am taking generals at a community college and have possibly fucked up my opportunity to be able to get a carrier in the field I want or be able to pay for it and I am so panicked and freaked and don't know what to do. \\n\\nNow for the story:\\nI guess I'm not really sure where to start. I don't have many people to talk to about this so I've resorted to strangers on the Internet haha. But this seems like a supportive community I could possibly get some reassurance from. I guess I'll start sort of from where I started getting all this anxiety and nervousness from.\\n I'm an (almost) 21 year old female. in highschool I got fairly good grades, graduated with a GPA of like 3.8 out of a 4.0 GPA. I applied to the big university for my state and was accepted into the honors program but saddle I couldn't afford it and I couldn't get big enough loans and I just couldn't seem to get any scholarships. So I was crushed but decided to go to the tech and just do my generals while staying with my parents. From there I've just gotten so anxious all the time. I've developed rashes on my arms from it that come and go and I've also developed a little bit of an anger problem. I've gained weight, and have just been so worried all the time. Tried therapy but I'm so shy it didn't help a ton. Tried some meds but the doc gave me this really weak shit that didn't help much. I relax with artwork and photography and pets. I have a 5 gallon fish tank, a rabbit, a preying mantis, a betta and a cat. I love just watching them, it's really relaxing, but it still doesn't help when I'm working or at school.\\nAnyways I'll be done with my generals this semester and I'm freaking out so badly. I've applied for some more scholarships and another college in town that can help save some more money but give me a few more prephysical therapy classes. Problem is all I can think about is what if I don't get into this college? My grades have been iffy over the last couple years. Working, helping with my brother, classes full time and my sorta second job from my artwork has out a huge toll on me and in now average about a 3.4 GPA. I even have a Withdrawal on my record because I got bronchitis at one point. What if I don't get into this college? What if I don't get this scholarship? I don't have any option but to work full time at my retail job that I hate so much and I worry I won't get the chance to get the carrier I wanted. I feel like I'm stuck in the middle with everything. My grades aren't amazing so I won't be able to get into a physical therapy school and my art isn't amazing so I couldn't change to art school. I have no idea what to do. I'm trying to get into volunteering but I don't exactly have a ton of time and I'm worried if I add to my list of stuff to do ill just have a full blown panic attack and break down.\\nBy boyfriend doesn't understand as he's never actually gone to college. My parents both went to college but they're majors weren't near as hard and they didn't have to pay near as much as they didn't go to the big huge universities with the programs That cost a fuck ton and are competitive like mine. I feel like a fucking winer when I complain about this to my couple of friends cause they're all just working instead of going to college but they did try and it just wasn't for them I guess. I just feel like I'm stuck. I feel like a winy loser about this. I know I'm lucky to be able to even go to the college I did, and have a family to stay with and a part time job when a lot of people don't even have half of those things. I feel like I wasted my opportunity and now I just am so panicked and anxious. :( thanks for reading all this if you did. I appreciate it, just needed to vent. I'm typing this after work and am super tired so I apologize for any errors. \", \"After a year of doc visits and multiple medications,  I'm turning to the collective wisdom of reddit, if for no other reason than to find some common ground.  Around this time last year, I started developing consistent headaches around my sinus area, gradually increasing tinnitus, and general restless, which I probably brought onto myself from worrying.  A month or two in, the doc ordered an MRI of the brain and sinuses which came back showing a golf ball sized arachnoid cyst (not_a_tumor.jpg), but it appeared to have been there since the beginning of (my) time.  The neurosurgeon was unconcerned; said there was no pressure and it wasn't the cause of the headaches.  ENT said sinuses were clear and everything looked great.   Between the time of having the MRI ordered, having several days in limbo between knowing there was some things to be looked at with brain doctors, and eventually getting the all clear, I seemed to have psyched myself into an issue which I can only describe as anxiety.  I'm not sure if this is correct.  It's not generally an attack of sorts where I'm afraid I'll die, or my heart will explode, but rather a string of 4-6 days of feeling general tweaky hell.\\n\\n   Fast forward to today.  My life is generally low-stress.  I work a 9-5 in a great company.  Expectations are not unusually high, and I have a great family.  However, I continue to feel as if I've downed a case of red-bulls on a daily basis.  I've sloppily self-diagnosed myself with some sort of anxiety disorder, and the doctors that I've seen tend to go along with this.  My symptoms which have been going on for the last year, in varying levels of intensity are twitchy eyelids, lots of goop in my eyes, stiff neck, strong tinnitus, mild nausea, and most of all, a general but strong feeling of uneasiness/racing thoughts/and irritability.  Like I've seriously half drowned myself in rockstar/redbull/coffee/whatever. \\n\\nSo far, my medications and effects have been:\\n\\nCitalopram - Intensified the yucky mental feeling (anxiety?) many times over, to the point where I didn't want to do anything, although doing nothing was probably the worst way to deal with it.\\n\\nVenlafaxine - Similar to the effects of citalopram, but with lesser intensity. \\n\\nWellbutrin - Seemed to level things out, but would still make me feel worse for a few hours after taking the medication. \\n\\nXanax - Mostly works.  I'm taking this in small doses (.5mg) once every few days.  Since it is habit forming and makes me drowsy, I'd rather not take it, but it does help to knock the edge off.\\n\\nThe first 3 medications I gave up after 1-6 weeks, depending on how shitty they made me feel.  I understand that most antidepressants take longer to work, but the side effects were just too much.  \\n\\n\\nI'd like to know if anyone has a related experience and what may have helped along the way.  Obviously I could (and probably will) switch doctors several times until something clicks, but getting appointments takes an amazingly long time.  I feel bad for those who are worse off than me, and have to wait months for an opening.\\n\\ntl;dr:  I feel like shit 75% of the time and don't know why.\", \"Okay first of all I hear 10,000 different horrible things about it and that there are better drugs out there. Can someone tell me their experiences and perhaps some drugs they've taken they liked? Second I'm on two medications already (Zonisamide for seizures, Concerta for ADHD) and this just sounds like it will counteract or cause some problems. My doctor says it's fine but it still makes me nervous. Especially the concerta mixed in  part.\", \"I'll try to keep the background short. I'm 20/F.

Turns out she had a huge brain tumour (a meningioma). It wasn't cancerous and it was removed, but she was in hospital for four months after getting an infection after the surgery. \\n\\nI'm 20 now, and still live at home. A little over six months ago, I woke up to the sound of plates crashing. When I got up, my mother was having a seizure on the kitchen floor. I called an ambulance and she went to hospital. We don't know what caused it, but she was put on medication and discharged and hasn't had a seizure since.\\n\\nEver since then, my anxiety has been really bad. If I hear any odd noise during the night, I wake up (I sleep pretty lightly since that night) and have to go check on her. I usually wake her up once a night to make sure she's okay. I always have to call to check in if I go out and if she doesn't answer her phone I get really worried. \\n\\nI almost feel like I have a very mild case of PTSD. Ever since that night, I'm just a nervous wreck. I'm so worried she'll have another seizure, and I know seizures aren't generally dangerous on their own but something bad could happen and I might not be here to help. \", \"I take amitriptylene 50mg for headache and general anxiety but my therapist wants me to try an SNRI.

I\\'d told her very clearly that I was dealing with overwhelming anxiety over all these estate issues to the point where I was having to get medical treatment for it, but after dinner, despite what I\\'d told her, she started talking about estate matters with the phrase she always uses for this, \"Well, we need to . . . \" In a few seconds, I could feel my heart start to pound. She won\\'t leave me in peace about this stuff for one goddamn day even when I\\'ve told her that I need a break. \\n\\nThanks for reading and for any sympathy you can provide. I remember thinking the day before my brother died how it seemed like life was actually pretty good. Business was getting better, and things were going well. Then it all got turned upside-down. ', 'I have been seeing a psychiatrist for a little over six months now, and she\\'s been fantastic - as far as helping me to find the right medication to alleviate my anxiety and depression.  Much to my surprise it has been working, ever so slowly.  Lexapro has made my life so much easier...and normal...which is exactly what I was seeking by turning to a professional.\\n\\nHowever, the reduced anxiety has introduced a new problem - I feel much more at liberty to express myself.  Doesn\\'t sound like a problem, right?  Here\\'s where it gets tricky:\\n\\nA former employer terminated my contract without notifying me.  This happened in July.  They didn\\'t even bother saying \"goodbye\" but more importantly they gave me no opportunity to retrieve my belongings.  Now they refuse to return them, not explicitly, but by ignoring requests made by myself and my recruiting agency.\\n\\nThe anger and anxiety over this just keeps building and building.  Mind you, I never received any kind of performance feedback from these people and performance was not the reason they cited to the recruiting agency for my termination.  They said, essentially, financing for my position magically disappeared.  One would wonder why they would even advertise this position and hire someone for it if they didn\\'t have the resources to fund it.  But that\\'s apparently how they operate.\\n\\nI want the items back.  One of them doesn\\'t belong to me and I can\\'t return it to its original owner.  It\\'s not the value of the item, I could easily compensate the owner for that.  It\\'s the data contained on the item (it\\'s a USB flash drive).\\n\\nMy psychiatric sessions focus solely on the efficacy of the medication.  It is not \"talk\" therapy so I cannot ask the psychiatrist for advice on how I should handle this.  \\n\\nThe people at this company lied to my face.  They smiled, acted as if everything was fine, and plunged a knife in my back.  It\\'s the scummiest thing that I\\'ve ever witnessed.  What makes it even harder is I\\'ve never had an employment experience like this.  ALL of my former employers before this provided glowing references, and one of them even pleaded with me not to leave - but I had to go for professional reasons.  My current employer just recently brought me into the office to tell me how much they appreciate the work I\\'m doing and the contributions I\\'ve made.\\n\\nIt\\'s just this one horrible experience with the company I now refer to as Mos Eisley.  I was raised to believe that one MUST take accountability for wrongdoing, that you don\\'t get a free pass to trample on others.  But I\\'m powerless here.  It just lingers, like a bad odor.  I can\\'t get an answer from these people, no explanations, not even a \"fuck off and stop emailing us\".  \\n\\nHow do I let go?  How do I explain to my friend that I can\\'t get his USB drive back?  How do these people rationalize treating someone this way?  These questions haunt me, constantly.', \"I've been to my doctors today as I've had a number of bouts of intense anxiety (or what I think is anxiety!) over the last few days, spurred on by situations which would barely affect the average person. They've been so bad that I've been bursting into tears and contemplating suicide.\\n\\nI've been on a number or medications such as citalopram, fluoxetine and pregabalin but nothing has worked. Due to how worse it has been, plus the fact I've got a situation coming up which I think is going to trigger the same effect in me, I went back to my GP who prescribed 14 2mg diazepam tablets to help me.\\n\\nI'm really hoping these have a positive effect on me and I'm feeling confident, however I'm concerned that doctors are very reluctant to prescribe benzos long term because of addiction, so I'm worried that I'll find something that helps me in these situations and I won't be able to get them again.\\n\\nI don't plan on taking them everyday, only a max of once per week when things too much. If I take them like this, rather than everyday, is the chance of addiction/reliance reduced?\", \"I went on and off Zoloft to treat generalized anxiety a couple times in college. About a year after graduation, I felt like I needed to go on it again, so I went to my new doctor in my new city and she wrote me a Rx for 50mg. Six weeks later, I went back to her and said I was having very strange symptoms/side effects this time: racing thoughts, terrible insomnia, hyperactivity, etc., all things that I'd read online might be associated with bipolar. She completely dismissed me, said those weren't real side effects of Zoloft, and then upped my dose to 100mg. Then last Friday--one week after she increased my dose--I had such a severe panic attack that I had to leave work and go to the emergency room, which has never happened to me before.\\n\\nNow I'm in a really tough spot because I don't trust that doctor anymore, but I can't seem to find anyone else who can help me. I've called a dozen psychiatrists, and none will return my calls. I have an appointment with a psychologist next week, but I know she can't help me with medication management. I tried switching to a different GP at the clinic I go to, but they can't get me in for two weeks. I feel like I need to see a doctor *now,* as in within the next few hours, or a day at the most. When I was in the ER on Friday, they gave me a small amount of Ativan, and I've already blown through almost a third of it because my symptoms seem to be getting worse and I feel like I'm constantly on the brink of another panic attack. I need to have my medication adjusted *right now,* but it seems like no one can help me. I'm really worried about what will happen if I run out of Ativan during the holiday weekend when I'm hosting my entire family for Thanksgiving.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any advice, or is anyone able to even commiserate?

I've posted [before](http://redd.it/jbygl). Recently I started working out and dropped two pant sizes. With this new look and lifestyle I began to realize how good I was feeling without taking my daily anti-anxiety medication. But I've had some personal troubles recently that required me to take 2-3 pills a day. So now that time has passed I'm wondering if I should/could stop taking any medication all together. The pharmacy called me today to notify me of a refill that is waiting for me, but I'm apprehensive about going and picking it up. Should I take them even though I'm doing OK without them. I sort of feel like I'm doubting myself. Like I don't have the confidence in myself to deal with problems as they come. I don't know what it feels like to have the ability to trust in myself and not rely on a pill to help me cope with life. I'm nervous that I'm not nervous enough. That sounds crazy I know.....\", \"I'm getting some nasty ingrown toenails checked out on Friday and I'm pretty sure it's going to end with me getting anaesthetic injections in my toes and a doctor rooting around in my toenails and pulling pieces of them out.

I really don't want to chicken out of this appointment because it's intensely painful as it is and I know I need it done. Is there anything I can do to ease the anxiety during the appointment if I don't have access to medication? Distraction techniques? Anything? \", \"Hi all.  About three years ago, I experienced (what I perceived to be) a life threatening situation, which caused me to have my first panic attack.  I have them maybe 5 times a year, and usually it's when I'm feeling very sick/exhausted/stressed, or when I'm stressed about a situation.  \\n\\nWhen I begin to get anxious, I want to slow my breathing but it seems that when I try to concentrate on slowing and controlling my breathing, it sends me into full blown panic attack mode.  My attacks consist of rocking, severe hyperventilating, and my hands clench up, and my fingers go completely numb.  So far, the only thing that has helped is if someone rubs my back.  \\n\\nWhat are other coping mechanisms you've found that work?  Controlling breathing doesn't help me, and I don't want to always rely on someone to be there to rub my back to bring me out of it.  I need to learn to start controlling them because my attacks are situational, and meds aren't really necessary at this point.\\n\\nThank you!\", \"Over the last few months, my doctor and I have been experimenting with different anxiety medications with little success.  Most recently, he's prescribed me Buspirone HCL 15mg.  I'm getting tired of switching medications every 4-5 weeks, so I'm wondering first of all if anyone here has had success with this medication.

I suffer from anxiety and depression and haven't seen my psychologist for around 6 months. At the start of the year I started an education support course and it's been going well. I do have trouble focusing and remaining calm in the classroom, and today I was supposed to do placement at a local school near me. I've been doing placement once a week since the start of the year and have had days where I just couldn't bring myself to turn up.

There was a lot of yelling and hitting. I felt unsafe at school and at home. On the weekends when they were not drinking I felt ok. Not happy, I can’t remember a time when I was actually happy. There was always some kind of a problem, either medical or financial. They had enough money to provide essentials to me and my brothers. They just preferred to spend it on alcohol.\\n\\nI have a couple of medical problems. Not sure if they were caused by my anxiety and depression or if it was the other way around. I have severe psoriasis on my scalp and in other areas on my body. My gums bleed despite flossing, brushing, rinsing and regular visits to the dentist. As of a week I have lost partial hearing in my left ear. I am pretty sure it is connected to my psoriasis but I have yet to consult a specialist.\\n\\nI used to enjoy things. I have been very passionate about video games, books, music, TV shows and movies. I thoroughly enjoyed any kind of fiction. I used to come up with the ideas for books, TV shows and movies. Now I enjoy nothing. I have sold almost all of my possessions to have some sort of emergency fund. I have no debts, but since my health is not too well I consider it necessary. I also did it because I did not enjoy them anymore. I have sold all my gadgets. The only things of any value I own are a laptop and a phone.\\n\\nI have not left the house in almost two years since I have graduated college. Except for the occasional trip to another city to visit my brother. I do not go out since I have no friends. I used to have one female friend. We used to hold hands together and generally talk about everything. But we had some differences and now we do not even talk anymore. I feel kind of indifferent towards females. My sex drive is at all times low. I rarely masturbate. Not because I feel the need to. Simply because I have read somewhere that regular ejaculation prevents prostate cancer. I work out a lot. But there are no gains in muscle mass or confidence. I do it because I feel like I need to, but deep down I feel like it is pointless. Like everything else.\\n\\nI have not been able to get a full time job for the same amount of time. I had literally two job interviews since I left school. On both occasions I have heard the same thing: That I give of the vibe of someone extremely introverted and shy and that I might not be a good fit for their team. I have been deluding myself that I have some minor translation work going for me but I have not done anything with it for a long time. I might be able to start soon if I get accepted into another company but I will not be making much. I get intense panic attacks in situations which will affect my future. These include job interviews and meetings with new people and old colleagues. I do not think I am a hypochondriac. It prevents me from having the life I want. I cannot afford therapy or medication. Not until I get that good job. It is so bad that I am considering drinking before my next big interview.\\n\\nI do not know what to do next. They tell me to live but I do not see the point to. Every situation, friendship, relationship feels temporary. Nothing lasts forever. I am terrified of growing old. I am scared of what other medical problems another ten years will bring.

Since last Saturday\\'s panic attack I\\'ve had fairly severe anxiety and restlessness (not tremors, per se, but I can\\'t stop moving for long) throughout the day coupled with a strong headache that is only marginally improved with Aleve or Advil. The morning of Saturday I felt perfectly fine before the cup of coffee that triggered the damn thing. Ever since then, it almost feels like I\\'m going through some kind of withdrawal. Am I missing something?\\nAge: 26 Male\\nPrevious History/Substances taken: \\n\\n* Alcohol binge+withdrawal: Summer 2012, July 2014, totally abstinent since.\\n\\n* Melatonin 10mg - 5x a week for about 2-3 months until Wednesday the 18th.\\n\\n* Aleve daily from 18th - 24th.\\n\\n* L-theanine 400-600 mg daily from 18th - 24th.\\n\\n* Smoked marijuana - 14th, 18th\\n\\nContext\\n\\n* First panic attack about 4-6 weeks ago, at work. Worked moving material around a manufacturing shop, which kept me on my feet for most of the night. Attributed it to energy drinks as I was working graveyard at the time. Went back in the next day, and anxiety dissipated within a couple of days.\\n\\n* 14th (Saturday): Smoked marijuana (live in Washington). It was the end of Valentine\\'s day, and my fiancée had wine but I am abstinent from alcohol having withdrawn from it twice before, once in 2012 and most recently in July. Hadn\\'t touched marijuana in at least three years, but felt no immediate ill effects from it.\\n\\n* 18th (Wednesday): Quit my graveyard job as I was never well rested and just couldn\\'t deal with the schedule. Smoked again that afternoon just as a \"fuck it all\" thing. Had been taking 10 mg melatonin on weekdays for about 3 months. Coupled it with Nyquil pills (not liquid to avoid the alcohol) for about 3 weeks before quitting.\\n\\n* 18th-21st: Tried to readjust my sleep schedule back to normal hours. Stopped taking all melatonin and Nyquil at this time. Felt general tiredness and fogginess, bit of a headache, and malaise but no anxiety. \\n\\n* 21st: Slept from 9pm to about 5am, felt great. Had a cup of coffee (hadn\\'t had regular coffee in a while, but I\\'d consumed caffeine in the form of sodas for a while before this), which within an hour triggered a terrible anxiety attack. Called the paramedics, but of course started feeling better after I knew they were coming so I called them off. Did jumping jacks and other physical activity to \"burn off\" the anxiety. Went to Vitamin Shoppe to pick up some L-Theanine chewables. Took 200mg that day. No real anxiety to speak of the rest of that day. \\n\\n* 22nd Sunday: Noticeably higher anxiety levels upon waking. Extremely anxious to the point of pacing around the living room. Took 500-600mg L-Theanine throughout the day, but didn\\'t seem to do much. Not quite anxious to the point of panic attack but restless to the point where I couldn\\'t sit still for more than a minute or two. Managed to do a grocery run together without problem. Fiancee and I made arrangements to drive up to Vancouver for a couple of days. Thought it would be good for me to get away for a bit. Ran 2 miles. \\n\\n* 23rd Monday: Fairly high anxiety levels driving up, I couldn\\'t manage to drive more than 40-45 minutes. Bad anxiety set in after checking in to the hotel. Dealt with it for about 1.5 hours before we went out on a walk. The walk helped, kept busy until the end of the day without major issues. \\n\\n* 24 Tuesday: Woke up again with bad anxiety. Went around town for a while until about 2pm, when I felt my headache increase and fatigue. Went back to the hotel to rest, but I couldn\\'t rest. Got anxiety to the point where I asked my fiancee if we could go home, a day early. Anxiety dissipated after an hour on the road, but flared up again to a panic attack for the final 45 minutes before getting home. Decided it might be best to totally abstain from all medicine and supplements to see if I just need a reboot of some kind.\\n\\n* 25 Wednesday: Woke up feeling marginally better than previous mornings. Still high anxiety and restlessness. Went on a quick two mile run before fiancee woke up. Felt okayish throughout the morning. Broke down crying for an hour after fiancee left for work. Went on another run, this one three miles which somewhat helped. Tried my best to keep my mind occupied to little avail, but still managed to stave off a full blown panic attack.\\n\\n* 26 Thursday: Again felt marginally better waking up in the morning. Didn\\'t quite feel the same need to pace around like a madman. Went on a long, 5 mile walk with my fiancee which felt good in the moment, but that feeling didn\\'t last long after returning home. Still, felt better than the previous afternoon. Managed to get out and go to Walmart and a couple other stores on my own after fiancee went to work. Anxiety wasn\\'t great though, and decided to stop in at an urgent care clinic on the way home. I explained the events of the last several days, but didn\\'t have the wherewithal to provide the broader context. Was prescribed 0.5 mg Xanax to take as needed, but I am wary about getting it filled as I know I\\'d likely get dependent very quickly.\\n\\n* 27 Friday: Once again, marginally better morning, minus the headache. Decide to take ibuprofen for it, which helps somewhat. Started taking multivitamins again. Still general restlessness and skittishness. Ran 5 miles in the afternoon, went out to run an errand. After laying down however, a got a surge of anxiety which led to a panic attack. Called paramedics, they did an EKG which of course was totally fine. All my vitals were pretty amazing, they said. So off they went. My nerves were frayed through the end of the night.\\n\\n* 28 Saturday: Nerves back up again in the morning, of course. Decided to write you fine folk.\\n\\nAny insight, help, or even just encouragement would be great. ', \"Long story; somewhat shortened, within the past year is when everything began to escalate.

My marriage has been on the rocks for the past year, at first I was highly depressed, I was prescribed lexapro for a few months until I stopped feeling any results from it, then changed to welbuturin and after 3 days on that was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts (not my proudest moment). This was about 4 months ago and since I got out of the hospital I had been off medicine and kind of strolling along, trying to keep my head up and keep on keepin on. Right now my wife and I are still living together, sleeping in the same bed even, kind of acting like everything is okay for the kids (which are now ages 5, 3, and 1) until we actually split up.

College actually relieved my anxiety, which surprised me. \\n\\nI developed a drinking problem after my boyfriend lied and left me for slutsherface and didn\\'t see a way out, and I had refused medication all my life saying there was \"another way\" but needed a helping hand other than my therapist and took the pill route. I started to take it after taking care of my drinking problem, didn\\'t want to have that affecting celexa, but the anxiety persisted (especially at home).\\n\\nI decided I felt like a zombie. Like my body and my mind were separated and that I was in auto-pilot. I had no sex drive, before and during the meds after starting birth control in 2008. I got off birth control summer 2011 to see if my sex drive would come back to me. Nope.\\n\\n I felt like part of my brain, the auto pilot was living life for me. I would write things and forget I wrote them, look down at the screen a few moments later and say \"when did I write that?\" Or be surprised when I had \"lucid\" moments where I feel \"alive\" or so to speak. Present is probably the better term. \\n\\nMy emotional response to things is to turn off the emotion or so it seems. I used to be very in tune with my emotions, but now I go numb and just go into screen saver like an idle computer.\\n\\nDrinking 3 beers put me in such a sleepy state that I have to be careful when I go out and can\\'t for very long if I plan to drink. \\n\\nI couldn\\'t deal with being a shell anymore, and I got off celexa by tapering with advice from online (stupid I know but I was studying abroad and didn\\'t want to pay 100 bucks to see a doctor to tell me how to do it). October 2011. \\n\\n\\nI still feel the way I did on celexa. \\n\\nAlthough my anxiety has improved and I am a lot healthier and more content with my life. I still feel zombie-like. \\n\\nEmpty shell in auto pilot that feels separated mentally and physically with no sex drive, that sleeps a lot and can sit thinking about nothing for a half hour without realizing it. \\n\\nI drink less than a liter of beer in 2 hours and I feel like I\\'m going to collapse from exhaustion. I just turned 21 and have been drinking since I was 17. My boyfriend says it could be \"my age\" that causes this, but I never had a problem with getting tired after 3 beers before in my life until Celexa.\\n\\nPeople have noticed a positive difference, I try to act like it\\'s all normal and I\\'m healthy again, but I feel horrible. My brain just feels different than before and I hate this. I hate this.\\n\\n\\nAnyone ever dealt with this before? Advice?', \"I've had panic attacks my whole life and was treated with medication from 6th grade through early college. Now I'm almost finished with my B.A. and am having a resurgent of anxiety. I'm graduating this semester and have to get a job after, need to find an internship for this semester or summer break, am getting married in November, and am dealing with some money problems. I know, most people would have no problems dealing with my first world problems, but I've just spent this whole morning in tears even though I only have one class today.\\n\\n\\n\\nI turned down a brilliant opportunity over winter break because of my anxiety and I'm terrified that if I don't get help now, I'll be a complete waste of space. I won't be able to have kids like my fiance wants to, I won't be able to find a job that I can keep to keep us in our apartment, I'll just be a quivering blob that will shake at the smallest imposition. I feel like people feel like I'm just lazy, like I'm scared of doing a day's work and would rather play video games and sit around than go to a job. I WANT to be able to live a normal life, but I don't know what to do. \\n\\n\\n\\nShould I go back on the medication? Do I need a therapist? Or a counselor?

Or even watching a comedy or looking at funny pictures on the Internet? I used to laugh all the time when I was younger at the slightest thing now I feel it's really forced? \\n\\nMaybe once a week I get a good laugh and that's it. I thought it would of came back as the meds kicked in but still nothing. Maybe I have just lost my sense of humour or my mind is just constantly occupied? Who's knows, well can anybody else relate? \", 'this might be a dumb question, but is there a definitive moment when i can truly know the meds are working ? ive been on them for a week, my psychiatrist said that they (especially zoloft) wont really kick in for about 3 to 6 weeks. now, i know that if they are working i will feel less anxious and depressed but, will this be very gradual or sudden ? ive never taken meds before so im not sure what to expect', \"I KNOW they suck and I KNOW how bad they feel to go through but fuck that we are all gonna get through this together without meds or doctor bullshit.\\n\\nLet's hear your natural anti anxiety protips GOGOGO\", \"I'm currently on Lexapro (Cipralex in Canada) and I'm worreid about the sexual side effects of this medication.

I keep reading about people having problems orgasming and reduced sex drives and it really worries me a lot.  Has anyone not experiecned these while on an SSRI?  I'm on my first week of taking medication and i'm already starting to notice these effects.  I'm hoping it will go away as my body adjusts.  Also once I get back into my workout routine, I'm hoping that will help as well.  \", 'Hey, long time lurker, first time post, etc, etc. This is really long and mostly ridiculous ranting, so I\\'m sorry in advance. Backstory: I\\'ve had anxiety attacks as long as i can remember. Last year I decided that I didn\\'t want to rely on medication for this anymore and prompted instead for finding other ways. I talk to a counsellor now, practice stress relieving techniques, but most effectively I bought a cat. His soft fur and warm affection help me calm down more than anything. It\\'s been a rough year and I couldn\\'t have gotten through it without him. I broke up with my long time SO of 4 years in August ( who in retrospect was really abusive), had to move out of our place and back in with my parents, got fired and found a new job, and since that job is a photography studio I\\'ve been under a lot of strain from the Christmas season. Since August I\\'ve been ok, transitioning and taking each step at a time. I even found a new SO who treats me so well that it blows my mind. I\\'ve never had to fight with him about anything, he listens to me and is open to talk if I ever have a problem. This is astonishing since I think I was screamed at about 5 times a week with my last SO. I\\'m in a really good place now, with everything.\\n\\nWhich is why I\\'m so mad about breaking last night. It was so stupid. I come home from a night out with my sister and join in on the group call with my SO and our friends to play some video games and tell me SO that we need to finalize our plans for a trip we\\'re taking TOMORROW, when I see a post in the group chat. I recognize it as his alternate reddit username. This is the the one that he used as a throwaway to post a personal story about me (that I agreed to because he said it\\'d be a throwaway) and some pictures into a thread once upon a time. The thing is, I know he forgot to log out and back into his real account for a while after that post and ended up using it for the majority of the time. I was ok with that since I figured no one knew that he used that one. But then I saw it on the group chat! No context to explain what it was or anything, because it\\'s just a string of numbers and letters, so I tried not to freak, but it has a lot of things in there about me that I don\\'t want my friends to know about! My heart start pounding really hard and my hands feel like they\\'re swelling up or something because they\\'re painful and tingly. I\\'m getting myself flustered and overwhelmed by the physical reaction of it all and can feel my face getting hot. I\\'m getting really mad at myself because I know it\\'s an attack, but I don\\'t want to have the attack, this isn\\'t a big enough reason for me to be having one and I don\\'t understand why I can\\'t just force myself to NOT have this happen.  I mean emotionally I\\'m holding shit down pretty well, because I have no evidence that there is really a problem yet, I\\'ve rationalized, but my body is just going off without out. I tried to ask him why it was there in the personal chat, but he didn\\'t notice the messages, so I even had to casually mention that he should check his other messages while on the group call with all my friends, and it was so nerve racking to try and note a personal issue in a group call because I don\\'t want to seem like the crazy girlfriend who bring personal matters to a public forum. So he checks it, and explains that he had to change his password on a video game yesterday and since it\\'s just a string of number and letters that he knew well, that it was the best option. And his friends needed to use his account for a second so he posted it as the password, and apologized for the confusion. That\\'s it. It was nothing. I started freaking out for nothing. And I just want to cry because the attack won\\'t stop now, it\\'s already on a roll and I keep feeling the physical effects of it, I have a headache and I\\'m nauseated and my cat is nowhere to be found. So I try and talk to my SO about it, (in personal call) and laugh it off and he\\'s being wonderful, but I can\\'t help but make worse and stupidly figure \"hey, you\\'re already in crazy mode, why not just spill out every minute thing that\\'s been bugging you this week\" and I blurt out my frustrations for out trip tomorrow and how I\\'m frustrated at him that he\\'s not helping and just keep spewing this acidic word vomit at him, that he doesn\\'t deserve. He\\'s still being wonderful and apologizes and helps me finish the planning and there\\'s no problems to be had for anyone. But my body still continues. I go to sleep and wake up this morning and lo and behold the effects of the attack are still working their way through my system, I have a headache still and no urge to leave my bed, when I know there\\'s a thousand things to do... So I\\'m writing this is hopes I feel better. I do. Thank you to anyone who actually read through all that.\\n\\nTL;DR: I have an attack over absolutely NOTHING. I\\'m mad at myself that even though I can rationalize and sort out my emotions, that my body still has the full reaction of an attack, and there\\'s nothing I can do to stop it. And mostly ranting.', 'I have been off Paxil for my anxiety and depression for a few days because my psychiatrist office and my insurance company screwed me out of coverage and no longer taking appointments and I ran out of meds a few days ago. Is it possible to get it prescribed by family/primary doctor? I am already getting withdrawal symptoms and my anxiety is returning to full force.', 'Hi everyone.\\nI\\'ve been pretty anxious for as long as I can remember. Things made me more nervous than most kids my age. I had a really great home life so I can\\'t seem to figure out where it came from.\\n\\nAs a child I had no traumatic experiences. Both my parents were/are still together. Both loved me and treated me great. I was never poverty stricken. I did average/well in school and in sports and always had friends. My little brother was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was two and my little sister was born with a developmental delay (it takes her longer to process things). But, aside from my two siblings slight disabilities I can\\'t think of anything that would of triggered my anxiety.\\n\\nThe first incidence I can remember where I was really was anxious was when I saw something on the news when I was about 5 or 6. Something about public pools being contaminated because little kids were peeing in them and then the public pools weren\\'t using enough chlorine to kill the germs? Anyways I had gone to a public pool (YMCA)  few days before I saw the news on the subject. I think I overheard a symptom being dry or rashed skin.. and I guess I thought I had contracted something from the pool (when in reality my skin was just a little dry and had some bumps?) I wouldn\\'t wear dresses, shorts or skirts at all that summer. I remember only wearing pants because I didn\\'t want anyone to see my skin. I was so scared to go to the doctor and for them to tell me I had contracted some disease. What 5 year old worries about that?!\\n\\nThe next issue with anxiety I remember was after September 11th. I was in 5th grade (about 10 years old) and I remember not being able to sleep in my own bed for weeks. I would lay in bed and envision a plane crashing into my house.\\n\\nAfter that around the age of 14 or 15 I watched some video in health about a variety of diseases..one section was targeting breast cancer. I would touch my chest all the time and think I felt a lump when I didn\\'t I was scared to go to the doctor and for them to say I had a tumor or something.\\n\\nThroughout the years I had a variety of anxious behavior but the worst time was just a few years ago when I got high for the first time. I had smoked weed a couple times before.. I think I tried it when I was 17 but I don\\'t think I ever inhaled properly to get high. About 2 1/2 years ago I drank a decent about and then smoked weed at a friends apartment. I literally had an out of body experience. (I didn\\'t even know that was possible?) But I felt like I was in a dream and couldn\\'t wake up. I kept thinking of the worst thing that could happen. My heart was beating out of my chest and I literally thought I was having a heart attack. My boyfriend gave me water and I was trying to relax. I literally can\\'t explain how I felt. It was like nothing was real..yuck even thinking about it gives me anxiety.\\n\\nThe whole next day I was in a fog. I just kept thinking how I felt that night and it was like by thinking about it I could almost bring myself back to that place and how I felt. Anyone know what I mean? After that day the way I saw the world was different. It\\'s like now I can almost \"make\" myself feel how I felt when I was stoned. I obviously don\\'t want to.. but sometimes when I\\'m really tired, or zoned out, or it\\'s late, or if I\\'ve had a drink or two I get back to that horrible anxious place. (By the way I know it was just weed and nothing else mixed in because my boyfriend and our close friends all smoked and were fine. I have also tried smoking a few times since then to see if it happened again and it did. I obviously don\\'t smoke now)\\n\\nSo basically the point of this post was to see if anyone has any advice or has felt anything similar. Obviously the awesome people here have experienced anxiety, but I\\'m talking about how the way I smoked effected me so much and almost triggered me to having worse anxiety.\\n\\nI have a friend who can\\'t smoke because it gives him anxiety, but no one I\\'ve talked to experiences a weird fog like anxiety level when there\\'s no smoking involved.\\n\\nI always think the worst thing could happen but it\\'s so odd because my life is so normal. I\\'m almost 22 (female) I\\'m graduating from a university with my bachelors in May. I have a great job- one that will promote me when I graduate. I have a loving and supporting family, and an awesome boyfriend whom I\\'m moving in with in a few weeks. It\\'s just these anxious thoughts pop in when I\\'m not really busy..when I have time to let my mind wander. I get anxiety about the world ending, about cancer, about severe storms.. everything :( I just don\\'t know what to do and if anyone has experienced anything similar.\\n\\nEDIT: Also, I\\'ve never been to therapy, or been on any medication.', 'Anyone in agreement with my title? I know it seems slightly pessimistic and for all of the \"suffers\" probably a bit misconstrued because, \"we\\'re actually inflicted!\". I have recently been tossing this idea around in my head considering that I have been in a struggle with what I believed to be depression/anxiety/ocd...etc, and I thought that my life wasn\\'t in my own control anymore. It seemed that I might as well hand over my ability to reason to my newly anointed \"crazy, endlessly-running, sad\" mind. This was my exact thought process for a year and a half up until now. \\n\\nI found the idea to call myself mentally unstable after I seemingly lost control of my thought process and allowed dark, repressed thoughts to take the reins over a couple weeks time until one day where I caved. The year before this I had walked onto a Division 1 mid-major swim team without prior training aside from dedicating every minute of my previous summer to transforming myself into a grade A athlete. My mind was focused on nothing else and this was good for me, as I had finally found a way to disassociate myself from my half year of sadness after a breakup and a shitty freshman roommate. My sophomore year was promising, as I began the year with the least experience, the best build and a whole lot of room for improvement on the team. Come the third month of training and my season is plagued by a very fucked shoulder and I was forced to watch my teammates succeed from the bench, not to mention I had just recently tried to find happiness in one of the most beautiful girls I have ever known. I tried to repeat my prior relationship the same way as my first and immediately my infidelities came out. She obviously was excited at first but saw my sad motives and moved on. At the end of the year I knew that my athletic career was over and I had literally no clue where I stood with women, not to mention I had developed a weird anxiety where I was constantly checking to make sure I wasn\\'t going to piss myself in class. God Dammit. I basically thought I had no hope for anything. Later on I broke down to my parents about how scared this made me feel while omitting the anxiety issues. I lost all hope for life and I was sad as shit. \\n\\nEnter the summer before junior year and I have started my first internship with a broken ego. My boss was quite possibly the most abusive person I think I will ever meet and one of my coworkers was a closet homosexual. I know that\\'s a brash thing to say but it was discussed around the workplace and it was quite obvious. The reason that is relevant is because of a developed new thought process that made me terrified of becoming gay. Funny, right? I had never had these thoughts previous and became terrified of myself. The sheer thought of homosexuality destroyed my well being and it made me turn from a confident individual who had never had any issues being outgoing into a nervous, shy person who would have rather sat in my room and stare off into space. Fast forward past the summer and I had scavenged the internet for the \"answers\" to what was going on. This was on top of the fact that I had entered myself into a peer-pressured lifestyle of a fraternity. I unfortunately and fortunately am one of the better looking guys at my school and felt pressure from everyone I knew, even when it wasn\\'t as present as I made it out to be. I would later on learn that this pressure was a self-pursued fantasy. Good-looking people can still be scared shit-less, when approaching the opposite sex when sober.\\n\\nH.O.C.D. and Depression: \"A debilitating combo that affects very few OCD sufferers around the world. The normal patient has constant spikes in anxiety when placed in a situation involving sexual contact or where possible sexual connotations are present. Usually the patient is not gay and has never had previous desires for homosexual contact. The patient must go through a series of Cognitive therapy practices and medication must be supplemented to overcome these harmful thoughts.\" Perfect, I found my answer. I was an OCD kid who simply couldn\\'t get rid of some thoughts. Now remember, I was so deep into my own thoughts that the \"H.O.C.D.\" was actually ruining my life. I kept reading deeper and deeper into my issues and decided to couple my new life with a bad habit of smoking weed 2/3 times a day, even after a previous bad experience with pot immediately following my first breakup. I thought to much, cast my health to the dregs and made bad decisions all year. I played friendship like it was an instrument and didn\\'t really hold anything dear. It was like I had thrown in the towel and allowed my thoughts to capture who I actually was. \\n\\nI knew I needed help, so I went to see a therapist at school. It seemed like the perfect chance to take a step to recovery, even though I still had no genuine understanding of my issues but still a good opportunity. The only issue was that I was assigned a gay therapist. Perfect. I gave him half assed answers the entire time and eventually gave up on the sessions without disclosing my OCD fears. \\n\\nFast-forward into the spring and was at a loss for what I was going to do with myself. I hated myself, It felt like there was nothing I could do and the fact that I kept reading into my issues from other peoples, similar but still subjective problems, did not help. The next summer came and my anxiety was at an all time high. I vividly remember having horrific panic attacks, where my body was almost uncontrollable. I hated where I was and I hated who I had become. \\n\\nThis past fall, I finally found some courage to change my life. I went to a new therapist and a psychologist at school and told them everything. It felt good and honestly even though I honestly thought I was insane, I definitely noticed a change in my thoughts the day after my sessions. This revelation did come with a price though. The price was a new sense of purpose in life and my submissive anxiety filled character started to fade away. Once I harnessed that, I started smoking less and eventually became more engulfed in my health. I tried acid a few times too, which I thought was just going to make me crazy but it actually did the opposite, It allowed me to grow even when I did have one bad trip. Continue up to now and I have apologized to the people I have hurt, removed some bad seeds from my friendship group and stopped grasping others specific issues as answers to my own issues (I\\'m looking at you reddit). I have begun to write occasionally and although I still suffer from the occasional bad thought, I find it now more subjective in my case and I rely on myself to change my life and thought process. The things that finally brought me back to some sort of reasonable mental state were not relying on my thoughts to predict my happiness and making my actions key in defining who I actually am. I\\'m not going to say I\\'m happy all the time and I\\'m not going to say I\\'m sad all the time either, but I have changed and have embraced my growth from youth to manhood as a beautiful part of life, no matter how terrifying it is. I have also realized that being shitty to women and collecting sexual partners is a terrifying way to live life and it won\\'t collect happiness for you, especially if thats not how you lived life upto college. Taking note of the world around me and not fitting all of my problems into each and every single moment of my life has proved key in my recovery. Moving moment to moment is better than continuing a thought filled, action-less life, but then again that\\'s subjective for me. \\n\\nP.S. Acid is a beautiful drug and you won\\'t go crazy from it unless you have a legitimate family history of schizophrenia or something of the like. \\n\\nTL;DR: OCD and other mental health issues are real, but become exacerbated to the point of finding yourself in a horrible pit of despair. Don\\'t rely on reading others experience to change you, change yourself and trust your instincts over your harmful thoughts. \\n\\nI commend you if you actually read all that. Also please note that this isn\\'t my full story, I had a wild year and a half dealing with this so there is more than just this page.', \"Background: I'm a 22 year old female, I've had anxiety for years, but nothing this bad. I've had major depression and very slight anxiety (like only in the car) since I was about 15.The last few months I've been having random panic attacks that come out of nowhere, I've been severely depressed, and I have a chronic pain condition that still hasn't been completely diagnosed (they dx'd me with Fibromyalgia and are still doing tests a year later for MS). I'm overwhelmed, in pain, my muscles seize up when I walk so I am basically stuck in bed unless I take a muscle relaxer or smoke some weed. I don't know how to talk to my doctor about pain medication, I've been taking tylenol extra strength and it only barely numbs the pain. My mind is constantly telling me that I can't do it anymore and I'm getting intrusive suicidal thoughts that I can't control. My husband and I got in a fight last night because I went to bed before him and I was really anxious because it's really hard for me to sleep alone. I was really bitter at him because even though I was begging him he just didn't want to lay down with me. I had a breakdown. He ended up trying to leave me but didn't because I was in such a bad state he didn't trust me alone. I can't control my emotions.

I owe thousands of dollars in medical bills, I need to come up with $2000 upfront for all the testing they want to do for MS, I feel like my husband is miserable and I don't feel like I'm worth much.

Let me know what you think.  If anyone who\\'s familiar with the disability application process has any tips for making it better, please let me know.\\n\\n&gt; Every day I wake up and getting out of bed feels like a chore.  Sometimes it takes me hours to work up the energy to do it.  Not because I\\'m still tired but because I feel so emotionally drained and empty right off the bat.  On top of that, I worry.  I worry I\\'ll stand up and twist my ankle and fall.  I worry I\\'ll leave my room to discover something terrible has happened to my family or the world.  I worry about everything that could go wrong that day.  I just feel awful from the moment I get up.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; I spend almost the whole day in my room by myself.  Even being around my family in other parts of the house makes me nervous most the time.   My room is my safe space where I can feel slightly less on edge.  I have no friends to hang out with because I get too nervous meeting new people to actually establish a connection with anyone, so I am isolated.  \\n&gt; \\n&gt; It\\'s near impossible for me to find enjoyment in anything.  I\\'ll lie in bed for hours just staring at the TV because I can\\'t be bothered to do anything else, but it doesn\\'t entertain me.  I just stare blankly.  I don\\'t care about it.  Sometimes after a lot of struggle I can will myself to play a game or something but I rarely enjoy myself doing it.  It makes the time, which always feels to move so slowly, pass a little quicker but I rarely have fun.  I get little to no enjoyment out of the things I supposedly enjoy.   I have no real hobbies because I can\\'t be bothered to do anything.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; I hear voices I shouldn\\'t hear.  They usually make no sense.  \"Radar blue CD patrol!  Don\\'t forget your horse!\"  Just nonsense that won\\'t shut up and leave me be.  Oftentimes they aren\\'t pleasant.  They\\'re often reaffirming every negative thing I think about myself, telling me I\\'m useless, worthless, fat, ugly, annoying.  No one likes me.  I\\'m a burden on my family.  I\\'d be better off dead.  I\\'ll never get any better.  The world is ending.  People are watching me.  They can hear me.  I\\'m not alone.  The voices are loud and angry and they scare me and they don\\'t stop.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; I can never stop the worry, either.  No matter how much I try to focus on other things, the intrusive thoughts always find a way into my head.  I worry about getting hurt.  I could stand up and twist my ankle and fall.  I could trip and smash my head into the floor.  The next time I go somewhere we could get into a car accident.  I could have a brain tumor I don\\'t know about.  I worry about getting old, dying.  I\\'m terrified of death and I can\\'t stop thinking about it.  I worry about the people I love dying.  Sometimes I start to cry because I can\\'t stop thinking about my parents, sister, grandma, or boyfriend dying.  The thoughts disturb me and I can\\'t get them out of my head. Gruesome images of my pets being harmed pop into my head and repulse me, make me feel physically sick and horrified and there\\'s nothing I can do about it.  I fear terrible things happening to the world, like nuclear war or a comet striking that will wipe out humanity.  I become convinced the world is coming to an end and I can\\'t stop worrying about it.  I fear something happening to my home - a fire or tornado hitting.  My safe place gone, everything I own and that is important to me, gone.  I\\'d have nothing and nowhere to go and the thought terrifies me.  All my thoughts terrify me and I can\\'t make them stop.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Then I panic.  I have trouble breathing.  My chest feels tight and painful.  My limbs go numb.  I cry and shake.  I feel like I\\'m dying, and then I panic more because of my fear of death and it all amplifies.  Sometimes it lasts a few minutes and sometimes it lasts an hour but it feels like days, weeks of agony in just a few minutes.  Can\\'t breathe.  Can\\'t think anything except that I\\'m dying.  Can\\'t feel anything but my heart pounding, ready to explode.  It happens at least weekly, sometimes multiple times a week, and it\\'s agony every time.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; I avoid going out places at all costs.  As soon as I get around people the anxiety amplifies and I get more on edge. In crowds I feel like I\\'m being smothered.  I become terrified of embarrassing myself in front of people, saying or doing something stupid.  I constantly worry people are judging me for how I look, walk, talk, act.    I become convinced that the people surrounding me can read my thoughts so I have to keep my mind blank.  I can\\'t look at someone and think anything about them because they\\'ll know and they\\'ll think I\\'m weird or crazy.  I worry something bad will happen while I\\'m in the store, like a shooter or hostage situation.  I spend the whole time worrying it\\'s going to happen.  I can\\'t talk to people in public by myself either.  My mother has to be standing right there when I check out at the grocery store because I can\\'t do it alone.  I can\\'t talk to strangers without panicking.  I need a chaperone. \\n&gt;  \\n&gt; Whenever I do have to go somewhere I have to go with my mother because I can\\'t drive.  I\\'m too anxious and panicky to drive.  I\\'m terrified of having to control a vehicle.  I don\\'t want to get in an accident and get hurt or killed.  I\\'m convinced I\\'ll accidentally hit another vehicle, pedestrian, or animal.  Even the thought of accidentally hitting an animal makes me sick and so I\\'m petrified of driving in case it happens.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; I had a job for a few months and it was hell.  It started with just a couple days a week, just six hour days, and that was too many and I had to be cut down to one day a week.  Even that, just six hours a week, and I was miserable.  I would have panic attacks before work every day.  I would be a nervous wreck in the car ride on the way in (Mom driving me of course, since I can\\'t drive).  Once I got there I\\'d just go emotionally numb.  Everything was so overwhelming - being out of my safe space, being around people I don\\'t know, having to talk to people and do things on my own.  I\\'d get more and more anxious throughout the day.  I\\'d shake and get cold sweats and have to cry in the bathroom.  I ended up losing my job and instead of being upset I was relieved.  I could just stay at home where it\\'s safe again.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Night time is difficult for me.  I get more paranoid at night, and I\\'m afraid of the dark.  I can\\'t look out windows at night because I\\'m convinced I will see something or someone staring back at me.  Ghosts, aliens, intruders.  All the curtains have to remain closed at night because I can\\'t look out.  As I walk through the dark house I need to turn on every light I can to reveal anyone or anything that might be lurking in the shadows.  I\\'m afraid to look behind me because I worry something is there, watching me.  \\n&gt; \\n&gt; I can\\'t go to sleep without something on the TV to provide light and noise or it\\'s too dark and quiet and I worry things are watching me and listening to me.  Oftentimes once I close my eyes I\\'m terrified to open them again because I become convinced that when I do, there will be something/someone there over my bed staring at me, watching me try to sleep.  I fall asleep each night terrified and worrying again, always worrying.\\n\\n&gt; I often have nightmares of all the things I\\'m afraid of happening.  I thrash and moan in my sleep and wake up with my arms scratched up from clawing at myself.\\n\\n&gt; Then the next day it all happens again.  I feel dead and empty inside.  Can\\'t be bothered to do anything.  Nothing is enjoyable and all I do is worry.  It\\'s miserable and no way to live.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; I\\'ve been on countless medications and few things have helped.  I\\'ve been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 11 and they\\'ve given me so many different pills and treatments and nothing helps.  I\\'ve been hospitalized multiple times and would always leave in the same state I entered in because nothing they did made any difference.  \\n&gt; \\n&gt; I\\'m on medications now and they barely help.  They quiet the voices a bit and take the edge off to a degree but I\\'m still constantly plagued with the intrusive thoughts and fears.  I\\'m still hard pressed to enjoy anything.  I still barely know what fun is.  I still loathe myself.  There\\'s still always that underlying level of anxiousness and depression.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; I worry I\\'ll never get better.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; ', 'The last two weeks I have had very bad anxiety.

Well, I decided to go back to school this summer, and realized that I would need meds as well.\\n\\nI had a ton of anxiety about seeing my doctor again. I was on antidepressants, but had abruptly stopped taking them.

You need to stop calling those panic attacks.\".

I have a few medical conditions that i often stress about too, but never thought i was overwhelmed with anxiety cause of them. \\n\\nIm just wondering if anyone has had similar symptoms or might have symptoms that don\\'t fit the \"normal\" description of anxiety. My anxiety during most of this has been very bad. I  do have days where my anxiety is better but my neurological symptoms are still present. Is that possible? To have the physical or neurological manifested symptoms still be present despite not feeling anxious? Any input would help out immensely. Thanks in advance for any feedback. \\n\\nTL;DR- Experiencing memory loss, confusion/disorientation, warped perception of time along with other neurological symptoms. Abrupt onset of all symptoms (about a month ago). Feels almost like what i believe dementia would feel like. looking to see if anyone else has had similar symptoms before.

Yesterday when I went to their house, I walked in and saw grandpa sitting in his chair. I went over to give him and hug and a kiss on the cheek like I usually do and he turned his mouth and tried to kiss me...open mouth! That\\'s not the worst part. He also rubbed my boob. I don\\'t know what to think or do about this. Would it be better to just not say anything about it? He is really old and just started a new medicine so I don\\'t know if it was making him feel loopy or what. But he also said \"I probably shouldn\\'t be doing this.\" as he did it so I kind of feel like he knew what he was doing and that it was wrong. I feel like crap for not saying anything to anyone but I think it might be worse if I do say something. I am afraid my husband won\\'t let me go over there anymore without him but his grandma and I are really close. I am afraid to say anything to her because I feel like she will be embarrassed by it.

I'm 17 and have been dealing with what I guess you would call social anxiety, which is odd because I come off as a pretty confident person, although on the inside I'm irrationally freaking out. I don't exactly know why I have this irrational fear, or what I'm even afraid of, but the symptoms seem to feed off of each other. I'm a pretty pale individual hehe, no albino, but to the point where if I'm flushed, it's visible. So the anxiety will usually flare up, causing me to start sweating considerably,mostly under my armpits regardless of temperature, immediately causing me to become self conscious of this and my appearance, which then causes my face to flush a bit, and it's a vicious cycle that only perpetuates itself. My face will feel really hot and flushed, yet the rest of my body will feel cold and clammy. These symptoms little by little, are pushing me into a more introverted lifestyle, and I can't stand it, I feel like my anxiety has taken a hold of me. I have no idea what options are available to me, I've tried for a couple years to get a grasp on this mentally, but that hasn't worked so in terms of help I'm looking to medication. Anything to stop the sweating which I think in turn would reduce the flushing/heated face feeling? And I'm not sure if this is a situation that deems worthy for anxiety meds, but I'd prefer not to have to take some medication that will numb me and not make me feel anything, although I'm open to anything that will help with any of these symptoms.

I also think it\\'s important to note that my maternal grandmother has extreme anxiety and is a hypochondriac (undiagnosed, but undeniably exists). My mother has diagnosed anxiety and takes medication for it; but the level of anxiety appears to lessen with each generation.\\n\\nI believe the onset was in high school, around age 17.  I would wake up in the morning feeling like I had just smoked weed; similar to a feeling I get when I\\'m dehydrated like I\\'m in a dream but I know I\\'m awake.  Except it would not go away.  I feel like I am always in a dream state--the levels of this feeling vary drastically though.  It\\'s not a feeling of disconnect; it\\'s a feeling of overwhelming consciousness of my self.  Every now and then it will get undeniably intense and I will be obsessed with the thought \"I cannot believe I am talking to this person right now/I cannot believe this person is looking at me and I cannot believe that they feel like anything about being alive or being human is normal.\"  It\\'s borderline out of body and I get warm and have to will it away with all my might.\\n\\nBut this is by far the least of my worries or problems; it is only a hindrance when I am forced to speak publicly.  The last speech I ever gave was for a class in high school.  It was a public speaking class and it was my final speech.  I got up in front of everyone, said the first line, then, \"I forgot what else I was going to say.\" and returned to my seat.\\n\\nThe part that affects every facet of my life and is nearly impossible for me to articulate is how uncomfortable I am around other humans.  I constantly feel like I\\'m walking on egg shells.  Everything I say is in hopes of making a good impression and not annoying them.  But the ironic part is that when it comes down to it, when I\\'m not around them, I don\\'t care if they like me or not.  I like who I am and I would hate to be someone else.  But I just feel perpetually uncomfortable around even my closest friends; if not especially my closest friends.\\n\\nI don\\'t change any of my opinions so that they like me either--I don\\'t say I like things just because they do.  I am too comfortable with myself to do that.  This is where it gets really hard to explain.  I don\\'t lie so that they like me--but I am always feeling like whatever I am saying is somehow offensive or annoying or worthless.  I feel like I need to be accommodating to everyone at all times.  But I am not a doormat either. I know this may sound like I\\'m in denial, but I just feel like I have to be nice and happy all of the time or else everyone is thinking about how mean and horribly boring and pointless I am. But, again, at the same time I don\\'t care; I care about the anxiety it gives me.\\n\\nI would really really prefer to be by myself maybe 95% of the time.  I am an introvert and I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever felt lonely.\\n\\nMy problem with all of this is that I\\'ve researched so many anxiety disorders and none fits, some of them may be like 30% similar to what I feel; but the rest is just nothing like me.  I know that not everyone fits their diagnosis perfectly and that there is grey area. A lot of the questionnaires that I\\'ve looked at use the word \"fear\" the entire time: \"Do you fear being around strangers?\" -No! I don\\'t--it\\'s not fear!

I couldn't find many posts from British hospital experiences so just wanted to put this here in case it helps anyone!\\n\\nYesterday I had a General Anaesthetic to remove a cyst in day surgery and I have to say, I was absolutely taken aback by how easy and non terrifying the process was. I had been suffering really awful anxiety in the run up to it, and the fact that the NHS don't tend to give you a lot of information beforehand meant I had googled away and focussed on all kinds of complications and side effects. \\n\\nIt went like this: I went in at 7.30am and sat on a little ward with around 8 other women. A nurse came around and ran through some basic questions and did my general obs. Then the anaesthetist came around to see me. He was great, immediately reassuring me as I explained my many fears. As it wasn't going to be a long operation I only had to have a soft little tube just at the opening of my throat - no tube into my lungs. He also said that he would give me an anti sickness medication before I came round, and that it wouldn't make me feel woozy or sleepy. \\n\\nThen the surgeon came around and explained exactly what she would be doing and answered a few of my questions. \\n\\nAt about 10am I changed into a gown and got on the bed to be wheeled over for surgery. I panicked a tiny bit at this point and cried a little, but the nurses were fantastic, chatting away and distracting me. In a side room I had a canula inserted by a student doctor. She got it first try and I felt next to nothing. The anaesthetist let me know that he was first giving me a little something to make me relaxed. I told him I was terrified of sedation but he reassured me it was very gentle - more like a large glass of wine, and he was right. I had been worried about the proposition of a pre-med (lots of people in the US mentioned this) I'm not a massive fan of sedatives, and envisioned sitting on a ward freaking out on ativan. But this was 30 seconds of very slight relaxation right before I was put under. The lovely nurse held my hand and I have no memory of the actual anaesthetic going in. \\n\\nThe next thing I remember is waking up in recovery. This was the part that I'd lost the most sleep over beforehand. But I was really pleasantly surprised. I have a vague memory of the soft airway tube coming out and then I was completely awake. No disorientation, no grogginess, no sickness. I was immediately aware of where I was and what had happened. I wasn't in any pain and didn't feel strange at all. \\n\\nThe nurse wheeled me back and I hung out on the ward and drank tea and ate biscuits for an hour or two. The surgeon came back around and explained what she'd found and what to expect from the healing process. After another set of obs from the nurse I went on my way around 2pm and my mum drove me home. I felt completely normal and relieved.\\n\\nPain has been very minimal and controllable with paracetamol and ibuprofen. This morning I woke up with a slight headache but nothing worse. \\n\\nSorry for the incredibly long post. I know this is a slightly niche area, but I just wanted to post because if I'd have known more what to expect beforehand I would have been able to deal with the horrible anticipation anxiety so much better. \", \"I'm a 22 female and I've had GAD for a number for years, but this past week it has been extreme. My depression also goes hand in hand with the anxiety, and it has felt like I am going to explode and I want to tear at my skin for pretty much 24/7. I've had a really rough past (bullies, abuse) but I can't figure out any triggers for this current episode.\\n\\nI'm not on any medications at all. I had a bad experience with benzodiazepines and it's put me off of the whole medication thing. I'm currently seeing a psychologist but I won't have another session for a month since she is on vacation. \\n\\n**Anyways**, I'm currently at work and have been doing my meditation exercises, but what else can I do to help relax and diminish the feeling while I'm currently at my very professional workplace? How do I not lose my cool? It's been really hard.\\n\", 'I (24F) met a wonderful, sweet, kind, genuine man (23) a couple months ago, and we have been seeing each other ever since. On our very first date, he explained to me that he is bipolar and has pretty bad anxiety issues (on medication for both). I was and am fairly understanding of this. I have an academic background in psych, so I\\'ve got a bit of head knowledge, and I\\'ve also been dealing with anxiety of varying severity as well as occasional manic episodes from age ~20-current, so I have the \"heart\" knowledge - albeit nothing on the same scale as he deals with.\\n\\nI recently got out of an emotionally manipulative relationship, and he\\'s still recovering from a recent manic episode. As a result, I don\\'t believe either of us are emotionally healthy enough to enter into a relationship, but it\\'s something I\\'d love for us to work toward and maybe eventually enter into. \\n\\nHowever, doing something like that requires communication, and communication between us about anything involving \"us\" is very difficult as he tends to shut down and become catatonic whenever I try to have a discussion with him about anything between us (granted, we\\'ve only known each other for two months, but I think there\\'s been two or three conversations in that vein). I don\\'t present our conversations as things to be afraid of or things that will ruin our friendship - they\\'re just that, conversations, things I bring up because I want to discuss them with him.\\n\\nHis reaction is nearly always the same - he gets a very disconnected look in his eyes and tends to grab at himself like he\\'s cold and trying to rub his arms to warm up. He\\'ll let me touch him or hold him, but often he shakes or twitches a bit like a mild seizure (though not continuous). He\\'ll also only whisper, and only say one of three phrases (either my name, \"I love you\" or \"I\\'m sorry\"). I can\\'t get him to talk to me about *anything*, even little mundane things. He\\'s like this for a very long time - usually I have to leave him alone for a while for him to get back to \"normal\".\\n\\nTypically after we have a \"conversation\" like this, he apologizes in earnest for how he behaved, but we never revisit the topic of conversation. In other words, we don\\'t really get anywhere. When I ask him what he was thinking when he wasn\\'t talking, he says that he was \"stuck inside his head\" and \"going in thought loops\".\\n\\nDoes anyone have experience talking to someone who has a similar response due to their mental condition? How can I help draw him out of his head and get him to talk to me? The majority of my anxiety issues stem from having scary and unpredictable conversations with my foster parents, so I\\'d like to think I know the basics of having nonthreatening, constructive \"talks\". I really adore him and want to be able to have a solid relationship someday, but I don\\'t see that happening without the ability to hash things out in conversation...\\n\\nThanks so much for any help you can offer. I just don\\'t know what to do when he shuts down.\\n\\nPS: I know this is probably a bit weighty of a question to be asking after only knowing the guy for two months. We\\'re both in agreement that we feel we\\'ve known each other longer, and as a result things have moved a bit quickly. Probably not the best idea in hindsight, but you can\\'t take back things you\\'ve already done.', '**EDIT: As of Sunday 30th, I will not be around for a few days. I\\'m making my way back up to university and won\\'t have the internet sorted up to a few days.

I need some advice/suggestions and would like to know if anyone else suffers in a similar way to me and how you managed to deal with it. This post whilst being used to reach out to others in a similar situation as well as gaining advice and thoughts will be used to help me collect and compile my thoughts into one location that I can copy down and use as some sort of transcript when speaking with a doctor. I know it\\'s big but I wanted to cover all grounds and try and answer any questions and provide information to you that you may want. I\\'ve broken it all down into categories so you can read the bits that interest you. It would be great to get some feedback, even if you don\\'t read it all.*\\n\\n**TL;DR: Anxiety causes me bad gut cramps and makes me shit badly, it is caused by just thinking about and actually leaving the house, even if it\\'s to take a 1 minute walk to a postbox. Longer durations cause more stress.**\\n\\nI haven\\'t been told by a doctor that I suffer with anxiety but I think my symptoms (I will get to these shortly) are a clear indication of this. My anxiety is directly linked to my bowels which I\\'ve dealt with for nearly 8 years in silence. I only came out to my parents on the seriousness of the issue a few years back and need to get medical help. Anyway, I\\'m not sure how to structure this post, everything is all inter-connected and all over the place. I\\'ll start with a bit about me.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**About Me**\\n\\nCurrently, I am a 21 year old Male in the UK. I am about to go into my 3rd year at Uni. I have dealt with my anxiety as it is listed below for nearly 8 years. I place the event that started it towards the back end of October 2004. Some stupid school/childhood trauma that I place at the foot of all of this, I could be wrong. I\\'ll write the details up at the end if anyone is curious. I\\'m about 5\\'10\" and weigh in at ~(8st|50.80kg|112lbs). Very underweight, not sure if this is related to my symptoms at all (I eat lots).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**My Triggers**\\n\\nTo begin the horrible anxiety crash course, all I need to do is merely think about either going outside. This ranges from going places in the car - to sitting in a university lecture - to walking to the postbox and back. Leaving the house causes anxiety, thinking about leaving the house causes anxiety. This is somewhat related to the worry of getting caught-short and needing the toilet where there isn\\'t one. (The symptoms complicate this, see below).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**My Symptoms**\\n\\nSymptoms I can deal with:\\n\\n- Faster, shallow breathing.*^1\\n- Nausea.\\n- Feeling like I could be sick.\\n\\nSymptoms I cannot deal with:\\n\\n- Horrible gut cramps that force me to clutch my stomach in pain, these come and go in a way that can only be described as contractions lasting from 20s - 60s and coming as often after one another as the time they last.\\n- A sudden and alarming urge to take a poop. (The urge is very real) *^2\\n\\n*^1 I\\'m not sure if this is a symptom or my response as a coping mechanism.\\n\\n*^2 My stool is firm and fine when I am not anxious. As soon as the anxiety kicks in it will liquefy there and then. Never had a hard stool while anxious. My anxiety involves holding back diarrhea. You can now see my problem.\\n\\nIt takes a great deal of mental (keep doing what I\\'m doing and remaining around my trigger) and physical strength (keeping that sphincter shut (see *^2 above)) to push past this. It should be noted that once the trigger has gone, ie: I get back into the safety of my house: my cramps stop, the urgent need to poop goes and the other symptoms just vanish. It\\'s at this point I become fine.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**About My Attacks**\\n\\nOnce we get to about 30 minutes before I need to leave the house to attend university classes, my symptoms start. I will go to the toilet for a poop (as stated earlier, these are real urges with something behind them) and will poop about 3 times before finally leaving the house. (15 mins before leaving, 10 mins before leaving, 5 mins before leaving, etc... (not concrete times)). This is the point where I\\'ll decide if I can continue, if I feel too bad, I will stay at home and skip the day, which makes me feel bad since once I decide to stay at home, the symptoms just stop. Should I venture onwards, it is at this point I\\'m usually just feeling sick, nauseous and be breathing quickly (going to the toilet has calmed the guts down for now). At this point, the bowel troubles could start up again. The worst feeling is sitting in class/lecture stuck in by other people while waiting for it to start, knowing that it could come back with a vengeance. Not nice when you\\'re going to be stuck there for 1 hour. Whilst I can go to the toilet and this offers some relief, it doesn\\'t always stop the problem. I can go to the toilet and feel great afterwards, until it comes back again. Other times I can go to the toilet and still be in pain. Truly horrible. The only cure for this problem is to remain at home - Not something that is going to be possible for me.\\n\\nThankfully my family and friends fully understand what I go through and never rush me. They encourage me and convince me everything\\'s going to be all right. The sad thing is that it doesn\\'t help, my problems don\\'t go away and I continue to experience them on a daily basis.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**My Current Stance**\\n\\nSo right now once I get back up to university, I\\'m going to go back to the doctors. I\\'ve been before but I was going there with the intent to sort out a bowel problem*^3 and didn\\'t place the focus on anxiety which after much reading leads me to believe that is the cause. I hope with this stance and changed approach to my problem that I can get the help I need to overcome my problem.\\n\\nI find it hard to force myself to attend university classes or group meetings when walking there, sitting there and going back lead to the symptoms I described above. This is wrecking my life and I need it sorting quickly. How can I attend my graduation with this problem? If it\\'s not under control, I will skip it. Travelling to and from university (nearly 3 hours drive) is the bane of my nightmare and I\\'ll be doing this on the upcoming Sunday.\\n\\n*^3 Was given Mebeverine 135mg as a stomach relaxant. Worked for a while but my worry eventually rendered them useless and the problems persisted. Continued to take it as a way of convincing myself it would help, though I\\'m not convinced with those efforts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Where do I place the cause for this?**\\n\\nBack towards the end of October 2004, I was in school and we were doing a small test in class that was used to assess how we were doing with learning German. Our normal teacher wasn\\'t there and we had another covering for it. I sat there in pain, really needing the toilet - Yet I didn\\'t ask until I really had to go and that I couldn\\'t hold out until the end of class. My request to go to the toilet was rejected and I sat there suffering in pain for about 15 minutes before she looked up, saw me looking as white as a sheet and then had the cheek to ask me if I wanted to go to the toilet. She sent someone with me thinking I would faint when I went downstairs. Anyway, I unloaded and completely destroyed the toilet (it was very messy) and then I felt relief. Since then I\\'ve had my problems. I blame that woman. She doesn\\'t even know how much she\\'s screwed me up. It makes me so angry.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**I ask you:**\\n\\n- Do you deal with bad bowels as a symptom to your anxiety?\\n- If yes or no, doesn\\'t matter, how do you deal with you anxiety, what do you do to push past and through the rough parts of it?\\n- Does my symptoms meet the requirements to be considered an anxiety \"attack\"?\\n- What kind of anxiety disorder would you put this down to? (8 years of suffering when the same triggers fire makes this hard to believe it can\\'t be a disorder).\\n- To those who have gotten help from a doctor, how would you advise me to convey my problems in a way that will stress my urgency? The shitting problems need to go and they need to go very soon.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThank you if you took the time to read any of this giga-post.

I knew from the get go it was just to piss me off. (Recently he admitted to it, and said he wont do it again.)\\n\\nA few days ago I started talking to another guy, Nick. I\\'ve talked to him before, but we were both seeing other people and eventually quit talking. But we started back due to us both being now single, and I really like the kid. We\\'ve been walking together and holding hands and getting close and what not.\\n\\nTyler didn\\'t like this too much, which didn\\'t surprise me. I talked to a couple other guys before Nick though, but he never got quite as mad. Tyler started texting me yesterday and was telling me that Nick was no good, and will only hurt me. Tyler said he was just going to hit it and quit it. \\n\\nNick said he made it seem this way to Tyler so Tyler wouldn\\'t be so mad. Nick admits to everything and says that he truly does like me.\\n\\nDuring my texting conversation with Tyler, I had an anxiety attack. It was pretty bad, considering I haven\\'t had one in a while. (I stopped taking my meds because I feel better generally without them).\\n\\nAfter my attack, Tyler asks to call me, and I said sure.\\n\\nWe end up staying up until 3:30 talking. Not just about all of the drama but just how our lives are going, and catching up. We both admit to eachother that we still love eachother and miss eachother and just cry to eachother. He asked me if I wanted to get back together. I said yes. He said that we would start dating in a week or so, just to let things die down. I agree. \\n\\nIn order to date, we would have to be in school dating for a while, and in time go on dates, because I know my family will be pretty pissed if I get back with him due to what he caused me during the break up.\\n\\nNow, he doesn\\'t know for sure if we should go through with the deal, and neither do I. \\n\\nI like Nick, and would gladly date him. But I love Tyler, and always will. He is the only person that can calm my anxiety and I miss him in general. Every little thing about him. His humor, personality, his hugs, holding hands with him, etc.\\n\\nMost people tell me, don\\'t get back with Tyler, it\\'ll just end the same. I don\\'t think it will. I know it wont be good, family wise because he hurt me. I want to date him again, but I then again I don\\'t.\\n\\n\"Just ignore him again.\" It\\'s so fucking hard to just stop here, I still have an ounce of hope. \\n\\nI feel bad for basically making Nick wait. I of all people know how fucking depressing that shit is. I don\\'t want him to, but he says he understands.\\n\\nWhat should I do reddit? \\n\\nTL;DR: Ex is wanting me back after I\\'ve found another.

Unfortunately though, I don\\'t have any real \"away time\" when panic attacks hit because I take care of a toddler full-time and my husband works weird hours which lead us to different sleep schedules. I don\\'t want to wake him up and bother him when attacks hit because I know he needs his sleep just as much as I do, but a lot of the time the only thing that calms me down is to be able to talk to someone.

That\\'s normal, I know this, but I don\\'t want my child picking up on the fact that I\\'m feeling horrible anxiety all of the time. So I usually pretend to be okay and do things with her like playing or watching things. All this alone time makes my anxiety even worse and most of the time I don\\'t want to bother anyone so I never reach out. Though admittedly I definitely should. I\\'m not on medications right now and can\\'t get on any for a few months at least, so I just have to figure out a way to deal with these I guess.

Talk to your doctor. \\nYou have a chemical imbalance that may or may not fix itself. There's no shame in considering medication. Taking medicine turned my life around, find the one that's right for you, I tried three before I found one that doesn't make me hazy.\\n\\n2. Talk with the ones you love. \\nEven though it's hard at first, I found huge relief in explaining exactly how I was feeling to my close friends and family. Also, from talking with them I found a surprising amount of them had at one point had some of the same feelings I was having, which made me feel way less alone.\\n\\n3. Watch kids movies. :)\\n It might sound funny but it helped me a lot. \\n\\n4. Be active enough that you want to go to bed at night.\\nFor me, anxiety caused a really unhealthy cycle of staying inside all day, not being tired, laying awake in bed because of anxiety, sleeping in, repeat. Even though it feels like the hardest thing in the world to do, go outside. Walk around, exercise, go to the store, even just driving around. \\n\\n5. Wake up everyday and choose to fight it.\\nThis might not be for everyone, but for me, part of getting better was going from being a victim to a fighter. If you have it, you know it's a battle. It's the hardest thing I've ever experienced. So rise above it, be brave, choose to live on in spite of it.\\n\\nI'm rooting for all of you :) it will get better, keep fighting.\\n\\nSorry for the wall of text.\", \"I have no medical coverage and I'm broke so seeing a professional about this is impossible. \\n\\n\\nWanted to give all of you who were kind enough to give me advice an update.

During this day, I felt nauseous to the point where I ran to the toilet puking my guts out. Ive vomited many times before this, but this certain day traumatized me. I couldnt stop throwing up, and I kept crying. This scarred me into thinking that the next time I vomit, I wont be able to stop. Eventually it grew into a huge fear, and now anything that relates to vomiting (seeing it, smelling it, hearing it) I get anxious and freak out. \\n\\nNow a couple of years ago, I started having extremely bad panic attacks out of the blue, to the point that I am now currently on medication (Lexapro) for it.

The uncertainty of that was too much for me to deal with, so I told my parents that I was quitting because it was causing mental health concerns for myself and I just wanted to be happy and not worry about stuff again.  My mom has been scared her whole life (she also has real bad anxiety) that I will develop a mental illness at some point because her grandpa was scizophrenic.  \\n\\nThey discouraged me from seeing a therapist/taking meds, but this isn\\'t about them, this is about me.  I got a phone call from my older brother last week and he started off the phone call with, \"So mom said you are going insane?\"  I said \"What?\" trying to not acknowledge what he was saying.

The anxiety is enough that I avoid driving whenever possible, but not so much that I can't make a trip down to the store along familiar roads.

Everything is close by and I was finally feeling comfortable driving (enough so that I made two 200mile round trips to drop off (and pick up) the kids at their moms.  That's 800 miles in three days!).  Anxiety was less.  Highways were no longer intimidating.  I was comfortable switching lanes and making left turns.  I was even thinking about getting my own car (or a scooter).  All was going really well.  \\n\\nAnd then I got into a [car accident](http://imgur.com/a/fagYl) last Thursday.

Had it not been for the seat belts, I would've flown through the window and may not have survived.  But luckily, all I have is a shit ton of bruises and some chest pain (doctor said all is well).  \\n\\nI have training today at noon (for a different job), about a half hour away.  It's all highway to get there.  And I'm freaking out.  I really don't want to drive but I know I have to.  I can't let this stop me.  My girlfriend dropped me off at work this morning and I had a small melt down in the car.  I was *just* getting comfortable driving and then this happened.\\n\\nI know I'll have to just suck it up and drive.  I have no other choice.  But what can I do to minimize the anxiety while I'm driving?  To feel calmer and safer behind the wheel.  To prevent my head from seeing a potential car crash in any situation?\\n\\nLuckily, this is a route I've taken before.  But the car accident was less than two minutes away, but it still happened.\\n\\nJust in case: I'm not on any meds (aside from some pain killers for now) and I've never been diagnosed with anxiety problems of any kind.  This is pretty much the only thing that ever gives me any anxiety - everything else in life I tackle with a zeal.  But this is so debilitating! \\n\\n**TL;DR**: I've had driving anxiety for the 8 years I've had my license.  I was finally getting over it when I got into a bad car accident.  Anxiety is back with a vengeance.  Help!\", \"So I've decided to take the plunge and go see someone for my anxiety/depression that's been ruling my life for years. \\n\\nI have health insurance that covers what I would need to see someone about therapy or medication.\\n\\nBut if I do go (and I will depending) does my employer have to know? Is there any way they can find out I went to get treatment for mental illness? \\n\\nI'd really like to keep that a personal matter. \", 'I\\'ve been having a weird anxiety trip lately dealing with thinking that no one likes me etc etc etc. A bunch of I-know-its-stupid thoughts that I can\\'t get rid of. Pretty much completely based on focusing on negative stuff instead of positive. Like I had a friend over today to play video games, and she kept texting on her phone while playing. I later found out she was planning something with friends and she had to do it at that moment, but it still \"irked\" me to death about \"Is she having fun?\" \"Does she think I\\'m a cool person?\" \"What if I\\'m boring and shes texting out of boredom?\" etc etc etc\\n\\nIt\\'s just stuff like that that keeps getting to me. I \"know\" everything is fine and nothing has really \"changed\" per say, but I keep getting negative thoughts like nobody likes me, nobody wants to put time for me, I get left out on purpose, etc etc etc. It\\'s like a constant loop that I\\'m trying to get out of. Girl in above story actually gave me some meds that helped her in similar situations (which again, I should focus on that she cares about me enough to try to help me instead of dumb phone shit) but I havent noticed any difference really.\\n\\nAnyways, I just feel stuck in a loop and have constant dread/fear. I\\'ve contemplated asking a few friends (including friend above) blatantly if they trust me/like me, but then I also feel like that\\'s a bit too much/obvious and they\\'ll think I\\'m crazy or something. ', \"I don't really know how to put this so how about I start from the beginning. I've had panic attacks all my life and I have been she people about it and taking meds. They have been working well but I still have panic attacks when I exercise. I think it is important to tell you what sort of caused me to have such a fear of exercise (I feel it is important to note that do to my fear I have not stopped eating healthy so you don't have to worry about my weight) When I was little I was told by my mom that me and my bigger sister had to do boxing. My other two bigger siblings did boxing so we had to as while. We boxed and everything was overall meh but I do remember feeling scared when we did laps. But then it happened. I don't remember how long I was in boxing at this point but I would have to guess a week or two. A new kid a lot younger then me joins our secession. I was fine with it until my trainer tells us to do sit ups. It's fine I'm good a sit ups. Typing this is hard for me i feel like i'm going to throw up. As I was doing sit ups I looked at the new kid he was already up and finished his sit ups. Then I looked a my sister she was up to and looking at me... I froze. I couldn't breath or move I was so scared. They waited for me but I broke down. I couldn't go on and I spent the rest of the session on the floor hyperventilating and crying. Then I hear the ringing of the door and my mom walks into the gym. Mom... I love her some much she means the world to me... and then she looked at me. She looked so angry. She started yelling she said that i'm embarrassed her. She hated me I cried the whole way back my sister didn't look a me once. The next sessions where just as bad. A few years later my mom tried to get me into boxing again and that time it was worse. Now I can't run without panicking and crying. I try so hard but no matter what I do I still fall down the same pit all those years ago. Now my brother wants me to do boxing again and I'm so scared.

Coincidentally, this is how long I've been taking my meds (escitalopram, 10mg once a day). Could the meds and/or anxiety be causing it?\\n\\nI'm not freaking out over it, it's kinda cool actually but definitely not normal.\\n\", 'A few months ago I had a sudden drastic alteration in understanding of self after anxiety attack. I feel I am the same person, but, awake, alive, and unafraid. I still feel anxiety/fear, although it creeps up I feel it recognize it and it goes away. I find this change to be incredible, strange, and wonderful. I used to have panic attacks that made me miss work, cause horrible painful swelling in my joints and skin. I would get a temperature and experience the most awful mental distress where I felt I was coming apart. I would self harm and wail.\\n\\nSo a few months back after a bad storm that made life at work hell (cops involved, people becoming ill and injured, other crap) and the decision that I was going to be moving out. I had the panic attack of all panic attacks. I had been inside wailing (that uncontrollable cry you hear from a mourner) It is distressing for all involved to hear that sound so I went outside sat in a chair (to be away from others) and slumped forward and I have no idea what happened. For 2 hours I sat on the porch. I had the strangest experience (probably from lack of oxygen) where I saw warm and cold light. The feeling of becoming super small, but also a feeling of \"Oneness.\" I came out of it when someone came out to check on me. When I went inside I felt very VERY strange but everything felt very real, I was ready to get ride of everything I \"owned\" I did two weeks later donate bags and bags of things to goodwill and threw away trash bag after trash bag of junk. But since then, I have not had a panic attack, instead when I feel one, the need to cry or my heart going nuts, or my skin swelling- I become calm- I feel warmth and that \"oneness\" again I feel loving- still fearful but with a sweet undertone.  I know this did not happen on its own, I did years of therapy, studying, and medications (I am no longer on.) This event, altered the way I see the world and respond to it, it stripped away a part of my built up reactions to stress. \\n\\nSo, any idea of what the hell happened? I do not miss the extreme anxiety. I do not miss missing work or school and I do not miss the pain and stress. But what the heck happened? How? I feel like a person who is stable.

I just need someone... \", '*This is a new account, as some of our friends know my other handle, and I\\'m sure my wife would want me to keep her private affairs private. Thanks for you understanding.*\\n\\nMy wife has been suffering lately from anxiety attacks and some depression, and I want to help her, but I don\\'t know where to start to be honest. I\\'m okay with her seeing a professional- it only makes sense, right? When the car is broken, you see a mechanic, when your teeth are bad, you see a dentist. When your thoughts hurt, you see a therapist.\\n\\nLet me try to explain her (our) situation. If I miss anything or it isn\\'t clear, please let me know where and how I can fix it. \\n\\nWe are both young, early twenties. We\\'ve been married for a year, dated for five- the tail end of high school and all through college. We both graduated college one year ago. Like most high school kids, my wife and I both had self esteem issues in our teens, though I feel that she should be nothing but proud of her accomplishments- she graduated in the top three at our high school. In college, she graduated college suma cum laude from the honors program at the best university in the state. She has always had a little bit of anxiety, but over the last two years it\\'s gotten much worse. It started towards the end of college. With graduation and our wedding around the corner, she started having crippling anxiety attacks. She would become very upset with hysterical crying and pains in her chest. The attacks almost always came accompanied with feelings that she was a \"bad person\" and she would recall embarrassing memories (sometimes from a long time ago, sometimes very mundane) that caused regret and remorse. This is the part that I find most frustrating, though my frustrations aren\\'t directed at her- it\\'s just frustrating because she\\'s the most considerate and selfless person I know, and had never intentionally harmed another person or said anything malicious about anyone. A month before her graduation she began to take medications for the attacks- I don\\'t remember which ones specifically, but there were two. One was a once daily and the other was for when the attacks got very bad. She was on the daily medication for about eight months, and closer to our wedding she got off it. She still has the other anxiety medication to take when the attacks get bad. \\n\\nOver the last few months since our wedding, her anxiety has gotten worse and it has come to take on an air of depression. She says things like she doesn\\'t love herself. This part scares me very badly to the point where I feel like I\\'m going to be sick. She feels remorse and even shame over events that happened a long time ago. Sometimes it\\'s over small interactions that most people would dismiss without thinking twice about, but she keeps revisiting them and reading into them over and over until she comes to the conclusion that she\\'s a bad person. It\\'s like she can\\'t help but wander into these darker corners of her mind. I can sympathize, I\\'m familiar with this kind of sudden regretful memory or revisiting bad points, but I\\'ve grown able to quash those feelings by keeping my mind and hands occupied. So I understand where the feelings stem from, that\\'s not the part I need help with. My attacks like this largely started going away after I started dating her. It gave me the self esteem to be able to deal with those thoughts. She on the other hand, hasn\\'t been able to build up a defense mechanism. \\n\\nAnyways, she gets the attacks more often now. Anything I try to say or do to make her feel better doesn\\'t work- she refuses to accept anything I say when I try to calm her down. She will, however, listen to her mother, who has had similar anxiety attacks. I guess the most frustrating part for me is that her mom will tell her the exact same thing I will and it will calm her down. I say it frustrates me because I\\'m her husband for crying out loud, I should be able to comfort her. I should be able to  fix her problems, she\\'s my wife.\\n\\nHere is the external situation- our home life is good. We\\'re not awesome money wise, but we are comfortable. She is very close to her mom (we both are, actually), and we have an apartment in the next town over from her parents. The work situation is not as good. In a month we will be moving a few states away for my job. Since graduating college, she has been working a job where she is underemployed for her credentials. She loved the job when she got it 10 months ago, but has gradually learned to dislike it because it involves some physical labor aspects to it, which she struggles with because she physically small in size- just over 5\\'2 and under 100 pounds. I think this inability to perform some of her job\\'s tasks has taken a toll on her as well, since her self esteem thus far has been built on her successes. She was very (VERY) successful academically, but now that school is over she is struggling even more with her self esteem issues.\\n\\nNow that I\\'ve given you a back story, here is what I need help with-\\n*I don\\'t know where to begin to look for help. This is something a therapist can help, right? Or is it a psychologist? Is there a difference between the two? There\\'s so much I don\\'t know, and I don\\'t know where to start.\\n*After I find out what kind of professional help she needs, I need to locate one. Is there a way I can find out if the therapist is a good one? I need to know because she\\'s too important to me for this to be handled improperly.\\n*Once I find a professional, I need to be able to affectively communicate with them the problem. Where can I find a list of anxiety disorders (is that the right word, disorders?) and look for the one she might suffer from? Do any of you know what it might be called?\\n*When she is having these attacks, what can I do to mollify them or help her?\\n\\nI need help with these things. I also need *guidance*. If anybody knows of *anything* that might help, please, I\\'m listening and willing to do it.\\n', 'My SO is still battling with anxiety attacks.

I waited over a month and during that time I often felt like on drugs, flying etc... I thought I'm going nuts. Before that event I feared more or less nothing. Nowadays I fear more or less everything where I'm not in situation where I can leave. I don't have social anxiety (e.g. I host poeple from CS), I speak daily with people and occasionally do some lectures, but mostly in front of people I know. I don't fear people, airplanes, dogs, elevators, ... When I were flying the past years, I was always anxious for 20 or more hours. Unable to eat anything, unable to sleep.

This happens in this situations where I feel like I've no control. In the last years, I tried to get over that by myself, started doing many sports (climbing, sailing, running and yoga, during some months everything together), meditating. Nothing helped. I was going to a doctor and got some meds. Most of them didn't help or had the opposite effect (e.g. Surmontil, I was longer awake then normally). I also got Sertralin, which was the worst thing I ever took, after taking it, I liked to kill myself. Some months ago I went to a psychologist. Told everything. But I always got the feeling that she tried to think about my past, about my childhood, some Freudian stuff etc... wasn't everything perfect there, like in most families, but nothing really shamefull happened, not worth to spend too much time. I recently quit my job and liked to travel around, but some days before I liked to go, in a night I had some kind of an attack, could not eat anymore, my brain was just generating random noise, got very weak as a consequence.

Googling for the possible solutions for my problem I discovered meditation. Foundation of my therapy was samatha and vipassana meditation + cognitive behavioral therapy rather than taking meds. With time and persistence my anxiety started to fall off till it reach the level of present anxiety - a manageable anxiety with which I can normally socialize, make new friendships and function on the day to day basis which I couldn\\'t do before. Also, meditation brought a better understanding of the world, the concept which we call \"self\" and other things we discover on our path. But, last few weeks I discovered that my treatment is stagnating. Ok, no worries, I\\'ll just increase the dose of my meditation and everything should be fine. I started to meditate 3 times a day for a 30-40min period per session. And then I realized something. Every time my anxiety became scarier and harder to cope with I saw as a sign that my meditation effects are wearing off and I should sit and meditate to bring myself to the feel good mood back again. Well, I was wrong. I started using meditation as an escape pod from my anxiety feelings rather than a tool to understand them. Every time I\\'ve got anxious instead I comfort my anxiety and work with it with other techniques like CBT I was running away from it. Don\\'t get me wrong, meditation is a great tool, the best thing I discovered in my life, but our brain especially the anxious brain has it ways to make really benign stuff into harmful attachments and defense mechanisms. I\\'m really happy I\\'ve discovered this. Today I only sit twice a day, in the morning and in the afternoon, and when I get anxious I just let it be and work with it instead of avoiding it.

I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, general anxiety disorder, and panic disorder early last year. I see a therapist and psychiatrist every month and take my daily medications every morning. I'm doing ok with the schizoaffective except that anxiety and panic is still there. I feel really stupid, dehumanized and sad when anxiety manifests itself into a full blown panic attack and i cant stop it. I feel like i have the right tools through therapy and medication to stop the anxiety/panic but it just steam rolls over me.I try to read, go for a walk, talk to someone but it feels like if a panic attack wants to get me, its going to get me.

The international clinics are quiet far, so I have been going to the Korean hospitals around the corner where they speak little English, but enough. I have had 2 urine test, 2 ultra sounds of my bladder, kidney x-ray, and a blood test. All came back normal. Well a few weeks ago,  the doctor decided to check my prostate, but instead of stick his fingers up my ass, he decided to stick a giant stick up there to take pictures of my prostate and bladder (Was not a pleasant experience) Well all came back normal and he said I have an overactive bladder and gave me this medicine to take for 2 months. (No idea what it is, but I would like to trust him). Well it is 3 weeks in and still don't feel any different and wondering if the doctor could have missed something or if it is my anxiety acting up?!?!\\n\\nSome history to help, I have lived in Korea for 2 years before, lived in OZ for a year, and just moved back to Korea. I startex to get heath anxiety in OZ a year ago when I kept getting headaches and thought I had a brain tumor. Got an MRI, all was good felt better. Then, before I left for NZ for a month, started having chest problems, got and ekg and all that was good, felt better a month later. Maybe 6 months ago, thought I had colon cancer cause I was pooping weird, got test all was good, felt better later. So it would seem anxiety is ruling my life, but I don't know if this is just another case or if it really could be serious. I really do feel like I have to pee all the time. Either in my stomach/bladder or at the tip of my penis. I read somewhere that anxiety could cause all this.

The crying resulted in a pounding headache that I\\'ve had for 8+ hours now. I took an oxycodone to help ease it and am waiting for it to kick in fully, but I know it may not help the headache itself since different pain medication types work on different kinds of pain.

I\\'ve never been diagnosed with migraines before, but I\\'ve been told by family and friends that migraine pain is excruciating.

Anxiety that once ran my life, and thoughts that once clouded my judgement and vision, have ceased to control my decisions, beliefs, and actions. To all of you brave souls out there who struggle day by day, I make this post to tell you that anxiety can be conquered. The struggle isn't easy; there were countless times when I felt unable to fight back. But each day it became easier and easier, where finally my intrusive thoughts are nothing but insignificant blips of random, fleeting images.\\n\\nMy struggle is my own, and anxiety is a many-faced monster that differs from person to person. But through the years I have found that there are so many ways to fight it. Therapy and medication are not to be overlooked, despite the unfair stigma that may surround them. Friends and family can help as well, but in the end we are the ones who know our own personal little shit monsters called anxiety the best. It is a fight, and it will be difficult at times, but it is this hardship that makes us stronger and stronger. \\n\\nSorry if this post is cheesy or what not, but damn my nails look good and just felt that a little thank you was in need.

He isn't a very talkative guy. This past month he's been going to a psychologist and a psychiatrist because he decided that he wants to stop using medication (the Parotexine, which he has been using without any supervision from either a psychologist or a psychiatrist for about eight years now, I think).\\n\\nThey recommended him to u gradually stop using parotexine, which he did. Now he's on escitalopram, which is supposedly easier to stop with once you're used to it. He's having a hard time, I think he's going cold turkey still from the parotexine. He literally can't stand still, he took a break from his work about a week ago. He is either outside, walking, or at home trying to sleep. He can't eat, he can't drink water (he even stopped smoking) and he tells us that it feels like his head is on fire, he's agitated and very on edge.\\n\\nI figured, there would be people here who both have personal experience going through (maybe something similar) as him, but also people who have known someone who had to go through this. Can anyone give me any advice on how I could support him? How do you show your support, what could you best tell someone in this situation?\\n\", 'I\\'m a junior at a university, I don\\'t know how I even made it this far. I also took 2 leave of absences in the process. \\nEvery day I stare at my work for hours on end panicking and not starting it. I do this with everything except for readings and small assignments. But essays, exams, etc (especially essays are the worst! and my major is quite writing intensive) I end up staring at and never starting. I often end up never starting my essays and never turning them in, which has taken a huge toll on my gpa. Sometimes I don\\'t turn in final/term papers that are near 20 pages and about half of my grade. \\n\\nI stay up all night every night and often stay up 3 or 4 days in a row staring at my work and panicking. I\\'m really not a lazy person, I spend a significant amount of time \"doing\" my essays and \"studying\" for exams but really I just stare and panic. This is making me want to drop out again after this semester, as school is so not worth the sleepless nights and endless panic. I have a therapist and she\\'s understanding (plenty of other therapists I\\'ve had haven\\'t been but this one is), but I still don\\'t find therapy helpful and never have. I am on medication, so I no longer actively have outward panic attacks...but my fear inside is just as strong.

For the past few days I have been having very lucid dreams, ones where there are wealthy people and then people trying to kill me. And strange ones where I have no idea where I am. I woke up this Am and felt okay, then as I got ready for work I could feel my nervousness kicking in. I pushed through it as I am not on any medication. I got to work and about an hour into it I started feeling very lightheaded. It wouldn't go away. So I went into the bathroom, sat on the toilet, and attempted to relieve myself. While doing that I remembered what my dad told me, most people, when they die from a heart attack, it usually happens when they are on the toilet. Suddenly my left hand felt pressure, lightheaded began again. I  finished up and left. I went outside for some fresh air and change of scenery, it somewhat took the edge off but not completely. I returned to my desk, I found it was very hard for me to type, to consantrait on what I was doing. I kept freaking out that I was having a stroke or something was teribly wrong with me. ( I have had anxiety for about 5 years now, I have been on Zoloft and Paxil, I didn't like the way they made me feel so I stopped taking them) Anyways, I left my desk after sometime and found a little area that was quiet, I sat, contimplating another hospital trip.. I was scared, I am scared. I have been experiencing strange symptoms that are different than my normal anxiety, tremors from inside my body, tingling in my left hand. I have had many tests done on my cardio and ct scans, nothing comes up, everything checks out. I left work and called my father, I hate calling him becasue he is 64 years old, on his way to retirement, cancer survivor and I don't want to burden him with my issues. As I was driving and he was asking me whats wrong, I broke down. tering up through traffic. \\nAs a 32 year old man I feel ashamed of my condition. I went on vacation last week, only to have an attack there as well, hindering my supposed to be relaxation. \\n\\nI think what fuels this so much is my fear. My fear of death. Dying before my parents do. \\n\\nI am so upset right now, I feel like I have no one to turn to, no where to go. I have scheduled a Dr appt with a new Dr on monday. I plan on unloading this pile of worry onto him in hopes that I can get some sort of guidance. I know I need to speak to a therpist now. Or psychiatrist.

These things could easily be benign conditions, but they could also be signs of something serious, the thought of which makes me restless.\\n\\nAs I\\'m sure people with health anxiety understand, I have spent countless days worrying that I have MS, ALS, sinus cancer, colon cancer, testicular cancer, cardiomyopathy, other heart conditions, kidney disease, autism, celiac disease, liver disease, and a few others that I can\\'t remember at the moment.\\n\\nThe most common advice I see here is \"find a therapist\", \"find a psychiatrist\", \"it\\'s just anxiety\", and generally to deal with the *thoughts* first. This might be my anxiety speaking, but I feel like thinking this way means ignoring something important my body is trying to tell me.\\n\\nIf I ignore my symptoms, I will always be worried that I could have a fatal disease without knowing for sure. If I play along with my health anxiety, I will end up spending all of my money and free time visiting doctors and going through medical tests.

These thoughts are really interfering with the quality of my life.\\n\\n', 'I am 19 and in college and am nowhere near understanding the complexity and solutions of my disorder. I have been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety and OCD, but I\\'m not even sure anymore. I definitely have something. I know that. \\n\\nI am not a social person and going to a big new school, I cannot say I have been successful in making friends. There is one person I\\'ve gotten really close to. An old friend I knew from high school. Over our first two quarters, we got became really close. At least I thought so. I don\\'t think we saw eye-to-eye. After reflection we didn\\'t really do much, just homework, but I very much enjoyed it. I was her tutor so I think that skewed my perception, because her motives aren\\'t related to friendship. \\n\\nMy current problem started a few weeks ago at the end of my school\\'s Winter quarter (late March). My friend went on vacation for Spring break and I didn\\'t hear from her. Pretty normal right? Well I kind of freaked out. I had an anxiety attack and thought that she didn\\'t care for me and that she only talked to me for Math help. This quickly developed into the darkest week of my life. I spiraled into depression and was not in a good state. When she got back she tried to assure me that we were friends. Over this quarter she became very busy. She dedicates herself to school, work, a club she\\'s in, and her boyfriend. I have gone from seeing her everyday to maybe once a week if I\\'m lucky. My anxiety kind of crept up on me once again and I lashed out. I tried to point out that she didn\\'t care about me. I tried to point out that when she became busy, her behaviors with her boyfriend have become unchanged, but she has almost completely cut off contact with me. The first time I mentioned it was two weeks ago, and in person. Because I don\\'t really have the skills to deal with the situation, I ended up saying something, but then quickly back-peddled away from it. She seemed mad, but we said goodbye and I didn\\'t hear from her for a couple of days. The following Monday, I lashed out again over her using time that could have been used to do something we\\'d been planing for a while, dinner, to spend more time with her boyfriend. He gets the whole weekend and can\\'t even get an hour! I was furious! I wrote back telling her that she spends all of her limited free time with him and it makes me feel like garbage. She replied denying that and bringing how uncomfortable my previous anxiety techniques have made her. (A few months ago we had planned to go to an event, but she told me she had to take her brother to get his car fixed. Later, she made an Instagram post saying that she spent the night driving back to school and did a bunch of stuff with her boyfriend. Being that I don\\'t have an Instagram, I suspected that she didn\\'t think I would see this. When I confronted her, she got really mad and told me that she had to lie on her Instagram so that she could spend the night with her boyfriend and then drive up the next day. It was a trap for his parents to think that he drove her up and spent the night there. Although I am not entirely true that actually happened, I believed her and tried to tell her how sorry I felt. I absolutely felt terrible. Over many attempts to she show that, she told me every time that she was okay with it. ). This was the first I have heard that it still bothered her. I probably should have assumed it did as she changed her Instagram to private. \\n\\nAfter a day or two, this past Thursday, I asked for a few minutes to apologize as I don\\'t know what came over me. That came today. I got about 10 minutes to explain to her what has been happening. I have told her previously, mostly after the Spring Break fiasco, that I suffer from a tremendous amount of anxiety. That I am registered and receive accommodations through our school and that I seek medical help. I have done a lot of thinking and research for what exactly my problem is. One big thing I found similar was [Relationship Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder) and also just OCD. I was obsessed with the idea of her liking me and needed constant reassurance. I tried to explain these things and I owned up to all the mistakes this has brought me. I am not sure what I expected, when I told her that I needed support and later that I was okay with whatever relationship she wanted, she responded with \"I might text you a month from now just to see if you\\'re okay\". WHAT THE FUCK?!\\n\\nIs this something I should be okay with? I have been trying to find support in other places, but I am having trouble being that I am very shy and kind of need a lot. I suppose what I am asking is help, I think? Did I just lose my best friend? Was she really my friend to start? Is there anything I can do/could have done? I suppose I am just in a world of confusion and need help finding a way out.\\n\\nTL;DR: My anxiety got me to say bad things and my best (I think) friend isn\\'t okay with it.', \"Hey there.

When I moved to University, I went back to the doctor as these were becoming a little too intense to handle and I didn't want them affecting my studies. I was raised from 20mg to 30mg daily. This was probably around middle of October. I thought I had finally got to grips with this and found myself feeling a lot better. But within the past few weeks, I'm slipping back into these episodes again. I've had to miss a few workshops at Uni and it's affecting me completing my work. There's nothing on my mind that's bothering me. Apart from these episodes I'm a very happy person. I'm confused as to why I'm still feeling like this and why is it still so intense even when on meds. I've tried counselling before and it didn't help, I'm not too keen on this idea as I don't see how they would be able to help as I wouldn't be able to explain what I'm feeling anxious about??\\nI'm booking another appt. at the doctors tomorrow. But I'm worried as to what they're going to suggest. \\nHas anyone else been in this situation? \\nDo you suggest asking to change my meds, or have I just not stuck with the citalopram long enough??\\nI'm hesitant about changing meds and it would feel like I'm starting all over again. I feel quite alone with this, so any advice would be brillant!\\n\\nThank you xox\", 'I\\'ve had anxiety my whole life. I\\'m 28. When I was little it showed up in the form of nausea. I wouldn\\'t want to go anywhere because I was afraid I would \"get sick\". Whenever I slept over at a friends house I always ended up calling my parents in the middle of the night to come pick me up.\\n\\nIn high school I was finally diagnosed with anxiety, panic attacks and depression. It used to go through waves, being really bad (not being able to leave the house) to being manageable. It also seemed to sort of just go away on its own.\\n\\nI\\'m now on the tail end of one of my really bad episodes. Or at least I hope it\\'s the end. I\\'m better than I was a year ago. The thing that drives me crazy is my panic attacks and anxiety come out of no where. Therapist try and tell me there *has* to be a trigger, even if its subconscious, but there\\'s not. They are random and annoying.\\n\\nI just don\\'t know how to fix myself if I don\\'t know why I\\'m broken. I\\'m on meds, I\\'ve tried a million different types, I\\'ve been through countless hours of therapy and was even inpatient once in the hospital for behavioral health. Nothing seems to make a dent.

I\\'m more interested in the kind you take as needed, but am not sure what the options are for that  (xanax? that\\'s just a guess off the top of my head) and am wondering if anyone would share their experiences with those types of medication. ', \"Hey, everyone!\\nSo, I took a huge step today and made my first counseling appointment. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) when I was little. I can't remember how long ago it was, but I'm guessing around age 10 or 11. A psychiatrist started me on Paxil and eventually switched to fluoextine, which is what I have been taking daily for the past several years. However, I've never really been to any kind of individual or group cognitive therapy. I'm a student of psychology at university and, particularly lately, studies have shown that cognitive therapy can be equally, if not more, effective as medication. I am so tired of being racked with worries and constant fears. I don't have panic disorder, but I do tend to have fairly frequent panic attacks, especially if I am stressed or sleep deprived. My anxiety is beginning to affect my relationship with my boyfriend (who is wonderfully patient and the best thing that has ever happened to me!) and my faith (the most important thing to me), and I decided to take this struggle into my own hands. Because I've been diagnosed with GAD for so long and have researched it so thoroughly, I'm not too nervous about starting counseling. However, I'd love to hear about y'all's counseling experiences! Good? Bad? Ugly? What should I expect? \\n\\nWish me luck!\", \"A number of months ago my anxiety began to flare up and I was diagnosed by my GP with GAD. Since then I have been experiencing new symptoms all the time it seems, while at the same time having tangible ailments to (getting sinus surgery in a few weeks and have a compressed ulnar nerve in one arm for sure) so it has become harder to tell what is a symptom of anxiety and what isn't. I've also tried 3 daily anxiety meds to no success as my body absolutely does not react well to changed in the serotonin levels.\\n\\nSo question 1) I have getting numbness and some tingling in my feet, ankles, and just today started to feel like a humming in the thigh of my right leg - like when your phone is vibration in your pocket - very soft and subtle and last for maybe 4-5 seconds and starts and stops again. It seems to happen when I'm sitting up and not so much when I'm laying down. To be clear, there is no spasms that occur, no perceptive movements, just the sensation. Are these things anyone else has experience with or has had happen to them before?\\n\\n2) For the meds - has anyone found good daily medicine to control anxiety outside of the serotonin inhibitor family? Has anyone else had the same type of bad reaction as I have to the whole group? While my Doc goes back to the drawing boarding I have been left to sparingly use Xanax for the needed occasions. I react great to Xanax and only use half of a .25mg tablet when needed. My doctor however does not like Xanax and already wants to switch me off even though I still have half the pills left in the 30 pill bottle I was given back in January. Is my doctor being overly cautious or is Xanax really that bad to be taking?\\n\\nThanks or reading and replying, I truly appreciate the conversations that occur in this forum. \", 'Hi. My ex fiance called it quits six months ago and I went through some rough times because of some anguish over that. I saw a therapist but only one visit because I am shy. The first visit lasted 15 of the planned 60 minutes and ended with her suggesting maybe I wasn\\'t ready to talk. I guess she had a point though, because I still don\\'t know what it was I should talk about. I\\'m sort of selfish for being a sad sack about this and honestly, I\\'m a little embarrassed about that I\\'m so selfish and incapable of dealing with things like everyone else.\\n\\nMy GP put me on an SSRI when I told him everything, but I still usually feel generally bad most of the time. What\\'s the worst though, are episodes where I\\'m more or less \"triggered\" to think about the relationship and can\\'t stop dwelling on it or I see the ex (today). It just builds up and builds up and I end up cutting myself sometimes, or just sitting bawling like a baby in my room (quite embarrassing to admit) wishing I would just cease to exist. It feels genuinely horrifying. I have discussed this with my GP, but he just doubled my prozac. I have not noticed an improvement.\\n\\nI am wondering if anxiety medication could be useful for when I have these episodes. They are absolutely terrifying. I\\'m not sure, however, if they are really \"anxiety attacks\" or if they\\'re just times when I feel like shit. I sort of want to ask my GP, but I\\'m afraid of two things: \\n\\n1. I almost get the feeling he already thinks I am giant pussy for not being able to deal with the end of my relationship (I am male) and \\n\\n2. I am afraid of coming off as some dude that just wants to get high on benzo\\'s or something. Technically, if I asked him \"I think I have anxiety attacks and I think anti-anxiety meds would help\" that is drug-seeking. But all I want is some source of help or something I can do to help myself during these times because they are pretty much a living nightmare.\\n\\nAny sort of help or advice is much appreciated. The more practical, the better. This has been going on for 6 months and I really want to stop being like this...  Thank you.', \"So basically, i've tried therapy and it doesn't help. I feel the best thing for me is medication because I've been living my whole life with depression and social anxiety.

I can't even order food at a restaurant without panicking! I think my mom just doesn't want to admit that I have a problem.

', 'I saw a psychiatrist today to discuss complimenting my therapy with an SSRI. The idea is to make my therapy more effective and make it easier for myself to move forward in life at a faster pace. I do not want benzos because I need to remain sharp and focused. I expressed concern about the possible side effects, primarily libido. He recommended Prestig, as it is known to have fewer side effects. It is however more expensive. He then suggested that I can try Ciprolex, which he said about 40% of his patients suffer from decreased libido, but is also a good medication and much cheaper. In the end, I can afford both, just want to get a feel of which is more successful and any input from people who have tried either one. Thanks.', \"First of all, thanks for a good forum. So far I've learned a lot and felt encouraged from many of the posts.\\n\\nI've never taken my anxiety seriously, even though I know it has been there. \\n\\nIt started in high school and comes with some time in between but this time it has grown worse.\\n\\nSomehow it just felt so certain that I could not and would not survive if I stayed in the classroom. That's the best way that I can express it. It's not a 'fear of death' per se but just the feeling that 'if I stay here I won't survive'.\\n\\nFor very long I just tolerated this but now it has come to a point where it is invalidating me and I'm unsure of what to do.\\n\\nI have contacted a psychologist with anxiety/fear as his specialty.

I've taken solos in the past and they've always been shaky and I had to do my best to work through a massive internal freak out. The last time I went, I was part of a larger group and it was easier to play being in the back. This time, though, I'm worried I'm going to have the same reaction I have taking a solo, since I'm in a smaller group. Are there any other musicians out there who feel it difficult to play in front of a single judge and maybe four or five more people? Is there anything I can do to stay calm? Should I take more medicine that day?\", \"I don't know if I have anxiety problems. When I had talked to a school counselor she suggested it briefly. It was only a passing moment because she seemed more concerned with getting me through a really hard transition of colleges. It was a very helpful experience but it ultimately didn't work out too well. Because of this I'm afraid of going back to her because I initially went to wonder why I had been having so much trouble connecting with people. The problems is really getting out of hand. I'm a mid-twenties male. Only recently finished taking classes at a community college and never had a job. Constantly feeling hopeless, lost, and confused with just about everything involved with my life. I have enough friends and family I could count on one hand. Even so, I keep then only at arm's length. I can't go out and make friends because I'm horrible at conversation. Trying to find a job has been the worst feeling in the world. After reading some more into social anxiety, it feels likes so right to me. I sometimes get breathing problems, my mind will often become so overwhelmed with thoughts or emotions that I have to step back. I usually just have to go somewhere alone and curl up for a little bit. My chest gets tight feeling and I start to just feel entrapped. It's incredibly embarrassing and I'm so ashamed of the problem that I have trouble even reaching out for help. This shouldn't be a concern to anyone, I mean it's a part of life, and moving on, even if it's a transition. I can sit and rationalize through it as much as I can but sometimes I just act entirely on fear. I want help, I feel like I need help. If I can't find a resolve for things soon, I fear I may result to poor tactics that really damage ad ruin my life. It's become a horrible catch twenty-two with my life that I want to be alone and isolate myself for everyone but it's in that loneliness that things become the worst and I miss everyone I use to know.  \\n  \\nAlternatively, Are there any jobs that someone with social anxiety would be good for?    \\n  \\n  \\nLately I've been possessed with the concept of just wanting to turn my thoughts off. Would pursuing drugs or medications be helpful or am I just being wishful?   \\n  \\n  \\nIs finding someone to help this difficult? I'm not sure how to find someone when I can't really even talk to those around me about it. I also don't have a lot of money to try to pay for therapy or medication. \", \"I woke up eight hours ago and have spent every moment worrying. I tried playing a video game but my mind was too distracted to get any enjoyment from it. \\n\\nI usually spend a good portion of the day worrying, but not EVERY second. I know I can't get better by myself, but the thought of being on medication and having it not work scares me to death. What else is there to do if no medications are able to help me improve.\\n\\nThe only medications I've tried seemed to kill my emotions EXCEPT for the anxiety.\\n\\nIt's frustrating to talk to anyone in real life because I don't want it to seem like I'm whining. Everyone has problems, I would rather have my family think I'm ok than have them worry about me or think I'm being a baby.\\n\\nSorry if this is jumbled, anxiety also tends to make it hard for me to put my thoughts into words.\", \"I met with a guy last week Sunday (I am also a guy), and I gave him a handjob for the remainder of the hook up. I stupidly went down on him for about two minutes-3 min tops. He did not ejaculate in my mouth, but there might have been some precum. I kept pulling out his dick throughout the whole ordeal. I have been mental this whole weekend waiting for the window periods. This guy probably has had a lot of sexual partners. In 2013, he received a kidney transplant because he was born premature. He basically told me that his doctor keeps tabs on him. He gets medication monthly. I found his instagram account, so I know he was not lying about the surgery. 6 hours prior to the hook up, I brushed a bit hard and there was some bleeding. I hope that the wound healed, I am so fucking scared. This guy is a social guy, and drinks with friends and stuff. \\n\\nOn Saturday, I started feeling a weird sensation in my throat.

I used to have panic attacks quite regularly and though with meditation and a healthier life, anxiety attacks without serious triggers subsided, I still had an overwhelming sense of generalized anxiety. \\n\\nAbout a year ago, I got prescribed escitalopram and thought 'fuck it - I've tried most other anti-anxiety medications so why not?'.  It was a bit rockier to acclimate to (gave me horrible nausea for about three months - it hadn't even occurred to me that though it was an SSRI, it wasn't necessarily selective for neural serotonin and also affected your gut), but I acclimated nonetheless and honestly kind of liked it at first.\\n\\nOver the next few months, I wasn't so anxious about getting to work or a function on time, my worst-case-scenario thoughts had dulled quite a bit and for the most part, I was comfortable.  \\n\\nThen maybe about seven or eight months in, I realized my libido had dramatically decreased.  I was bloated frequently, didn't feel attractive, wasn't attracted to my partner... some more time passed and I realized I was falling out of love with him.  Fast forward to now (a year from the start of lexapro) and though I love my partner, I'm just not feelin' him at all.  Libido aside, I don't even know if I want to spend the rest of my life with him and we've built a life around that goal together.\\n\\nI should mention - my libido is zero just towards my partner (or so I think).

It did cause me to miss alot of social events growing up and i\\'ve always kind of been a shut in, i was also homeschooled which didn\\'t really help at all but i just saw all of that as part of being me and i liked being alone so whatever. But everything went downhill december of 2012, it honestly feels like thats when my life ended. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling weird like my thoughts were different or just like i was out of it and started freaking out. Eventually i was able to fall back asleep writing it off as just being tired, but i woke up the next day and while the panicky feeling was gone everything still felt different/off like i everything was just suddenly uncomfortable or something. I was freaked out but was able to keep it together for 2 more days but then in the morning i woke up and had the same thing but worse it felt like my thoughts were distant and i was having weird sensations in my head but it also felt like i was calm or drunk even though i was freaking out at the same time. I got really scared i was having a stroke or had a brain lession and ended up going to the hospital where i had an MRI and CT scan done and they took blood. Everything came back fine and they said they wanted me to see a neurologist because i was also dizzy/was shaky walking. He decided it MIGHT have been a seizure and put me on keppra just to be safe because i wanted to keep driving. I took it for awhile but eventually i kind of just started taking it here or there and it didnt really feel important since there was no proof it was a seizure and i hate taking medicines i think i dont need especially stuff that involves my brain. Meanwhile i was feeling absolutely terrible but back then i still cared enough to be embarrassed and never let on how weird i felt and how much it was ruining my life. Every thought i had i questioned like \"did i used to think like this? am i different then i was? is this normal?\" I felt super out of it all the time like everything wasnt real, i felt dull like i couldn\\'t concentrate or like i wasn\\'t thinking enough. Eventually stuff got kind of ok, i still felt weird/dull but it wasnt as bad and  i started thinking about stuff in the shower that wasn\\'t about how i felt weird or how i was scared. During that time though i still got a terrible feeling if i had to go somewhere in the next week or if i thought i had a health problem. I still worried about something constantly in the back of my head. Then about 10 months later do to alot of stomach problems(which was causing alot of worry) i had to have a colonoscopy. This caused me an INSANE amount of stress even though i knew it was no big deal i was freaking out and then i was up all night trying to drink the prep which made everything worse. I got home all whoozy from the twilight anesthesia and went to sleep. I woke up at like 11pm which isnt too crazy for me and went about my night normally until about 5 am when i started to feel super out of it again like i had when this first all started. I knew immediately that i was going to feel even worse for months and months and couldnt do anything but pace around freaking out. After this i felt even worse then i did right after my first \"attack\". Weird sensations all the time, having so much trouble going to sleep since being left alone to my thoughts without a distraction causes everything to get way worse,  i have no perception of how much time has passed, remembering something from an hour ago sometimes feels weird, like its from a week ago or something. i still feel like im almost drunk all the time like its too much work to think about something sometimes. Like ive just been living in a cloud of fog ever since this first happened. Then i started feeling like i tipped over a point or something, suddenly i started losing all of my emotions and it feels like im losing connection to my body. I can\\'t tell what i like, i can\\'t tell if something taste good, i can\\'t tell if i feel sick, my heart beat feels far away and feint in my head. Thats when my brother finally got me to smoke weed for the first time with an old friend that was back in town about a week ago. I took 1 big hit and we started watching a movie which i dont remember anything from. I basically just sat there while my heart rate was getting faster and faster until suddenly i felt this terrible terrible feeling in my head like i was having a stroke or my head was exploding and i thought i was dying and i started freaking out and ended up going to the hospital again where the doctor brought up anxiety/panic attacks and since i had been there before about a year ago without anything showing up i was discharged with instructions to see a therapist.  Also i had just taken my anti seizure medicine before leaving for my friends house so i guess that rules that out. This last week has just been me getting worse and worse, that feeling in my head comes and goes and i can feel my body panicking but in my head i still don\\'t feel anything. The distant feeling is causing my more and more distress which is probably making the distant feeling be there in the first place. I feel like a zombie and trying to sleep is absolutely terrifying. ive been having super vivid dreams and i think i had sleep paraylsis for the first time last night. The feeling in my head feels like its seeped into my brain and turned into agitation like i just want to flail around or run i cant explain it. And then i started thinking about brain lessions/strokes again and i can\\'t stop thinking about how one side of my face feels weird even though i know its from panicking/anxiety. Theres no relief from feeling scared/nothing/agitated anywhere. Everything i look at just makes me want to scream. Then this morning i had a doctors appointment with my family doctor just to get advice about everything and maybe some suggestions for therapist and to make sure it was actually anxiety/panic. Then i got in a 3 car accident on the way there because of an old person who didnt realize he was running a red light and my car is totaled so my doctors appointment got delayed until tomorrow and i don\\'t know if i can make it. So here i am sitting here with all these weird feelings in my head hoping i don\\'t die or have brain damage from a stroke even though this has happened before to a lesser extent and they didnt find anything. I still want to go to the hospital but i know i\\'d just get discharged again with nothing and my mom says its definately just anxiety and wont take me but i feel like im going to die. My thoughts feel so far away and everything seems so drained of life and meaningless. everything seems to be coated in gray that just makes me \"feel\" scared. I can\\'t find comfort in anything and have to wait another like 14 hours to go to the doctor who will probably tell me to go see someone else in like a week. I don\\'t know what to do. Sitting around trying to browse reddit just makes me feel even worse that i don\\'t feel anything anymore. I can\\'t take this feeling of being seperated from my emotions/thoughts and everything else in the world. I don\\'t want to die i don\\'t want to live i don\\'t know what to do. I just wish i could go to sleep for 6 months and hope i feel better when i wake up. im not even sure why im writing this. its giving me something to do i guess. im so lost, i feel like im out of options theres no relief theres nothing. I feel so awful its impossible to even want to get it fixxed since its stressful and seems hopeless. i don\\'t know how a therapist will help since my thoughts seem to have no effect on my body or my mood or how i feel. i can\\'t imagine ever feeling normal again. im just sitting here not even able to cry hoping im not currently getting irreversable brain damage, questioning ever thought i have, feeling like im a level above my body and all my thoughts/emotions like i trapped outside but can look in through the window and see them. help me', 'Hello all,\\n\\nLooking for experienced help.

I feel sick as soon as I wake up and I\\'ll lay in bed and cry and not want to do anything. I get anxiety attacks before/during work and it has caused my work performance as well as attendance to drop. Along with racing heart, sweating, trembling, etc, I will literally get sick to my stomach and vomit from anxiety, and I have been loosing weight because it is hard for me to eat. Eating has become one of my most dreaded daily chores because food NEVER sounds appealing even when I\\'m really hungry, and I have to fight the urge to throw up with every bite and I feel sick for hours after.\\n\\n I have been finding it very hard to interact with my friends normally as well as I often feel uncomfortable and can\\'t really let loose or have \"fun\" and I often just want to stay home. I feel like I have nothing to add to conversations but complaints about how bad I feel, and it\\'s really hard to relate to anyone. I\\'ve been dating a guy and I really like him, but I haven\\'t been able to talk to him about what\\'s going on because I feel very embarrassed by it, but that only makes really difficult when (for example) I get sick from anxiety on a date and can\\'t eat/have to run to the bathroom, or cancel our plans all together because I\\'m stuck in downward spiral of anxiety and can\\'t stop crying/running to the bathroom. I\\'ve just been saying it\\'s a really bad winter and I must be getting every stomach bug. I know as soon as I get back on my medicine I\\'ll be fine again and I\\'m afraid of scaring off a guy I really like early on in our relationship.\\nI got my approval letter for insurance, but my coverage does not start until March 1st so I can begin my medications again and get back on track, however that is still awhile away and I\\'m having a hell of a time in the mean time. I know it\\'s only a few weeks but every single day is a struggle and I feel like I\\'m just at the end of my rope here.  I already regularly practice meditation and other anxiety reduction techniques from my counseling, and try more alternative things like aromatherapy and some over the counter natural anxiety remedies, and while it helps a little big, I\\'m just counting down the days until I have insurance again. I never would have believed what a physical nightmare anxiety can really be until I experienced it myself.', \"Hello fellow nervous nellies!

My symptoms are feeling nauseous, panic attacks, spacey, can't sleep, sweating, crying, loss of appetite and derealization. My question is, has anyone else withdrawn from this medication?

Over the years it kind of ebbs and flows but I've always been able to keep it together on my own and I had always hoped that I would never need medication. Lately, the last 6 months maybe, I've felt worse and worse. I started having serious abdominal pain earlier this year and even ended up in the emergency room for a day. I've been to my Nurse Practitioner's office 3-4 times this year for all kinds of tests for the pain and when nothing was found, I was sent to a gastroenterologist who diagnosed IBS and prescribed a smooth muscle relaxer, which I've been taking for a month.

What do I need to do?\", \"A bit long, but most of this is meant to be therapeutic because I feel like writing. \\n\\nAt any rate, I was on some anti-anxiety medication (paxil and later, lorazepam) from the ages between 16 and 23 (I'm 27/m now). I had convinced myself I didn't need it anymore and felt comfortable about a lot of things, wasn't losing sleep, eating better, nor fretting over things. I made friends in college, had a nice social life, and had functional relationships.\\n\\nHowever, my last year at school, a close friend of mine passed away in an automobile accident. Originally I began medication because a friend of mine took his life when I was in highschool.\\n\\nI didn't want to go back on medication because I was slowly getting off of it, but I thought it was best. Eventually, after 10 months or so, I was off. Then two months later, I stopped by my best friend's place to hang out and found him dead in his bedroom. \\n\\nAt this point, I began therapy. It helped and was the first time I really sat down with someone and laid all of these things out. I was afraid that I was going to be affected by this at some extreme level. Like I was going to lose the will to have emotions for anything again. I don't know if I was depressed or what, but I lost lots of sleep but at the time time, convinced myself that none of this mattered and I had to stop thinking about it.\\n\\nA month or so into therapy, I met someone through friends. Things kicked off really well and I was ecstatic to have met someone. Unfortunately, things slowly didn't work out between us (her life seemed to be a mess, she was with other people while we dated. it's an entire other story), and my therapy eventually became about this girl and what to do. How to get over this. What could I have done differently? I sort of got over her. I still think about our relationship from time to time and it will eat at me, but I have no idea why. We only dated for a month or so. \\n\\nI thought maybe I developed abandonment issues from all of this. I found myself going back to ex's and trying to establish a relationship, but it never worked out. I knew it was crazy to dig all of that past up and I completely snapped when it didn't work out and they went on their way. I was always in a state of panic. I remember looking at my friends and other people and thinking, what am I doing wrong? I still have a social life and see my friends on the weekend when we go out, but I'm easily distracted as soon as some silly thought enters my mind. Other times I stop myself and tell myself I'm being ridiculous; there are bigger problems to worry about. And thankfully, I have a social life, friends, a job, and my health.\\n\\nAnd lately, I'm panicking nonstop.. I'm terrified that I'm at my age I have accumulated so much debt from school and have absolutely no idea what I want or should be doing. Or the fact that I still live at home bothers me endlessly. Sometimes I have a glimpse of an idea of what I really want to do, but it's fleeting. I tell myself that it wouldn't work out and I would probably get in some kind of trouble if I tried to purse it (like more debt). I volunteer at a crisis line and people call with their problems. After the phone calls, I start to wonder if I'm going to end up like that. \\n\\nTo foot, I recently met someone and the both of us get along extremely well. We've been on multiple dates that are all relaxing, fun, and... well you know, just a good date. But when I get home from them, I begin to panic. Like I'm waiting for the absolute worst to happen and I anticipate have to prepare myself to feel lonely again. Sometimes if she sends a message or a text that seems aloof, it bothers me for days. I sit and analyze it until something else occupies my mind. \\n\\nOr I think of something specific, like if we get intimate, I'm going to come off awkward and it's going to be a disaster (that's also become a developing problem, but not with her. It's happened with other dates or girlfriends I've had. It never became too embarrassing as long as the other person is understanding. I'm able to play it off. ) It keeps me up all night.

So I'd like to hear from you about your symptoms and the best and worst drugs you've been to. Below I'll do it myself in a detailed way so if you feel the same, it might be helpful:\\n\\n**Symptoms:**\\nThe main one is fear. I'm always on edge, waiting for something terrible to happen, every time my phone rings I think it's a tragedy, every time I come home I expect to find my cats dead, I never ever relax. Always a thousand worst case scenarios going through my head, and they all feel so real.\\n\\nFrustration is second worst. To the point that I can't get out of bed or get super angry and aggressive or can't leave the house (it triggers the fear and makes driving especially hard).\\n\\nBesides, of course, the crippling anxiety about doing important things like socializing, studying and sometimes working.\\n\\nI get depressed very easily, hating myself and getting impulses to hurt myself. Haven't done it since I went off the meds, but it always goes through my head. I want to break things and stop existing. \\n\\nI don't get panic attacks (like you feel you are dying etc) but I do get anxiety attacks where I can't breathe and go crazy, and get very easily overwhelmed by my emotions. I'm very empathic and general world shittyness makes me feel horrible. Brain fog is also common.\\n\\nI also have ADHD but have decided to not take meds for that, since they made my anxiety worse.\\n\\n**My med history:**\\n\\n- paroxetine (paxil) made me feel GREAT, but if I skipped even one dose, it made me crazy, aggressive and extremely self-harmful.\\n\\n- fluoxetine (prozac) made me apathetic and completely killed my libido, which made me more depressed.\\n\\n- desvenlafaxine (pristiq) made me dizzy and crazy if I missed a day. Not aggressive like the paroxetine, but extremely depressed and suicidal.\\n\\nI was wondering about bupropion or sertraline. My doctor (not a psych) had suggested bupropion but I read it might increase anxiety. Please tell me your symptoms and experiences, no need to get into detail, but I do need to have things to discuss with my psych doctor next week. It would help me a lot. Thank you so much.\", \"I just came back from my Psychiatrist and I'm completely panicked.  I've been seeing a therapist for awhile at a clinic, and she recommended seeing the resident Psychiatrist to get meds, so today I finally went.  They took my vital signs, and my blood pressure reading was super high (154/100).  They said it might just be a spike and might be nothing to worry about, but to have it checked again soon.  Before this anytime I'd get my BP checked, it was always normal to slightly high (I definitely get anxiety when at the doctor's, and I'm on birth control which I think can raise blood pressure slightly).  I didn't feel really anxious going in there until she told me the reading, then instant panic attack.  One of my biggest anxieties and sources of hypochondria is worrying that I will have a heart attack.

I was a Military Police officer and I believe that this sensation of \"being safe\" was being reinforced by being constantly armed. \\n\\nFast forward a few years, I am in school and with my then beautiful Japanese girlfriend. This is where I start feeling stressed and feeling a bit \"insecure,\" being a bit more observant... nothing \"crazy\" occurred during this time but I was eventually diagnosed with ADD. \\n\\nFast forward a bit more, now I am living in Japan, indexed as being one of the top ten safest countries in the world. Though, this is were I really start feeling \"insecure.\"\\n\\nI start seeing counselors and psychiatrists, they classify me as a type A personality and being \"hyper vigilant.\"  \\n\\nTheir would simply lead up to the conclusion that their is nothing wrong with it, so I start practicing meditation. \\n\\nBetween the time I left the US for Japan I was using ritalin and concerta. I start noticing I kept looking over my shoulder even at cafe\\'s and only felt comfortable with my back against the wall and watching the door. At some point I couldn\\'t get ritalin (banned in Japan) but I was able to get concerta (is it not the same? lol) \\n\\nAt one point I \"broke down\" in the train and just sat and rode it all the way until it stopped. In all honesty, concerta/ritalin just wasn\\'t for me. It was a filthy drug. \\n\\nEven when I was off it, I kept noticing my door, and I remember eating marijuana once back in the states. I had it with my girlfriend, it did nothing except come that night. She slept fine, but I recall waking up to a rush and felt someone was going to kill me lol. Even writing this now it gives me goosebumps. \\n\\nNow, first time smoking marijuana was in Japan (ironically) Mind you, I don\\'t really like marijuana but I am a curious person. It was a good experience since I was surrounded by Japanese (girlfriend was not there, she was back stateside at this moment) at a friends apartment. Why I am mentioning this is because while everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, yet again, I kept noticing the door and felt like at any moment the police were going to barge in.\\n\\nFast forward a bit more (after my train breakdown incident and letting go of crappy ADD meds) I recall quite often, at night being in bed with my girlfriend and watching ONCE AGAIN the door. She also starts noticing how I feel uncomfortable in public places if I don\\'t have my back against the wall. \\n\\nI am not socially declined or anything, quite the opposite if anything. I love engaging and going out, I used to avidly go to clubs, bars, and raves. My MBTI personality is ENTJ, whatever that\\'s worth. Before joining the military I was quiet though (one of the reasons as to why I joined.) \\n\\nFast forward a bit more and I am in the states now on business. I am here at my parents house now since I seem to have missed alllllll the damn family experiences between 2006 up until now. \\n\\nBut this is where shit goes haywire, instead of noticing doors I have this overwhelming sensation that someone is going to jump at me. I keep noticing windows, and my mother even asked me why so I told her, I don\\'t feel safe. \\n\\nThe other night, their was a stupendously loud thunderstorm. I didn\\'t know one was coming at night. I have not heard such a loud sound in my life up until now, I honestly thought it was an explosion. It must have literally hit the street next to my house. I jumped out of bed with my heart RACING. It was late at night, but I walked to my parents room. Mind you I am 26 lol, I sat at the edge of their bed since they too woke up, this is where I started shaking.... \\n\\nBut before that, the night before I realized, well stumbled across something that has been bothering me. I kind of discovered what\\'s wrong with me, you see I have a bad tendency to day dream to the point that It kind of bothers my lifestyle. I discovered maladaptive daydreaming. I told my fiancee that I felt ...sad, happy and relieved all at the same time : / \\n\\nI\\'m not alone lol. \\n\\nSo I had slept on that night with this in mind, I also slept on reading a few articles of the bombing of Hiroshima (g/f is from Hiroshima ironically) that night I was awaken by the loudest sound I have heard. \\n\\nAs I said, in my parents room, I sat on the bed shaking a little. It was pitch black and my mother started noticing it whilst the thunder was striking about and flashing. Then shook more, and all of a sudden started crying but I mean bawling. I honestly, don\\'t know why and where it came from. When I woke up that night, the first thought in my mind was that of my girlfriend that I love so much (Hiroshima link? Lol) \\n\\nI don\\'t know if I was crying also because I realized that up to that point that being a maladaptive dreamer I have been living a majority of my life in a fantasy. Sounds strange, but this is new to me too and I have a lot more to look into. \\n\\nBut the most overwhelming feeling that night while crying was feeling stupendously insecure, I kept looking at windows again.... my mother was holding me telling me everything was fine. My father was asking the most stupid of questions (Did something happen over there? (the middle east)) etc.... \\n\\nI am really not sure what I am trying to get at here. It\\'s past midnight and here i am typing away on a forum about this. Apparently tomorrow my mother has a psych coming to the house whom I honestly do not wish to speak to. \\n\\nBut another thing is this, my mother, mentioned how I as a child would be afraid to go into the bathroom alone and also mentioned an incident in which my cousin whom I was expecting at the door scared the shit out of me and started crying. Well what does this have to do with anything, well I was in a car accident when I was young. In that accident, the most memorable thing is the NOISE of the incident, it was fucking loud. Ever since then and up to now, I have been a poor sleeper and I would always have a source of light on in order to go to bed (probably doesn\\'t help falling to sleep) but I just felt \"safe.\" \\n\\nShe mentioned all this to me last night, now my parents seem quite worried. In all honesty, they think my recent interest and experimenting in nootropics is to blame, but I don\\'t think so... \\n\\nI do plan on mega dosing L-Theanine in the future.... : / \\n\\n\\nI also have had depression off and on, but I am totally fine now regarding that. Hmmm.... \\n\\nThe only other thing I could mention is that while writing this, I still feel like something is going to happen or someone is going to  jump at me. Whether it may be jumping through a door or is looking at me through a window.... goose bumps :(  \\n\\n\\nHonestly, what the fuck is wrong? I have a clean diet, I exercise, I have an amazing girlfriend whom I plan on spending my life with, I have an amazing family..... I can speak three languages, I am motivated, I know what I want in life.......but really what the fuck..... Is their a link to my childhood trauma? I was actually never treated for it.\\n\\nI suppose you can\\'t be perfect in life eh, just another challenge to meet.

Tonight will be my fifth dose. \\n\\nI should've started weeks ago but I've got a fear of medication (I hate not knowing what reaction I could have with substances as I have an unknown allergy that almost killed me in the past.)\\n\\nI'm posting this to both help as a coping method as well as documenting my experience for those beginning their ssris. \\n\\nI feel weird after taking it. I get very spacey and I find completing simple tasks to be impossible. I attempted to play a card game last night after taking it but my ability to solve any problems was entirely gone. I felt sick to the stomach for the first couple of days. It's the worst right when I wake up. My desire to smoke cigarettes is beginning to fade away. I usually smoked first thing after waking up. But I find myself waiting a couple of hours first. I haven't been responding to texts or calls as I have absolutely no drive to do anything right now. The past 4 days has been sitting around playing video games (or at least trying to.) But ultimately, I do not feel as depressed as I was prior. I suppose I've been lucky enough to feel the positive effects sooner than intended. There's still a knot in my throat from my anxiety. It's triggered an attack once but I got through it far quicker than usual. I'm sure that when I begin the 20 mg doses (currently on 10 to get me adjusted) I'll feel better. The side effects suck at times but I'm rrally glad I did this. For now, I'm extremely dissatached. I space out constantly. \\n\\nThis sucks. But I know it's worth it in the end. I'm taking this one day at the time, but I can slowly feel myself reaching a position I was in before I hit rock bottom, and that's wonderful. \\n\\nThank you.\", 'Hello all, 22 m here\\n\\nFor the past 4 years I have been battling allergy like symptoms of intense burning and itching on my head, as well as adult acne and low libido. The foods that do this to me has increased significantly over that time as well as environmental factor such as dust mites etc. I have tried EVERY diet and supplement and had numerous tests done all to no avail.\\nIt has been extremely stressful and I am a complete hypochondriac, I would research for hours and be constantly thinking and worrying about my worsening health for weeks and weeks. It has come to the point where I completely avoid social occasions with friends because I get really nervous and anxious about foods I\\'ll have to eat, and as a result I get stressed and everything continues to get worse. These \"allergies\" are so much worse when I\\'m stressed and my immune system just seems to be in constant overdrive.\\n\\nI never used to get emotional about this problem, but I\\'ve bottled it up for a long time and ended up getting really upset when telling my doctor about all of these problems yesterday. I\\'ve noticed my mood and general outlook on life has declined so much over these 4 years and I just think about giving up sometimes and feel really down. My mind is always racing with negative thoughts and worry, it\\'s really awful.\\n\\nMy doctor told me that he thinks that food is not causing these reactions, especially since an antihistamine made me worse, and that I suffer from anxiety and depression and has prescribed me etalopro 5mg, and increase to 10mg, so I hope that this will really help. My main fear of this medication is because my \"allergies\" are now so broad that I know that these pills will set me off, but my doctor has told me just to keep going regardless of what they do to me. Has anybody else experienced increased allergies as a result of anxiety, or noticed an improvement with medication?\\n\\n', 'Alright I more I read this subreddit, the more I feel like I might need some real help. I have to schedule a yearly doc visit anyway and I think I need to talk to them. \\n\\nHere a rant if you want to know more about my symptoms.

I live in Central Florida and if you know anything about it, its big, the public transportation sucks, and it’s full of crazy ass drivers. It’s nice to know that I am not the only one that seems to have this issue. I feel like it might help to actually spend the money on a professional driving instructor because I will be less inclined to freak the hell out in front of a stranger. Still, haven’t been able to actually get up and call one of these places and usually just make up another excuse to why I don’t.   \\n\\n--I had a job interview the other day. I cried for 3 hours before the interview and I can’t even pin out why.  I actually managed to keep my cool once I got there and I got the job.  Now my new problem is that I lose all ability if someone is watching me and turn in to a clumsy moron but I can usually keep up otherwise. Of course, then I can’t help but dwell on the fact that I just messed up something I have done perfectly freaking seconds ago.   \\n\\n--My poor boyfriend. I’ve broken down and freaked out about our relationship more than once. At this point I don’t even know what’s justified and what’s not but I am pretty sure I am once again overthinking everything and am in danger of crossing the overly attached girlfriend status which makes my anxiety even worse.  I shouldn’t worry about whether my boyfriend actually loves me or not, that fact that he puts up with my shit is proof enough.   \\n\\n**TL;DR**  \\nI am tired of stressing out my boyfriend and having him drive me everywhere and I hate always feeling like I have to puke, and that my heart is always racing. I want to be done with freaking out over regular everyday normal human crap. I am tired of feeling helpless, sleepless nights, and crying. Why do I always have to cry? It’s a never ending circle. I can’t even enjoy drinking anymore (not that it good for me anyway) as I usually break down emotionally 10x.   \\n\\nI have never been diagnosed or treated, am I a candidate for medication (what about side effects, possibly with birth control)? Are there medications that I should flat out avoid? I should try non-med therapy? I am already getting anxious about talking to the doctor, what do I say? I don’t want him to think I am just trying to get a prescription. Can a “primary care” doctor even do anything or just send me elsewhere? I will probably not have health insurance by the end of the year (fml) so I want to take action while I can afford it.  Thank you for reading all this crap. \\n', \"Hi /r/anxiety! \\n\\nAfter years of denial, I'm FINALLY addressing my anxiety issues with the doctor tomorrow. I've finally come to terms with the fact that I need meds...for whatever reason it bothers me greatly to go on meds. I've studied psychology (just graduated with a degree in it, actually) and I know anxiety can be the same thing as diabetes; both can be manageable with no medication, but sometimes meds are necessary. No idea why it bugs me, but it does.\\n\\nAnyways, I'm fat as fuck and part of my anxiety comes from that. I hate it. I'm terrified that any medication I go on will make me gain weight. Is it highly inappropriate to ask the doctor to keep that in mind when prescribing me something?   \\n\\nAny advice you can provide would be great, thanks! \", \"Hi there everyone, I'm using a throwaway account here because I like to keep my anxiety issues private. I have been a long time sufferer of mild anxiety and mild depression, but recently, my anxiety has come back and its full blown. I will be graduating, moving &amp; starting a new job very soon and my normal spunky self could not be more excited. My anxiety however, is totally taking over my positive energies. \\n\\nIn the past four years, my anxiety and depression have totally subsided and I have learned to control any mild anxiety moments I might have. But in the past four months, I've totally changed. Up to multiple times a day, I feel sick and so anxious. My stomach goes in knots, I get sweaty and light headed and I can barely move, think, or speak. As a result, my free spirited, outgoing personality that I have built up over four years is falling apart. I get debilitating anxiety just if I'm laying in bed watching a movie and a friend texts me to go to the bar. The sheer thought makes me so anxious, where in the past I would have been more than excited to meet up with friends. \\n\\nAfter trying to cope with meditation and other methods, I feel as though I would benefit from seeing a psychiatrist and receiving some short lasting medication, and was wondering how medicine has helped anyone in a similar situation to me. I know the dangers of becoming addicted to benzos etc...I just want to know how medicine has or has not helped any of you. Thank you! \", \"This has taken me a few days because I'm scared no one will respond but I'm going to finally just say it\\n\\nMy dad has been on somewhat of a downward spiral for the past 3 years. He defiantly experiences narcissistic episodes and has been diagnosed bipolar but he has always been in a difficult state of denial about it. He's also a neurologist who can teach you fascinating theories and facts for hours but he lost his doctors license due to lack of continuing certain certifications one needs every several years. He got into gambling and sort of just stopped putting effort into doing more with his career. I know it sounds bogus but he's been dealt a lot of traumatic experiences that have slowly worn him down so what's happened is slightly understandable. \\nHe was evicted 2 years ago so I let him live with my partner and I for about a year in our tiny one bedroom flat. He was clearly depressed staying with us and nothing was coming of it. I tried but it just was too much for everyone. Not to mention the amount of visible panic attacks i had triggered by the cramped space. He finally moved in with a friend of his across the country about half a year ago and now things aren't looking great over there. \\nHe claims to put out job apps for anything but rarely gets genuine responses. Last week he broke down on the phone with me asking for cash just to take the bus to a part time gig he has. He told me some weird health issues he's been having and says he's lost weight. God I just picture him nothing but bones... It's awful. My brain is filled with horrifying images of what he must look like now. \\nHe told me can't take it anymore and wants to just go hitch hike off to wherever he ends up. I'm basically the only family member that supports him financially and emotionally - I also have anxiety disorders that make the simplicities of daily life a series of drastic decisions most of the time. \\nI've grown much more disciplined in managing that obnoxious mental swill of mine but knowing someone I love is so screwed is more weight than I can handle. This has been damaging my sleep cycle the past two weeks. I can barely go 3 hours without startling awake infused with nightmares and bits of my OCD and anorexia have reared their ugly heads. I sought CBT and took meds for this particular conundrum before but honestly just want someone to talk to that gets it rather than another terrified look and unnecessary apology for my situation. My friends have all heard the story before. Their advice is confused and the therapy I've had just tells me something along the lines of letting him go and moving on with my life without helping him. It's my incredibly intelligent loving dad whom I am fully aware is mentally ill beyond his own control... How the fuck am I suppose to simply write him off? Anyways in the past when I've multitasked so many different states of anxiety-   Suicidal ideation usually kicks in. I so would like to avoid that now but unfortunately it's a bit too late. I feel like the smallest disturbance could set me off any day now. I know, it sounds really dramatic but I probably wouldn't be posting this much personal info on reddit if I wasn't worried and a bit desperate. So ok: Has something similar happened to you? \", \"I couldn't sleep last night because this was rattling around in my head. What would I do if I wasn't afraid?

Right now I'm thinking I'm being monitored by my neighbours so typing this is very embarassing, but screw it.  Every single day when I hear them come down the stairs of the building I feel like they're gonna break down the door and kill me (or at least beat me up and rob me).  I have a walking stick I have to use sometimes and I like having it near me, in case I need a weapon to defend myself.\\n \\nGoing outdoors is terrifying.  I'm better at doing it before, but it's actually getting harder and harder each time.  I have to prepare by meditating, again for longer and longer each time, and checking myself in several mirrors to make sure I'm not hallucinating that I've put clothes on and they're actually there, and my zipper is done up, and I even sometimes take photos of myself.  Then when I actually go outside I hear constant laughter, and I don't know whether that's a hallucination, or just misinterpreting real people's laughter, but it's like being paraded down the street as a huge laughing stock, and because I can never work out exactly why everybody is laughing and staring I get anxiety attacks and have to run into shops or bars to hide.  Whern walking past someone on the sidewalk I very often stumble because my legs tense up or something and get weak, and that's embarassing.  I can't urinate in public bathrooms anymore.  I used to be fine if I went in the stall but even that I can't do anymore cos I think people can see through the walls.  So I have to either be dehydrated or have a painful bladder.\\n\\nEvery single noise scares me when I'm in my apartment.  I can hear people laughing from the street outside and I'm convinced it's cos they can see inside my apartment, so I've been blocking up the windows with sheets of thick paper and making sure the curtains are fully closed, and it's pretty dark in here now but it helps a bit.  I'm constantly being observed and filmed wherever I am, which is pretty annoying. \\n\\nI've apparently been really really tense recently because I had to go to the emergency room for chest pains and tightness and uncontrollably fast breathing.  There's nothing wrong with my heart and they think it's chest muscle strain.  But every time I feel pain in my chest I get very worried it's a heart attack and I sometimes try not eating for a day or something so I have a lower chance of it, or something.\\n\\nI guess the point of this is do I need some kind of anti-anxiety medication, temporarily?  I'd rather not have more and more pills as I already take loads every day anyway, but they'd be better than drinking in the morning before I leave my apartment, which is the only thing that helps at the moment.  But my psychiatrist doesn't seem to care about it, or address it, and I've asked him directly about it.  I've never not had social anxiety to an extent, so it's a separate thing from the schizophrenia.  No anti-psychotic has ever got rid of my symptoms, just got rid of some of the anxiety from them, but I've never been good at going outside, sometimes going days without food because I run out and am too scared to buy any.\\n\\nI doubt anyone has read this far but if you have, thank you.  I needed to write this all down even if I didn't post it here, because it makes it easier somehow.  Of course I've had to type it with my wireless off so my neighbours can't access it, and then very quickly post it.  Of course they can still read my thoughts so that doesn't help much I guess.\\n\", 'I\\'m a 33 year old man who has struggled with anxiety for years. I have generalized anxiety with obsessive and focused worries. About a year ago my first serious girlfriend, and the only person I\\'ve ever loved, broke up with me. It was difficult (which is expected) and made worse by my anxiety (also expected) but I mostly dealt with it and have since gotten into a new relationship that is several months old.\\n\\nFor almost a month I have felt serious anxiety about relationships. I have felt unsure about my feelings for my new girlfriend even though I can rationally acknowledge that she\\'s a great person and that things are going well and much better than my last relationship, which definitely had its problems. I keep doubting whether I feel strongly enough to be able to fall in love with her and ultimately take the next steps (moving in together, marriage, etc.), I doubt whether I find her attractive enough, etc. Basically I have this need to \"feel sure\" about so much despite knowing that I can honestly say she\\'s a pretty and wonderful caring person who I get along well with.\\n\\nComing up against this is the fact that I still think a lot about my ex. Not in a heart-broken way exactly; I just think a lot about the relationship. I think back to fights we had, good times we had, ask myself lots of what-ifs, and imagine how she would respond to different things I think and say right now. Sometimes it\\'s just a bunch of thoughts that run around my head, other times it\\'s quite upsetting.\\n\\nMy therapist tells me that the problem is my fear over really putting myself in this new relationship and really committing myself (not commitment in the relationship sense, he means more my intentions towards her). He says this is why I keep thinking about and idealizing a past relationship that was ultimately not a very good one, and using it to convince myself that the current one isn\\'t good enough.\\n\\nI think this makes sense and I\\'m trying to work with it, but after almost a month of obsessing...I\\'m just so tired guys. I keep worrying and I keep doubting, and I think about it all the time. I try to do all the stuff I\\'m supposed to do to calm myself and change my thinking (therapy, changing self talk, mindfulness, meditation, medication, exercise, etc.). And it just doesn\\'t seem to be changing anything. I\\'m just really scared about my current relationship, though I can\\'t give a definite reason. We\\'ve been dating for four months so it\\'s still early, but there have been no \"red flags\". But I\\'m scared about taking any next steps with her. At the same time I\\'m scared of taking any actions based on my irrational thoughts. But I\\'m sure you know that even when I can identify them they aren\\'t that easy to ignore.\\n\\nI\\'m starting to ramble, sorry. I guess I just want to know if other people deal with this in new relationships and if they can offer any advice or encouragement. That goes double for anybody who has gotten therapy for Relationship-based OCD, which matches a lot of what I\\'m talking about. Thanks.\\n\\nTL;DR - I have had anxiety issues for years, and I am feeling all sorts of anxiety over a new relationship and whether I\\'m \"sure enough\" about it or it\\'s \"good enough\" despite the fact that I know it is.

Since I did that, I went about 3 days where the meds weren\\'t seeming as effective, but that has seemed typical that every two weeks around the same time I\\'d have a few days like that. Now they\\'re effective again but now I\\'m back to where the effects will fade over night and I feel okay, but I don\\'t feel \"great\" until about an hour after I take the meds.\\nAnyway, my questions is, is this change associated with the change in time of taking it and things should go back to normal or do I need to ask the doctor to up the dose from 10mg to 20mg? I\\'m weary to up the dose because I haven\\'t had any side effects at all ( other than a delayed orgasm and being hyper sexual), and I\\'m afraid that if I up the dose side effects will pop up.\\nWould appreciate anyone who can share their experience with Lexapro and SSRIs in general.

That was two hours ago and I still haven't been abke to calm down.

I do notice it\\'s much worse when im in a bar, a crowded place, being around people I don\\'t know,  or being in a car. \\n\\nThe only places I know I don\\'t see to be effected by it is at home and at the gym (I workout daily, but always with headphones on)  and that makes life super tough because I travel for work. \\n\\nThe anxiety gets so bad that I\\'ve hyperventilated by just being in a crowded hospital.  It\\'s caused me many times to have to pull over off the road because someone was driving even slightly reckless near me, if I need to speak to people I haven\\'t met in person I tend to stutter or just speak super fast, I have night terrors quite often where I wake up yelling yet I never remember what I was dreaming about. \\n\\nOnly pertinent history I have is I spent 5 years in the Marine infantry as a navy medic, and my family owns a boxing gym so I grew up boxing and since I live in a small town people always wanted to prove themselves against me no matter how much I\\'d try to back down (pretty sure this is the core root of my bar problems)  and since I\\'m a larger guy 6\\'1\" 215 lbs mostly muscle people would constantly harass me for a fight. \\n\\nAnyways all this set aside, I discussed everything with my doctor at the VA hospital here and I have an appointment to see the mental health clinic to get treated.

I have an anxiety disorder and attention problems, the difference is that i dont suffer anymore. \\n\\nOkay so anyway, this might be helpful to people that read a lot about anxiety and their causes and potential treatments or people that are just curious. I am going to list some thoughts or ideas in list format. \\n\\nNumber 1: it is COMPLETELY normal to feel anxious, but it is NEVER okay to feel overwhelmed, be aware of that. \\n\\nNumber 2: there are many potential causes for anxiety and dysfunctional behaviors and EVERYONE suffering from an 'anxiety disorder' has a ROOT cause. It could be a combination of genetic susceptibility, poor diet, lack of exercise, adrenal fatigue, nutritional deficiencies like (magnesium), very poor sleep, emotional trauma or excessive emotional stress. Chances are if you suffer from an anxiety disorder, you NEED to fix all of these areas with TIME. \\n\\nNumber 3: you will never fix an emotional problem from 8 in the morning to 8 in the night, think LONG TERM.\\n\\nNumber 4: the reality is, is if ur burned out, chances are you'll need 1 to 2 months to turn to the other side by INCORPORATING positive habits that are good for treating the disorder. \\n\\nNumber 5: a brain fog is a dangerous state to be in because you are being attacked by ur mind and you have no defenses to protect urself from self inflicted emotional harm. \\n\\nNumber 6: the reality is HORMONES are everything, balance ur hormones, balance ur life.\\n\\nNumber 7: ELIMINATE ALL refined carbs like white bread, ALL yeast, ALL high fructose corn syrup, ALL simple carbs. If you want keep eating any meat or vegetables, but moderate the fatty foods you eat like fried chicken (which is NOT as devilish as the carbs and yeast i mention above. Simple and refined carbs are PUBLIC ENEMY NO 1. \\n\\nNumber 8: the first days are very difficult after cutting sugar(carbs), you will feel dead. Take about 3 to 7 days to incorporate healthy complex carb eating, protein, and fats. \\n\\nNumber 9: Diet is CRUCIAL for anxiety issues. Eat more nuts, vegetable, and fruits.\\n\\nNumber 10: people with ADD/ADHD like me that dont take stimulant medications NEED exercise! For people with anxiety disorders this is also the case!! \\n\\nNumber 11: sleep is very important!! Buy a sleeping mask because the slightest light can inhibit HGH, an important hormone!\\n\\nNumber 12: Fast! Fasting for 24 hrs boosts HGH 2000% in men and 1300% in women. It is a crucial hormone, especially for people that are susceptible to internal damage like people with anxiety disorders. \\n\\nNumber 13: give urself some love and buy a multivitamin, magnesium supplement, fish oil supplement, and the chances are that ur digestive system is off because of constantly being in fight or flight so buy probiotic lactobacillus GG from culturelle which is a good brand. I drink 1 multi a day, 650mg Mg, 6 fish oil pills (for ADHD), and 20 billion bacteria which equates to 2 pills of probiotic. \\n\\nNumber 14: get sum vitamin D! Expose urself to the sun daily at ur discrepancy because it is reported that people are happier than people who stay indoors. If u dont have a sun, get urself some more pills to get vitamin d into ur system. \\n\\nNumber 15: shower with epsom salt. It relaxes ur body because ur body absorbs highly the magnesium found in the product. \\n\\nNumber 16: to fix ur brain, you must fix ALL addictions to become happier. Addictions highjack the dopaminergic system and decreases pleasure for regular activities like socializing and such. \\n\\nNumber 17: isolation is the key to anxiety. U can be alone, but not lonely. Happiness can only be found within, but having social interaction is crucial because we are hardwired for being in human contact. Even being in another persons presence is enough, dont hide urself inside a room. \\n\\nNumber 18: meditating for 30 minutes for 8 weeks can increase ur hypothalamus. This is crucial for people with adhd and anxiety disorders because most people with those conditions tend to have smaller than avg. this area of the brain is responsible for the important factors of LEARNING, MEMORY, and EMOTION. \\n\\nNumber 19: practice abdominal breathing exercises for at least 10 minutes a day. This helps the oxygenation of ur cells, and decreases stress hormones. \\n\\nNumber 20: never put urself in a situation that is overwhelming for u because this reinforces ur anxiety.\\n\\nNumber 21: relax the most u can. The more relaxed u are the better, but in work and school those are not the perfect places to be relaxing because ur brain needs to be making complex decisions that are for the most part absent in a relaxed, alpha wave state. Note: all genius ideas come from an alpha wave state. \\n\\nNumber 22: in small chunks, expose urself to the smallest things that u are anxious about.\\n\\nNumber 23: relaxing the muscles is crucial for people that are always on high alert. An easy way is drugs, but the best way is thru yoga, stretching, and others to relax ur muscles. TRUST ME, relax all ur muscle, it is IMPOSSIBLE to feel anxious. \\n\\nNumber 24: many people have laughter or crying deficiencies. Try laughter yoga with a group or by urself and laugh at the stupidest moments of life. \\n\\nNumber 25: hygiene is important. \\n\\nNumber 26: fix ur hair, body, and appearance to a cleaner, better looking you. \\n\\nNumber 27: everyone has root insecurities about themselves, the problem is not having them but suffering from them. How do u not suffer if u have insecurities? Self awareness of course! How do u develop that? In general, Positive habits and the original mindfulness meditation!\\n\\nNumber 28: in the end all the positive habits  form more emotional freedom within urself and that is the key to freeing urself from the belligerence of mental disorders. \\n\\nNumber 29: dont be blind by success, stay true to u and keep doing what ur doing and keep away from being blinded by others admiration. \\n\\nNumber 30: not all of these tips will apply to u and as with everything, not everything is for everyone. Apply what is suitable to u and make ur own personal program. \\n\\nHey guys im just tryn to help and i know how debilitating it is living like crap. I went from being a pile of **** to living like my own prince. This program is for LIFE, but you should see 90% improvement within 2 months in ur living conditions. There will be times where u just want to throw in the towel, but those are the times that u have to dig deep and keep pushing. Inertia is hard to move, but once u have the momentum everything becomes much easier all of the sudden. There will be times where u are doing everything right and everything goes south, thats a very bad feeling, but in the end it pays off. The worse you feel during ur recovery period, the better because in time u will feel equally, but in the positive direction. My recommendations are meditation 30 a day, aerobic exercise 30 a day, supplements listed above, restricted eating habits, sleeping better, better social connections and so on. Also i recommend at least 1 month off of EVERYTHING to fire the inertia into the right direction. After that it is much easier to keep going the momentum during school or work related occupations. \\n\\nOkay a little about me: \\n\\nWent thru worst bouts of social anxiety. Now after 2 months worth of recovery time i feel 90% better, if not 95%. I have other ideas i didnt mention, but if i did write them id write a novel. I love people, and i especially want others to succeed, especially when other people dont understand how diabolical anxiety disorders are. I want to write a book on anxiety and make a website someday about it to help millions of people suffering from anxiety disorders.\\n\\nIn the end if nothing works dont be afraid of getting medical help, even if drug therapy is a definite option. The reality is that drugs help, but they wont fix ur problems, but they set the stage for u to fix them. Being on drugs under medical supervision is potentially a very good way to incorporate and shape ur positive lifestyle. You can do it without drugs, but remember, you always have AN OPTION to get BETTER. \\n\\nLove to all\\n\\n\", \"Hi everyone. I suffered from crippling Generalized Anxiety Disorder and OCD for 5 months last year before I started talking Cymbalta. It's been about a year now on the meds, and my anxiety and obsessive thoughts have been basically null. The only strange thing that I haven't really gotten used to is feeling even and neutral most of the time. It seems like spontaneous feelings of elation and giddiness aren't as accessible as they used to be. Has anyone had this problem and do you take supplements or anything to get that happiness boost? \", \"Hey guys, I've never been/lurked in this subreddit before, so sorry if this is the wrong spot to post this but I just needed some advice.\\n\\nSo my SO is currently on the highest dosage of Cipralex (Idk what dosage that would be, I think she said 20mg? I dont remember), and has been for a year now. We've been together since November, and she's opened up to me about it in February. We haven't had sex many times, but her sex drive is pretty much non existent, and she has never orgasmed before in her entire life (in HS she felt guilty about it, and the was on AD's so she never got a chance to). Things aren't that great sex wise because her AD prevent her from feeling anything down there (we've tried oral, fingering, sex toys, etc). Now, don't get me wrong, I'm totally supportive of her being on ADs and have never pressured her to change medications or stop taking them, because sex isnt important enough for me to make her stop taking something that makes her feel normal, and good. It's just something we talked about together, and she's considered changing medications because nothing else was helping her orgasm. She has an appointment next week with her doctor so she's going to talk to the doc about switching and even lowering her dosage. \\n\\nShe's nervous of lowering her dosage though because she's scared she'll go back to the place she was in before. I asked if she feels ready to lower her dosage and she says she does, but she's scared that if she goes back to being depressed, she'll be tempted to shut everyone out because when you're depressed, even irrational thoughts seem rational (her words). \\n\\nI don't know if this is a thing but, I'm wondering if her worrying about going back to her depressive state, will make her over think things, and actually cause her to start seeing symptoms again. I realise it must be so scary to have to take that big step and start lowering your dosage because you're slowly letting go of something you've been relying on to feel normal and happy, so I don't blame her for being a little nervous. (IDK if i'm making her sound paranoid, she actually isn't, I think her level of nervous is normal).\\n\\nAnyways, I was wondering if there's anything I should do to make her feel comfortable with this; I want to do anything I can to support her. I've never been in this situation before so I don't know what the right thing to say or do is. I've told her that I will always be there for her to support her, especially if she starts feeling that way, and if I ever sense her shutting people/me out I will help her go back to her counsellor so they can give her the help she needs. \\n\\nAlso, since she's on a higher dosage of Cipralex, would she have weird effects when changing her medication to something that's a little more libido-friendly? I know you guys aren't doctors, I just want to get an idea of what to expect, and maybe pass on some info to her too. \\n\\nThanks guys :) \\n\\n\", \"So I've posted here before and thankfully have been helped out quite a bit and made an amazing recovery in a short span of 3 months from my anxiety(only took meds a handful of times ) and it was great, for that I will always be thankful to this subreddit, but today and the past three days I've been feeling these symptoms and would like an opinion:\\nNew symptoms not present before:\\n-Pain in left arm (only began today) and it went away after a few hours, has not returned\\n-the feeling of something stuck in my throat permanently \\n-my limbs go numb really fast when I sleep on them (never used to)\\n-very constipated(I get enough fiber and drink lots of water)\\n-my throat feels incredibly dry all the time even after a healthy dose of water throughout the day \\nReturning symptoms:\\n-the feeling of my heart dropping in my chest \\n-churning stomach as If I were nervous all the time\\n-shortness of breath\\n\\nLast time this happened I had a handful of EKGs done and all looked fine, I'm keeping my meds and aspirin at hand when I sleep in case of emergency but this is driving me insane, I keep having paranoid thoughts of an impending heart attack.

I thought I was having a heart attack when it turns out it was my first panic attack. Something that night (Dec. 15th 2005 - I will never forget it) stuck in my head. I thought I had a heart problem. For the next 6 to 8 months, I saw 3 cardiologists and all test both major and minor came back fine. \\n\\nFor a few years after that, I dealt with some minor panic / anxiety issues and it really did not hinder my daily life. As time progressed, I started having panic attacks everywhere. Driving, the mall, the doctors office, etc...\\n\\nStill, at this point, I was not an agoraphobic and I knew things were getting worse for I started avoiding certain things. In 2012, I went and saw my first therapist, but the lady was a moron and I quickly realized I was wasting $150 per session. In 2013, I decided to see another lady and she was great, but at that point in my life, I setup a safe zone around my house. Her old office was in this safe zone, but she moved after 4 or 5 sessions. I did manage to make it to her new office once with mild anxiety but the second time was horrible. I did stay for the full hour, but I asked her 28 times to call an ambulance for I thought I was having a serious cardiac event. Needless to stay, since I had a major panic episode there, I never went back. \\n\\nThis safe zone is still in place. It is about a 2 mile radius from my house and there is a big hospital located within the zone. \\n\\nSince that happened, I figured I would go and see a professional about medication. I found a local psychiatrist that was in my safe zone. After my first visit, he told me I was severely depressed and proscribed me paxil. I did some research on the drug and was very hesitant to take it. I did take it for 5 days when all of a sudden I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life. I never took it again.\\n\\nI went back to him about a month later and then he told me I was bi-polar. Again, I quickly realized this guy was a joke after telling me I was bi-polar after talking with me for about 10 min.....no bullshit. \\n\\nSo that was my last time looking for professional help.

At first I only used Xanax (prescribed .5 mg as needed) to control my panic attacks but I can handle those due to therapy nowadays and they are not nearly as common as they used to be. However, I have had this compulsive thought that I have obsessed over for about 3-4 years (I have been taking medication for OCD since kindergarten, same dosage, just fyi) and it is very hard to describe; I just keep thinking about how I don't get how I can move my body, like just all of a sudden I'm moving my body and I don't know how I am doing that, and then that makes me afraid that I am not going to be able to move my body or something and it just keeps on going like that. I consider myself a pretty active person, but I got into the habit of taking a Xanax (again, .5 mg) before a run because something about the repetitive nature of running makes me have those thoughts, and thus a panic attack. I run pretty frequently and have been running for awhile, and have been taking a Xanax before hand for awhile and nothing bad has happened at all, but now I am worried that this could cause problems for the future. I feel like I take the Xanax not for the prescribed effect (honestly, I can't even feel a difference in myself after I take one) but just for the mental effect of knowing that I am ok. Is there anything wrong with doing this? Should I try to back off the Xanax and talk to my doctor about getting my OCD medication upped? I don't want it to be this way forever, but I also would prefer not to have panic attacks when I go on a run. \", \"Ever since I got back from visiting my family for Christmas, this wave of anxiety and depression has hit me, so I went into recovery mode.\\n\\nI had one good day this week, as far as coping goes. Everyday I seem to end up in a tailspin of procrastination behaviors, like cleaning week-old dishes, finally vacuuming, digging up old projects I never finished, and of course retail therapy. Even getting out of the house to work on my thesis or do errands, I end up coming home much earlier than planned because I can't get focused and *stay focused*. I've spent hours staring into space or starting a bunch of things I forget to finish (just discovered a wet load of laundry in the washer from last week).\\n\\nYesterday I got my haircut (didn't wait too long to schedule it for the first time ever) and then took myself out to dinner. It didn't feel as awesome to take care of myself as usual - it just felt time consuming, and I was very anxious being in public. I still see the stylist my ex sees, but she's understanding and doesn't bring him up. the restaurant I went to is one of my favorites, but it slipped my mind that 2 of my ex's friends work there, one of which served me. She was too busy to mention him at all.\\n\\nMajor stressors right now:\\n\\n* I'm 3 weeks behind on my thesis and I have 3 weeks left to have it written and ready to submit to my readers.\\n\\n* My lease ends in 4 months and I'll have to find a new place to live.\\n\\n* My unemployment will run out in 2 months, so I have to find a job before then. I want to finish my thesis before I start applying like crazy.\\n\\n* If all goes well with my thesis, I'll be graduating with my Masters in May. And I don't know what I'm going to do next.\\n\\n* My divorce isn't final until the end of February, and he attends the same campus as me. So does his girlfriend. I'm absolutely terrified of crossing paths with him and/or her.\\n\\nUsual coping strategies:\\n\\n* yoga 2-3 times per week\\n\\n* relaxation exercises before bed\\n\\n* setting small goals for daily progress (like, get dressed upon waking)\\n\\n* adequate &amp; restful sleep\\n\\n* taking my supplements daily (not currently on medication other than BC, which lessens my mood swings)\\n\\n* planned social outings with a couple friends at a time (not spontaneous - I always know who, what, when, and where)\\n\\nSo my overall strategy is to focus on my thesis and get that done, but I've been having anxiety attacks every couple nights as I'm going to bed, and I won't get to sleep until 2 or 3am, which has created this cycle of sleeping in and then not being productive that day. I've slept better when my SO stays the night (I don't like to be alone in the house), but I can't ask him to be here every night. Maybe it will all even out once classes start up next week and I can settle into a routine, and the yoga classes at the gym will be more diverse.\\n\\nI haven't gone to therapy in a couple years because my coping methods typically work, but with the stress of divorce, job loss, and education I think it might be time to see someone. I just took a mental health screening, and it recommended that I get an evaluation for GAD and for Clinical Depression.

My son is 10 and there are a lot of things going on.  We are seeking help in the medical community, so that is covered.  I am hoping that some of you will recall what it was like to be that age and struggling.  Perhaps now you have found coping mechanisms and have thought about what your parents could have done to help more when you were a child.  \\n\\nI worry for my son because his anxiety is to a point that it fully affects his hygiene, his ability to be around others, and I am honestly concerned that he will be put into a special ed class despite being off the charts intellectually.  \\n\\nOkay, so here are a few specific things that you might be able to offer coping mechanisms for:\\n\\na) Showering and teeth brushing:  the issue seems to be that he is too afraid to go upstairs and be away from me to get the job done.  He'll attempt, but it is all 20% done.  Because of this, his teeth never seem fully brushed and his hair looks gross.  When I talk to him about it, he vaguely refers to a fear of something happening.  His current coping mechanism is reading while he does it.  However, it takes away his ability to actually get the job done.  I have caught him reading in the shower many times.  How one reads in the shower is beyond me.  He also demands the bathroom door be open (so he can get out more quickly), the shower curtain is open, and when he is done he bolts down the stairs soaking and barely covered by a towel.\\n\\nb) sleeping:  similar issue with being away from me.  I should note that I don't think it is separation anxiety so much as a mass fear of various things and my presence eases it.  Because of this he is probably constant sleep deprived.  There are periods when he has enormous bags under his eyes.  When I talk to him about it, he seems to talk of a fear of not having enough time in life, that he will die before it will all get done, therefore there is no point (he is very nihilist and either should read Nietzsche or never read Nietzsche.)  Coping mechanisms are not consistent on my part.  They are tea (he loves tea), reading (me to him), and if I really need him to sleep I will stay by him until he crashes.  I should mention that I am a single working mother and this does not always work full picture, not to mention he is 10 and needs to be able to go to sleep by himself.  \\n\\nc)friends: He has friends at school, but he cannot work up the nerve to see them outside of school.  As it is, I push him into it.  He almost always has a great time, but beforehand he will tell me his sick (he probably genuinely feels sick due to nerves.)\\n\\nd)School:  oh school.  I can do next to nothing, but I can give advise to his teachers.  I do not fully understand what is happening because I do not see it.  He has instigated fights (never threw the first punch), been bullied, he worries about how he looks (but won't take the time to fix it), his own disorganization stresses him.  He keeps losing the agenda folder his teachers give him.  All papers come back a crumpled mess.  I do not understand why a child so stressed about all these things wouldn't want them all in place.  No coping mechanisms for school. We cycle, so we will have months where I hear from the teacher, principal, or someone else at least once a week to nothing for months.  \\n\\ne) electronics: damn those electronics.  I like games.  I do.  I keep feeling tempted to take them away entirely because it leads to more meltdowns than anything else.  He gets worked up and when it all falls apart, he does too.  For me, tetris is a stressful game.  You are on a time limit, things are falling and no matter what you do... you will fail.  So I don't play it.  It seems like that with every game for him.  \\n\\nI was going to bring up more, but I feel like I've already written a short novel.   I will say what he likes in hopes it helps though.  He loves reading.  It is his escapism.  I can't keep up with it on our budget, but luckily he is fine with re-reading.  His favorite book is Enders Game, but he usually reads things below his level to stay cool with his friends (I don't mind this, but I would like to him to do both).  He is also into comics as of late, but of course picked Nova which is more obscure, therefore harder to find cheap.  He likes chess.  He is starting skateboarding, but won't enter the skatepark for fear of being laughed at.  Board games (good ones), legos, architecture, engineering, all things NASA, math.. the kid rocks at math.  I don't know, I think at this point I'm throwing what I can out there.  \\n\\nHopefully at least one person reads all this. Thank you for at least listening.  I want to do what I can, but I am on my own and sometimes (more often than I'd like) it frustrates me.  I get angry that he won't shower.  I get angry that he can't be more than 5 ft away from me without freaking out.  And I love him.\", \"So I just started taking generic zoloft a few days ago to treat my anxiety. I'm on my fourth day.

I would cry at the drop of a dime, for nothing in particular. I was so sad that my old self, my calm and collected self, was no longer. I was mourning myself. A few weeks passed, a few more trips to the ER, and after some blood tests, they told me I was anxious, but they also found out that I had low thyroid hormone, and that I was Hypothyroid. They prescribed me synthroid, and it put my mind at ease, knowing that finally, these meds will help this awful feeling go away. Well, they didn\\'t. \\nIt\\'s been about 3 years now since my first brush with anxiety, and I am quite a different person. The initial overwhelming \"i\\'m going crazy\" feeling slowly passed, but this general uneasiness stayed. Presently, this uneasiness appears when there is change in my life, or something with my health comes up. For example, last year, I moved out of my parents\\' house, and with the change of lifestyle and scenery, and the loss of my \"comfort zone\", I was gripped with pretty bad anxiety, and this \"uneasy\" feeling. This uneasiness I feel is kind of like this feeling of being mentally uncomfortable in my environment. I just recently had to move back in with my mom for a month, and tonight, at dinner, just the lighting, the kitchen table, the kitchen, it all just made me feel uneasy, kinda worried for no reason, and kinda nauseous. I also get really anxious before I travel, because my \"comfort zone\" is far away.\\nMy current state is as follows;\\n-I feel anxious (uneasy) with change of environment\\n-I feel anxious when I think about my health, death, and the future.\\n-I feel anxious with commitment (my new girlfriend)\\n-My depression has taken a new form. What used to be crippling sadness, has been replaced with apathy, lethargy, lack of emotion, extreme low libido (I hardly even get erections because my libido is low). So basically, I don\\'t feel many emotions, and I don\\'t really ever get horny.\\nI started taking a natural thyroid hormone, hoping that it would cure my apathy and low libido, but it hasn\\'t really done anything. The dr. tested my testosterone, and I actually score pretty high in that. \\n\\nSo now, I don\\'t know what to do. My sex drive is dead, my emotions are dead, I feel anxious when im in unfamiliar environments. I also really don\\'t want to go on any SSRI\\'s or anti-anxiety meds.\\n\\nHelp?', 'SO... I need to get a few things off my chest. Because I don\\'t feel like I can speak to anyone anymore. \\nI have anxiety. A lot of it. \\n\\nEveryday feels like a struggle, and nights are even worse. at night time, sometimes my throat feels like it starts closing up, that i cant breathe properly, then i start getting chest pains and my arms go weak. i become dizzy and then my neck back and head start to to get sharp pains. I know that these are all symptom of anxiety, and rationally I know its the most likely cause of my physical symptoms, but I sometimes worry that I\\'m assuming too much, which then causes more anxiety. as soon as anything happens during the day that is remotely emotional... bam. anxiety. if i hear on the news about some horrible accident = anxiety. the list is endless. \\n\\nI dont feel like I can talk to anyone anymore about my problems. My mum is tired of hearing my complaints, my brother thinks its simple \"oh why dont you just stop thinking that\". GRR. I even feel like I dont have the support of my boyfriend anymore. Even though he hangs around and says he loves me, I dont feel like I can tell him anything that goes through my head, because he\\'ll get tired of it and leave me. \\n\\nI see a psychologist and a psychiatrist, but thanks to the government saying that \\'nobody uses 10 psychology sessions per year\\' I cannot claim anymore from medicare. I am a student and dont have much money, so now my psychology sessions are only when i can afford them. my psychologist has been super nice and lowered her price for me, because she feels I need the sessions. I go to get remedial massages, I try to drink 8 glasses of water daily, I try to do a little bit of exercise (even though this in itself is anxiety provoking, because my heart starts to race and I cant breathe so I think that something is wrong), I do calm breathing exercises, I\\'ve tried meditation, but they seem to make me feel even worse, I take rescue remedy drops, I cover myself in lavender and rose essential oils, I dont drink caffine (no coffee, tea, chocolate etc). I feel like I\\'ve tried everything. Except medication. \\n\\nI could keep ranting, but I\\'ll be lucky if any of you have even made it this far through haha. I know I whinge, but I feel helpless and I dont know what else I can do. \\n\\nI welcome comments, just to know I\\'m not alone here. \\n', 'Has anyone noticed a decrease in anxiety or depression after taking them?  \\nIt could just be a placebo effect because I have some strange idea I have something going on in my brain and this has reduced inflammation in that area. Not based on science or evidence at all.  \\n\\nAnyway is that unheard of, reduced anxiety due to taking anti inflamm meds?', \"Hi all,\\nThrowaway here as I need some advice but don't want to be recognised due to confidentiality. I work for a charity as a volunteer recruiter. My job generally involves receiving applications from potential volunteers, then organising and undergoing interviews and introducing them into the company. We work on an equal opportunities policy and many people who have chosen to volunteer in the past have had difficulties with disabilities or illness. As such I am very welcoming to people who express that they have had or currently have issues which are preventing them from finding paid work - for example, I have had volunteers in the past with mobility issues, learning difficulties, autism, blind, deaf etc.\\nLast week I was contacted by an NHS vocational worker on behalf of somebody who would like to volunteer for us. Due to her job's need for confidentiality she did not divulge any information on his condition to me, however the fact that there was an NHS worker involved alerted me that this person probably had some sort of disability. No problem, he can come in for an interview. At the interview, the man was very quiet, a little odd perhaps but isn't everyone? I asked if he had any medical issues I should be aware of and he told me that he had suffered from mental illness a few years ago and had had to go into a psychiatric hospital. He said that he was on medication now and desperately wanted to reintegrate into society. I assumed that this was something like depression, and so was very friendly and told him that everyone deserves a second chance and we do our best to accommodate volunteers regardless of their needs.\\nThe interview went well; before he had become ill he had worked in a skilled profession which would perfectly compliment the voluntary position we were trying to fill. After he completed all the required paperword, I thanked him and the NHS worker, shook their hands, and saw them on their way. I told them that I would be in touch soon to organise his induction and his first day for the charity. A little later in the day, I googled his name. I do this with all our new recruits, out of curiosity if nothing else, and generally just have a look at their social media presence (we once had a volunteer with our vulnerable elderly residents who turned out to have a very controversial twitter account, and so I always have a look online in case there are any alarm bells). The first result that came up when I entered his name was a local news article from 2007. It was accompanied by a photo of him, so I am 100% sure this article was about him. It said that in 2007 when he was 33, he had suffered a paranoid schizophrenic episode, and stabbed his 24 year old wife 27 times in front of their two year old son. She had been in the process of moving out because of his possessive and controlling behaviour, and he murdered her. He was sentenced indefinitely for manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and remanded in a secure mental hospital.\\nThis hit me like a tonne of bricks. I started shaking like a leaf and although its now the next morning, I'm feeling really ill and anxious and panicky. I genuinely don't know what to do; in my personal life if I found that somebody was even remotely domestically abusive then I would distance myself immediately and have nothing to do with them. I had no clue of this man's past, neither he nor the NHS worker told me any of this. I really do not want anything to do with this man. I don't want him to be part of my charity, I don't want to speak to him or interact with him, I genuinely do not feel safe around anybody who has committed such a crime regardless of their diminished responsibility. I have had my own mental health problems in the past, and know many other people with their demons, and I know how horrible it is to be stigmatised because of something you can't control. But where is the line? If I let this person volunteer with us I feel like I am accepting and forgiving his behaviour. His wife is still dead, and his child is almost certainly traumatised or damaged by having witnessed it.\\nI don't want to stigmatise somebody with a mental illness. But I really don't want to let this man into my workplace. I want nothing to do with him. I do not want to come into contact with him, speak to him, spend time with him. But if he is to volunteer with us, I will be his direct manager. I will be responsible for him. I will have to interact with him. And I really feel legitimately scared - even if he is now on medication and has his illness under control, I still feel that somebody who has committed such a severe crime is a danger to me and to other women.\\nOn top of this, I had no idea when I interviewed him, and I offered him the position. HR has told me that due to equal opportunities we are bound to take him on as a volunteer. Our charity supports the elderly, and the head office is on an estate where we have almost 100 retired people living on site. The position he has applied for is not directly involving the residents, and so in line with our current policy, I told him we would not need to do a criminal records check.\\nI'm a complete mess over this. I haven't got work again until Monday morning, and it's Friday morning now, but I feel like this is making my own mental health problems increase significantly. I barely slept all last night, I haven't eaten (which is bizarre as I am usually a comfort eater) and I feel sick. I'm shaking, anxious and afraid to leave the house. It's triggered all this shit inside of me and I'm scared that my own anxiety will affect my ability to do the rest of my work. On top of all this, last night we had a large corporate event to raise money for the charity, and I spilled my heart out to a couple of colleagues who I trust, but I'm worried that I was unprofessional to do so and I don't want to get in trouble at work.\\nThis is so long, and I'm sorry if it doesn't make much sense but I genuinely don't know what to do, or if there is anything I can do. I don't know if anybody can give me any advice or comfort but I could really use it.\", \"So I had an appointment with an actual doctor today. He has recommend I go on medication. However he recommended I wait and make a decision in a few weeks. This is also so he can closely monitor me, since the school health center is closed until the 8th.\\n\\nThe two medications of choice are Lexapro or Celexa. Was curious what everyone's experiences was with both. What did you like?What did you not like?  \", 'Hello,\\n\\nBefore I met my girlfriend I had such bad insomnia. I\\'d get such little sleep most nights and my life just felt like a blur. After panic attacks when I was a kid and the stress my parents caused me I\\'d cry so many days through middle school and high school. I never felt as \"alive\" as I wanted, just that everything I did was an automatic response.. And my mind would race always, I\\'d never have a moment of like relaxation. My heart always beat so fast and I constantly felt like I was wasting time or I felt nervous. But when I met my girlfriend. I could finally be myself. I slept so soundly. I felt alive, I appreciated so much more in life. I made all the improvements I wanted and moved past my self image problems and anxiety. I felt so deeply in love and happiness. I looked forward to every day.\\n\\nNow that I\\'m in college, and we go to different schools... It\\'s all just come back, all of those problems. And I feel like a robot sometimes, or in a haze, and I\\'m just not myself. I love her immensely and I can\\'t ever lose her. I want to be a good boyfriend and never mean or an ass but my emotions just make me someone I\\'m not and I\\'m trying to get a better hold of them. \\n\\nI had tried marijuana awhile before, in high school, without her knowing... I thought she\\'d think I was cool (I was a naive teenager) but she was so heartbroken when she found out. After I did it once, I felt really great about my life. And not just during the high, after too. It was such a mind opening experience. I realized after getting high a few weeks later, through some introspection that I needed to stop. I had talks with her about it while I was doing to see if she\\'d think it would be okay. She was sort of negative towards it but I just listened to myself, she had to be okay with it! So, I did it anyway, \"how could she and so many people have such a negative opinion of something so good?\". \\n\\nI felt like marijuana clicked with my brain more than most, I was so ecstatic, it felt amazing, unreal. It was almost a religious experience. What?? I thought stoners were just like loser skateboarder/video game playing teenagers who did badly in school. I felt like I had finally reached my potential. The couch locking mind numbing effects? None of that.. My mind was alive. I later found out this was a \"sativa\" strain, which are very stimulating.\\n\\nWow, I never knew about any of this. I always wanted to try marijuana, but I never wanted to do it often. I have read so many positive things about it, so I decided to try it. I knew the risk of addiction was relatively low and it was more of a habitual/dependency thing (which I guess is a lot like addiction). But I have good self control, I could go without anything I think.\\n\\nBut now for the one thing I can\\'t go without. My girlfriend. We had never had a single problem, argument, conflict, ANYTHING besides about marijuana. She just had very strong opinions against it, and I really made a huge mistake there, hiding something from her. There\\'s nothing else I\\'d hide from her, I love her with all my soul. When I went off to college I felt depressed, anxious, almost suicidal. My grades weren\\'t the best. I didn\\'t have many friends, I didn\\'t like what people did on weekends. I got stressed out when my girlfriend went out on weekends, and I wasn\\'t being as good to her as what she deserves. My girlfriend suggested I see the counsellor. I did, and I realized I just have to help myself, but that she (the counsellor) would help me accomplish that.  We made some progress, but after the happy talks I always felt sad a day later. After a month of meetings, my counsellor said I don\\'t seem like I need to meet regularly anymore, and that I was welcome to come back whenever.\\n\\nNow, I knew people who go on medication for anxiety+derealization/depersonalization+depression but I feel that I hear so much about those medications leaving the taker unfulfilled, with a void in their life. That there are side effects of derealization, depression, suicide, emotional numbing. I\\'m very emotional and I don\\'t know if that\\'s always a bad thing, I would only want my anxiety and sadness to change. People who use hard drugs to cope with problems never turn out well. And alcohol and tobacco can lead to a lot of mistakes and regrets. \\n\\nMy girlfriend kind of brought up, \"well if you want to try marijuana again, and be honest about it, that would be okay.\" She is so amazing and understanding. I had vowed to never try marijuana again, I loved it but I\\'d take my girlfriend over it any day. I thought maybe her idea could work, and now that I don\\'t have to hide it from her we won\\'t have any problems.\\n\\nWell, I tried it again (a different type of it) and it wasn\\'t the same mind blowing experience, but it completely lifted my depression off, and threw away my anxious thoughts. The problem was she was really upset before and after I did it again. And the next few days were great, well.. after the first few hours where she was sort of down about the whole thing. I was never a mean person again, our relationship got along very well, we opened up to each other more and have more intimate talks over long distance. The next weekend rolls around and I figured \"well she\\'s going out with her friends, I\\'ll see if it\\'s okay with her if I try it again.\" And it upset her that I brought it up, and we talked for a long time with her being distant, and she said \"it\\'s okay just do it I don\\'t want you to be sad.\" And over the week she kept telling me \"it\\'s okay, you can do it, it\\'s you not me\" and I know that she\\'s just saying that, but deep down it upsets her. And I definitely can\\'t allow myself to continue doing it if it upsets her, I just don\\'t want it to upset her.\\n\\nWe\\'ve been together for a year, and have a better relationship than anyone we know. We talk about marriage and making it through college together all the time. She\\'s going to try to transfer to my school next year. All of our other friends long distance college relationships have failed but ours. Now, I just don\\'t want to sound like a stoner or loser. I am really on the right path, since I lifted my depression, I rose an F in chemistry to a B+, got A\\'s on my engineering assignments, calculus assignments, English papers. I worked 14 hours on homework on a Saturday! And I did pretty much 12 hours of work every 5 days for the next few weeks. I made 10$/hr online, I gained almost 10lbs of muscle from working out, I finally lifted more than I did when I played football in high school. I made new friends. I had a big appetite for the first time in my life. This was my big rebound from where I was. I rarely had even spent 2 hours on homework in a night of high school, or ever studied for a test, and I was an A student taking AP classes with a high SAT score! I now do a weeks worth of high school homework/studying in a night, if not more. But I liked it! My friends who were off at different and sometimes more prestigious colleges than me tell me they party on weekdays and never do homework. Their parents are so wealthy, millionaires, and they\\'re expected to do the same with success? No way, the generation of hard working parents has led to lazy and unmotivated children. So now I see myself, a once passive good student, now doing better and working way harder than all my friends. It feels great, and me and my girlfriend are working so hard in our classes so that we have a great life ahead of us.\\n\\nI know marijuana isn\\'t this cure-all magic drug. But it\\'s helped me. And it still upsets my girlfriend whenever we talk about it or I say I want to do it. I tell her every time she\\'s upset I will quit and never do it again, but she doesn\\'t want me to go back to being sad. I know in the end that I have to just help myself, but this has helped me do that and whenever I show her the literature on it or explain how much better I\\'ve been doing she gets upset. Every other moment we\\'re not on the topic, life and our relationship is amazing, perfect, but it\\'s on both of our minds all the time now. Is there any way I can make her comfortable with this or find some compromise? Or am I just a druggie and need to drop this little habit and help myself? I want to know what to do, because all of my options just seem like they will cause a lot of conflict. \\n\\nThank you so much for reading. I know this doesn\\'t take the place of a therapist or actual counsellor but it would be nice to hear some opinions.', 'Hey guys,\\n\\n I posted here a few weeks ago about my new struggles with anxiety. I knew it was anxiety because both of my parents struggled with it when they were my age and had told me about it. I was having panic attacks at school. Well, I\\'ve turned the corner. The first few days at school (college) after my panic attack I spent all day doing my best to fight off new panic attacks (which meant I couldn\\'t talk to people and basically used all of my energy to fight the panic). The real turning point was a day when I had a bunch of tests on the same day. I\\'m good at tests (always have been),  and they focused me because I had less time to sit quietly and think. Because I was so busy, I literally forgot about my anxiety problems and just did my work. After that, I said to myself \"Well, you got through a whole day without any anxiety, so you should be fine today.\" Now, whenever I start to feel panic set in, I say to myself \"no, that doesn\\'t happen anymore.\" I know many of you here have much more serious anxiety problems than I did, but when I was at my worst, I thought this was the new normal for me. I thought I would forever struggle with anxiety and that I would never be a \"normal\" person ever again. Here I am, no anxiety, no panic attacks, no medication, just a normal dude. It can and does get better overnight if you don\\'t let it control you. ', \"I finally mustered up the courage to make it to the psychiatrist the other day. She was a nice sweet lady, but I'm the type of person that always remembers to ask the questions days after the appointment as apposed to when she asked me the other day. So I'm hoping some one here can help.\\n\\nIt's my first time being prescribed any sort of medication so I'm a bit skeptical/worried on what to expect.\\n\\n1. Lexapro (10mg) - so far I've noticed that is just makes me sleepy and very nauseous. It's only been a few days though and I know it takes a while for these to work. What should I do if I forget to take it one day? Take two? Or just skip it? And should I be feeling nauseous/sleepy? \\n\\n2. Ativan/Lorazepam (0.5mg) - with these, I feel like they don't do anything. I'll take one before I go out into a situation where I know I'll be anxious, but I'm still anxious. She said these were supposed to be the fast acting ones, but not much has changed. Is this normal? I was looking forward to these for temporary relief till the other ones began working, but now that they're not I'm still just very uncomfortable.\\n\\nThis was the first psychiatrist that I have ever been to and I'm not really sure how soon to follow up with her. Or what are things that I should let her know right away?\\n\\n\", \"Hey r/Anxiety.\\n\\nAs you may have guessed, I've had some sort of anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember (10+ years), have been in unsuccessful on and off counselling, tried Prozac, Zoloeft, Cipralim, all to no effect. They literally could have been placebos for all the good they did.\\n\\nOn Monday I worked up the guts to go to a doctor, had in a letter I'd written (physically am unable to speak in certain situations) and just walked out with a new prescription. I did some reading online and as it turns out I've been given another SSRI. I'm developing the belief that SSRIs don't work on me. I will still take it though, because I don't see what harm it could do...\\n\\nExcept of course if it has bad interactions with other drugs I use off-label. Mostly illegal stuff that I wouldn't dare tell my doctor about. I've asked people in r/drugs and similar places who assured me I'm gonna be okay, but still.\\n\\nTo clarify, this ain't a case of 'oh I feel like shit for a few weeks'. It's a case of 'If I had the willpower and guts, I would end my own life right now if it wouldn't upset my mother'. That's how we're talking. And the anxiety is debilitating. I have a job but struggle immensely to get through each and every day, and definitely cannot hide any of this from anyone. Wouldn't be too surprised if I had other mental disorders that were never diagnosed  too.\\n\\nSo. Anyone have any notable experiences of Paxil? Especially coming from people who don't find other SSRIs useful? Or is it just a fact that meds can only do so much when my head is full of screwed-up thinking that can't even be changed by understanding logic?\", 'I am diagnosed with Bipolar II which really only manifests itself in me as pretty bad depression. Occasionally, I will feel kind of euphoric (but still completely rational) which is what they call hypo-mania. About two weeks ago, I was perfectly fine. I went for a walk with my husband after a productive day and amazing dinner with the family. We got back home and sat down to watch Game of Thrones. At one point, there was an overabundance of nudity. Now, I have put on a lot of weight since being depressed and am no where near as attractive as them. I instantly felt depressed and shut down. It was like a light switch. I spent the next week not really communicating, interacting, and crying fits on and off. I had a constant burning in my stomach and tightness in my chest. I instantly felt jealous and completely worthless at the sight of any woman. The thought of my husband looking at porn or naked women sent me into panic attacks with huge 1 hour long crying spells. Things intensified over the next two weeks. Nothing would help, except when I had sex with my husband... somehow that would make it better for a little while. I also had some pretty severe insomnia. \\n\\nThings came to a head this past Friday. I woke up just fine. My husband took the day off of work and we were going to watch a movie while our daughter was in school. I started feeling bad right before we left and it progressively worsened. It is like a sinking feeling in my stomach, that turns into a burning, that feels like I can\\'t breath, then the tears start and I feel physical pain. Over the next couple of hours, it got worse and worse. By this point, after 11 days of pure depression and cycling anxiety and panic attacks, I was feeling desperate. I began to fixate on the thought of inflicting pain on myself to release some of the emotional pain (which I haven\\'t done in 15+ years. I was also wishing I could just go to sleep forever so I wouldn\\'t have to feel this way any more. I asked my husband to go to the hospital because I just couldn\\'t take it. I was place on a 5150 (psych hold) over night. It was terrible. I had a panic attack that lasted for the rest of the day, into the night, and until 11am the next day. They gave me ativan which knocked me out for a couple of hours, but everytime I woke up I would be sobbing and not stop until I was knocked out again. I was allowed to go home Saturday afternoon. The psych on call said he didn\\'t think I would benefit from being admitted, nor was I \"bad enough.\" He recommended a partial hospitalization... basically treatment M-F from 9am to 3pm or so and then you go home. It is 3-6 weeks. You see a psych once each week, and a therapist 3 times each week. I felt I desperately needed this. \\n\\nI should also mention that I can\\'t see my psych until June 8th and that the meds she suggested I adjust over the phone haven\\'t been working. Also, I see a therapist each week, but today will only be my second appointment (I only started to see her once things got bad... shit move on my part, I know) so I don\\'t know how much help that will be.\\n\\nHowever, the last day and a half I am better. I still have a low burning in my stomach, but it occasionally goes away. I haven\\'t had a crying fit in about 3 days. I still have insomnia pretty bad though. However, I\\'m still depressed. Not quite so severe, but I just spend a lot of time in bed. \\n\\nAlso, because of how it provided me release, I am kind of addicted to sex now. I obsess over it. I am masturbating a ton. It\\'s bad, I know. It just works better than all my pills. I have never been diagnosed with anxiety before, but I have brought it up to my psych. A bunch. And the one before her. I get some bad anxiety, but it has never been *crippeling.* It has affected my day to day life, but has never been like this. My doctors just keep writing the anxiety off as a part of the depression associated with bipolar. However, I am now CERTAIN that I have a separate issue along side the bipolar that MUST be addressed. \\n\\nOkay, so now after my ginormous wall of text with my life history, my question is, since I\\'m feeling a bit better, should I not go through with that intensive therapy? It seems like it might be overkill now, but somehow the weekly therapy and monthly psych visits don\\'t feel like they will be enough. Additionally, ever since Friday, my husband has been seriously babysitting me and staying home from work. Which I am grateful for, but I feel guilty. Especially since I am a bit better. Maybe his constant presence is what makes it better? I don\\'t know. I also feel like I\\'m just cried out from Friday/Saturday. Emotionally exhausted, if you will. \\n\\nWhat do you think? I\\'m assuming/hoping many of you will have much more experience and may be able to make a suggestion?', \"I’m really hesitant to type all of this, but I’ve been wondering for a while.  I’ll try to be as brief as possible.\\n\\nI’ve come to realize that I have a crippling fear of rejection.  It doesn’t matter by who or what, it gets in the way and makes me lose all ambition to do things.  I don't want to do anything but sleep.  I’ve started to realize this because 9 times out of 10 my weekends are spent sitting at my house by myself. I start by watching Netflix or playing PlayStation but eventually I wind up staring at the wall/ceiling depressed because I want to be out doing something with someone or anyone.  But I’m not.\\n\\nI have a circle of friends.  I could probably find myself out on the town or at a bar with at least one of them with a few text messages.  But I can’t bring myself to contact anyone because I’m afraid they’ll say no.   It doesn’t matter who it is.  For example, I have two particular friends that I don’t see very often, but when we do wind up seeing each other to work during the day we always make plans to go out that night.  They tell me they want to see me more and they’re a call or text away but *I can’t bring myself to ask them because I’m afraid they’ll say no.*  \\n\\nI’ve grown to hate weekends because they're always the same thing.  On Friday nights I hope I get to do something with roommates, roommates inevitably leave to go do their own things without me without asking if I want to come along (or there's reasons I don't want to go, like having to third wheel), and I’m left alone in my solitude to wish I was with other people.\\n\\nIs this a thing I should go talk to someone about?  Should I seek out medical attention and maybe medication?  It’s been happening off and on for about a year now, but more on than off lately.  I have a great job, I'm making money, and all things considered I don't really have reasons to be unhappy and afraid all the time. But I’m really tired of it.  And I'm afraid of what could happen if I try to fix it. :/\\n\", \"Recently I've had a major financial upheaval: it seems like all the certainty in my life has just gone away in one big explosion. I can count on nothing. Since then, I have completely lost control of my anxiety. I cry all the time. I want to cry now, but I've got to get it together for what little bit of work I'm able to do. Every cent counts.\\n\\nI've been taking more Klonopin than I'm supposed to--sometimes double. Sometimes in the morning (not my usual). I have 2mg a day prescribed, but lately that's become 2.5, then 3, and sometimes 4. A couple of times, it became 2 and a spare Norco I had lying around (prescribed at one point). I understand this is exactly how drug addictions start. And I know I'm physically dependent on Klonopin. I want to stop, but more than I want to stop taking the medicine, I want the ANXIETY to stop. It is running rampant. It feels like I have Restless Leg throughout my entire body. Actually, it feels a lot like Klonopin withdrawal! I have no idea why! I am irritable as hell, unable to tolerate the least bit of difficulty, screaming at inanimate objects...\\n\\nI see my therapist tomorrow and my psychiatrist Friday, thank God. In the meantime, I don't know what to do. I'm not having panic attacks. I don't feel impending doom or death. I'm not hyperventilating. I'm just struggling so much to hold in the crying. \\n\\nDoes anyone else know what the hell is happening to me? I'm miserable, especially physically, and it just won't stop.\", \"I've dealt with major anxiety and depression for most of my life (38 years old).  I've lost two jobs due to depression, and my anxiety is the reason that my internship didn't turn into a job.  I was first diagnosed and put on medication a little over 10 years ago, but I haven't been medicated for approximately 3 years due to lack of health insurance.  I signed up for insurance through my county at the beginning of the year, and was finally able to get an appointment with a new doctor (after going through the circle of calling my old doctor, finding out that they're not covered under the new plan, finding a new doctor, being put on hold, finding out that they're not taking new patients, finding a doctor that takes my insurance *and* is taking new patients, waiting for the new insurance card...).\\n\\nMy first appointment with the new doctor is tomorrow.  It's 5pm, and I've only gotten out of bed to use the restroom and eat something around noon.  I've slept on an off throughout the day (it's my coping mechanism).  I wasn't able to fight through it over the past few weeks to have my records sent from old doc to new one, and now I'm worried that the new doc won't trust me when I tell her what meds to put me on (because I already know what works and what doesn't).\", \"I've been working very hard to find reliable online work to support traveling. I've been scraping by on a grab bag of things, usually working at less than minimum wage, when I finally heard back from a reputable company for a contract position that pays quite well. I had to do some training and pass some tests. It was surprisingly difficult and I was absolutely convinced I wouldn't make it, but I made myself put in the time and I barely squeaked in. I was over the moon.\\n\\nBut now that I have the job I'm weighed down by the idea that I'm doing poorly and will be let go any day now. I dread working so much, I've gotten better, my numbers are okay and it's not as hard anymore; yet, I can't shake that feeling of dread and worthlessness.  I put it off and put it off. I've been getting by working in small chunks (I try for 30 minutes, but sometimes I have to break after as little as 5) but I'm barely hitting the minimum hours required, and I'm scared I won't even manage that this week.\\n\\nAnd it seems like it's not just work anymore. I spend the whole day with guilt, sleeping more, avoiding and my mood is dropping lower and lower. Completely unrelated goals are starting to seem unreachable. I just feel like I'm sinking into a sand trap and it's getting harder to get through every day.\\n\\nI've never taken medication for my anxiety before (just therapy for coping mechanisms, it was very helpful overall) but I'm really considering making an appointment for that purpose, because I think my fear of losing this job may just turn into a self-fulfilling prophesy soon. Losing the income would put me in a really tough spot right now. I don't know what to do.\", \"I've been taking Lexapro for 2.5 weeks now and my life is a complete 180 to what it was from when I started.

It just sucks.\\n\\nAnyway. Just wanted to complain for a bit. Thanks for listening.\", 'TLDR at bottom\\nI(26F) just found this sub-reddit. I really want to get some stuff of my chest that I\\'ve been dealing with for a long time. I\\'m sorry its long, I just need to vent. I dont know if you guys post trigger warnings in this sub-reddit, but I know if I was reading this as an outsider I\\'d want a warning. I dont want anyone to have a panic attack from reading this.\\n\\nHere goes. I\\'ve had anxiety attacks/anxiety in general since I was a little girl.  When I got into highschool it got worse. A panic attack once a week.  I would go into my parents room crying..Freaking out over something. My parents..didnt really completely understand what was going on and quite frankly after 15 years it was wearing on them. They\\'d sleepily tell me to go back to bed or unintentionally snap at me( which made the attacks worse because I would freak out over upsetting them). \\nMy parents at this point took me to the doctors. I was prescribed Zoloft . I should mention I have ADD and was taking medication for that as well. The zoloft made the attacks less frequent, but the attacks themselves much stronger.. (At least thats how it seemed to me). It may have also caused me to have depression..\\n\\nI met my husband when I was college and things started to get a little better then. He learned very early on that my anxiety was serious issue (he tried to \"scare\" me out of a panic attack once..It didn\\'t end well on his part) and began research/ trying his best to help me during my attacks. Once we were married, the attacks started getting so strong that I would pass out.\\n\\nWe figured out that I needed a routine. My attacks usually happened at night, so he would make me tea/ice cream, get me into pjs, and put on a tv show that i liked. We thought we were doing good.. We even got it to where I only had a panic attack once a month. \\n\\nAnd then we moved. My DH worked from home barely making anything because the city we moved to is expensive. I got a job with a HORRIBLE BOSS. We found out I have poly cycstic ovarian syndrome and was told the chance of me having children was slim to none. It was an awful year. I finally agreed to see a therapist to help me through my anxiety. It was a failure. The therapist basically told me to do what I was already doing. No other advice than \"It sounds like you\\'ve already got this down. Keep it up\". \\n\\nOnce DH got a better job and were doing better financially, I decided that I was sick of taking my meds. So I did the stupid thing and went cold turkey on both of them; at the same time. Once I got over the withdrawals everything was wonderful! It was rare that I had a full blown panic attack and I was able to calm down when I was anxious.  We actually got pregnant and out of the entire pregnancy I only had ONE full blown panic attack. We now have a wonderful little girl..(I also got \"laid off\" from the awful job at 4 months pregnant..Which I was totally happy with) \\n\\nPost Partum was when things started to get rough again. I guess I had PPD (post-partim depression) but I was one of those moms that didn\\'t bond completely with LO in the beginning (there were a couple of health issues). We eventually did bond and then I became a typical first time parent.. Checking randomly through the night to make sure she breathing. Calling her doctor on every little thing. (Heck I still will have my husband go check to see if shes breathing and shes 13months). \\n\\nThe thing is when LO was about 6months was when I had my first full blown panic attack in almost a year. It was a bad bad bad one. Chest tightening, making no sense, nothing could calm me down until I basically passed out. It was not a good time and family drama ensued because of it. (thats another issue for another day).\\n\\n(TRIGGER WARNING!!!!!TRIGGER WARNING! TRIGGER WARNING!)\\n\\nFast forward to  fall last year. I started getting these headaches. I had also started running and trying to get into shape. This also was around the time when Brittany Maynard came out saying she had a brain tumor and that she was going to end her life. I had read an article about how the pain first started as headaches. I immediately went to talk my doctor who said they were just flash headaches. ( I was dehydrated a lot and that can cause small headaches .. Which i had at the time) In march I began experiencing other symptoms. And then fast forward this last week. My headaches have gotten worse and I go see my doctor. She wants me to go get an MRI on my head and neck. I immediately go into panic mode. Thinking about Brittany Maynard and freaking out that I have a tumor. \\n\\nThe funniest part is that my Doctor is 99% positive I dont have a tumor. I started bawling in her office in front of my child and she tried to assure me that I most likely just have a ruptured or pinched disc in my neck. And its completely plausible. I can feel the pain in my neck all the time.(I have an old car accident injury that never really head properly) She did some physical tests and I passed them with flying colors. She said she would be shocked if I had something wrong. \\n\\nI\\'m still freaking out though. I look at 1% chance of having a tumor and I\\'m running with it.  I think I have a tumor..I try to distract myself. I pray for calm and peace. I keep telling myself that I passed the physical tests. Nothing calms me down. I have a scheduled MRI in 2 weeks and each day is getting worse. Its to the point where I cant spend time with my husband and daughter. I have to go hide in my bedroom so my daughter doesnt see it. Its wearing down my husband and its wearing me down. There\\'s only so much I can do to distract myself trying to not have an anxiety attack in front of my kid. By the time my husband gets home I\\'m barely functioning. I\\'m freaking out over nothing and this anxiety isn\\'t letting me enjoy my daughter or my husband. I hear them playing in the other room while I\\'m trying my best not to scream from the panic. \\n\\nI just dont know what to do any more. Its taking over my life. \\n\\nTL:DR Dealing with anxiety all my life. Now I have to get an MRI and freaking out because I dont want to have brain cancer.. Even though my Doctor is 99% sure that its not and thinks its just a pinched disc in my neck.', 'I\\'m not sure what to do anymore. I guess everything started about 4 years ago. I was working for a major insurance company and I lost my job due to depression. I ended up getting evicted and moved in temporarily with my grandmother. She is the only member of my family that has ever reliably been there for me. \\n\\nAs I stayed with her I came to realize that she needed someone to take care of her. I talked with her and asked her if she wanted me to stay with her indefinitely and be her caregiver. After some consideration she agreed that things were becoming difficult for her and it would help her a great deal. After a short period of time her health began to wane. After being a smoker for 40 some odd years she had COPD and CHF, and then was diagnosed with a hereditary problem secondary pulmonary hypertension which affects the lungs. The long and short of it is that my grandmother retains water and requires a heavy dose of diuretics to get rid of the water. About 3 months ago, while in the hospital for one of her numerous stays she began to hallucinate. The doctors determined that the diuretics had taken a toll on her kidneys and she could no longer be \"aggressively treated\" for her water retention problem, and the hallucinations were due to her medication poisoning her. Since her health has been steadily declining and she now is in hospice care, and I\\'m scared as shit she\\'s going to pass any moment. \\n\\nI\\'ve done the best I could to take care of her, but the past 3 years have been very difficult. I have had no income at all, and my grandmother only makes about $1500 a month. In the state of michigan, we did not qualify for any programs to receive any financial assistance to provide me with any form of income. We\\'ve been able to get by, but barely.\\n\\nSo I\\'m at a point where I\\'m watching someone I love die. And all of her children are already divvying up her belongings and getting ready to fight over pathetically small amounts of money. They already let me know that they would rather sell her car and split the money rather than let me have it. Which I don\\'t honestly care about. I don\\'t want to financially gain anything for the loss of my gram. But I\\'m furious that they would be so petty and wouldn\\'t even wait for her body to be cold before laying claim to my grandmother\\'s belongings. It just makes me sick, she didn\\'t raise them to be like that. On top of that I am walking out of the situation the same way I entered it, broke with no where to go. But the very worst part, the part I can\\'t handle, is the dread of knowing my grandmother can pass at any time. I lived with my grandparents from the ages of 2 to 5, and this was by far the happiest time of my life. I just don\\'t think I\\'m strong enough to endure anymore. I feel like I am about to collapse.

My cousin came very close in succeeding in killing herself. Last Rites. The whole thing. Beginning of April. Next time she attempts I believe she will be successful. \\n\\n2. My brothers run my parents house (my house) as a drug house. I am really just waiting for the moment that police armed with a search warrant bust in my room, shoot my dog and looking for evidence will give my cockatiel a heart attack. They are out of control and my parents and grandmother are too weak mentally to stop it. I am the youngest and they are abusive at a physical level. They got drunk and kicked in 3 doors in my house when my parents were gone and I was home. They didn't know I was home and I was frankly fearful. I have a feeling that my brothers are jealous of me going to school and I feel like a stranger in my own home. \\n\\n3. Big changes are coming. I am leaving for college in July and although I KNOW my life is going to be easier, the idea of leaving home and routine scares me. \\n\\n4. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and the thing that scares me the absolute most is that I will get to school and be so agitated or having symptoms I will have to withdraw and come home. Reddit this scares me on a level unimaginable. I only have schizophrenia symptoms when I get run down or stressed and don't sleep.\\n\\n5. When I have anxiety I can't sleep. :( The kind of anxiety that I am plagued with is mostly depersonalization. For those that have experienced it, it can really fuck things up. Like philosophically, Am I here? Am I writing this? Is this my body? When i follow this train of thought for too long I feel like am i going psychotic which triggers adrenaline laced anxiety. \\n\\n5.5 Me and this girl were acting partners in class and we ended up kissing.

I look on facebook the next day and she's actually engaged. But i wanted to be physically loved in such a fucking bad way I guess i didn't care that she had a boyfriend. I still feel like shit. \\n\\n6. I need physical intimacy. This part of me disgusts me. I haven't really had much lately and I need someone to be close with. But getting close to someone and having it not work out is tricky because I will be devastated if I get attached and end up getting hurt. Every time I talk about this with my therapist I cry.

That morning we never thought it would be anything worse than a two night stay at the hospital. We ended up with a dead dog. The infection had returned but this time was much closer to his bloodstream, and they couldn\\'t remove it like before without taking out 80% of his colon. No dog can survive that. He was already half of what he should of weighed. \\n\\nWe couldn\\'t even let him wake up to pay our last goodbyes. They said it would have been far more merciful to euthanize him while he was still under anesthesia otherwise he\\'d wake up in a lot of pain from the surgery. Worst phone call ever. \\n\\n---\\n\\nIt\\'s been almost two days. He died around 3 PM on the fifth. You know, the thing about this dog is, he loved being around everyone. Giant Schnauzers are reserved by nature, but he was definitely less so than most and after he\\'d made sure you weren\\'t a \"threat\" which consisted of just a second of barking and then a liiiittle bit of sniffing, he would stick to you like wet cement and follow you around everywhere. It was adorable and maybe a bit annoying at times but in the best way possible. He also loved to please people and give them so much love. \\n\\nI\\'m an introvert probably part by nature and part due to my condition. So I preferred a tight circle of small but well-bonded friends, although at times it did get lonely and I was still prone to many moments of severe hopelessness and feeling worthless (still get those, all the goddamn time). He knew, and was always there to be by my side and comfort me. I\\'ve long since recanted my faith but at the time I said he was a true gift from God. That he changed my life. He was my best friend and the best dog my family ever had and we\\'ve had eight dogs over a period of maybe 25 years. \\n\\nHe always wanted to be pet. Always made you feel loved and worth something. He was the sweetest boy. And not even three years old when he died. His (very rare variation, I might add) condition was so severe by the time it was finally diagnosed and the full severity of it realized, literally on his deathbed, there would have been no point in trying to keep him alive even if the infection site had been somewhere far less dangerous. He would just have gotten it again and again and again and died to it anyway even if we followed his every single movement and diet intake like an eternal hawk.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSince then, I\\'ve plunged and hit the grieving process perhaps harder than normal people (however they can actually be referred to...). I didn\\'t cry after the first day, but yesterday I did have a moment where my eyes momentarily filled up in tears during a Skype session with my SO. But... I\\'ve all but shut down inside. I don\\'t sleep... I had to take 5mg of melatonin to go with my night pills plus the Xanax I\\'m weaning off of to even sleep, and then I overslept because of the melatonin and woke up feeling numb and shitty after a dream of my dog being alive and well in the garden. \\n\\nI don\\'t talk to anyone. Even conversations with my own two parents tend to be short lived. I comfort my mom and she\\'s been crying far more and harder than everyone else which is distressing... she wants him to be alive so badly as we all do. I\\'ve stopped being as open with my (LDR) SO of over 5 months, and we had very open communication before my dog died. I think he thinks he\\'s partially to blame because I don\\'t talk much to him anymore and my replies are often distanced and short. I wish I could work up the energy to write long and heartfelt messages about how that\\'s not true as I usually do, and I didn\\'t mind one bit because I knew it was the right thing to do and I liked doing that, but now... I just feel so dead inside that no emotions are ever truly evoked anymore for maybe more than a moment or two. If he reads this: It\\'s not your fault. At all. I promise you this, always and forever.\\n\\n---\\n \\nI feel like an even emptier husk of my former self. I stopped eating as much and I already ate little before. I feel anxiety creep up on me now more than ever before, and then that crushing and sinking feeling of utter, muted grief and misery non-stop. I keep remembering my mom getting that phone call about him dying and her bursting in tears, red-faced and saying, \"They say Thor isn\\'t going to live!\" like a horrific scene out of a Sarah McLachlan ad, on an endless and nightmarish loop. Again and again. \\n\\nI\\'ve been up for almost 20 hours and I don\\'t feel tired at all. Bits of my mind would rather I kill myself than let this go on. But the truth is, I never, ever go through with suicide. In fact, I might toy with the thought sometimes but I don\\'t ever plan it out, not one bit. Because... I always want to know whether it\\'ll get better. It got better, when I first got properly diagnosed by a then-new doctor and put on appropriate medication. Then it took another nose dive. Again and again with me failing college and coming home. Then I met my SO. Cue getting better. Then Thor died. Nose dive basically the distance of the summit of Mt Everest to the ground.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if it\\'ll ever get better, but I\\'m far too indecisive and inquisitive to let that doubt stop me, oddly enough I let every fucking thing else in my life stop me. I give up a lot and have zero self worth. But I\\'m still fighting and that\\'s not going to end. \\n\\nBut it\\'d sure be a huge help if Thor was healthy and alive.

Im not sure), and partially because I dont know what to think. \\n\\nMy apologies for the awful, ranty wall of text below. \\n\\n Im a college student who has suffered from anxiety in one form or another my entire life. Ive been on meds of ADHD since I was in the 3rd grade and have been to therapy once before for masochism and anxiety. As of about six months ago, my anxiety has steadily increased and I have been having crippling panic attacks. They started small, a natural out cropping of my anxiety and as it has gotten worse they have as well. I was afraid to tell any one, and did my best to deal with it on my own. Of course, soon it was impossible to hide - but I did not admit how bad it had gotten or ask for help until around 1-2 months ago when I had a huge panic attack/breakdown. Since then I have been undergoing CBT. \\n\\nMy progress has been....slow at best. I am still at school and finishing up my classes. My professors know and for the most part are being very accommodating and understanding. I tend to be afraid of judgment from what I call \"tertiary acquaintances.\" Thats just my way of referring to people on the \"fringe\" of my social group, not close (primary) friends, not people with whom I share simmilar interests (secondary) but people further out - close enough to know my name and have a general idea of who I am but not someone you are going to stop and chat with if you pass them on the sidewalk.  I am well aware that they all have far better things to do than judge me, but no one said this was rational. I am fine with complete strangers, its just those people on the edge... \\n\\nBecause I go to a fairly small school, my world is filled with these people. Its pretty damn terrifying. I cant leave my room without running into one of them. In addition to these tertiary people, I have anxieties associated with places, the fear of \"failing\" (whatever it means for me to fail at that moment), and (possibly) certain times making my entire day a minefield of panic attacks waiting to happen. This has resulted in me missing quite a bit of class, and while two of my professors have been really chill about this my third one - not as much. I cannot blame her for it, when a student misses over half of the classes I would be rather concerned as well. Still - I do all my work outside of class and manage to pull out a\\'s and b\\'s on exams. \\n\\nOn monday I had a presentation in this class, which I missed because of a panic attack. When I woke up after my initial panic attack and realized what had happened I wound up having a panic attack so bad I was apparently unresponsive for well over half an hour (I don\\'t remember how much time passed)  and the paramedics were called. Seeing as there was little they could do, I did not end up going to the hospital. Unfortunately one of them was not trained to handel panic attacks and other mental breakdowns and told me things like \"Im done playing games\" and \"if you dont communicate with us, we will have to take you to the hospital where you will be responsible for some pretty big bills.\" Im sure you can imagine how well that went over. I wanted to run, scream, hide. I was so blindly terrified that I almost attacked the Hall Director who responded to the situation when she approached me even though I have never had a violent (ok, outwardly violent) reaction when panicking. In the end I wound up passing out and waking up in a calmer, although still panicked, state. I then spent the rest of the week coming down from that and recovering - missing my therapy appointment on Tuesday as well as all of my classes. \\n\\nThat brings us to yesterday, when I had a meeting with my professor. She was sympathetic to what had happened on Monday, but still very insistant that I come to class. \\n\\nSo, this morning I wake up 2 hours early just to be sure Im ready on time. Everything is going great, Im going to make it. I wont let her or me down today, no sir! Then about thirty minutes before class starts I feel it creeping in...icy fingers pulling at my gut. No, Im going to make it. 20 minutes to go, its getting worse.... 15....even worse...by 10 minutes out (the time I have to leave to make it on time) I was in a full blown (although small) panic attack. Grabbing the first note book I can find, breathing deep, examining my fear (just like my therapist and I had practiced), I walked out the door. Forcing my feet to walk, not run (what will the people Im passing thing? If I start running, will I ever stop?) I make my unsteady way to class.

Then I forced my self to grab lunch, check my mail and *walk* back to my room. \\n\\nPart of me is really proud that I managed to do this, to sit in a room I fear, filled with people I fear, at a time thats bad for me. Another part of me snarkily replies that I only did it so I wouldn\\'t have to face a bigger fear, failing. I still havent come down from that panic attack all day. It hasn\\'t gotten any better or any worse. \\n\\nIm just siting here on the edge ready to burst - filled with anxious anticipation - fully knowing that it would be better if it just broke. \\n\\nSo I guess this wall of text is partially a rant, a way to get it all out. But appart from that, I could use any insight or advice you all may have. Have any of you experienced something similar? If so, how have you dealt with it? Do you have any advice for handeling it in the future?\\n\\nI have a great crew of supporters, but none of them have been there.

I ordered my own coffee yesterday. Without having a meltdown and crying for my twin to help me and get me out of the store. I then sat outside and a girl noticed my shirt (Shaun of the Dead) and I talked to her without having a panic attack and made an excuse on leaving.\\n\\nIt's the first time in over a year I have been able to do that. I don't think I'm on that pink cloud, because today I had to drive to a different town to go see a movie and I had to switch with my mother (I feel so childish, because i'm going to be thirty) to take over for me when I started getting in to San Antonio. She promised it was not a big deal, and she was glad to spend time with me. I then ordered my own movie ticket, and picked out my drink without thinking about it for 20 mins. \\n\\nIt feels like things are finally starting to work for me. I just needed to share, because this sub has helped me a lot. I may not post in here, but I read it and don't feel so alone. :)\\n\\nI was put on a 20miligram dose of Lexapro, has anyone else here had any success with it, are there any side effects that are uncommon that I should be super aware of? \", \"About a year ago I sort of found out the hard way that I think I may have an anxiety disorder or something. I am a pretty laid back person, it takes a lot to get me worked up about anything. But a year ago I was going through a lot and one night driving down the highway I ended up experiencing what I think is an anxiety attack? I got pins and needles in my arms and legs, was hyperventilating, my heart was racing, my face felt flushed then more like...numb, I ended up with tunnel vision and there was ringing in my ears. After a little bit of time I ended up feeling dizzy and lightheaded as well. To sort of make it worse, whenever I have anything that effects my breathing my first thought is I'm having an asthma attack. I did not have my inhaler on me due to the fact that I am pretty sure I've basically grown out of all of that (I haven't had an attack in maybe a year or two and the last ones have been so minor) but I started panicking worse not having it. \\n\\nI've had maybe 4 or 5 experiences similar to this over the past year (it has been a pretty stressful year). No where near as bad as that one was though. Also, driving does not stress me out at all, it's actually a stress relief of mine; and when I experienced that I pulled off the highway, pulled over to the side of the road, got out of the car, laid down on the sidewalk and tried to calm myself down. The ones since that one have definitely been no where near as bad (pins and needles aren't as bad, face doesn't go numb, tunnel vision isn't as severe), but one thing different is I end up really nauseous and start coughing and dry heaving (while still hyperventilating). \\n\\nIs this an anxiety attack? Do people who have anxiety issues always seek medication or are there other ways of dealing with it? Whatever this is definitely effects me, but I haven't sought out professional advice yet just due to the fact that it has never impacted my ability to work or to do well in school. But it does sort of frighten me? The more stress in my life the more I find myself worried that I will end up having an anxiety attack. Oh, and another thing is sometimes when I'm really stressed out I find that sometimes I won't feel too well but nothings wrong, I'll be breathing fine but then inhale sharply. It's sort of involuntary? And it doesn't usually happen once, it happens multiple times over the span of a while but with breaks in between. It's sort of happened a lot prior to me having an anxiety attack so I figured it was worth a mention. Anyway any responses to the questions I asked above would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\nAnd... obviously I haven't done a lot of research at all, as I said it takes a lot to work me up enough and that's the only time I really think about it. If I'm not actually super stressed out about something I don't dwell on that at all so I never think to look into it. I only thought to look to see if there was a subreddit for this because I was stressed out and started freaking out a little so after I had calmed down it was still fresh in my mind enough to make me think to look into this. If this does sound like something anxiety-related if anyone has any good reading material I would love to educate myself on this. Thank you in advance! \", \"I had another panic attack today. Not the worst one I've ever has but still one of the worst.\\n\\nIt starts like any other anxiety attack. A little nervousness mixed in with a little anxiousness. \\n     Then, came the chest tightness and the lack of breath. It feels like my wind pipe is being gently hugged from the inside. My eyes start to go cross-eyed and blur. Everything is a gentle haze as I stumble down the hallway. I am unsure anymore, which way is up and which way is down? I sink to my knees and gasp for breath. Each breath catches in my throat. Too much air is going out and not enough is going in. My heart is singing a tune so loud that it feels like it wants to give up. I sink lower to the ground, my mind racing, trying to....make sense.\\n\\n*This is just a panic attack, just a panic attack, nothing else, just a panic attack.         \\nThis is just a panic attack, just a panic attack, nothing else, just a panic attack.*\\n\\nThis is my new mantra, as I drag my body off the floor and get up. I have to keep moving. I work my way towards the kitchen to get what my body needs. A glass of water and medicine. I find my way to the sink as my vision starts closing in. Everything is going dark around the edges and the edges are going out of focus. It's like a kaleidoscope without all the colors.\\nFilling my cup is a lot harder than it should be. My hands are trembling so much, that I have to fill it twice. I successfully open my pill bottle and down two pills. I wish it was like the movies. They have instant relief, as soon as the pills hit their mouth. That isn't the case here. I stumble my way back down the hallway and crawl in bed. Now, I just hope for sleep to over take me and I can rest. There is no need for me to set an alarm. I won't be late. This happens enough, that I have an alarm for that.\", \"I recently saw my psychiatrist and explained to him that my anxiety was making a dramatic return.

I was given celexa and took that for about 15 years - it didn't seem to do much except take the edge off.  I stopped taking it and I've been working through things without drugs for about a year now.  Developed panic in the process, but am still working through it.\\n\\nI guess I just want to keep my options open.  But given my experience with celexa I'm certain I would never go back to that.\\n\\nEdit: One thing to note is that a few years ago I took Accutane for about four months.  I had to stop it early because it really messed with me - made me super anxious, panic attacks, and extreme depression.  Since then things have never been quite right and it's at this point that Celexa stopped even taking the edge off.\", 'Last night, I had the worst panic attack of my life. It was the most scared I\\'ve ever been. 20F, took two hits off a blunt. The second hit went right to my head, I was coughing like crazy and felt light-headed and nauseous. Went to get some water and go to the bathroom, sat down on the couch and then everything went hazy. My entire back, limbs, and neck were pins &amp; needles. I could barely walk, it was hard to concentrate or talk or even open my eyes. I was so dizzy and honestly thought I was going to die. Went to the ER, got some sedative and a few hours later I was fine. But I\\'m still just frustrated, embarrassed, and confused. I have a meeting with a psychiatrist in a couple days, my first one. My dad pretty much told me \"you shouldn\\'t walk out of that office with some sort of medication\". These anxiety attacks have happened once a week or so for the past few months, weed has triggered the worst of them but they\\'ve happened seemingly out of nowhere as well. It sucks because weed was good at calming me down sometimes, plus it\\'s a fun social thing. Ugh. Anyway, a few questions... first, does anyone else have/had similar experiences with weed? This panic attack was miles worse than any other ones I had, which was really confusing. Now I\\'m scared about what other feelings panic attacks can cause. Second, first psychiatrist visit, what should I expect? If I tell him that a few attacks have arisen due to weed, will that impact an ability to get some sort-of medicine? \\n\\ntl;dr: Had a horrible panic attack after two hits off a blunt. Pins and needles feeling all over my back, dizzy, could barely move or feel my limbs, crying, etc. Is this a normal panic attack, it seemed extreme? Also, what should I expect from my first visit with a psychiatrist? Would revealing that weed has caused some (not all) of my panic attacks impact the possibility for some sort of medication?', \"For about 5 years now my doctors (I've moved around) have suggested that I take anxiety medication. I've been diagnosed with Seasonal Affectiveness Disorder, depression and whatever else. I've always refused medication. But it's getting worse. I can't go a day without being consumed with fear or doubts. I'm always getting my feeling hurt and always worrying. It's hard to do anything normally anymore and it's destroying my relationship. \\n\\nI'm very afraid to take medication. My boyfriend disapproves of it because he doesn't want me to experience any bad-side effects. I'm afraid people will look at my differently if I accept it. I'm afraid some permits will get taken away from me. I'm afraid I might get zapped into a hollow numb person. I don't want to not feel, I just want to stop constantly panicking. \\n\\nThis morning I was convinced that my boyfriend didn't love me because he didn't have a retort when I told him a cute comment about our relationship and I've been thinking about it all day long. \\n\\nPlease, someone tell me that the meds don't make you numb. I want to feel happy, and I want to feel sad when it's okay to be sad. But I don't want to panic anymore. \\n\\n**TL;DR** I'm afraid of what getting on anxiety medication will do to me.\\n\\nUPDATE: I told my boyfriend and unlike before he was very supportive. He's noticed that I've really been suffering lately and has agreed to be sensitive about the issue. I am seeing my doctor on Tuesday.\", ' Hi all! Not really sure how to start this out but I\\'ll try. I\\'m currently an 18-year-old full-time student and I\\'ve had anxiety my whole life.  But recently I\\'ve discovered that my dad has anxiety too, and even was prescribed medication (my mom made it seem like it wasn\\'t a huge deal) but after a while quit taking it because he \"didn\\'t want to be propped up on it his whole life\". \\n\\nNow, as for me, I\\'ve been anxious ever since I was a kid. I used to pick my fingers until they bled and nowadays I\\'ve moved onto my face which of course triggers some horrible self-worth problems on my part. I also had a few panic attacks back in high school to the point where I was sobbing to my mom trying to explain what was happening/what I was feeling but was unable to put it into words. She told me I was hormonal and kind of wrote it off. \\n\\nAnxiety affects me daily, to the point of where I can\\'t wear both headphones in my ears because I\\'m afraid I\\'m breathing too loud or I have to assign memories to different tasks, otherwise I think I forgot them. (Ex: \"I remembered to turn off the curling iron because I was listening to this song when it happened, or I said \"Done.\" or I pointed at it, etc. etc.) If I don\\'t do this I think about it all day or even call my brother if he\\'s home to go and make sure I actually turned off my curling iron.\\n\\nSocially it\\'s a bit different, and I think this is the root of why my parents don\\'t think my anxiety is a big deal is because I\\'m outgoing. I have a lot of friends (God that sounds braggy, sorry) and I\\'m really involved on my campus. I think they believe the stereotype where if I have anxiety then I must be a loner who just sits in the dark all day. Still, I obsess over day-to-day interactions, I\\'m constantly afraid that others will find me boring or not good enough to be their friend. I have a phobia of spending the night at someone\\'s house other than mine (although I have done it twice in the past year) and I\\'ve only ever had one relationship because I\\'ve convinced myself that if someone found all this out about me they would reject me, which would make me feel worse.\\n\\nSo what\\'s the basic gist after this whole long diatribe? Well, basically I\\'m a little lost. I mean who knows, it could be hormonal teenager-y stuff I could look back and laugh at one day, but I honestly doubt it and I want to be able to talk to someone. The problem is  my parents don\\'t support therapy for me right now. I searched the Free Clinic link and a lot of them in my area were for the homeless. (In the US by the way) Should I call anyways? How do I schedule an appointment? Since I\\'m still on my parent\\'s insurance, is there a way to pay the co-pay without them knowing I was there? I just need some general guidance I guess. Thanks so much if you read this all the way down. It means a lot to me.\\n\\n**tl;dr I\\'ve had anxiety my whole life. Father has it too. Parents think I\\'m overreacting (which is possible).

The thought that we're all going to die one day, and we're all just pointless little specks in the universe doomed to be dust for eternity. As an atheist, I wish I could believe something else. I wish I could believe in a God or an afterlife, but it's not something I can just turn on now. It's like a window I've opened that I can't close now.\\nThis has been somewhat of a dark cloud that's followed me around for the last few years (as I've become more aware of atheist ideas and thoughts about mortality). When I was younger I just didn't think about these things....but as I've gotten older (I'm almost 28), I've started to see my entire life in perspective, and my childhood has become a more distant memory, and things in my life and people around me are changing....It's made me consider the big picture of my entire life and who I am....and thoughts about my existence and mortality have become much more intense. It also doesn't help that there are a few things in my life I'm not happy about. I still live at home, I've never had a girlfriend, my career path is somewhat promising but requires a lot more hardwork and has high risk of failure if I don't work really hard and fight for it (which is hard when you think everything is pointless now).\\nI used to have these thoughts every once in a while, but I'd just push them into the background and carry on with my life. Ignoring this idea of eventual eternal nothingness was all I could do. But in the last couple of months this dark cloud has been looming a bit closer, and the last couple of days it has come full force and I can't ignore it anymore. It won't go away. I basically had an anxiety attack yesterday. The more I thought about how pointless everything is, the more I saw there's nothing I can do. I actually vomited twice from the anxiety and inability to do anything about it. I'm trembling and have no appetite...and I may vomit up anything I eat again.\\nI try to carry on with my life and continue ignoring it...but it's very difficult without a big distraction, and anything that does distract me is just momentary until the thoughts resurface. I look around at my friends and family, and see them living their lives, blissfully ignorant, ignoring the fact, and I can't do it. I'm trying to focus on my goals and things I want to do with my life, but I'm having trouble giving a shit cuz I know it's all pointless. Everything I see around me is completely pointless. I can't find the motivation to care about anything now.\\nI don't want to kill myself, mainly because that would devastate my friends and family, but also I don't really want to do something that crazy....it also doesn't really solve anything except make the thoughts stop...and then I wouldn't be around to enjoy that feeling.\\nI've read other similar posts on here, and there aren't really any solutions to this problem. Nothing anyone says to me can make it better because the truth still remains. And that's what's so terrifying about this. I've tried watching Alan Watts videos or look up other peoples' advice, but nothing really helps.\\nI'm kind of scared to talk to my family or friends about it because they all think I'm a pretty well adjusted, happy person....and I don't want to blind side them with something crazy like this and freak them out......I feel like I need to go to a therapist and maybe get medication or something. But I don't know if there's any medication to deal with this kind of thing....and I really don't like the idea of medication but I'm not sure what else I can do.\", \"Hi guys.\\nI went to the doctor today to see if I could get help with anxiety and the panic attacks I've been having lately.

Truthfully, I was in a much worse place mentally when I was taking that medication.

Of course, that makes me anxious (yay!). I'm relatively certain the reason she chose Wellbutrin was because of the problems I had with Lexapro in the past, but still. Any tips and tricks for taking this stuff? Reassurance that its okay to give meds a try? My SO is quite skeptical. I'm quite skeptical.

If she doesn’t want to meet up, leave her be and don’t get mad. \\u2028Step 5. Don’t ever, EVER, tell her that you understand how she feels, because odds are, you don’t. \\u2028Step 6. Blaming her for having anxiety is never okay, no matter how mad you are or even if you don’t mean it. She didn’t choose to be this way. \\u2028Step 7. Don’t leave her alone because if you do, all she’s left with are her thoughts. \\u2028Step 8. Tell her things are going to be okay, because even though it’s not always true, it’ll give her some hope. \\u2028Step 9. Don’t make her confront her fears if she doesn’t want to. Sometimes it’s only going to make it worse. \\u2028Step 10. Love her. Love everything about her, especially her bad side.

I didn't make an effort to meet anyone because i felt better alone. \\nDecember 2014 my parents separated, my Mother left my Father for another women, i won't go into details because i don't want to but this is obviously a huge change, i haven't felt the same since it happened to be honest, at first i just drunk it off. I turned 18 in January 2014 and over the Christmas break in 2014 from college i was out most nights just drinking with friends. \\n\\nBut i would always, always shy away from talking to girls, even eye contact would be awkward for me, like they were judging me, everyone was judging me. I met one girl who'd previously gone to my high school but transferred to another, if she never spoke to me though nothing would have happened at all. She was attractive but honestly i didn't feel that there was a relationship there. We met a few times but nothing really went anywhere.\\n\\nThen one night after work i wasn't going to go out because i love cancelling plans last minute but in this instance i was dragged out by my Closest friend. He met his girlfriend in a club and she had a friend that i'd never met before with her. \\n\\nNow i'm going to be as honest as possible here but this girl was just....wow, i didn't even have to ask her anything i just knew that i would like her, i'm talking past the looks, i kinda just knew i would like her personality and everything. I really struggled to speak to her though, like my friend and his girlfriend just left us alone in order for me to talk to her. But i thank them for that i guess.\\n\\nI ended up being in a relationship with her for a few months, i adored everything about her, we shared music taste, films and just loved spending time with each other. \\n\\nI became extremely clingy and it made her uncomfortable and i pushed her away more than anything, i kept wondering if i was trying hard enough or if i was doing things right or wrong. I constantly worried about everything to do with the relationship. \\nWe're currently not together but we're still as close, having her tell me we're not together is like someone tying a weight to my heart, it feels heavy and my stomach turns up and twists. \\n\\nI've recently been struggling to eat meals properly without feeling sick/nauseated halfway through, my stomach turns in knots constantly when i think about losing her, things she said like above and the thought of her being with someone else.\\n\\nI constantly feel like i'm not good enough, i shake and shiver more frequently and i bite my finger nails way more than i did before. It has always been a pet habit but now it's much worse. \\nI have no one to speak to this about, my dad worries about me but i won't talk to him about anything because he's very one track minded. He doesn't realise it but he's very naturally against mental illness or medicine/tablets such as anti-depressants, it's just kinda of sub-conscious. My mum doesn't live with me and it's still hard talking to her anyway. Like i will cry most times i even think about mum. But then again i cry a lot about the girl i've been with.\\n\\nI've been told that i'm maybe replacing my mum with the girl i've been in a relationship with but i don't think that's true as i know i wouldn't be in a relationship with her if i genuinely didn't like her, that's just unfair. \\n\\nIt genuinely hurts me and that just makes me spin scenarios in my head and get a lot of thoughts about what if i did this different, what if i do that, what if she thinks this, what if she means that, what if she doesn't like me at all.\\n\\nI know recently i've just been annoying her, i tell her a lot about how i feel, i know she still cares and likes me but i say everything wrong and that makes me worry about whether i should say anything at all.\\n\\nI don't really know what else to say\\n\\nI would really appreciate piece's of advice or just any thoughts in general. I'm seeing a doctor about it soon, i'm not on any medication currently and whether i need to be i don't know at all. I'm speaking to a college advisor about it in confidence, she's signalled that i could possibly develop an eating disorder.\\nI've not looked into detail about meditation or other self help techniques but any suggestions are welcomed\\nI really don't know\\n\\nAnyone that's got this far i'd like to thank you for listening, i know really it's just a teenage love story somewhat but my feelings are all over the place, rapid mood swings from happy to sad and vice versa. \\n\\nAnyway i guess i'm going to just leave it here.\\n\\nThank you for listening, it means a lot\\n\\nLuke\\n\\nEDIT: - I've never suffered a panic attack, however i do have a lot of nightmares about things such as losing her and not being good enough. I wake up heavy breathing and sweaty, sometimes the same feelings as the nightmares come up just before sleep, i just run tonnes of scenarios through my head\", 'I just started college this week.

I\\'m freaking out so bad... it\\'s awful.\\n\\nToday was the first day in my writing class, and we had to do a speech on ourselves.... only a couple minutes. i finished writing mine and was too scared, worried, and nervous over being in front of everyone, so i didn\\'t bother to do it.\\n\\nanytime i have to do something in front of a class, talking in front of people, whatever, i get so anxious and nervous and start shaking and worrying about every possible little thing. i\\'ve tried so many different ways to try to NOT be this way but i CAN\\'T HELP IT. \\n\\nshould i get medication? i don\\'t know how i could possibly get through the rest of college without almost having a nervous breakdown every time i have to talk in front of people.\\n\\nwhen it\\'s finally time for me to talk in front of everyone i\\'m so nervous and shaking so bad and worrying, and can\\'t even speak right and stutter or mess up words then i feel embarrassed and keep thinking in my head that every ones making fun of me.\\n\\nwhat should i do?\\n\\nalso asking friends if they feel the same way or for advice is useless, if i ask if they feel the same way as i do they laugh or think i\\'m being over dramatic. it sucks, i feel like i can\\'t do anything about it. something as simple as saying \"here\" during attendance makes me shake and worry.', \"Throwaway post since I don't want this connected to my real account.\\n\\nLooking back on things, I've had anxiety for the longest time but it didn't become a problem until last year (senior year of college). I failed a big chunk of my final semester and had to repeat it in the fall. My self esteem was destroyed after that and I don't think it's gotten any better. A few weeks later, I got into a bad car accident that the police said was my fault. My insurance company proved it wasn't my fault, but it gave me a new fear of driving and being blamed for things.\\n\\nAlmost a year later, I don't think my anxiety has gotten better. I see a therapist once a week and I like just talking him because I'm worried about burdening my family/friends. That helps a lot but I still feel terrible. I got a new job in my field and I'm too scared to make phone calls for it because I can't break the mindset that I am a fraud and I don't deserve this at all. I'm also getting to the point where I'm too afraid to make plans with friends because I don't know how they'll react or if they'll be busy and I'll look like an idiot. Those are the thoughts that keep me up at night.\\n\\nToday my mom yelled at me about all of that and now I just feel fucking terrible. I don't want to go into my job (which I hate) today- I just want to be alone and cry. When my mom was home, she was screaming at me when I was crying and yelling at me as if this was my fault. This is the last thing I'd want to inflict on my loved ones. I hate this anxious part of myself. It brings out the worst characteristics of myself. I just feel so alone because I don't have a huge support system here like I did in college and I feel like my mom is getting frustrated with me and wants to put me on social security.\\n\\nI'm thinking now medication might be the next step. I'm at the point where my anxiety is crippling me from doing what I want to do in my career, socially and mentally. I'm going to my therapist tomorrow and I'm going to talk to him about all of this (I actually wrote a note in my iPhone so I'd remember how I felt when this was happening) but I just feel like everything is my fault. I hate feeling like I'm the worst when I know I'm not that bad. I want to go back to the more carefree version of myself where I wasn't worried about money, getting a job or anything else.\\n\\nI don't really know if I'm seeking advice on medication or if I just need to vent but I'm not in a good place today. This sucks so much.\", 'I am a gay male who has dealt with anxiety most of my life, starting when I was in middle school. The earliest I could remember was the persistent fear of getting kidnapped, and things of the like. Later, going into 7th grade I got hit with this massive fear of being buried alive to the point where I would cry daily and couldn\\'t eat or sleep. I would later get hit with several other anxiety spells, the most recent extreme one being a fear of hell over the course of a good chunk of 2013.\\nRecently I started talking with a guy who lives half way across the country, which was one of my first very serious guys who i had ever talked with. Recently he told me how he needed some time to himself, so I\\'ve been extremely anxious because out of nowhere he stopped talking to me. I was scared he was going to forget about me, even though he never actually would because of how great friends we were. He told me that if he doesn\\'t respond to my messages that it\\'s because he\\'s really bad at responding to stuff, and that sometimes he doesn\\'t see my messages. I would ask to facetime him, and he normally would until this past week when he stopped responding (this was when out of nowhere he needed time to himself). I found out that the idea of just being his friend and being okay with that was enough to pacify my anxiety, because I need to be okay with myself before I can be in a relationship with anyone else (as has always been my mantra). But last night he messaged me briefly, but stopped responding in mid conversation, while I saw him tweeting. My anxiety kept me awake a good part of the night, to where I kept waking up, and couldn\\'t calm myself. I was thinking to myself, \"where did all of this come from? Just hours ago I was doing fine because of my friendship with him, and now this.\" My point for this is, I think it\\'s more so a neurophysiological response from my brain as opposed to it actually being me. My friends keep telling me that I\\'m overreacting, but I can\\'t control this anxiety. As we all know, if I could just make it stop on a whim, I would. Is there any way I can stop MASSIVE anxiety like this without having to resort to pharmaceuticals? I don\\'t like having to use medication because I think the cons outweigh the pros. Any advice?\\n\\nTL;DR - I\\'m having what feels like actual anxiety attacks over a guy. I need a way to relieve my anxiety. Any advice? ', \"I've really always had anxiety, ever since I was a little girl around 5 or 6. It started with storms, a tornado watch would have me crying and sitting in the basement. That slowly faded, and now I am absolutely fascinated with them. When I was about 8, I threw up in a store, I hated it, I had no where to go, I felt gross and like everyone hated me because of it. Because of that I didn't go anywhere for months (I was homeschooled so it was really quite easy to avoid my fears) because of the fear of being sick. \\nThe fear of that faded again after about 9 or 10 once my parents forced to face the world and go grocery shopping. \\n\\nI'm 18 now, go to school part time and have a good job now, I'm barely home, don't get enough sleep, and eat unhealthy because I spend my days at a desk at work and school. \\n\\nOut of the blue I got a stomach bug a few months ago, and ever since then I've had unbearable anxiety (and full on crying terrified panic attacks) that I'm going to be sick.

I stayed at my parents house for 3 days this past weekend and forgot to bring my medication with me, so the last time I took my pill was on Thursday night. As of yesterday evening I started feeling dizzy with some occasional pulsating aches in my head. Is this Lexapro withdrawal? I came to work today directly from their house so I won't be able to take my pill until I get back to my apartment around 6pm today. \", '(I\\'m a 23 year old Female. I\\'m not particularly sure what type of anxiety I have but it\\'s mainly based around obligation and decision making. I currently do not take medicine to control anxiety as I have not had much success with medications. I do undergo therapy which is quite helpful.)\\n\\nI was wondering if anyone else had a similar issue with sleeping/ falling asleep? This has been going on consistently through therapy and various anxiety medications for essentially as long as I can remember. \\n\\nI have issues falling asleep at night. I imagine the behavior at the core of it is having some sort of obligation the next day (school, work, house sitting, &amp;c) that I\\'m really not looking forward to. As a result I can\\'t seem to allow myself to relax because I know that activity will happen right after I wake up, and I feel like I will have to partake in it sooner perception-wise. \\n\\nThis minor stress fueled behavior turned into an anxiety driven behavior, that has since spread to nights where I do not have obligations the next day. Such as right now, I don\\'t work for too days, but I feel stressed about this obligation, and it is effecting my ability to settle down. \\n\\nIt has essentially become this weird thing that happens every night when I settle down, and it is dark outside, where I\\'m too anxious about the time in between obligations that I\\'m \"wasting\" sleeping to allow myself to relax enough to sleep. The problem is not prominent/non-existent during the day when I sleep or nap regardless of obligation.\\n\\nOn a similar note, if I know I need to be in bed asleep by a certain time, I have trouble getting to bed as well as falling asleep once I\\'m there. I know I\\'m doing it, but it\\'s almost a compulsion at this point. I can\\'t seem to stop myself from stretching the time before bed out as far as possible. That anxiety starts creeping up on me and then I feel like the stress is just radiating through my body, and I feel restless. I used to find that exercise helps, but my worsening health has made exercise more difficult, and painful, so I\\'ve since had to limit what I can do. \\n\\nI\\'ve been doing this about as long as I can remember, which admittedly is not that far back anymore. I was wondering if anyone had similar issues? How have you personally been able to relax, or lessen this sort of pending doom type of anxiety. I\\'ve been able to work through the majority of my anxiety through therapy, but this particular problem seems to be lingering. I was hoping some of my fellow redditors might have some techniques I can explore.', \"I've been a long time suffer of migraine (w/aura) and lately they've been happening more and triggering at any sign of stress.

Recently it's gotten to where I have the anxious/scared feeling, with moderate chest pain and shaking, what feels like I'm having a hot flash and start sweating, and nausea. It's also lasting for almost an hour.

They're a huge inconvenience and I have no idea what to do.\\n\\nI also plan on maybe getting medication sometime early next year if it continues. I was curious if anyone has gotten medication for it and if it's helpful. I'm also wondering how exactly you go about getting a doctor to prescribe it to you?\\n\\nThanks for any advice! \", 'I was \"diagnosed\" with anxiety when I was 16 years old (I am now 20). The first time I ever had a panic attack was after I had smoked weed with my sister and some of her friends- it was like an acid trip. Ever since that, I haven\\'t felt the same (I\\'m sure it\\'s a mental thing). Anyhow, high school was completely terrible for me- I hardly ever was able to go because my anxiety became so debilitating for me. I was started on SSRIs when I was 16. My GP started me on Zoloft, which made my mind feel cloudy and made me prone to forgetfulness. I then switched to Prozac when I was about 16 or 17. I also tried seeing a therapist, who after about 2 sessions basically began to send me away after about 20 minutes, claiming that there was nothing else to talk about during the session. I ended up leaving that therapist after about 3 or 4 sessions- it was worthless, she didn\\'t think I needed the help I was looking for. The Prozac made me feel drowsy and zombie-like but I stayed on that until the age of 19. At the age of 19 I was then put on Lexapro by my GP, then began seeing a psychiatrist soon after who continued me on the same meds. I began seeing a therapist, in addition to the psychiatrist, and she has me doing CBT. She diagnosed me with General Anxiety and Social Anxiety; she also mentioned that I seem to have OCD tendencies, but not full-blown OCD. We have worked on relaxation training and thought stopping. We talk about my anxieties and possible triggers; she has me keep a journal to keep track of my anxiety. Right now my \"homework\" is planning out my homework and assignments so that I am not constantly doing homework or doing it in large blocks. (Note: I freak out about school. I like to put my 110% into it. I will sit at my desk in my bedroom and do unnecessary school work for more than 5 hours at a time without a break. I don\\'t know how I find the focus.)\\n\\nSo, long story short, I want to get off of SSRIs and all medication. I will not be able to take SSRIs for the rest of my life, and they will certainly not solve my problems. I need to fix my anxieties from within. I am looking to make myself a lifestyle plan. I would appreciate any suggestions. I read a few and came up with some on my own already:\\n  \\n\\n Diet: \\n        eat a balanced diet, focus on omega 3s and probiotics.       \\n        Eliminate coffee (replace with tea). \\n \\n\\nIncorporate Exercise: \\n        I am a huge proponent of yoga. I have been practicing since I  \\n        was 16 years old and just got back into it recently in a huge \\n        way. I find that it calms my mind, makes me \\n        happy, allows me to focus, and helps me feel good about myself.\\n        I have recently begun going to the rockwall at my university just \\n        about weekly. Its a good exercise and is definitely something I \\n        have to work at- I think I\\'ll keep up with it! \\n        I plan to begin running for my cardio once the weather gets  \\n        nicer. I have read that cardio is awesome for anxiety because it \\n        gets you used to the somatic symptoms (rapid heart beat, loss \\n        of breath, sweating, shaking, etc.).\\n   \\n\\n\\n Meditation:\\n        Just as I have been doing yoga since 16, I have been practicing  \\n        meditation for about as long. Meditation fell out of my practice \\n        further than yoga did, so I have to redefine and reconfigure my  \\n        practice, but I find this to be very important to my recovery and \\n        happiness in life. \\n     \\n\\n\\n Stop avoiding anxiety-inducing situations and stop reacting  \\n           to my anxiety:\\n        I am very nervous in a social situation generally, such as \\n        speaking in front of a group. I would typically avoid this, through \\n        dropping classes that required such activity. I am no longer going \\n        to do this, I am going to push myself to try my best when this \\n        situation comes around again. In fact, this semester I am in \\n        multiple classes which require that I speak in front of my \\n        classmates. In my writing class, we are writing memoirs and \\n        personal essays. We read these writings aloud to our classmates \\n        so that they can critique them, and I have fortunately become \\n        okay with this. In the beginning, it caused anxiety to the point \\n        that I would consider turning around to go back home on the \\n        way to class so that I could get online and drop the class. Now, \\n        I am so glad that I did not do this- I am succeeding! \\n\\n        A lot of symptoms get a stronger reaction out of me, for example   \\n        the spatial deformity which I experience. Sometimes, in an \\n        especially anxiety-provoking situation, my spatial skills seem to \\n        leave me. I reach too far out to grab things that are right in front \\n        of me, I cannot tell where things are. In essence, I lose some \\n        spatial recognition. This is especially problematic when I am \\n        driving. When this happens, I worry more that I am going crazy or    \\n        that something is wrong with my brain. I need to train myself to    \\n        quit this.\\n\\nSorry for the long post, Reddit. I hope you have some suggestions, though.

I also wanted to throw in some other stuff about teas that I have found to be effective. I am going to try to make this as short but detailed as possible. \\n\\nSo a little over a month ago I decided to try out Passionflower and see if it worked for me and my anxiety. I decided to do this based on information from other reddit suggestions in the past and random reading I had been doing. It seemed to have at least some scientific basis for its anxiety-reducing benefits. \\n\\nSource: [Study] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11679026\\n\\nAnyway I bought these: [Amazon]http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Answer-Passionflower-Standardized-60-Count/dp/B000I48M3A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335225158&amp;sr=8-1\\n\\nand took them as directed, 2 capsules a day. I took one in the morning (when my anxiety is the worst) and one mid-day. I don\\'t know if it was a placebo effet or if it did in fact work. All I can say is it definetly FELT like it worked. I had almost the exact same feeling as Xanax minus the drunk-like feeling and not near as much drowsiness. I am only on .5mg of Xanax as needed though, and have only taken it 2 times in the last 4 months, just an FYI. \\n\\nAny day I woke up anxious during this last month I would take a capsule and it seemed to work everytime. If it didn\\'t completely eliminate my anxiety, it made it very manageable. Of course I still keep a spare Xanax in my wallet in case I ever get a terrible panic attack. Passionflower just worked wonderfully for me.\\n\\nDuring this same time, I started to experiment with teas. My mom is a HUGE tea drinker and has buttloads of different teas at her house. She was showing me some that had been recommended to her a long time ago when she was suffering from anxiety/depression too. \\n\\nIt was these in particular: \\n\\n[Mix Blossoms Tea]http://www.botanic-art.com/anahuac-blossoms-bags-pi-224.html\\n\\n[7 Blossoms Tea]http://www.mexicanimports.us/images/thumbs/0000345_300.jpeg\\n\\nAfter looking at both of them, I kind of said, \"Wow no wonder\". BOTH teas have Passionflower in them and the mixed blossoms tea has Valerian Root, another scientfically proven herb to reduce anxiety. I was lucky enough to find more at local hispanic stores.\\n\\nI combined this with my now routine, twice daily, Passionflower pills and WOW. I sleep like a freaking baby now. I\\'ll drink a tea 30mins-1hr before bed an it knocks me out. I get such a good nights sleep without feeling anxious during the time it takes me to actually fall asleep.  \\n\\nSo to recap my routine goes like this: \\n\\n*1 Passionflower Capsule in the morning if I feel anxious.\\n*Another one mid-day. \\n*Either one of these teas before bed. \\n\\nI highly suggest giving this or something like this a shot if you are a new anxiety sufferer (like me) and don\\'t know in which direction to go yet. IE: Medication, CBT, or both. Or maybe you want to try to fight off anxiety yourself and need something asap. I personally want to get rid of my anxiety ASAP (or make it more mangeable) thus I am starting CBT next friday and will continue to do this routine to help facilitate the whole process. If needed though I will incorporate actual anxiety meds but im currently optimistic that Passionflower and CBT will help me overcome anxiety. \\n\\n**NEEDLESS TO SAY**, DO NOT take with any other anxiety meds without talking to your doctor first. I haven\\'t taken my Xanax once since starting with the Passionflower since I have not had a chance to ask our family doctor yet. That and also because I haven\\'t needed it =D. \\n\\nGood luck everyone! ', 'About 6 or 8 months ago, my wife had what she considers a near-death experience.  One night she smoked some K2 (a synthetic form of marijuana) and had a massive panic attack, actually thought she was having a heart attack, and *seriously* thought she was going to die.  She had smoked K2 probably 20 on or more different occasions prior to this night, and over a several month period, so it wasn\\'t just a freak-out reaction to a new drug, and it wasn\\'t any kind of new brand or anything.  She hasn\\'t touched K2 or any similar substance since then.  She has never been the same since that night.  \\n\\n\\n\\nShe says that \"not a day goes by where I don\\'t think about dying, usually several times a day.  Every single day I live in fear.  That panic attack was the single most traumatic event of my life, and I think about it every day.  It gets so bad that sometimes my anxiety over having another panic attack like that one actually *triggers* a flood of anxiety that borders on a mini-panic attack.  I feel like this event has actually left me with PTSD type symptoms.  I would give anything to go just *one day* without dwelling on my own mortality over and over, but it just never happens.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe also has great difficulty going to sleep.  She says that when she lays down and begins to drift off, she\\'ll jerk awake with her heart racing and gasping for breath.  It sounds a bit like that thing that we all experience, where you feel like you\\'re drifting off to sleep and suddenly feel like you\\'re falling and jerk awake, only WAY more intense, to the point where it takes her several minutes for her heart rate to return to normal, and at least an hour or two to calm down enough to try to go back to sleep.  And *then* she\\'ll have anxiety over \"what if it happens again when I try to go to sleep this time?\" and that will keep her awake even more.  When things get bad, she finds herself only able to sleep for 2 - 4 hours at a time before waking up with this same panicky adrenaline rush.\\n\\n\\n\\nReddit, I know the bad reaction to the K2 was likely the initial trigger of all of this, but like I said, that was 6 - 8 months ago, and she hasn\\'t touched the stuff since then.  I would ask that you not focus so much on the fact that the use of a drug triggered the problem, and instead focus on trying to help us get through this.  We are both well aware that using K2 (and other substances like that) is a really stupid thing to do, and it\\'s a part of our lives that we\\'ve left behind for good.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, I need to stress that we live on an *amazingly* tight budget.  Health insurance is a concept that goes right out the window when you\\'re forced to choose between that and keep your electricity from being shut off, struggling to keep your car from being repo\\'ed, and managing to scrape together the mortgage payment.  If taking her to the doctor or seeing a therapist were a liable option, I wouldn\\'t be here typing this thread.  That\\'s what we\\'d really love to do, but unless one of you wants to volunteer to pay the medical bills, it\\'s not an option.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a husband, I am at a loss as to what I can do for her.  I try to be there for her, listen to her, and comfort her, but beyond that, I feel powerless to do anything to improve her situation.  It is my hope that there may be some of you out there who have similar traumatic near-death experiences that impacted you for months (or years) to come, and that you might be able to share some ways that you conquered (or at least learned to deal with) your issues.  Any comments from spouses trying to support their loved ones through an ordeal like this would be welcome too.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe\\'ve considered disability, but the catch to that is that you have to have extensive medical documentation of your problems to have any hope of winning a disability case, and how are we supposed to afford such medical documentation without insurance?', \"Hello, I'm really new to reddit and found this anxiety section hoping to get some peace of mind. I actually went through something really traumatic 14 years ago and to make a long story short I had this nervous energy for two years, always looking over my shoulder until the situation was put to bed. I was fine and everything seemed to go back to normal until I got into a car accident 6 years ago. I couldn't sleep, I was constantly thinking about the accident and what could've happened.I woke up one morning and as I lifted my head up, everything kind of went white and my head was extremely fuzzy. Like a a ton of bee's were stuck in my head. I had rapid heart beat and premature heart beats as well. It totally freaked me out. I didn't go to the doctor right away but my thoughts consumed me and at that time I didn't know how to control the anxiety I just let it consume me and let it take me down a dark place in my head. I went to see a chiropractor from accident and told him about my symptoms hoping for anyone to tell me what I want to hear. From there I saw another doctor because I was then starting to have this off balanced feeling, like when you pull out from a parked position and the car next to you pulls in, that sensation of movement but you're not moving. She did some simple tests on me to rule out further testing for brain MRI's as I thought I had brain cancer/tumor but this one doctor could feel my worry and concern and instead of prescribing me medication (as all docs before her did), she told me to buy this book that only cost me $3.49 from amazon. It was written in the 70's and it was seriously a life savor. I called it my bible for anxiety. After I started to train myself to let the anxiety happen and not dive into it, I started to feel so much better and could go on with life, BUT....This situation that happened 14 years ago has resurfaced and what I've heard is if something really traumatic happens, even if you're over it, all the feelings and emotions flood back as if it's happening for the first time. Just two weeks ago I started to feel off balanced again, nausea but no vomitting, can't fall asleep, consuming thoughts and this weird sensation in or on my head. The best way to explain it is, it feels like, I can feel my hair growing, it's this weird buzz, chills kind of feeling and of course I let myself go online and start looking up brain cancer and oh my goodness the list goes on. I guess my question to anyone who might understand is, does anyone else have these weird sensations accompanied with anxiety? I'm starting to really freak myself out again and allow myself to go down this ugly road. perhaps I should bust out my book again? Just hoping for some clarity so I'm not running around like a crazy person again scheduling multiple doctors appointments. Thank you!\", \"I was diagnosed with PTSD about 5 years ago.

This bus was full of acquaintances and then just my one friend and I. (the two others stayed behind.) Anyhow as soon as the bus doors closed, I started to feel nauseous, like I had diarrhea coming on. I toughed it out but seriously considered jumping off the bus. Long story short I made it with some coaching from my friend. When I got back to my room I ran to the bathroom, but there was no diarrhea, actually nothing happened, I just felt relief. Since then, I have had anxiety for the last 10 or so years, with a break in the middle of about 4 years. \\n\\nHow does this affect me?

Airplanes are terrible for me. The whole sitting while waiting to take off, and the sitting while it taxi's to the terminal. I go out of my way to look for non-stop flights, even international. Overall I just get really strong feelings of uneasyness. I can deal with the stomach feelings, you know not really craps, not really pain, just weird feeling. Its the thought of having diarrhea and crapping myself on a crowded plane, bus, coworkers car, where-ever. Strangely, I feel like if someone I know closely is aware of my phobia then it doesnt creep up, but I am reluctant to tell the world.

(if you want the link just ask) Is there some medication I can take that makes it just go away, and I keep my sex drive?

Once my daughter was born, I slammed into severe PPD.  It's hard to explain, but I felt like I made a huge mistake, I was terrified to be alone with her, I cried 24/7.  My husband was not exactly supportive, he made comments like 'suck it up, you're a mom now' 'what did you expect when we decided to have a baby'.

Honestly, I should of been home schooled sooner. Maybe I would've done better.\\nBut I've noticed as I've gotten older my anxiety has gotten much worse. I take medicine for it but of course, it doesn't always help. I'm sick of feeling like that awkward girl or the girl that never socializes. Everything literally makes me so uncomfortable/nervous. My anxiety is literally ruining my life. \", 'Benzos, SNRIs and SSRIs all made me aggressive, violent and angry. I am a little afraid to try other medicines, but I want to know, what should I look for as potential alternatives?', 'So I been on Wellbutrin for over 3 months. My doctor just upped my dose from 75mg 2 times a day to 75mg 3 times a day. For the first two weeks I felt great after the change. Then this past week and this weeekned I have been having bouts of dizziness and when I get dizzy, my whole body feels messed up. Have any of you guys ever have something similar to this happen to you on any medication?', \"I just had my first appointment with a psychiatrist today. I was nervous last night and made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/q7il0/im_nervous_about_my_first_psychiatrist/) about it - thanks to all who helped (TL;DR went to see psychiatrist because I want to deal with physical symptoms of my social anxiety). In certain situations, my anxiety gets so bad that I have nausea. I've had to call in sick to work a lot because of it and am not working at the moment, partially for that reason. I went to the appointment hoping to get prescribed beta blockers, because I've heard that they help with physical symptoms. Instead she gave me a script for Prozac. I went home and then freaked out because I'm really scared of side effects and withdrawal. I've also had some friends in the past that have had terrible experiences with anti-depressants, and I don't want that to be me. So I called her back and told her I was really afraid and was wondering if I could try beta blockers or if there was anything else. She said the beta blockers are really more for performance anxiety and wouldn't help with the nausea. She also said that if I wanted to I could try Klonopin instead; she said it might help more with the nausea than Prozac, but might not be as effective overall.\\n\\nNow I'm kind of in a bind because these are the two options I didn't really want to have. I'm worried that if I take the Prozac I might have some nasty side effects and/or experience withdrawal if I try to stop, which is a concern as I really don't want to be on medication more than a year at most. On the other hand, the Klonopin has a high potential for addiction and could have some side effects as well, plus you can't drink on it - although if I take it just for certain situations, could I drink on the days I don't take it...? The advantage to the Klonopin is that it would be nice to just be able to try it and see how it works rather than wait 4-6 weeks for the Prozac to kick in and possibly not work at all or make me crazy; plus, my anxiety is relatively manageable when I don't have the nausea, so it would be nice to have something I don't have to take every day. That way I can also continue to work on it with my therapist and hopefully be off of the meds sooner.\\n\\nHas anyone taken either SSRIs or benzos for nausea and had any effect? Or any other medication? Should I consider getting a second opinion from another psychiatrist? I'm going to think this over and also talk to my therapist, but I wanted to see if you all had any experiences or input to share.\", \"I'm 17, posted a couple weeks ago about help asking my parents to take me to see a doctor about my anxiety.  Finally did, they agreed.  Now I'm wondering what they will do for me.  I have been having daily anxiety and panic/anxiety attacks.  Sleeping is very difficult, I have pains and aches, my extremities get numb and I feel claustrophobic like I'm trapped or like I'm being crushed.  What will they do for me?  Therapy?  Meds?  What is therapy like?  What meds would I most likely be given?  Thanks\", 'I thought I\\'d share my experience from last night regarding a large social event that I asked for help with yesterday - thank you for the encouragement and ideas of how to cope! Love this sub! (TL;DR at the bottom)\\n\\nBackground: I have generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks and have had this diagnosis for about two years (longer undiagnosed). I\\'ve been off my happy pills (Zoloft) for almost a year now. I hate huge social situations where you have to make small talk or if you are on \"display\" for people to see/judge. It\\'ll send me into panic attacks before and during the event.\\n\\nEvent: My grandmother-in-law\\'s 90th birthday party - yay, a large social event full of people I don\\'t even really know that I\\'m not even related too! Yay. And many of the people in the family (my husband\\'s) are loud social people. But not even the fun type of social people who get you to relax - they\\'re just obnoxious at times and off-putting with their lack of intelligence or general arrogance. Thankfully I was involved in some of the planning and had the forethought to make the party work for me rather than the party working me. \\n\\nI offered to make a floral arrangements for the tables - that was ignored. Thanks. Then I offered to make a photo guestbook because it was going to be the \"gift\" and I\\'m a terrible gift-giver. That idea was given high praise because this family is into pictures - great! I can work with this! I gathered numerous family photos to make the book and as I did I realized that this family can\\'t take a snapshot worth crap.\\n\\nSide story: As someone who took photography in high school (we had a darkroom and everything) I know a thing or two on how to set up a good shot (looking back now I see why I found the B&amp;W dark room soothing - didn\\'t have to deal with muchless see people lol). I also can\\'t stand bad photography - check the background for the love of God!! No one wants someone derping in the background!! \\n\\nSo it dawned in me - I\\'ll be the photographer! Yes, I\\'m having to talk to be people, but I\\'m not really in the spotlight because I\\'m behind the camera. And I\\'m telling them what to do! I\\'m in control! Also, I can run off and go take pictures of people -- or things -- rather than having to make small talk. \"Ooops sorry! Duty calls!\" And then at the end I can make another photobook for Grandmother-in-law and be the hero! Best advice: find a way to take control of the situation that makes you happy or uses your gifts and talents. I feel lucky I was able to do that in this situation. Not ever situation lends itself to that.\\n\\nSo how did it go and what did I do to survive?\\n\\nPregame: Honestly, I probably should have taken small bottles of liquor with me to take the edge of since meds are no longer a thing for me, but instead I pregamed with my crochet (like knitting). I sat in the car (we got there early) and crocheted for a while. I knew I couldn\\'t do it there, but I still slipped my yarn and needles into a bag just in case I needed to peal off and calm down. It\\'s my soothing hobby and keep me from twitching too much - I hate being a twitcher. \\n\\nEvent: I got to work right away. Taking pictures of the cake, table settings, etc. Forcing people to pose together (yes, evil me came out because I was in control \"no you move there, and you get a little closer, that\\'s it!\"). Everyone was behaving themselves and being over all pleasant. It was kinda weird. \\n\\nThen it happened. The ONE person who I could go the rest of my life without seeing shows up. We\\'ll call him Walter. \\n\\nBack story: A few Christmases ago the family friend Walter was dumped on me. That Christmas I was going through some health issues and didn\\'t feel good. I didn\\'t even feel like moving and thus I fell prey to Walter. Now Walter is generally harmless, but he\\'s a very loud, very annoying man who has an extreme case of aspergers. And before you accuse me of anything, I\\'m a teacher, I work with all kinds of kids and the aspergers are usually my favorite. But Walter does not even take the bluntest of cues - yes you just have to be blunt with aspergers. The other thing too is how I would treat an aspergers kid in my classroom does not look socially acceptable (you have to be blunt and it doesn\\'t look nice, but there are small social cues that are lost on some aspergers kiddos). It\\'s a hard card to play at a social event like this where you have to be socially polite and I didn\\'t want to have to deal with it! He\\'s a nice guy, but it was neither the time or the place for that kind of stress. And I\\'ve been scarred by a previous experience of endless hours of tedious conversation (I\\'m not a talker).\\n\\nSo Walter walks in - avoid, avoid, avoid - and it\\'s perfect because I have a task to perform. I\\'ll avoid as much as possible, but then he is invited to sit at my table. I noped out of there because I had pictures to take and it was almost cake time! A few times there was just nothing to take pictures of and so I had to sit and be social. I did my best to be polite and when it would get to be too much I would go take pics or skip out to the restroom - lipstick had to be reapplied!\\n\\nThankfully the event was taking place in a large building with a lobby near the bank of elevators. And as all people with social anxiety know the cell phone reception is always better in the lobby away from the party. I sat down for a while and did things like checked reddit, texted family, and I also had a friend on stand-by who is my go-to. If I need to get out of anything she will call me with a great excuse - and she\\'s creative - to get me out. I seriously think she should loan out her services!\\n\\nHaving a \"get away\" place really helped in not only avoiding Walter, but also helped to calm me when I felt like it was too much. Coupled with a productive and creative task it was a much more bearable situation. \\n\\nHonestly, it was a miracle that I didn\\'t have any type of panic attack although I felt one coming on that morning. Thankfully I was able to fight it off. But I learned that I have to make things work for me and not let things happen to me. \\n\\nPostgame: Today I am chilling at home with my pups. I have played around on reddit, written a few lesson plans for the week, and I\\'ll probably put on Christmas music and decorate. It\\'s my re-charge day. I have found it is so important to give yourself time to recharge after large social events. If I don\\'t I will burn out and it\\'s not pretty -- major panic attacks and hugely obsessive and unwanted thoughts.\\n\\nConclusion: Went a whole lot better than I could have imagined! I feel like I\\'m making huge progress with my anxiety! I still can\\'t believe I didn\\'t have a panic attack! It\\'s so weird!\\n\\nIn summary, here\\'s what I learned helped me:\\n\\n* Involve yourself in the planning of the big event if possible (not always) to make it work for you. Use your talents to create a task for yourself on your terms. But don\\'t give yourself more than you feel comfortable doing. Remember to make it work for YOU and not work you up!\\n* Pregame a bit - find a pregame task that is going to sooth you - jam out to music, go for a run, focus your attention on a hobby. Avoid obsessive thoughts about what is about to come - that always bites me in the butt.\\n* Give yourself \"outs\" - like what was suggested from an earlier post make an appointment or have plans that you have to \"rush off\" to. I think having my friend on speed dial as backup helped me even though I never used it. Allow yourself to \"disappear\" if you need. Find a quiet place and \"take a phone call.\" Or as one of my high anxiety coworkers says, \"use the excuse of explosive diarrhea - it\\'s too personal and is never questioned!\" I don\\'t like hanging out in bathrooms, but given the alternative it is only a little crappy! \\n* Come prepared with a few topics that you feel comfortable talking about or questions to ask people. I find this makes the small talk go smoother. Something I\\'ve been doing for years.\\n* Postgame a bit too: Relax and be alone. Let out a panic attack if needed (I\\'ve learned how to hold them in), or participate in your pregame soothing activity. \\n\\nI hope this helps someone out there. I find that I get a lot out of reading other people\\'s experiences because I don\\'t feel so alone. Again, I want to thank everyone on this sub who have been so helpful to me and to others. This really is a nice bit of therapy. \\n\\nTL;DR Went a large social event, Grandmother-in-law\\'s 90th birthday party, and using my coping mechanisms I avoided a panic attack and only had mild anxiety. Hooray!', \"My boyfriend had a panic attack Monday night that landed him in the ER because he thought it was a heart attack. It's only the second one he's ever had, while I've had them on and off since I was ten and almost daily for the last few weeks. Sunday night we had a huge fight because I had yet another panic attack and he feels like I blame them on him, even though I only want support. He pretty much blames me, because even though it was actually triggered by something at his new job he said he would never have been stressed out enough for it to happen if it wasn't for us fighting. I'm hurt and upset but he's probably right because I've been a nightmare because I hate my fucking life and he's caught the brunt of it because I don't have many people I trust or feel comfortable around. \\n\\nI don't for the life of me understand why me being anxious and likely depressed and hating mysel would stress him out that much, bu I guess I never will. \\n\\nNow he's pushing me to get professional help and that just makes me want to die. I don't know what's worse, the idea of losing him for his own mental health or the idea of admitting that I'm a worthless piece of shit who needs mental help and committing to a lifetime of heavy-duty medication and being a zombie. He says he wants to be with me but he can't help me if I won't help myself, but the help I would need is humiliating. I've been in therapy but I always refused medication when it was suggested. I know he can't keep improvising his own mental health for me and and care too much about him to want him to. I don't know what to do. Help me, reddit.\", \"I have had crippling anxiety my whole life. Depression is a newer acquaintance. After being sick, calling off a wedding, having a dream job shattered, and having a major surgery I noticed, people are selfish. My last fluffy pieces of faith in humanity floated away. Why wouldn't anyone come visit me while I was stuck in bed? All my friends know I have no family to do so.  Gossip at work (even from HR) that I was not even sick. Did I ever stew. Having all that time alone to think about what went wrong.\\n\\nI have always been an animal lover. Have cat named Strudel, and a snake Diegs. But I was still lonely. Enter Panini my adorable Ragdoll. He was a Christmas present to myself. The only way I celebrated that year. Ok I am not out of control yet...Then I offered to foster for a local animal rescue. The lady called to come do a home check. She was an hour and a half late. She texted asking if could bring a puppy inside. This starved husky shepherd puppy had been left by the dump. I was going in for surgery in 3 days, but I couldn't say no to those blue eyes. Millie became a new temporary roommate.  Anyone who has been around huskies should know of their dramatics. I didn't get much peace.\\n\\nWhat followed was incredible ups and downs with fosters I tried to rehabilitate. Wish could tell all of them here but would take me hours, and not sure anyone is as enthusiastic as me about them. If you are comment and I can leave little bios with pictures. I was having a stressful day last year. I had to go to the pet store to get dog food. I stopped at the hamster cage. Walked out with Falafel Phil. Who would soon become HBO for cats, and dogs. I am starting to develop a pattern here. Down in the slumps = new fuzzy friend.  \\n\\nThen I got my guardian. Rescue lady called, there was a huge abused most toothless malamute shepherd who was at dog control. Overcrowding was not making his 4 month stay look like a very promising future. We know by now that I can't say no, right?  Within two minutes he had sat politely for me, and gently offered me a paw in exchange for a soft treat. The poor guy can't really chew milkbones and whatnot. He stood up, wagged his excessively fluffy doggy pants, and gave me the lowest little howl/talk saying thank you. I could not let anyone else adopt this dog. He talks to me! Rarely hear him bark, just a happy low chatter. We could go back and forth for hours. I called the rescue lady the next day and told her I wanted to adopt Wiley. \\n\\nNow I have this solid companion. Socially I am still very introverted. Only going for walks at night so I do not see people and whatnot. Wiley makes me feel safe though. No one is going to mess with a tiny 5 foot blonde, while she has a dog almost her weight with her.  I however underestimated Wileys good looks, and charm. People flock to him for rubs, and to ask me questions. Good thing I love talking about him! There I go starting to open up again. That dog has helped me train numerous other rescues, makes me laugh every day, and is just the loveliest example of what an abused animal can be.\\n\\nDamp moment here. Falafel Phil the hammy died. Who I quickly replaced him with Crouton the dwarf hamster. Then my python of 9 years passed suddenly. Adopted a breeding pair of winter white dwarf hamsters this time, Miso, and Sushi. I know I have a bit of an addiction at this point. These animals are my therapy. I quit my high paying office job to pursue a career working with animals. I did get hired too, as a vet assistant. Making minimum wage. Bit of a rant here. I was assisting in surgeries, euthanasia, office work, janitor work, grooming, animal care, medication dispensing, and going to multiple unpaid meetings. I would not be given OT as deserved, or breaks. And a 12 hour emergency watch shift paid even less than my hourly minimum wage?  Forget to mention the Dr. I am working for has the shortest fuse ever. It pushed me back in to the depths of depression. One overnight shift I almost took my life right there as I had all the tools. But the reason I was there was an elderly dog who was suddenly having violent seizures. I couldn't leave her. \\n\\nFinally reached out to the guy I was dating, and told him everything. He was willing to financially support me if I would quit my job, and go talk to a Dr. I did both. That was a couple months ago. Today I am making plans with real people again. My work experience at the vet paid off too. Got hired as a part time doggy daycare trainer. I don't even care that I make minimum wage either. Wiley and I are helping animals every day without overcrowding our house any further. \\n\\nThanks all :)\\n\\n\", \"I've made countless posts to this site on different sub reddits and I don't even know why I do it! I have no friends or anybody who can help me and I have no money and I'm just going out of my fucking mind! I live in the middle of nowhere and I can't even get help from the government I'm so fucked. I can't win the battle against my obsessive thoughts anymore and I'm just so fucking tired of fighting myself and reassuring myself and I can't sleep anymore just day after fucking day after day and I can't sleep unless it's the weekend. Every single night is so awful and the pressure to just sleep one fucking hour is so strong and every night more pressure and more pressure and it just never happens! I have a mortgage and all these bills and I have to be at work all the time and so early 6am in the morning until 6 at night and I'm just so exhausted. My anxiety is hard enough to cope with when I'm sleeping and eating but after days of no sleep and nausea I can barely eat. My hands shake constantly and I'm having hallucinations. The dizziness and everything is so unbearable and I can't even talk about it because nobody fucking cares about me at all. I basically beg my family for help and they tell me I'm 23 to figure it out on my own I'm not their responsibility any longer. And I know this is true I just don't know what the fuck to do. I want to self admit myself to an institution but they are so terrible and I don't have the money to pay for it and I'll lose my job. I can't afford therapy and I can't afford anything but Anxiety medications from my general dr and they just make it SO MUCH WORSE! The last anti depressant I tried seriously made me want to actually consider suicide because it was the absolute worst thing I have ever felt in my life.

I know this post is a complete mess and looks so ridiculous but I'm just so exhausted and I haven't slept in almost 4 days and I feel insane. I just want to sleep so badly. \", 'I\\'ve had GAD for years now, though I\\'ve always been able to get through a panic attack through my own will.  I\\'ve never taken anxiety medication because of this.  In January, I bit the bullet and began taking Klonopin for my condition while going through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  I was prescribed to take 1-1/2 a pill, 3x daily, though, fortunately, I haven\\'t been taking this large amount, I\\'ve been taking ~0.5mg/day.  Sometimes more, sometimes less, but never more than 1mg.  These past few weeks I\\'ve only had to take 0.5mg/day.  I decided that I don\\'t like feeling so drowsy and out of it all the time, due to the medicine, and wanted to stop taking it.  Then I began reading around that I can NOT just stop taking it, for risks of severe withdrawals and even *seizures*!  Now I\\'m a complete wreck.  \\n\\nMy anxiety is at a phenomenal level, one that I have not even experienced ever prior to taking this medicine.  I almost went to the hospital today because of it.  I just want to be completely OFF of it and the fact that I might go through withdrawals or have a seizure if I do so is driving me INSANE!  I believe I\\'m psychologically addicted to it because once I start experiencing this sheer panic of having a seizure from stopping the medicine, it subsides a second after taking my dose, and I know the medicine doesn\\'t work that fast.  I fear that I couldn\\'t even bear going through a taper due to all of this.  \\n\\nI feel completely betrayed by my psychiatrist for not telling me this little fact before putting me on it.  I told her I wanted to go through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, not be on any long term medication after she tried pushing an SSRI on me, and even after me telling her this, she prescribed this medication \"just to take the edge off while I\\'m doing the therapy.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know how I\\'m going to make it through this.  I regret taking it, I should\\'ve trusted my gut instinct and never gone on it to begin with!  I\\'m a complete wreck and don\\'t know how to handle all of this!', \"I am going to be put back on medication soon, and thinking about it terrifies me. \\n\\nI've never had a good history with pills or any sort of medication. When I was 9 my Mom put me on Vyvanse and I couldn't sleep, eat, and some days even get out of bed. I was depressed and so sore I could barely move. After being taken off my Mom *insisted* that I take something else, because I didn't function like a normal human, 'didn't act right' and 'wasn't happy enough'. \\n\\nSo at a ripe age of nine and a half years old I was put on Prozac. I hated it, taking it made me feel like I wasn't human, along with the two sessions of therapy a week. But whenever I took them my Mom was so happy because she would see me 'smile more'. I started throwing them out, flushing the pills, getting rid of them any way possible, but after a few months was caught and had to be supervised. The rare times I could visit my Dad he would take all the medication and flush it in one go since he doesn't believe in medication. So I would go to his house as often as I could.\\n\\nMy friends all said that it wasn't healthy to mess with my medication and constantly be going on and off, but none of them had any problems (or so I had thought), medication, therapists, so I would get in arguments and have breakdowns. \\n\\nAfter faking a happy act for a while I was taken off of the medication when I was barely 12. I thought that I was free from it, but it was actually that my Mom wanted something **stronger**. \\n\\nNot long after I was taken in to get my first shot from the Gardisol series. \\n\\nI got a prescription for Adderall but before I even took it I feel ill. Constant high fever in the 100s, puking, headaches, I felt like death for two weeks of my summer vacation. But my Dad said it was just the flu. \\n\\nTwo months into the school year and I had begun to form very unhealthy eating habits (skipping meals and binging later, restricting), but my Mom thought that the medication was really helping me, when I was really the acting classes I took after school twice a week.\\n\\nI went and got my second shot of the Gardisol series.\\n\\nMy insomnia came back and it came back strong, going days with out sleeping before I would literally pass out. Everywhere I went I was afraid, that someone would notice, see me, even look in my direction, and I would have to smile and talk and be cheery. The anxiety that had always been present was growing by the day, I would work at school during lunch instead of eating so that I could boost my grades above the scale and lose the disgusting pudge that surrounded me in the mirror.\\n\\nI went and got the third shot of the Gardisol series.\\n\\nI don't remember what happened that weekend. I thought it was a Monday, and got into a dispute with my Mom until she pointed out that it was in fact a Thursday. All I know is that I had complained of a head ache and gone to lie down. When I did return to school that Monday, I told the teacher there was something wrong with a computer, my glasses were broken, something was wrong. I began to panic. I couldn't see. \\n\\nEvery little blob was disfigured in a bright colorful palette that made it burn to open my eyes, I felt like it was some sort of lucid dream, someone had messed with my medication, no I threw away my medication this morning. \\n\\nThe teacher tried to calm me down but I panicked, ran to hide in the hallway. That is where my sister found me, curled in a ball and sobbing. She still can't describe what my eyes looked like that day.\\n\\nWhen my Mom picked me up from school I calmly handed her my glasses and told her, 'These don't work anymore.' At the eye doctor the next day, they confirmed that those glasses did not work anymore, because my prescription had changed, I had loss around 11% of my vision since my last test only a week before.\\n\\nNobody knew how to explain it, but the situation only got worse. Sure the painstaking neons and pastels were gone, but my vision got blurrier and blurrier as my eyesight plummeted. The absent days at school added up with all of the doctor appointments. My teachers were kind enough to excuse me from as much as they could, but that was the first year that I received a B in class. \\n\\nOne day I woke up and it was so bright that there was a persistent throbbing, and I had to wear sunglasses to tame it. It continued to get worse as well, to the point that I now have severe photo phobia and even wear my sunglasses outside in the night time, and rarely go outside during the day. \\n\\nI was leaving school for another appointment two hours away, and an innocent classmate (a friend of mine too) yelled out, 'what, are you going blind?'. Everyone laughed, but it was silent again when I smiled at him and said, 'Probably, yeah.'\\n\\nI would get fit for a pair of glasses and they wouldn't work the next day. My eyes were steadily getting worse, and I was getting extra sessions of therapy and suggested a support group to prepare me for the day I would wake up to a world of grey. \\n\\nNever did I ever dare to cry in front of my Mom, only in my bedroom on the long nights I couldn't sleep, because I didn't want to show fear. She was always upset, screaming to doctors on the phone that there has to be a cause for her daughter that is now so tainted, poisoned, that they needed to fix her precious baby who was *broken*. \\n\\nFor the first time in two weeks I went to school. Everyone tried to help me in any way they could, I would only respond to one teacher and two of my friends. I felt like crap, I was zoning in and out, about to pass out, but I couldn't go home, my Mom needed to go to work, we don't have the money to deal with this, I need to suck it up. My close friend kept demanding me to go to the clinic but I told her no over and over. \\n\\nThen at lunch I sat at the table, looking at the milk in front of me. I couldn't move. I could feel everybody's eyes on me, on my back, on my frizzled hair, on my chapped lips, on my cracked, purple nails. On the sunglasses I wore on my face with shame. \\n\\nIt's not clear in my memory what happened, but I know that I had a panic attack. Crying, shaking, random spasms as people rushed to hold me down and keep me calm, trying to tell me, it's okay your Mom will be here soon, the ambulance will be here soon. But this only made it worse! I can't afford an ambulance, I can't afford all these appointments, I can't afford to make my Mom come home from the work she held herself from for me to see me like this, twitching on the ground. I tried telling them I was fine, don't call an ambulance, don't call my Mom, I'm fine, but nothing came out. Just gargles and choked sobs. \\n\\nI passed out in the ambulance. \\n\\nThey chalked it down to me having taken two of my pills instead of one, and to have somebody moderate my dose again.\\n\\nI went to school the next day and acted as if nothing happened. The people who asked me if I was okay, what happened, can I help, were all ignored as I tried to make up the work I missed and take notes on the power point about Anthropology. \\n\\nIt was the last day of finals that I lost the vision in my right eye. A trip to the hospital, no explanation, and I went to school for a week with only 40% vision in my left eye. It came back.\\n\\nDoctors kept saying 'it isn't real', 'she has to be faking it', 'this isn't possible' until we met one man. He was the only one in the country researching the effects of Gardisol, and the people it had killed and permanently handicapped. This man looked at me, smiled, hugged me, and promised he would make me feel better about myself again. I cried all the way home. \\n\\nThe Medicare acts changed, and I got a letter saying that my insurance no longer covers the previous services. I cried again. \\n\\nFinally my vision stabilized a few months ago, now I have lost 83% of my general vision, all of my peripheral vision, and have severe photo phobia.  \\n\\nI'm trying to take care of my depression, anxiety, and eating disorder (I've stopped skipping meals, doing daily activities to love my body and increase my self confidence, I try to get out more, etc). \\n\\nBut I'm about to be put back on medication soon. And I am terrified that it will trigger a reaction in my body and I will lose the rest of my vision. I no longer use pain medication, sunscreen, commercial toothpaste, or anything weird to ingest/ put on my body.\\n\\nDoes anybody have a specific recommendation for treatment with out some sort of dangerous side effects? I know it is useless to ask, but I've been sitting here typing this and crying for the past twenty minutes or so, so I guess it is worth posting. \\n\\nPlease, help me out here, I'm only 13 and I just want to have a normal life from here on.\", 'I was caught with pot in October 2010 and again in May 2011, and now I have a criminal record that won\\'t be able to be expunged (erased) until 2017. I\\'ve never even been a heavy pot smoker, but now every time I apply for a job or apply for an apartment, people are going to think I am a pothead. Later this year, I\\'m going to need to start applying for internships next summer. If they do a criminal background check, I have no idea what to expect. I already struggle with incredible anxiety whenever I apply for little jobs like at supermarkets and stuff, but I can\\'t imagine what it\\'s going to feel like when I need to step into the real world. The muscles in my legs tense up, I completely lose my appetite, and just the thought of getting zero interviews for years scares the shit out of me. I try to calm myself down in many different ways, but still the thought just consumes me. This has been on my mind practically every hour of every day for the past 14 months, and I think it\\'s really starting to do its toll on me. My social anxiety has gone up, since the second time I didn\\'t even KNOW my friends were going to start smoking pot, when before I knew it, the cops showed up. Everyone around me has the attitude that in order to be successful you need to take risks, but I simply can\\'t have that attitude anymore. I\\'ve taken a risk and fell really fucking hard. It\\'s irrational, I know, but I can\\'t help it. That one night last year, I kept telling myself that the chances of the cops showing up are slim to none, my friends smoke here every day. And of course, the one day I decided to go with them, I get fucking caught. I\\'m the one who has to tell people that I was a pothead, me, the guy who only smoked about three times ever but got caught twice. Not the guys in college who smoke weed in their dorm rooms every day, or the people who binge drink every weekend and get close to death once a month. They can keep up their grades as good as I can, but *I\\'m* the one who has to \"pay\" for the two joints I\\'ve smoked. \\n\\nThe ways I calm myself down are:\\n\\n- Reminding myself that we live in an age where marijuana acceptance is rising at a faster pace every day. Employers are therefore more and more likely to look over my record as youthful ignorance than something more severe. They are also only misdemeanors, which employers are much more likely to skip over than felonies.\\n\\n- I have options. I live in a state that is obviously pretty tough on marijuana laws, despite 3 out of every 5 college students puffing up daily. I can move out to a state that\\'s more open-minded about it, and will maybe understand.\\n\\n- I\\'m still young (21) and have the rest of my life ahead of me. In twenty years, this whole thing will only be a blip on my radar. I should focus on making my life better for myself forty years from now, rather than at the moment. \\n\\nHowever, this whole deal just impairs my ability to think clearly and reason through situations like I normally would. I\\'m scared of getting into any relationship, since I\\'ll have to tell the girl eventually about what happened. I\\'m scared about meeting ANYONE new, because a quick Google search of my name plus my hometown will make it pop up (my town is uptight, and reports on every fucking arrest here). I\\'m scared to move into apartments with anyone, since they\\'ll have to know. I\\'m not the type of person you\\'d expect to even drink that much, so I have no idea how warped some of my relationships would become with the people who still don\\'t know. I\\'ve already lost friends because of this, but I don\\'t want to grow up alone. This whole situation has pervaded every aspect of my life and I constantly find myself wondering how much happier I would be if I just didn\\'t go out with my friends that one night. I already have been to therapy for this (court-ordered \"drug counseling\", but we treated it more like therapy because it was obvious I\\'m not addicted to anything), and that definitely helped me out a little, but the thoughts still persist. I sometimes feel depression creeping up on me, but I\\'ve learned how to make it go away.\\n\\nThe anxiety remains constant, though. I don\\'t know how I\\'m going to deal with it once I need to apply for real jobs. I just need to keep an open mind, and let my life flow on... Any advice would be appreciated.\\n\\nEdit: Just a little more backstory that I want to get out there. I was planning on becoming a teacher before this all happened, but after it happened, the chances of that were shot. I was forced to change my major by the school (since people with criminal records have close to zero percent chance of becoming a teacher in this state), and I went through a period of time over the summer when I just had absolutely no idea what to do with my life. I went through a phase where I wanted to become a musician, since I have a huge passion for music. However, I eventually reasoned through that by telling myself that my chances of getting a job as a musician are slim even *without* a criminal record. I eventually settled with Biomedical Engineering, which I am *incredibly* happy with. I feel comfortable with doing this. However, that period last summer really did a toll on me. I felt numb for weeks and weeks, not depressed but just *numb*. Like all the emotion was just drained out of me. I moved past that phase when I went back to school, but I sometimes get flashbacks to that part of my life. It was incredibly dark. I used to listen to lots of music, but I was so emotionally drained that I completely stopped. I would watch movies and start weeping at the dumbest little things for no reason, and then have no idea what was going on with the plot. I would listen to music and just hear sound, not music. It really changed me, but I moved on from that part in my life. It kinda feels like I made it out of the deep dark hole, but now I\\'m just in a more complicated cave with a little light here and there, even though I know the surface is just above my head.', 'I am freaking out right now, I have work at 2pm and I am battling the urge to call in sick or straight up quit. All because of a massive fuck up I made last night. \\n\\nYou ever have those moments when you look back at something you did and you\\'re like \"What the fuck was I even thinking?\" Well that happened to me last night. \\n\\nFor me, I take my job very seriously, especially since I work with live animals (dogs) and I pride myself on being a very good worker but last night I did something that I am having a hard time understanding and getting over. \\n\\n(My dog description is dog walker at a boarding facility.)\\n\\nI was in charge of one of the many hotel rooms and this dog usually gets medication with this meals (in the past some supervisors usually take his dinner and put in the meds) well this dog went swimming earlier so he wasn\\'t allowed to get his dinner until later. When the time came to feed him I was wondering if my supervisor had given the dog his meds because he didnt get fed yet. \\n\\nSo I went over to the meds sheet and read it, and I read it wrong. I thought the dog had not gotten his meds, so my thought process was:\\n\\n\"Okay he gets meds in his food.\"\\n\\n\"he has not gotten his food yet because he went swimming.\"\\n\\n\"The med sheet says he didnt get them\" (Which I was wrong about)\\n\\n\"Ill just give them to him now\"\\n\\nAnd then I just went ahead and did it without any further thought, when I put the bowl down I told my supervisor via the walkie and he freaked out! He said he already gave the dog the meds without food and came running in the room, he then showed me that I had misread the medication sheet. \\n\\nI feel like a total IDIOT. The mfedication fortunately is not going to hurt the dog which was our main concern, even though my supervisor wasn\\'t overtly angry at me I know just how badly this looks and I am so angry at myself.\\n\\nBefore this I have never messed up so stupendously. Its like my brain completely failed me because even if the dog actually didn\\'t get his meds ITS NOT MY JOB TO GIVE THEM. I know that, and at the very least why didn\\'t I ask before I went ahead with it? I\\'m having a hard time understanding why I just went and did without thinking because I know better than that. I just can\\'t forgive myself for fucking up so bad.  \\n\\nI feel like I am never going to get over this, when I realized how stupid I was I started having an axiety attack, my supervisor said to calm down because the dog would be okay but that I was getting written up. I completely accepted the write up and told him I take full responsibilty for my actions. But all night into this morning I keep going over it in my brain and giving my self anxiety to the point I feel ill. What if I had killed that dog? Why didn\\'t I stop myself and realize what I was doing? I just dont understand my actions because I have never done something like that and I dont think my managers will either. \\n\\nI sent a message to my manager explaining the situation and expressing my deepest regrets but I just dont know if I can work here anymore.\\nArgh. ', \"Hey all, I've posted here a few times before but got too anxious about them and deleted them after some time, ah. Anywho, I'd like to share my current journey!\\n\\nLate November, I finally decided it was time to try out medication. I was prescribed 10mg of Fluoxetine (Prozac). I was on it for a month and only noticed very adverse affects from worsened suicidal thoughts to vertigo to mood swings and anger.\\n\\nI got swapped over to 25mg of Sertraline (Zoloft). The instructions stated that I could up my dose by one pill each day if I felt I didn't have enough after 7-10 days. Two weeks pass of feeling okay, when I suddenly became detached and extremely upset. I upped my dose in hopes of feeling better. Nope -- I felt much worse. Suicidal thoughts every moment, crying at everything, and huge fits. Insomnia out the butt, stuff like that.\\n\\nWhen I finally saw my doc again after a month of starting Zoloft, she gave me 25mg of Hydroxyzine Pamoate (Vistaril) PRN, gave me a Vitamin D supplement (my levels were extremely low), and instructed me to taper off the Zoloft. I put off the Vistaril for a while and when I tried it, it helped me sleep...for a minimum of 12 hours. So I avoid taking that at all costs.\\n\\nNot too long after I already started tapering off the Zoloft, my doctor sent me a message saying she spoke to a more experienced doctor saying I should actually bump my dose up to 75mg and possibly even 100mg. I got incredibly anxious but did it anyway. And things just got worse. I self-harmed a few times for the first time in a while and planned out a few suicides and such. I stayed at 75 and refused to go up to 100.\\n\\nSaw my doctor again for my monthly follow-up and was instructed to taper off and given an Rx for 10mg of Escitaprolam Oxalate (Lexapro). I followed her instructions to taper down every 3 days and even extended it a bit since it's been snowing a bunch here and I haven't been able to stop by the pharmacy. I ended up running out and going through withdrawal (dizziness, brain zaps, etc). It was very uncomfortable.\\n\\nThankfully, I was able to pick up the Lexapro the next day (about a week ago) and so far it has been heavensent! Besides the headache of a new med the first night, everything has been going smoothly. Well, one other thing I can complain about is sleeping so well that I am prolly a hypersomniac right now. I'm hoping it's just my body catching up on sleep.\\n\\nBut really, to think I may have found the right meds so soon alone makes me joyful. Each day I wake up and actually want to get out of bed and do something for myself or work or socialise a bit. I saw my friends for the first time in several months, got my hair cut at long last, and haven't cried in a while. Even my nightmares are slowly going away. I don't want to kill myself. I want to live. And it feels so great. I can only hope this for other people and offer my full support now that I am much more stable!\\n\\nMuch love, and many thanks to those that listened and responded to my concerns before:)\", \"A few months ago I switched to a new medication, mirtazapine.  I started out on 15 mg and switched ~8 weeks ago to 30 mg.  I used to smoke marijuana every night and it made me feel great.  Now on this new medication it's making me feel panicky. \\nI've also started getting this tightness/numbness/squeezing/vague pain down my left arm and every time it happens I'm instantly convinced it's a heart attack and I'm going to die. \\nI'm just really down now because it's my 21st birthday on Saturday and all my friends have recently abandoned me, maybe because I'm just a mess.  I was planning on just staying home with my bf and smoking/drinking but now this pain in my arm is making me paranoid that if I alter my state in any way it's going to give me a heart attack and I'll die. So I'm probably going to spend my birthday sitting with my thoughts and fearing the future and feeling sorry for myself that I can't just have a good time like everyone else does on their 21st. And that makes me feel like a selfish child.\\n\\nI'm feeling on edge every second and CONSTANTLY on the verge of tears.  I'm taking 18 credits at school which is also very stressful.  I can't unwind at all because my anxiety won't let me.  I love video games and drawing but haven't been able to enjoy either because I'm constantly on edge and can't calm down enough to do anything. \\nI've been sleeping horribly, waking up every few hours and feeling the arm pain that drives me insane.  \\nI exercise daily and try to eat well and I'm so scared that I will never get better.  I dont want to live my entire life in fear and sadness and panic. This semester is ending soon and I'm getting straight As but im just ready to quit school. I quit my job yesterday partly out of severe anxiety.  I also visited a drop-in therapist yesterday through my college and literally just sat in an office with a stranger and cried uncontrollably for 2 hours.  I don't really know what I'm asking for I guess I just need to talk about how bad I'm doing because no one listens to me in real life\", 'My anxieties used to be reserved to just that constant anxious feeling. It seems like I\\'ve learned to control that better now - thanks to meds, therapy, and my girlfriend. She\\'s so kind, understanding, and loving and she\\'s just been my source of stability and relaxation. The problem now seems to be that I get horrible panic attacks. Today I had one. \\n\\nMy girlfriend is currently in Morocco studying the language and culture and I\\'m just working on the road for the summer. We don\\'t get to talk very much because of the time change and it\\'s dependent on when I get off work. Anyways, I finally skyped with her today and she\\'s so happy. I tried my best to be happy for her, but something felt wrong. Something was nagging inside me. I faked my smiles for her, told her I was doing alright, and wished her well, then I went about my day. I had to drive out of town to my next job site, it\\'s about a two hour drive. On the way there I started taking my deep breaths and trying to keep it together. Half way there my breathing was becoming labored and it finally just hit. I kept balling my eyes out and kept trying to steady my breathing. It was so damn hard. I almost had to pull over to the side of the road because I was getting light headed. My fears hit me full force and I\\'m still trying to keep myself contained. When I saw her face and heard her voice, she seemed happier than ever - happier away from me. Her parents hate me because they think I\\'m fucked up due to some issues with my family and they constantly give her shit about being with me. She\\'s there to hold my hand through the dark times and she tells me she loves me and wants to be with me, but what if she\\'s happier without me? All I want to do is make her happy - that\\'s what I live for with her. I love seeing her smile and enjoy life but I can\\'t help but feel that I\\'m not enough anymore. She\\'s given herself fully to me, and I to her but hearing her say things like, \"it\\'s heaven here\" and \"I never want to come back\" just makes all the fear and hopelessness well up inside me. \\n\\nI need her, I told her that I need her. I told her that she gave me a reason to keep on living when I had felt that there was nothing more for me to look forward to. She seemed overwhelmed by this. I now fear that I\\'ve trapped her into feeling that she\\'s obligated to stay with me, even if her feelings change, but I don\\'t want that to be the case, I just want what\\'s best for her and I just hope and pray that what\\'s best for her is what\\'s best for the both of us. \\n\\n', \"After months of contemplating getting help.. Wednesday I actually looked forward to finally having that conversation with my doctor about my anxiety and panic attacks. I meditated before I left and my mom drove me. For the first time in months I didn't feel anxious in the car, we actually went out of my comfort/safe zone. The appointment went great, my doctor prescribed me some meds to try and we headed back home. I was supposed to stop at the pharmacy and go back to the office get my shot. When we were heading towards our exit it started pouring, my mom could barely see our exit. We hydroplaned and slammed into a big truck in front of us. For the next hour it was a horrible dream and the worst panic attack I couldn't pull myself out of. My ears were ringing and I got out to pull my mom out but she was unconscious. Someone pulled over and helped my mom while I called for help. \\n\\nMy mom ended up being taken to the hospital in the icu and I refused treatment and my brother brought me home. The accident was just a couple minutes away from our house. I spent the next several hours in the bathroom dry heaving, shaking and weak. Took forever for the shock to wear off. I've never been in an accident before. I still don't feel right, me entire body aches. Or that I'm here. Most of the impact was on my side and I don't understand how I wasn't injured and how I walked away from it. \\n\\nI don't know where to go from here. I woke up last night hyperventilating thinking I was still in the car. I can still smell the smoke and dust from the air bags. \", \"I have been on antidepressents without break for about 6 years now (diagnosed with GAD and depression, now also starting to question getting looked at for ASD which my son has been diagnosed with).\\n\\nStarted on Pristiq, gradually went up in dosage over the years, and then at the recommendation of my GP switched to Effexor (as I had been increasing my dosage, side effects increased. While Effexor is pretty much the same thing as Pristiq, my GP said she'd had some patients who found that their built up tolerance to one didn't apply to the other, and so had success switching to the other at a lower dosage).\\n\\nUnfortunately (and perhaps not surprisingly), I found myself having to increase my dosage on Effexor much faster than originally with Pristiq, and the side effects were even worse (the worst being decreased libido and ED).\\n\\nI am now looking at switching over to Mirtazapine, which looks like it will be a much better med for me. However prior to starting on the Mirtazapine I need to come off the Effexor. I have been decreasing my dosage weekly for several weeks now, and am now on my last week (on a 37.5mg dose). Each week I have found myself becoming more and more irritable, and getting incredibly (and instantly) angry at the smallest triggers. This is much worse towards the end of the day (I am taking Effexor in the mornings).\\n\\nWhat I'm wondering though, is are these feelings a result of coming off the drugs, or is this an accurate picture of what I'm like without them?\\n\\nPrior to starting on antidepressents, I was a very angry and irritable person (and still was to a degree after going on them). However what I'm experiencing now is a whole other level.\\n\\nIf I had to put a number on my anger and irritability before any meds, I'd say I was a frequent 8/10. After starting on meds, an often 6/10, and sometimes 8/10. Now I feeling like I'm at an 11/10 for more than half the day, every day.\\n\\nWould love to here others thoughts/experiences/opinions.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nWow, thanks for the support everyone! Glad to hear that this isn't uncommon. \", 'Hello everyone,\\n\\nI\\'ve been dating my girlfriend for 2 years and living together for one, and we\\'re really great together.  I really think that she\\'s the one I want to be with for the rest of my life, but she has a myriad of personal issues that she struggles with which prevents her from truly seeing/believing that.\\n\\nBasically, she has a complete lack of confidence in herself and it seeps into every aspect of her life.  At any moment, she could begin to have \"bad thoughts\" which are (according to her) overwhelming and uncontrollable.  During these times, she constantly wonders why I would want to be with someone who is \"like her\" (she doesn\\'t say or know what this actually means beyond feeling awkward and weird), and the effort to feel \"normal\" and just being herself can be physically exhausting for her.\\n\\nShe says things like \"why aren\\'t you with someone else?\", \"why do you put up with me\" or \"why would you want to help me?  My problems are just stupid anyways.\"  She thinks with absolute certainty that I\\'m going to leave her because of how inadequate she is.  She refuses to spend time with friends because she feels like she will \"interfere\" with their lives.  She refuses to participate in activities with me because she believes I\\'m just trying to appease her and would really much rather do things on my own.\\n\\nAnyways, without making this much longer, I need some advice.   She has tried therapy in the past but never \"buys into it\" (her words).  She refuses to try medication and never did the \"homework\" given to her by her therapists (ie. write down something nice about yourself everyday).  I find myself getting frustrated because she just accepts the same circular logic that she will never change the things that she hates herself for because she\\'s inadequate because she\\'ll never change.  \\n\\nWhat can I possibly do differently to help her cope with normal everyday life?  She has a good job (which is what she\\'s been wanting to do for a decade or more), she has friends (when she chooses to see them), she has me, she has family.  She has all the things that make life great, yet for a significant percentage of the time I feel like she\\'s miserable.  What advice can I give her that\\'s going to enable her to feel not just adequate, but needed and loved?\\n\\n ', 'Hi guys,\\n\\nI’m not sure where to post this. I’m new here, but I guess I just need to vent/get some advice.\\n\\nI suffer from social anxiety. I\\'m a female gamer who over the years has isolated myself because I enjoy reading, gaming, etc. over partying &amp; socializing. but deep down, this is because I am afraid to socialize, and deep down, I want to be able to socialize without fretting over who\\'s going to be there/if I\\'m being awkward, etc. etc.\\n\\nI seem to be stuck in this notion that I\\'m supposed to be doing the things that other people my age are doing: socializing &amp; partying (I\\'m almost 25). I used to be incredibly social/outgoing (probably because of my drug use during that time), but since I\\'ve lost a lot of my friends over the years, I\\'ve started to withdraw &amp; isolate myself. this has been going on for a couple of years now. however, there are a lot of factors involved because of this... last year I pretty much lost my mind after getting randomly fired from my job, which lead into a deep depression. I also detoxed off of suboxone last year (this is my first year without any opiates/opioids in my body since 2008), which has definitely contributed to the emotional &amp; mental changes I\\'ve been dealing with. I\\'ve also impulsively went back to school, got a \"real, adult\" job (however, I don\\'t regret this or going back to school at all), and moved out of my town to my boyfriend\\'s town where he grew up. so I already know some of the root causes as to why I am afraid to socialize now.\\n\\nanyway...\\n\\nI live with my boyfriend &amp; a roommate, but I always want to stay inside and do my own thing. any time some sort of social event comes up, I get incredibly anxious. I am then confronted with two options: to go or to stay home. 98% of the time I choose the latter. I end up challenging my social anxiety about every 3 months, but then realize how boring/miserable I am in the social situation, so I end up just not going out. but then this leads to depression/more anxiety down the line because I feel like I\\'m a figment of everyone\\'s imagination. some weird hermit who does nothing but stay inside, even on beautiful days. I guess I feel the need to, for some reason, prove something to other people, but I don\\'t know why. I guess I care too much about what others thing about me now.\\n\\nI\\'m usually okay with staying home. since like I said, I enjoy some time to myself every now &amp; then because there\\'s not much privacy here in the apartment, but then when my boyfriend chooses to go out without me, I end up feeling anxious as well. I always want the opposite of what I get. I want time to myself, but then when he says he\\'s leaving, I want him to stay. I want to him stay, but then when he says he\\'s not leaving, I want him to leave. I make things incredibly complicated for absolutely no reason &amp; continue to give myself/my boyfriend a hard time, sometimes. usually, I just end up judging/beating myself up because of the emotions that arise. I think it\\'s ridiculous that I feel this way still. I\\'ve been with my boyfriend for over two years now, and I\\'m sick of the constant thoughts in my head about what he\\'s doing when he\\'s out, if I\\'m just crazy, the debates on whether I should stay or go that constantly happen over &amp; over again, back &amp; forth in my head... I don\\'t know. I don\\'t really know how to stop this when an overwhelming emotion arises, usually because of the situations I just described.\\n\\nI am in therapy &amp; on medications, and have recently been reading about Buddhism, since I need something more. this has helped, but not during the times when the overwhelming emotions paralyze me/consume me, but I guess that\\'s part of just practicing Buddhism, which is a long road involving lots of patience without any judgments.\\n\\nI guess I just needed to vent, or hear someone relate to my struggles, or relating to my struggles, but with a story of how you overcame it. I can use any advice/tips/whatever you can give me.\\n\\nsometimes, I just feel so alone.', \"Hello, so I'm going to try to keep this straightforward with main points but I'll answer all questions and provide any additional information that is required.\\n\\nMy girlfriend of 2 years suffers from severe anxiety, and it has gotten much worse over the last few months. Here are some major points about her that I notice.\\n\\n**1)** She smokes tons of weed, roughly 2 grams a day, BUT we have been able to cut that down significantly over the last week, and we are continuing to get her to stop (though it is extremely hard since she's been smoking weed for many fews now, and always a lot)\\n\\n**2)** Her eating patterns have gotten MUCH worse, she has always been an extremely picky eater (does not like lots of meat, mostly likes pasta, will not eat any fish, will not go near any ethnic food), she's barely eating now, she says she has no appetite, but she does not struggle with eating disorders or body image problems, she even recognizes she's too thin.\\n\\n**3)** She gets tons of nightmares, and she's constantly waking up in the middle of the night, 4-5am, and she says its hard for her to fall back asleep (i'm thinking weed has something to do with this, so hopefully once we cut it out, her sleeping patterns will be better)\\n\\n**4)** She places SOOOO much stress and pressure on herself of what she needs to accomplish, she is currently a teacher (she just started), as the school year is approaching an end, she has not been supplying at all, she will confirm supply shifts, but cancel them last minute (around 5-6am), which then further ruins her day and she tells herself she is a failure, she's ruining her life, she lost all this money. (I helped her spending habits, and encouraged her to get rid of all her debt and start a saving, which she has saved for $5,000 from January to now, but still says it isn't enough, it isn't enough and freaks out.\\n\\n**5)** She has tons of chest pains, and says theres this feeling that something is constantly wrong, or something bad is going to happen (but it never does)\\n\\n**6)** She cuts herself, hits herself, breaks things in her room, abuses drugs, supposedly takes 10 pills of Tylenol but always throws them up after realizing she doesn't want to do that i'm assuming (i've never seen any of this, so i don't know how true it is that she downs 10 pills) BUT I have told her that she cannot be doing this anymore, especially if she loves me, I've always been understanding and patient with her, but with cutting, or saying she's going to commit suicide or taking all these pills, after a few times I've told her i WILL NOT stand for that and that she CANNOT do this, and i was very firm with her about it, and told her many times and she hasn't done it since (THANK GOD).\\n\\nSO what I've tried everything possible, you name it, i'm always patient and understanding, i've given all the support and love, i do get frustrated and mad sometimes, i've tried tough love, i've get motivational stuff, i've tried just being there to hold her and tell her i'm here its okay, i've just listened, i've tried everything, but nothing works.\\n\\nMY ONLY concern is that she doesn't get put on all these medications her whole life, i am very much against long term usage, if she needs to take whatever medicines for a few months, i'm okay with it, but i don't want her on anxiety or depression pills her whole life, its not curing the problem, its just masking/numbing it.\\n\\nPlease help me, my heart is breaking day by day, i'm sick to my stomach, i'm so scared and worried, she used to be a lot happier, now all she does is lay in bed, barely eats, cries all day, and freaks out.

From where I\\'m sitting, at 30 years of age, I think the experience of undergoing the tests was probably the most traumatic one I\\'ve ever had.  I can think of a time in college that may have given it a run for its money, but I would put them as equal at most.  Nothing was explained to me, my parents were less than sympathetic, and the process was one of alternating terror and physical pain (seriously - you try subjecting a 7-year-old to patch and subcutaneous allergy tests with no comfort and see what happens).  Follow that up with years of weekly injections to get my allergies under control, which freaked me out just as much as the tests.\\n\\nEnd result?  Lifelong (until now) anxiety and trepidation about any kind of doctor visit or medical procedure.  Cold sweats and pounding heart from the minute I walked into the waiting room, dry mouth talking to the doc, the whole 9 yards.\\n\\n6 months ago I went in for a physical - first one I\\'d had in 16 years.  Doc said I was overdue for a tetanus/DTaP booster.  Oh heeeeeeeeell no, trypanophobe me is having none of that.  Little 7-year-old me, ruling with an iron fist from the back of my mind, would not stand for it.  Well I felt like shit.  Thought I offended my doctor by refusing consent, thought myself an overreacting idiot, all that jazz.  Anyway, finally decided that enough was enough.\\n\\nI\\'ve been employing a combination of CBT (with an amazing therapist my equally-amazing GP recommended) and low-dose alprazolam and, finally, went to the doctor last Thursday.  I declined a flu immunization (both the shot and the nasal spray, as I\\'ve been gifted with the immune system that ate Manhattan, which is a damn good thing given my staunch refusal to get jabbed over the past half of my life) and he jokingly said \"Gee, how\\'d I know you wouldn\\'t want a flu shot?\"  (Seriously, he\\'s awesome.)  He was all ready to wrap up the appointment when, despite my pounding heart breaking through the relaxation methods I was taught AND the Xanax, I said to wait a minute.\\n\\nI came here for a reason and god dammit, this was getting done.\\n\\nI *requested* the DTaP booster.  Said that I *wanted* it.  Not just that I\\'d grudgingly accept it, but that I had an active desire to go through with it.\\n\\nHe showed me the needle in its packaging, let me hold it, answered my questions about it (1\" long, full length goes in to reach the muscle, etc.).\\n\\nHim: \"I don\\'t want to pressure you.  Of course I always recommend it but only you can say if you\\'re at a point where you\\'re okay with this.\"\\nMe: \"...Yes.  Let\\'s do it.\"\\n\\nHe came back a minute later with the shot.  I pulled up my sleeve, he swabbed my arm with an alcohol wipe, pinched up a lump of upper-arm flesh just below my shoulder (I think), and in went the needle.\\n\\nAnd you know what?  I didn\\'t feel a goddamn thing.  The mild soreness that followed the next day was a hundred times worse, and that was easily taken care of (read: nuked from orbit) by a couple aspirin.  I felt him pinching my arm (not painful) and a sensation of pressure, and that was it.\\n\\nWent back to my therapist the following Monday and told her all about it - she was overjoyed for me.  I mentioned that my doctor was very patient with me and verified multiple times that I did indeed want to get the shot, and she joked \"Wow, he really made you work for it, huh?\"  I expressed concern that despite going through her deep-relaxation exercise both at home and in the waiting room, and having taken a Xanax in between, that I was still anxious in the doctor\\'s office, but she said that a big part of therapy is moving away from black &amp; white thinking.  \"That you got it done is a win.  Your victory condition isn\\'t a total absence of anxiety and being cool as a cucumber, it\\'s being in a better place than you were, and it sounds like you definitely are.  You\\'ve moved from black and white to shades of grey, and that means you can keep getting better bit-by-bit.\"  I said I was hoping to reauthor my mental definition of the process to take the power away from the allergy-treatment memories, and I succeeded.\\n\\nThe memories still suck, and I\\'m still unhappy with my parents for handling the allergy issues the way they did (neither one doing anything that I could remember to explain/demystify the experience, dad being borderline angry in his impatience with my reactions, for which they haven\\'t and probably never will apologize^(1)), but I have a new way of processing and regarding those memories now.\\n\\nStill seeing my therapist and occasionally using the Xanax for other ongoing anxiety matters, but this one I can definitely say has improved drastically.  I\\'m happy to give people the names of my doctors (GP, therapist, psychiatrist) if you want - just PM me.\\n\\nI know everyone responds to different forms of treatment differently, but what I hoped to convey was that even the thickest fog can be seen through if you find the right treatments, and you can do that if you commit to it and level with your doctors/therapists, saying \"I want this to work, I don\\'t know if it will, and can you help me find something that does if this doesn\\'t?\"\\n\\ntl;dr Childhood medical procedures fucked me up with serious anxiety about anything to do with doctors; decided after 16 years it was time to fix it; fixed it.\\n\\n^1 EDIT: In case you\\'re reading this, Mom &amp; Dad, no apology means no forgiveness.

I since grew out of that one, but the noise related fears with guns and even a silly plastic balloon still gives me mild to severe panic attacks. It's gotten to the point that if I attend an event like a theatrical performance where a gun is fired I avoid it at all costs because I fear the sound so much. (This is also a problem because i'm an aspiring actress and I dread the day that I could be cast in a production that would use such a thing).

I don't like admitting I have a fear of guns and balloons at age 19. \\n\\nOn top of all of of this I have severe self loathing issues because of my irrational fears. I hit myself sometimes because I can't believe how stupid I am. Sometimes it gets so bad that I want nothing more than to die because I hate the person I am. I also have a lot of issues making new friends and keeping friendships because I don't trust people easily. I love being alone but I desperately wish I had friends I could love and trust. \\nI'm crying as I write this because I just realized that my whole life has been me living in fear of stupid things.

I'm also scared of paying hundreds of dollars for a therapist. I can barely afford to put gas in my car let alone drop hundreds for a therapist. But yet I think I desperately need one.

I realized that over the course of several months of being on this medication I began to stop answering my friends text messages, stopped becoming enthusiastic about anything, and my interest in anything was very slight at best. I used to be a very outgoing and happy person. I used to love having conversations. I used to love human interaction. Things began to get really bad when I've started pushing my girlfriend away.

Do i need to consult and doctor and take meds?\\n\\nHi,\\n     I've started noticing some alarming symptoms that happen to me in moments of panic, or high stress situations.  I could be overreacting so I figured I'll describe my situation here before consulting a doctor.\\n\\nI recently got a manual transmission car and am naturally in the process of learning how to drive it proficiently.  As a result I try to take my driving slowly and follow the posted speed limit religiously.  \\n\\nScenario 1:\\nCouple of days ago I was going 46mph on a back road which had a posted speed limit of 45mph.  A minivan began tailgating me and flashing his lights at me for not going faster.  I tried my best to ignore it and kept going at a similar pace since the car ahead of me was also going the same pace. This was a single lane back road so I couldn't exactly let the minivan pass.  Then suddenly the minivan driver accelerated into the oncoming lane to overtake me and dangerously merged back into our lane maybe 4 feet away from my car almost clipping my front left fender.  I immediately laid on the horn for a good 5 seconds.  Then I noticed my heart rate spike up and I could distinctly feel my left foot shaking/twitching.  It was bad enough that i was not confident in my shifting and was having trouble simply keeping the clutch depressed.  I'm pretty sure my hands were shaking too but didn't notice it since I was holding the steering wheel with both hands.  As u might know, you need your left foot in a manual car to operate the clutch and change gears so my shaking foot alarmed me even more and I had a moment of panic.  Then I took the next intersection I could find and pulled over on the dirt/grass next to the side street to collect myself.  My adrenaline was soo high that even after i reached home 20+minutes later my mom remarked why my hands were shaking.\\n\\nScenario 2:\\nCouple of days later I was driving around later at night while my dad gave me pointers on what mistakes to improve on.  I pulled up at a 4 way stop sign that had an incline.  As soon as I lifted off the brake and engaged 1st gear, my car started rolling backwards.  Similar (although less pronounced) symptoms of shaky hands and accelerated heart rate happened.  The honking from the suv behind me worsened the situation and i just froze.  I failed hard at that moment and had to ask my dad to switch with me and take the wheel.  This time there was no shaking/twitching left foot, only shaky hands and increased heart rate. \\n\\nBackground: \\nI had to take a medical leave of absence due to depression &amp; anxiety from graduate school last year.  It was the darkest period of my life with the high stress of my first year of graduate school, first time living alone with crappy roommates and being emotionally impacted by my parents divorce all at the same time.  I had a psychosis episode and was advised to take a year off.  I took a medication named Risperdal for 3 months.  I was slowly weaned off it in those 3 months since my anxiety improved.  The last time I took the medication was match[march] of 2013.  Thankfully I re-started my graduate school program with the next incoming class (bc I was a year behind now) and successfully completed my first year.  \\n\\nConcerns:\\nI'm concerned weather this could be an alarming symptom of an underlying problem that i need to address.  After my psychosis episode of 2014[no, 2013] i have lost my confidence that I once had in undergrad.

I want to be able to grow but I\\'m almost paralyzed by this. I\\'m already socially awkward so I would make a fool of myself, but I can handle that.

I toughed it out for awhile because I thought it was a stomach bug and that it had nothing to do with anxiety since I had never had it before. After a couple of months I went to the doctor and was put on Lexapro. After a very short time, things got a lot better, I gained weight back, was able to eat and didnt have to worry about getting sick in public. The only side-effects I remember were excessive yawning and sweating. Then, I can't remember why but I switched to effexor. Effexor worked great (only noticed a bit more sweating) and I took that up until about 5 months ago when I decided that I wanted to try living without medication. I worked with my doctors to taper off of it slowly and still had some withdrawal symptoms but was able to get through the month or so that I experienced them. \\n\\n\\nMore recently: My anxiety is not nearly as bad as before but I still often get that sick feeling when I go out with friends so I had my doctor prescribe me Klonopin at .5 mg to take as needed because I wanted to try everything that I could before going back to taking meds every day. I noticed that when I would take a klonopin, that I was actually able to sit down and focus even if I didnt take my adderal and its even better if I take them together. This is how I found out that my anxiety was also causing problems that I had with focusing and getting things done (Which Ive had for a while). My main problems that led me to see my doctor again were \\n\\n1.) I am always tired mentally no matter the amount of sleep that I get.\\n\\n2.) My ADD medications were not helping me focus anymore, they only helped combat the tired feeling in my head. I'm having trouble doing the things that I like to do (produce music and DJ)\\n\\n3.) The Stomach feeling \\n\\n\\n\\nNow to the present: I was prescribed Remeron (Mirtazapine 15mg) yesterday and took it for the first time last night. I took it at about 8:30-9pm and I was knocked out cold by 10pm. I wasnt able to get out of bed until about 12:30pm today and even then I went and laid down on the couch because I felt very foggy and zombie like. I was scheduled to work at 5pm but ended up calling out because I didn't feel safe to drive, or even work for that matter (I'm a barback so its pretty labor intensive).\\n\\n\\nI'm currently working two jobs and my next scheduled shift isn't until Thursday at 7 pm, but then I'm also scheduled on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I'm going to try the remeron one more time tonight but if I wake up feeling the same way, I think that I'm going to have to stop taking it completely and go back to either effexor or lexapro because I can not miss anymore work (there isn't anyone else that could cover for me). I understand that it can take a while for these side effects to go away but I don't have the time to find out as I'm scheduled to work almost 6 days a week between both of my jobs.\\n\\n\\nI'm just looking for some advice because I do not know if I will be able to get an appointment with my doctor before I work again. I dont know if its okay to stop taking the remeron after two days, if I should just replace it with effexor/lexapro again and try a different route for fixing my focus issues?

This is because this parasite is hella dangerous for humans, while not so dangerous for dogs. Basically, it's very tough to get rid of and complications might kill you. You get it by, for instance, touching a dog's nose after it has licked its ass and gotten flatworm eggs in his face, which you swallow the next time you put a finger in your mouth or whatever.

I\\'ve been diagnosed with GAD for 2 years, though it\\'s likely I\\'ve been suffering from anxiety in some form since elementary school. I was in therapy (cognitive behavioral, no meds) for around a year but haven\\'t been seeing anyone recently. I made a big life change about a year ago, moving across the country, and I\\'ve noticed the anxiety starting to interfere with my life more.\\nI\\'m female. I\\'m a full time graduate student and I also work full time. \\n\\nToday I came home and sat down for a while, did homework, etc. Normal stuff. I\\'m getting ready to go to bed and I notice on my night stand is a slip from the maintenance people at my apartment complex. Pest inspection. I wasn\\'t warned about them coming in, so my apartment is a wreck. Part of my anxiety (depression?), I\\'m starting to realize, is the inability to clean up after myself or do normal adult type things. I\\'m not lazy- I do other chores and I\\'m always proactive at work and school. But I\\'ll tell myself to clean and it just doesn\\'t happen. I literally wait to clean my apartment until someone is coming over. I can\\'t talk to my parents about this because I\\'ve just now started to convince them that I\\'m a responsible adult (even though I don\\'t feel like one).\\nI don\\'t think it was a citation that was delivered, rather a notice that I need to clean and that my apartment was treated for pests. \\nHere\\'s the bad part: I totally flip out. My immediate reaction was to clean, like doing it now is going to reverse what someone saw. So I did that. It\\'s 75% cleaner than it was. My next instinct is to go down to the office tomorrow morning and confess, because the way it makes me feel is that I\\'m a criminal. (Something similar has happened before with a minor traffic accident where I was convinced I was going to be arrested even though it wasn\\'t my fault). Any minor citation of wrong doing and I totally lose it. I don\\'t know whether or not to go down there to even ask about if I will be charged for anything because I\\'m afraid they will make me remove my cat for the damages she causes and I can\\'t live without her (cat is approved on the lease). I\\'m afraid that if I raise any issue with them they will have a list of all these things I\\'ve done unrelated to the current issue and act on them. My anxiety makes me pretty paranoid sometimes and nervous and it makes me seem like I can\\'t be taken seriously when I do talk to someone about a problem I have with them. \\nSo, onto the real problem.\\nWhile freaking out for a good 2-3 hours, I noticed a thought come into my head that I\\'ve never had before. I\\'ve never been suicidal ONCE in my life, but, I thought \"God I am so tired of having all this anxiety. I wish it would go away. Anything is better than this, and if I remove myself from life it would go away. That sounds really nice. I just want to be done. I could take some pills right now and it would all be over with.\" I didn\\'t have to fight myself too hard to make the thought go away but I\\'m a little freaked out right now. \\nI guess I just don\\'t know what to do now. I want someone to tell me that this is such a small issue I shouldn\\'t be reacting the way I\\'m reacting (I know that). Usually talking it out (what I\\'ve done above) really helps me, so I may just be using this format as a sounding board, like I do my friends. But this suicidal thought really threw me for a loop. I\\'ve contacted my grad school\\'s free counseling, but the last time I was there I was referred out, and I don\\'t have insurance that covers normal therapists. It doesn\\'t seem urgent enough to be seen right away but I don\\'t know.\\n\\nWow that was long. \\ntl;dr I\\'m probably freaking out about nothing as per usual but I want someone to tell me it\\'s ok?', \"I've been dealing with anxiety for about 19 years now (since I was 12).  At the moment it's reasonably managed with medication.

They're just annoying.  I've only now begun to wonder if they're related to my anxiety.  All of these things I deal with on a daily basis but 99% of the time I have no problem taking a moment and then moving on.\\n\\nI don't like things touching me.  This applies mostly to collared shirts (such as polos - I'm required to wear one as part of my work uniform), sleeves that hit in the middle of my upper arm, my hair (on my head), and jewelry (this is off and on but more prominent with necklaces and dangling earrings).  I also have problems with my leg hair and eyebrows, nails (having any dirt or residue under them as well has dry or overgrown cuticles).\\n\\nI don't have trich and I don't pull out my hair but the urge to shave my head or my eyebrows is often strong.  Right now I'm growing out a pixie cut and the growth is just long enough to tuck under my polo shirt collar but not long enough to put into a ponytail.  My hair doesn't bother me nearly as much when it's longer and I can pull it back (but the pixie was nice, too).  I've never given in to the urge to shave my head or eyebrows.\\n\\nI pick a lot at skin abnormalities.  Pimples, scabs (I have two cats so scratches aren't abnormal for me), spots of dry skin.  I've even gone to my face with tweezers to pull out sebaceous filaments when I can see and feel them.  Same goes for wax buildup in my ears, eye crusties (removing them in the morning gives me satisfaction), and boogers.\\n\\nI like wearing makeup but some days I can't stand the feeling of it on my (especially foundation) and have to wash my face in the middle of the day at work in order to feel better).\\n\\nAaand I didn't realize much stuff there was until I started writing it all out.  Yikes.\\n\\nLike I said, I feel this way daily but it rarely makes me feel overly anxious or panicked.  I just now begun to realize that it's not normal and may be related to my anxiety and that dealing with it might make me happier and more relaxed.  \\n\\nDoes anybody else here experience the same?

It started out of no where, and I can't really seem to pin point any major stressor in my life. Most of my panic attacks just result in me on the floor hyperventilating a bit, and basically feeling really shitty. \\n\\nIt is important to note that a lot of my anxiety is health related. Even simple things set me off. Well the stress has been giving me all sorts of odd symptoms which has led to more stress thanks to my health anxiety. I feel weak, have acid reflux, tight chest, feeling out of breath, pain in weird spots, numbness, hyper vigilant, and all sorts of crazy things. They all appear and disappear in a seemingly random fashion. \\n\\nWell last night I felt like I couldn't breathe. It was was bad. Probably related to my acid reflux. I freak out and tell my GF I need to go to the ER. This makes it way worse. We go to the ER and I try and calm myself in the parking lot as I know it is an anxiety attack, and don't want to go through the whole ER mess for them to just tell me it is a panic attack. \\n\\nI almost feel better, and then it gets worse. Way worse. Super light headed, can barely think. We get out of the car and start walking in and I can barely function. The line of course is pretty long, and almost kneeling on the floor waiting, can't breathe, can't think, it sucks. \\n\\nWe get called up finally and at this point I'm way out of it. The lady is asking me questions and I don't know if I even answered them. Had to sign a sheet and all I remember is telling the lady I can't sign and she is saying I have to lol. At this point my head is on the desk and I can't even move. Finally get a bit frustrated and force myself to get the pen and scribble in what I think was the signature line.\\n\\nI can't walk anymore so my GF gets a wheel chair and rolls me the 5 feet to the waiting area. At this point I pass out for a bit. But come back and feel almost pretty good. Still have some of the physical symptoms but have a bit of a calming feeling. \\n\\nFast forward 10 minutes and I am almost okay. The whole ordeal was a bit scary as I have never been unconscious like that before. This goes down as the worst panic attack I have had. But in hindsight there are a few big mistakes I made.\\n\\n1. I had propranolol (10mg) which I was prescribed to take as needed, and for some reason decided it wasn't needed. I have not taken it before and for some reason thought it would be a bad idea to take it during a panic attack. For those that don't know this is supposed to lower my blood pressure and slow my heart, basically blocks adrenaline from doing what it does. Probably would have kept me from getting as bad as I did.\\n\\n2. Fixated on my breathing. I do this a lot. I think I am not getting enough air, so I get worried and start hyperventilating. I needed to distract myself or just force myself to accept that my breathing was fine. I didn't do this, and mentally reinforced the idea that I couldn't breathe.\\n\\n3. Drank caffeine. I had cut out caffeine because of anxiety, but was feeling pretty good earlier in the day. I am taking Mirt to help me with sleeping, which makes me feel groggy, so figured I would be okay with downing a bit of caffeine. Nope.\\n\\nWell there it is. Another embarrassing moment thanks to my anxiety. My GF gets home in a few hours and I'm going to take the Propranolol since I still feel really on edge. I get too worried about taking medication the first time to try it in private, and don't really have anywhere I need to go right now. \\n\\nHave a therapist appointment (first one) next week, so hopefully I can last until then. \\n\\nI just realized I never said what happened at the ER. I started to feel better, so I let the desk know I wanted to leave. They had me sign a sheet, which I was actually able to do this time, and I left. Easy as that. I did feel anxious until I took my Mirt for the night, but then passed out till morning. Good times.\", \"I weened off of Lexapro 4 months ago when I got fired from my job.

This condition is characterized by irrational feelings of overwhelming worry and fear, often accompanied by physical symptoms such as gastrointestinal discomfort, trembling, sweating, and shortness of breath. Treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Northport generally includes prescription medications, often in combination with psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Anxiety disorders are often treated with SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medications, such as Zoloft or Prozac. However, benzodiazepines are also frequently prescribed in Northport as treatment for generalized anxiety disorder. Benzodiazepines are often effective in providing short-term relief from anxiety symptoms; however, they do carry some risk for dependency and addiction, which physicians must take into account when prescribing these medications in Northport.\\n\\nBenzodiazepines as Treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder\\n\\nBenzodiazepine medications are commonly prescribed in Northport as part of treatment for generalized anxiety disorder. In fact, four common benzodiazepines--- alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan) --- are among the top 100 most prescribed medications. Benzodiazepines work by enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid), which lends the drugs their sleep-inducing and anxiety-reducing effects. The most commonly used benzodiazepine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder is alprazolam (Xanax). Although benzodiazepines are often efficacious for managing anxiety symptoms in Northport, they are not without risk. According to current estimates, as many as 23% of people who take prescription benzodiazepines may be dependent on them. The risk of dependency on benzodiazepines is most strongly associated with long-term use.\\n\\nThe Dangers of Benzodiazepine Dependence\\n\\nBenzodiazepines tend to be federally scheduled due to risk of misuse. Although it is not unheard of for people in Northport to seek out benzodiazepines like Xanax illicitly for recreational purposes, many people who become dependent on these drugs were originally prescribed them for therapeutic purposes--- often as treatment for generalized anxiety disorder. Although not everyone who takes a medicine like alprazolam is necessarily going to become dependent on it, physicians in Northport generally take these risks into account when prescribing them. Most physicians feel that benzodiazepines are suitable only for short-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.\\n\\nPart of the reason that dependency to benzodiazepines can arise is that a person will develop a tolerance to the substances over time. Although tolerance to the sleep-inducing effects of benzodiazepines develops quickly, it takes longer for a tolerance to their anxiety-reducing effects to arise. Tolerance to benzodiazepines is associated with changes that occur in the number and sensitivity of GABA receptors, along with effects on other neurotransmitter symptoms and changes in genetic transcription and coding that arise as a result of long-term benzodiazepine use. When a person becomes physically dependent on a benzodiazepine, they cannot necessarily just stop taking the drug, because if they do, withdrawal symptoms may occur. \\n\\nBenzodiazepine Withdrawal Syndrome\\n\\nIf a person who is taking benzodiazepines for long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder develops a physical dependency, abrupt discontinuation of the drug can result in a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. An estimated 15-44% of long-term benzodiazepines users will experience withdrawal symptoms if they stop taking the drug. Withdrawal symptoms vary in severity, but in extreme cases they can include life-threatening effects like seizures. \\n\\nSymptoms of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may include:\\n\\n•\\tIncreased anxiety and panic attacks\\n\\n•\\tAgitation and restlessness\\n\\n•\\tMuscle aches\\n\\n•\\tDizziness\\n\\n•\\tDry mouth\\n\\n•\\tHot and cold flashes\\n\\n•\\tHeadache\\n\\n•\\tHypertension\\n\\n•\\tDiarrhea\\n\\n•\\tInsomnia\\n\\n•\\tImpaired concentration\\n\\n•\\tIncreased urinary frequency\\n\\n•\\tParanoia\\n\\n•\\tSweating\\n\\n•\\tIncreased heart rate\\n\\n•\\tTinnitus\\n\\n•\\tVisual disturbances\\n\\n•\\tConfusion\\n\\n•\\tDelusions\\n\\n•\\tHallucinations\\n\\n•\\tIrritability\\n\\n\\nLong-term benzodiazepine use affects GABA receptors in the brain, and may even cause changes in genetic processes. This results in the development of a tolerance, and even of physical dependence on the substances. Although benzodiazepines such as Xanax are relatively safe for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms, they are not suitable for long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Better treatment options for anxiety in Northport include safer drugs that do not result in dependency, such as SSRIs; psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavior therapy; and neurofeedback therapy, an exciting treatment modality recently available in Northport that uses EEG biofeedback to identify and change brainwave dysregulation that underlies brain-based disorders such as generalized anxiety disorders.\\n', \"So I have been dealing with severe health anxiety for about 16 months now.

It didn't immediately hurt so I don't think it was too bad, and the only pain I have now is the burning of the scraped/slightly bleeding skin.. so I'm pretty sure it's nothing to worry about medically.. but I need to keep telling myself that in order to not freak out.\\n\\nAm I taking this too lightly?

It seems like there will be horrors either way. I know it won't fix my social problems. But it will make them more endurable. As I recall.\\nI'm in CA bay area.

I act a certain way around people because I\\'m really shy and it really frustrates me but I feel so anxious in situations I never do what I think I should. I pretty much get frustrated by my anxiety, due to my anxiety. Because I get frustrated, when I think about things  get anxious and it is a vicious cycle. I\\'m only like half a person when I am anxious because I am not doing what I want to do or feel all my time. I can\\'t express myself 100% due to my anxiety.  And as I\\'ve said, it has really frustrated me and made me depressed. \\n\\nBut, after being high I started to realize what thoughts were bad thoughts. I would think a thought but before I could over think it or analyze that thought which would make me feel bad, my body was just able to recognize that as a feeling of anxiety and shot it down. I pretty much couldn\\'t feel anxiety and the feeling I had while I was high was me 100% without anxiety. I pretty much just cured my anxiety. Literally, my body is recognizing my anxiety lately and not letting it affect me. I think that this could be because of the medication and maybe it literally one day just kicked in. I\\'ve been taking it for pretty much a month. When I am sober I still feel the same way about anxiety and what is bad. \\n\\n**EDIT:For example, I just wanted to clarify that for the past few days I was sober and still my brain was recognizing and managing my anxiety. I don\\'t want people to judge me and think that I am high right now, so I got anxious. I didn\\'t want to edit the page because people would see that I edited it. So then I just felt anxious and didn\\'t want to do it. But my brain just then made me feel like that was stupid and I got past that initial anxiety attack and did things. I feel like my anxiety cripples me and have been depressed about it but I now understand what thoughts are bad and I understand my brain now. Like I don\\'t even acknowledge the thoughts anymore, I\\'m literally not acknowledging the anxiety in my brain. I know Reddit hates this word but I think I\\'m euphoric. So this is an edit explaining my thought process and how I got over it. **\\n\\n\"Me a week ago would never have edited this.\"\\n\\n This is a really powerful sentence to me. Everything in my head just clicked. Does that make sense? Or am I crazy?  I typically give in to my anxiety and get frustrated and depressed about myself because I know I gave in to my anxiety but could never really put those feelings into thoughts in my head that counters out the anxiety. I used to try to meditate, where you are supposed to not acknowledge bad thoughts. With my anxiety, I couldn\\'t do it. Because of my medication, not I can. I literally control my thoughts now. My whole life, I couldn\\'t fathom how to control my feelings and with this medication I finally can.\\n\\nI feel like the chemicals in my brain that send out my anxiety are not really even being produced anymore. I get past that certain panic attack with everything I do. I\\'ve only seen life full of anxiety and I guess maybe I had REALLY bad anxiety and now the medication is making me normal and who I am. Wow. Can anyone relate? Is my medication just kicking in and is this a great success story? Or does this not make sense? Maybe I just smoke too much weed? Please, help me out here. I appreciate it a lot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntldr, I can now control my anxiety. ', \"Hey everyone. This is kinda a rant/ I would love some advice on the matter. \\n\\nI have very serious anxiety. 3 years ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, major depressive state, OCD, and anxiety. It has always fluctuated. I will go through weeks where I am fine and then have a couple bad days, where I use Ativan to control symptoms. I can usually make a 30 pill prescription last 3-4 months.\\n\\nFor the past 3 months it has been horrible, to the point where I have lost 10 pounds. I have been having to rely on my medication. I get one month at a time and I can only make it last the month, sometimes a little less. This has gone from taking half a pill to maybe one full pill here and there, to taking half a pill to a pill in a half in a day. I am in therapy. I got 1-3 times a week. I really stump them with this problem. They don't know why I get the anxiety for the most part. We know I start to get it, and I get a lot of symptoms. One my of biggest fears is throwing up, and lucky me, my symptoms are mostly digestive.\\n\\nI get a lump in my throat, dry mouth, I can't swallow, I will gag food up, my sense of smell becomes sensitive, I get gassy, nauseated, sometimes I will have the urgency to go to the bathroom (usually a normal BM), sometimes I dry heave, I feel pain in my stomach (but honestly I think that part is in my head), my heart races, I get sweaty hands, and I will either feel hot or cold. \\n\\n\\nI can't live like this anymore. Usually I could keep it under control but I have lost it. I have pretty much felt sick everyday for the past three months. I am also exhausted. I will sleep for 14+ hours a day if I have nothing to do. I don't leave my house anymore besides work, I have no interest in doing anything, I am becoming agoraphobic because of feeling ill all the time. The medication is working, but it's a short term effect.. I need something to stop it.\\n\\nI guess I want to know if any of you have the same symptoms as me and now to manage them. Is there any medication that works in the long term that you take, that you think I should ask my doctor about? Can you share some relaxation techniques that perhaps I have not tried? Anything? I honestly can't take it anymore..\\n\\nTL'DR: Going nuts because of anxiety, can't handle it anymore. \", \"Lately, I've been feeling terrible. I've been single for my entire 22 years on this planet and I hate to see people in happy relationships. I feel trapped in my head and deeply depressed because I don't seem to have control over anything in my life. \\n\\nI'm supposed to be graduating college, but I have to go back for half a year because I had to withdraw from some classes. I had to withdraw from classes because I just stopped caring about school and myself. I'm supposed to be taking an MCAT in a month, but I'm postponing it indefinitely because I can't bring myself to study and I'm certainly not ready. I'm an obese mess because I can't keep myself motivated enough to even try to go to the gym. I eat one meal a day and its usually crap which is destroying my body. \\n\\nNothing makes me happy regardless of what I try and I don't know what to do.

It didn\\'t let me eat for a while so my immune system must be crappy.  I\\'m going to a daily program at a mental hospital, which seems to be helping.\\n\\nAnd then I get a cold or something.  I had a sore throat and a cough for a few days, and suddenly a fever, so I went to the ER yesterday.  Had my blood taken to rule out dengue (endemic in my area).  Then the doctor prescribed azithromycin antibiotic.  I took the first dose yesterday.  \\n\\nToday, I did something stupid.  I have Health Anxiety, so of course I googled up the medicine, even though I\\'ve taken it before, in fact, earlier this year.  Wikipedia brought this up:\\n\\n\"A 2012 study found the drug may increase the risk of death, especially in those with heart problems, compared with those on other antibiotics such as amoxicillin or no antibiotic.\"\\n\\nApparently it can cause an arrhythmia, for which the risk is very low because I don\\'t have high pressure or heart problems.  I\\'m crazy afraid of taking it now.  I know I need to take a full course of antibiotics or risk getting ill again, or the development of drug-resistant superbugs and whatnot.  But I just know the minute I take it my anxiety will go haywire and my heart will beat hard and fast and I will be afraid that it is the drug that oh my god has finally killed me.\\n\\nHow can I calm down and take my meds? :(', '**Pretty straightforward, I just need any advice you can give me about what to do, how to handle interviews, what jobs would be good, how to explain the resume gap, how to handle the actual \"going to work everyday and working\" part (the big one), or anything else.

I\\'ve had to quit two jobs already this year because I couldn\\'t handle the office-environment stress  and fear of failure.**\\n\\nFor some more optional background: I grew up with a narcissistic and extremely critical mother, who also happened to have generalized anxiety disorder.  That\\'s the true source of all of my anxiety, genetics and a huge fear of failure (and the subsequent judgment and scorn I feel will follow from everyone observing it).\\n\\nMy first job was at age 19-21 delivering pizzas for Papa Johns in a little suburb.  At the beginning of this year I got a job at a tiny insurance office owned by an older couple as a customer service representative. They were basically taking me on as a young adult/college student part-timer (30 hours a week) who they could train and teach the industry to, so I could become an agent.\\n\\nI called in sick quite often because I\\'d have anxiety and occasionally panic attacks before work and be left exhausted and in tears, certain I couldn\\'t go in or else make a fool of myself and continue failing.  I think the small office environment definitely didn\\'t help. They were terrible at training me. I was never really sure of what my job expectations were or how well I was doing. I was constantly paranoid that my coworkers and boss were all talking about how terrible I was behind my back. I survived there a miraculous 6 months before having to quit because I couldn\\'t take how miserable it was to panic every day before and throughout work, come home crying, and have to do it the next day.\\n\\nLuckily, even though I quit without a job lined up, I had enough money saved up to get me by and I got another job within a couple of weeks.  It was at a cell phone carrier call center as a customer service representative.  I only made it 4 weeks into the 8 weeks of paid training.  It was even worse.  The huge building filled with a maze of cubicles and rigid schedule made me feel trapped.  They record every call (they come in constantly), grade you on every single aspect of the job, including sales, and I just knew I couldn\\'t do it.  I had such high expectations for myself but my performance was nowhere near how I thought I\\'d do.  The anxiety made it too hard to think clearly.\\n\\nI\\'ve been unemployed since late September and depressed since then.  My self-esteem is pretty low.  I\\'m afraid of history repeating.

I'm in my mid 20's. It's fluctuated between not so bad to really bad over the years. At age 21 I was diagnosed with GAD, OCD, and depression. I also have GERD and IBS. Thankfully with the help of medication I was able to get it under control. One of my big triggers is medical issues (hypochondriac). Needless to say my stomach was upset yesterday and I threw up. 24 hours later I'm convinced I have heart problems and kidney failure (I know that all of my symptoms can be tied to what I've been diagnosed with). Even though less than a year ago I had a full medical work up where they said I was perfectly healthy.

I was on Amitriptyline before that for a while and initially started on Paroxetine/Seroxat in 2011.\\n\\nThough Mirtazapine has been effective in managing my anxiety (and for that I am thankful), my biggest concern is the effect it has on my sleeping. When I first started taking Mirtazapine/Amitriptyline (the two drugs which I would take at night), I enjoyed the ridiculous ease it gave me in falling asleep, but as more time has passed and the \"honeymoon\" period I experienced is over, I\\'ve grown deeply concerned about my sleeping. I\\'ve reached a stage where I\\'m extremely dependent on the medication to even get tired at night. I know that deep down I tell myself that maybe it\\'s a price to pay to not be crippled by anxiety daily, but it\\'s quite soul destroying to realise I\\'m at the mercy of a drug to fall asleep and may be for the rest of my life.\\n\\nSo the question I have is this: Has anyone encountered medication for anxiety which doesn\\'t have effects on your sleepiness?

I normally don't say this stuff but I just want to put it all out there, thanks ... \\n\\nI'm 16 and male. In 7th grade I started being late for school. People would comment, that wasn't too bad. But it felt awkward.. I open the door after class starts, it makes a loud creaking noise, no one is expecting anyone. Everyone turns and stares at you. You have to go to the front and hand in your late note, as if your pedestal wasn't big enough already, proceeded by making more of a scene settling in. And then once there I feel like I don't belong there. I feel like I'm supposed to be there when I make it on time, though. Also as for why I'm late. I'm tired. It doesn't matter if I sleep at 8pm, 10pm, or 2am. I'm tired. Once I'm awake, I go in the bathroom. I just sit there with my head down in the dark. My stomach hurts. Its somatic, it has to be. I know my diet is bad but I can't get stomach aches this often. Sometimes I make it to class on time, rarely. Usually I don't. Sometimes I time it right and my mom drives me in right in between the periods so it's less awkward. Sometimes that's better. But sometimes I can't even do that. I know I can't use the computer or have WiFi or service on my phone but I don't know. That doesn't motivate me. They take away the only thing I really enjoy in life, and not going to school is more important or something. I don't enjoy being home with nothing and everyone wondering where I am and my parents saying I'm not doing the right thing. I cant help it. It's not fair. I'm not even allowed to play a game and try to escape and distract myself. \\n\\nSorry, I got off track. I guess I'm just trying to lay out my thought and ask for help.\\n\\nSo I miss days. I got psychiatrist. He was condescending and I feel like all of his clients are 8 years old. He gave me Zoloft and I made my way up to 75 mg. I got a therapist. She was okay. I miss a week of school in a row. I go to a mental hospital with the diagnosis of severe social anxiety disorder. Okay. I'm there for a few days whatever. I meet girls with lines on their arms and legs, a kid who hospitalized his father. We played puzzles and talked a lot. They were nice. I actually had fun. Nothing really changed for me though. My Zoloft went up to 100 mg. I'm 12 right now. \\n\\nthings continue I guess. I miss a lot of school. I'm never really happy. I always longed for some pretty girl who lived near me or went to my school to like me and talk to me till I tell her about my issues and she stands by me and is supportive. I know that would make me happy, but that seems like a ridiculous fantasy. Now I'm in 10th grade. Its January first. I talk to her online. We don't have a lot in common, but we think the same way, and I've never met anyone who does. We talk. We argue about some stuff. I get sad because she's kissed people before and everything. Its fine I guess. I guess I get jealous. I try to help her and act happy. I told my therapist about her in august, my therapist urges me to tell my parents. I told them there. It was awkward. So I ended up going there and it was good. I got my first kiss. I was proud of that. Its 11th grade now. I was on Prozac for a bit. I don't know if it affected me. I'm already broken. I'm off meds now and stopped seeing the therapist I saw for 4 years. She broke up with me in November. I barely remember why. I think it was that too many things bothered me and all id do is complain. I had no one else to tell everything to. So I told it all to her. I guess I shouldn't have. I cried and got more depressed than usual. A week later I was casually talking to her because we tried to maintain friendly relations. She made out with a stranger at a party. I got even more depressed. Now basically everything makes me tear up. It doesn't even have to be that sad.\\n\\nSo I'm in 11th grade now. I'll recap the year. I missed a lot of school. My parents talk to my teachers and tell my friends parents and her friends about my issues. I tell her not to and she keeps doing it. Then I don't want to see anyone. Everyone will know. My friend saw my mom's email to his mom and told our friend circle. I told them I missed school because I was sick because it was longer than usual. They told me about the email. Its hard to talk to my friends because they make fun of people who cut themselves and tell people to kill themselves as jokes. Its not like I have a large pool of friends to choose from. I'm not too close to them in that I no longer really have a best friend. They do stuff and go out behind my back I know that. But my real issue is school. How am I going to graduate. My mom makes it worse. There's no one to talk to. No one in real life to talk to. No one to be myself with. I don't know what to do.\", '6 years ago I woke up one morning mid panic attack.  It was the first one I\\'d ever had.  This continued, almost constantly for 6 months.  I was in a literal constant state of panic.  I called the EMTs several times a week to come check on me and would park in the ER parking lot just to feel safe.  Every time I went in I was embarrassed because of course, nothing was wrong with me, I was just having a panic attack.\\n\\nEventually a psychiatrist diagnosed me with GAD and put me on Seroquel.  Her reasoning was that Seroquel is a sedative.  I took it at night and this way when I woke up I would still be somewhat sedated and would not be able to panic.  That worked *okay* for a while.  \\nA year later a new psychiatrist decided to switch me to Lamictal to avoid some of the negative side effects of Seroquel.  I didn\\'t question her at the time, but soon learned that was a huge mistake.  \\nThe Lamictal worked well for the anxiety but I soon lost my memory nearly completely.  I couldn\\'t remember what I\\'d eaten for breakfast, what conversations I just had, where I\\'d been, and I had to keep meticulous notes of everything I did so that I could function the next day.  It was like I had amnesia.  \\n\\nI went in for a yearly physical and was diagnosed with a pretty bad Vit D deficiency and a \"slightly under active\" thyroid.  I began a D supplement and thyroid meds.  Within a week I felt great and stopped the Lamictal with no issues.  I felt great physically for the next 5 years with minimal GAD relapses.  I was happy, healthy, calm, and productive.  \\nI would occasionally experience health anxiety, but nothing like now.  I would have a symptom, google it, and convince myself something was wrong.  Sometimes I was right, but it was always minor issues that resolved themselves quickly.  I was doing fine.  I knew that the months of panic years before had scarred me, made me unable to trust my body, and created some sense of physical helplessness, but it was manageable.  \\n\\nOne year ago I woke up and CRASHED physically.  I had a million symptoms and it was unbearable.  I had to stop taking classes and working.  This time, something was really wrong.  My anxiety spun out of control and I spent all of my savings and much of my partner\\'s on doctors and tests.  All of which showed nothing.  The lack of a diagnosis was maddening.  I became obsessed and spent ALL of my time researching.  My stress level was like nothing I had ever experienced.  I was completely convinced I was dying, and not knowing why was making me crazy.  \\nFINALLY things began to come together, slowly.  I was diagnosed with Hashimoto\\'s, then needed more thyroid meds, then adrenal fatigue, then Epstein Barr Virus, and that\\'s likely not the end of it.  This is after nearly a year.  All of these conditions are likely the result of extreme stress, both anxiety and lifestyle related.\\nSo now here I am.  I\\'m actually sick.  I\\'m trying to balance hormones which is maddening in and of itself.  Every week I have a new symptom.  Some can be explained by my illnesses, some can\\'t.    \\nI am in a constant state of panic over my health.  It has completely taken over my life.  One of the most difficult parts for me is that if I hadn\\'t been like this, and done my own research, sought out specific doctors, ordered my own tests, I would still be undiagnosed, untreated, and much, much sicker.  The illnesses have reinforced my obsession with my health and now I can\\'t stop.  I\\'ve learned that I can\\'t trust doctors and I MUST obsess over it to get anywhere.  I feel like I have to find the root cause of every single thing I feel or things will spiral like they did originally.  \\nToday is my birthday.  I\\'m out of town in a hotel in an attempt to celebrate but I\\'ve already had a breakdown over my health.  I woke up today with a new symptom, seemingly unrelated to the others.  I simply can not emotionally handle illness of any kind anymore.  The stress makes me sicker and makes many other symptoms worse.  I can\\'t get out of these thought patterns.  I can\\'t stop thinking about it.  I\\'m paralyzed with anxiety and fear.  I have NEVER been a suicidal person, but lately it crosses my mind as a way to escape.  I of course would never to that, but it\\'s terrifying that I\\'m in a place where that feels like relief compared to my reality.  \\nI\\'m in therapy but my therapist doesn\\'t seem to be of much help with this.  She told me to take my klonapin, but because of my issues, I HATE medications and will avoid them until there is no other option.  \\n\\nHow do you cope with long-term anxiety?  How do you get over health anxiety?  There are no relevant groups in my area and none of the psychologists specialize in it.', \"So I suffer from severe anxiety and currently am going through an alcohol problem (I'm getting help don't worry but that's a story for later.)\\n\\nI was freaking out and had a couple sips of hard alcohol to calm me down a little while ago (i know its wrong please dont focus on this) maybe the equivalent of 1 shot. I just picked up my medication and I've never had it before. Would taking it be a bad idea considering I had a drink of alcohol about 4 hours ago and another sip about 1 hour ago? I'm not drunk just a little warm. I know never to mix the two but with my problem I want this medication to help as soon as possible\", 'Hey there readers of r/anxiety, maybe you can help me in my journey. \\n\\nJust a note: I DO plan on visiting a doctor and finding a counsellor/therapist. I\\'m not asking for medical advice, I\\'m just wondering if, in the meantime, I can even call what I have, \"panic attacks\". \\n\\nHere\\'s a little background about me: mental illness runs in my family. My mom suffers from anxiety, depression and alcoholism; my sister from anxiety and depression; my aunt from bipolar? and anxiety; my grandfather from bipolar and dimensia. So nobody was all that surprised when I struggled with self-harm in high school and was referred to a family counsellor. She and two of my doctors tentatively diagnosed me with bipolar, even though I was only 14. Since then, I have taken Divalproex every day as a mood stabilizer. \\n\\nWhen I got to university, I began to see a counsellor at student services and he was amazing. He taught me all about cognitive behavioural therapy and I really began to think that anxiety played a large role in my profile, despite never being diagnosed. I graduated and haven\\'t seen him since. \\n\\nThis year, I entered into a serious relationship with a man and started taking hormonal birth control (the \"combination pill\" that most women take) and I guess the estrogen and progesterone did a number on my brain. I have been irritable, unreasonable and weepy for about 3 weeks now (I was on the medication for 9 weeks before I quit). I pick fights over nothing, I get so upset and angry over them that I start crying and holding my breath, and I can\\'t sleep until I\\'ve cried myself out or \"resolved\" the problem by arguing with my boyfriend or one of my friends. \\n\\nConsequently, I\\'ve been tired and irritable at work, and unable to live up to the standards I set for myself on the job. Last night while I was at work I actually had a full-blown \"attack\" where I called my boyfriend and got into an argument with him, started crying and freaking out when there was work to be done. Luckily I was in a situation where I could go home early, but now my behaviour is getting in the way of not only my relationships, but my job. \\n\\nWhat happens is that I start to feel cranky or worried about, really anything: Do I have the money to pay next months rent? Is my boyfriend not responding to my text messages? Was a customer at work really rude to me for no reason? And then I blow it out of proportion. \\n\\nI start to feel this concentrated feeling of hopelessness, usually for an hour or more it lasts. I cry, I tend to hold my breath (something I have realized might be making it worse) and I think completely irrational thoughts for the entire duration of the \"attack\". These thoughts include: \\n\\n- life will never get better. I will never achieve my goals\\n- it will always be this bad\\n- I will never escape my anxiety/depression, it will always come back\\n- I will push away my loved ones \\n- I am an incomplete or insufficient person\\n- I am unable to fix this \\n- I feel trapped\\n\\nI feel overwhelmed by these thoughts for hours, usually at night before I go to sleep but sometimes earlier in the evening. I am unable to escape them and it is really terrifying. But then they end. I fall asleep, or someone comforts me, or I cry myself out and the feelings subside. \\n\\nI can go about my day feeling tired maybe, cranky maybe, but otherwise functional: it\\'s those intense feelings of hopelessness, worry and depression that only last a couple hours at most. \\n\\nAre these panic attacks? I don\\'t have a racing heartbeat, I don\\'t experience chest pain, I don\\'t feel dizzy or experience tunnel vision, and I wouldn\\'t say I\\'m \"completely\" detached from reality. But I am unable to function, I have racing thoughts, and I feel trapped by my emotions. \\n\\nIs this anxiety? Depression? Are these panic attacks? Normally I am a reasonable, caring and kind person, who is admittedly insecure. But when these episodes hit I become defensive, self-deprecating, and irrational. I\\'m not myself. ', \"So I've been struggling with anxiety/symptoms of depression for about 2.5 years now, but only got help when it got incredibly horrible during the beginning of my senior year in highschool, about 9 months ago. Since then I've been going to therapy and some groups, and I've improved quite a bit since (yay!)\\n\\nThe thing is, even though I've come a pretty long way, I feel like I've still been experiencing a lot of symptoms. I haven't had a panic attack for almost a month now, and even though I've gotten better at keeping myself from going into complete panic, I still experience the things that go with it, such as shakiness, dizziness, tight chest, lack of concentration, etc. These types of things have been happening often. Therapy definitely has helped me to handle these symptoms, but I still feel like they get in the way of my life. I can still function, but I don't think I'm functioning as well as I could be.\\n\\nAnyways, medication sounds like it could be a good idea. However, I'm terrified of side effects and all the bad stories I've heard on the Internet. My therapist told me that if my current therapy groups weren't fixing my anxiety, she would reccomend I take a mild antidepressant. I still don't know if I need it, and I'm scared to try it.

And now to the main part of my question, I sometimes find myself wonderibg would it be easier if I kill myself, I know it would be hard for my wife but my daughter doesn't really know me yet so she won't miss me and my wife has really good support from both sides of our family and I am sure she will get over it in time wont she? It scares ne to think about and I know I wont do it but I am afraid, and I think that sometimes it would be better to do it before my daughter gets to much older. I havnt spoken to my dr about this yet because I am afraid of what he will do if I tell him. I will be reading these with my other account so if anyone wants to contact me leave a message in the comments and I will try and contact you\", \"Hi everyone. Since April or May of this year, I had an anxiety attack. I had the whole rapid heart beats, chest pain and stomach pain. I freaked out so much that I went to the doctor and they prescribed me prozac and clonopin. But only took prozac for 3 days because it made me feel shitty. I called the doctor and he told me to stop taking it which was great. Anyway, I tried learning how to deal with anxiety and stuff. Anyway, fastforward to November,  I went to the doctor because of mild pain on my right hand side below my ribcage. The doctor took a blood sample and had it tested. I was so worried I might have cancer but the blood test came back normal. Doctor emailed me the results and told me to 'enjoy life'. I still tend to have stomach pain here and there or head aches which I hardly ever get. Lately though, they started being more regular and today all day, I've been having mild stomach discomfort like when you  eat a lot and you feel full. I am wondering if this sounds familiar with you guys. Is this pain caused by anxiety? I still worry I may have cancer or some other disease. My anxiety level is low I think, meaning I do think about money, school, work, and my social life on a regular basis. ALl which are worries but not to the point of high anxiety?? A bit of background, last year was the worst year for me. My dad passed away in 2012, I got fired from my job and missed a semester at the university. Oh and not to mention the 30 plus K medical bills from my dad's hospital bills after he passed away. This year things are better when it comes to money. I found a job in february and financially I feel better. I have other worries but now I have all these physical symptoms that are freaking me out, making me worry if I have some incurable disease. Sorry for the long thread. I just want to hear your take from this, do you guys relate to what I am going through? Is this anxiety caused? God I wish my stomach ache would go away as I am typing right now. Thanks guys. \", 'I thought I would share my experience with my medication in the hopes that it may help someone, or at the very least resonate with people. \\nI had anxiety pretty much my entire adolescent life, but it really came to a head my first year of university. I was constantly having attacks, and I was so worried about everything that I would just shut down and do nothing. I skipped classes for weeks on end because they were just too stressful. I also was in constant fear of people judging me, which made me not want to leave the house for fear that I would say something stupid, or wear something atrocious, or even be wearing the \"wrong\" lipstick. \\nI had been seeing a psychologist to try and deal with it, but it didn\\'t seem to be quite enough. It got to the point where I didn\\'t want to do anything but be in my room and watch movies (which is so not me, because I am highly extroverted). \\nFinally, I mentioned to my doctor about all this, and she recommended that I try a low dose of cipralex, which is technically an anti-depressant but works for anxiety as well.\\nWELL. Within a week, I started to feel like myself again. I actually wanted to go to class, hang out with people, and spend time outside of my room. The little things that were stressing me out stopped scaring me. I stopped being worried about what other people thought of me, and started speaking in class.\\nI\\'ve been on Cipralex for about 2 years now. The best part is feeling like a normal human again, and feeling like **myself**. Obviously medication isn\\'t for everyone, but it definitely saved my life.', \"Going through a big life change at the moment (leaving uni, moving away from home, etc.) and lately I find myself being unable to sleep because of it.\\n\\nI'm currently on 30mg of citalopram and it's fairly ok with my depression, just doesn't seem to be helping with the anxiety so much. I've tried reading and watching things on Youtube but I find I can't fall asleep for long periods of time as it feels like I'm drowning under a wave of anxiety and blehness.\\n\\nAlso going through CBT for the nth time but I haven't managed to come up with a way to get past this as of yet. I know there's always sleeping pills but I'm taking enough as it is without adding yet another pill to the list. Hate being dependent on medicine to keep me rational.\\n\\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\", \"So yesterday I proposed to my girlfriend (now fiancee!) Anyhow it was the most nervous I think I have been in a very long time. I legitimately thought I was going to pass out or have a heart attack, or both! My heart was pounding so bad and I couldn't control my breathing but I got through it and made the best of it. My concern is, today I've still got a cramp like feeling in my chest, I normally worry about medical issues and heart attacks. Could that major episode yesterday cause me to have this feeling in my chest today or need I be further concerned?\", \"I don't even know what to say.  I'm feeling worthless. Hopeless. Lost.  I've suffered from anxiety since I was 14. Took Paxil for 10 years.  Love/Hate relationship with it. Stabilized and managed to do without it.  Started smoking marijuana in grad school and found it the most relaxed I had ever been.  Relieved stomach issues. \\n\\nMy mom attempted suicide (for the 3rd time) during school.  Academic expectations were high.  I had less control of more situations than I was comfortable with and I started to lost it again.  At this point I had been off my Paxil for 4 years.  \\n\\nI was waking up with diarrhea every day and throwing up. Back to doctor. Endoscopy from gastro. Back on meds but not Paxil.  SSRI and sleeping pill. Requested accommodations at school to ease my stress.  Managed.  Graduated. Came off meds. Passed my License Social Worker exam. Got a job that is extremely stressful.   \\n\\nBrief familial history. Mother has Borderline Personality disorder.  PTSD(from a disabling car accident that happened when I was 17) Anxiety.  Depression.  We have so many similarities.  My father is the rock of the family, and almost impervious to stress.  \\n\\nFast forward to now. I'm at my job 4 months. I've been really stressed for 35 days now.  Waking up 3 hours before my alarm and throwing up.  This morning I woke up at 3am to a fierce intestinal growl.  I clenched my ass as right as I could until it passed.  10 seconds later I ran to the bowl and it was like my butt was throwing up. I threw up a few times after that then decided to call out.  \\n\\nI have been tormented by the thought that I have put all my efforts into school and getting the job that I wanted...just to find out that I'm incapable of doing it.  I'm in constant fear that I will have to quit and I will be like my mother.  On disability. Depressed.  Incapable of working.  But I don't have the means to support myself so I need to work.  \\n\\nI'm back on meds.  Prozac 20mg and .5 Xanax but it's obviously not helping.  I haven't worked out in 6+ weeks because of the constant vomiting in the morning from nausea.   I smoke a bit and it eases stomach but I can smoke before work. \\n\\nI'm open about my anxiety because it helps me not bear this alone.  I read some of these stories and they make me feel better and others I read almost confirm that I will not be able to overcome this and continue with my job.  \\n\\nI'd really like to love the job.  It's stressful and I accept that but now I'm fixated on the debilitating somatic effects I'm experiencing.  I had explosive diarrhea this morning and was so afraid I would shit everywhere.  I have court for work next week and I'm afraid i will puke in front of the judge, my client, and my colleagues.  \\n\\nI'm so afraid that I'm going to end up like my mom.  I used to think that I could never because she has experienced significant trauma throughout her life.  But I'm feeling weak.  I try to think about the hardened youth I work with.  And the environments they grew up in.  And how that trauma shapes their behavior.   Will this stress at work, if I continue to take each day one day at a time, with each day a small victory, eventually dissipate and my brain will readjust.  Or will this wear me out and send me into a dark place of regression, incapable of being a productive member of society.  \\n\\nI was feeling good that I was sticking with it. Until I had to call out today.  I'm almost convinced that smoking weed is giving me social anxiety but it's the only thing that eases my stomach when I'm vomiting. \\n\\nCan I overcome this and be a stronger person?  Or am I predisposed and incapable, requiring a job with less stress.  Hearing that I may have to quit turns my anxiety up x1000.  \\n\\nThere are so many details I've left out.  I don't want this to be a rant.  I want someone to reach out and tell me they have persevered and overcome.  This isn't just a job.  It's everything I've worked for in school for the last few years.  80k on student loans.  This wAs supposed to work out and be my career.

I'm close to one dude, but I don't like telling him very much of what's going on because we don't know each other well and I don't want to seem clingy or impose. I've been dealing with depression and self harm for a very long time, and anxiety seems to set in once my depression gets very bad. Later this month I will be going to see my old psychologist and looking at medication for the first time in four years. \\n\\nYesterday marked the end of the semester and we were all drinking - I was pretty drunk, and went out for a cigarette. I was texting a friend from my hometown at the time. When I was out there I got overwhelmed with some pretty intangible emotions. This happens pretty often. Things like dread, hopelessness, anger, inadequacy, all tied into one massive wave. It feels like drowning. Normally I'm just able to kind of... sit there and take it, I guess. This time I wasn't. I started breathing in very short bursts, and I felt like I was going to cry, but crying is something that I'm rarely ever able to do. I was having trouble standing up. I was trembling (it was pretty cold out, though). I thought I was going to puke - I went around to the side of the building for a while, but I'm not even sure how I managed to walk over there. I sat there for a few minutes, then came back to the entrance I'd been standing at and had to sit down. I couldn't parse through my emotions, couldn't understand what I was feeling, and couldn't read what my friend had been texting me.\\n\\nI managed to text my closest friend in the apartment building who knows I'm going through some shit and told them that I wasn't doing so well, that they absolutely didn't have to come down, but that I could benefit from some company. I don't know how long I sat out there. I know that I threw up, and then it was like I blinked and my friend was in front of me asking what was going on. I didn't think he would come out. I didn't really believe he was there at first.\\n\\nWe went and sat in his car. I got out several times to throw up. I kept telling him how sorry I was - it was all I could really say. He helped me take some deep breaths, got me back up to my apartment after I have no idea how long, and then I was able to take a shower and go to sleep.\\n\\nThing is, I can't tell if this was a mild panic attack, or me just being drunk and depressed. I didn't feel like I was dying, as much as I would have liked to in that moment. I didn't feel absolutely terrified so much as in emotional anguish. I'm not expecting a diagnosis here, but has anyone dealt with anything similar? I'm at a loss.

It started around mid-August, and she would ask me things like, \"Hey, do I look different?\" and \"Is there anything wrong with my face?\" and \" Does my face look fatter than before?\" Mind you, I am male, so there\\'s obviously some bias. I honestly didn\\'t know what she was talking about because she still looked the same to me. Little did I know, this was the beginning to a very slippery slope. I then found out that over the months leading to now she had been asking various friends that she had about it, she went to a doctor\\'s clinic to get it checked, she has been calling various medical professions about it, etc. And they would giver her answers like, \"Oh, you\\'re losing weight..\" \"Your face is changing as you age\" \"Your face changes with your environment\" etc. The problem with this is that this obsession about her face has been ruining her life. She\\'s not the same person anymore. She\\'s usually really out-going, friendly, attentive. But now, because of this intense obsession over her face, she has been doing things that she normally doesn\\'t do. She was supposed to go out for a retreat the past weekend, but instead decided to sleep all day. On her birthday in October, we were supposed to go hiking, but she called it off because she woke up with panic attacks pertaining to her insecurity about her face.\\n\\nLast night, I had to calm her down. I drove to her place, picked her up, and brought her to a park to just talk, and what we talked about just ripped me to shreds. I felt like I had no answer to everything she was asking. She\\'d say things like, \"I don\\'t know if I can live with this face!\" and \"I can\\'t live anymore! I can\\'t live for myself! I can\\'t live for my loved ones!\" and \"This thing is ruining my life, but I don\\'t know what to do I am so helpless!\" I\\'d say things like you have to keep fighting, but she\\'d just say that she couldn\\'t and that she\\'s giving up. Last night, as I was dropping her off back at her place, I felt so defeated. Usually when I talk to her I could calm her down, but this time I just... couldn\\'t. It really sucked. And I realize that I don\\'t have all the answers, and all I could do is be there for her.\\n\\nThe thing is, she\\'s been seeking professional help, but it hasn\\'t been doing anything. That really concerns me. I don\\'t want her to be reduced to a pill bottle and a prescription. This face obsession makes me think that this is a mental problem from all the overwork she\\'s been experiencing (btw she\\'s a college student that interns and has a job), but I can\\'t put my finger on it for sure.

She becomes incredibly red when her co-workers talk to her, she has trouble thinking of words to say in almost every situation, she feels like no one cares about her, she says she has no friends and that everyone expects much more from her than she is capable of (not true, she was recently accepted to grad school at 3 of the top 10 schools in the world), she calls me probably 3 or 4 times a day, and she has started questioning my devotion to her. She constantly accuses me of cheating on her.\\n\\nI promise you, this girl is incredibly beautiful, smart, hysterical, and I never thought I would ever have the chance to be with someone like her. Cheating on her is not on my to-do-list. She is convinced that I am, however. She calls every girl in my life (old friends, classmates, club members, etc.) the name of a certain promiscuous television character, every time anyone posts a picture of me on Facebook and there is a girl in it, she accuses me of cheating with her, and even when I'm talking to her on the phone in a public place and she hears a girl's voice (can be anyone, even someone just walking by), she accuses me of lying about not cheating on her. \\n\\nI know this reaction is not her. She's been on some form of anxiety medication (she won't tell me what it is) for about a week, and I like to think it's getting better. But I can't help feeling that this reaction is just her, unfiltered. I'm so dedicated to her, and it really hurts me on a personal level that she accuses me of cheating on her. I try to be patient, calm, loving, whatever.

At this time, I use it as a way to relax myself from my constant stressors (worry/running thoughts/amped up feeling) and to calm myself overall. It has allowed me to make new friends, keeps my mind positive and clear and has even boosted my self-esteem. I am prepared to stop so that I can get used to my new medicine and so that in four weeks my doctor can make a clear evaluation. However, after this period I plan to continue smoking/vaping (hopefully less) and was wondering if anyone had experienced any negative reactions from combining a low dose of Zoloft with cannabis. I have done my own research and have found out that it seems to depend on the person and the understanding of the drug. I would consider myself experienced with this drug and fully aware of the effects it causes. In the case that I do decide to smoke while on Zoloft, I will obviously take it easy and test my limits. Should I have to worry about smoking while on my medication? What about alcohol? Thanks in advance. \\n\\n', \"I've been taking Effexor for about 6 months now with great results on the depression side of things.  My psychiatrist and I tweaked the mg's to 225 to be ideal for me.  However, I still experience more anxiety than I'd like, so he prescribed 10mg Elavil to take with the Effexor.  He says that Elavil can provide an anti-anxiety effect when taken with Effexor that helps control anxiety symptoms better.\\n\\nI know that serotonin syndrome is a risk in combining these meds, but doc says it is very minimal and I would be slowly increasing the amount of Elavil I'm taking daily until it was at an ideal level for me.\\n\\nJust wondering if anyone has experiences with these two drugs being taken together - good?

I\\'m now pretty good at recognizing when I\\'m catastrophizing a situation and can nip it in the bud. \\n\\n\\nMy problem now is that I have come to fear the anxiety itself. I have so many memories of the panic attacks, and how scary they were. This is especially true regarding situations where I\\'ve had panic problems in the past. I can start out feeling calm and normal, but work myself into a panic with thoughts like, \"This made me panic before- what if it makes me panic again? That was so awful. But that won\\'t happen again, will it? What if... Oh God, I\\'m starting to feel panicky. I think I\\'m having a panic attack!\" And it just snowballs from there, complete with the physical symptoms (racing heart, shaking, etc.)\\n\\n\\nHas anyone else in the community had problems like this?

It didn't take long at all for us to be completely in love with each other, and trust each other with everything.  He told me a bit about is problems, but since he was on meds, symptoms were never really an issue. About a month ago he told me that he felt really confident and that he decided that he was happy enough that he didn't need his meds anymore. Thats when he became a completely different person. He barely answers texts anymore, always rejects coming out to see me, and when i do see him he shows no affection anymore. I've backed off a lot and am attempting to give him his space, but its difficult for me considering how close we used to be, and now it seems like he wouldn't care if we stayed together or not. I've told him that i want to work through this, and told him that i miss him being affectionate/seeing him a lot. A week ago i told him i want to be more supportive and not smother him and his response was 'you cant put this on yourself; i know you need more attention but i just cant give it to you. I'm destructive to those around me; when i'm off my meds i just cant control. I cant think about it, my life cant have structure.' I was really scared in that moment that he was going to leave me, but we're still technically together even though we haven't really hung out or talked that much since.  The only times i can seem to see him lately are when its with a group of friends.\\n\\nSo my question is what should i do? I know that since he is only recently coming off his meds (been coming off for about 8 weeks now) he may be suffering from withdraw. Should i just wait it out and see if he copes better?\\nShould i continue to encourage self-help? He's very self aware of his problems and how they affect his life, but seems to have just accepted that its not fixable, and avoidance is the best solution. I know he is open to the idea of therapy, but hasn't started any self or outside help. Maybe its a lack of motivation?\\nThe question i'm most afraid to ask: would it be best for me to just let him go? Would he be happier without me? \\nSo far i have decided to limit contact and not ask to see him; hoping he'll come to me as he recovers.

Needless to say I loved it and it has greatly improved how I feel. Problem is, when I was given a 3 month dose, I went to a different place for my medicine for convenience. The pills are entirely different and I feel that they are completely ineffective. I've been taking them for over a week now and can feel myself draining back down, getting irritable and stress eating again, I'm back to sleeping 13 hours a day and I feel all my energy is gone again. I still had a couple of pills left over from my first month and on the days I take those I feel great but I'm down to 2 of those. At this point I'm unsure of what to do. I don't know if its the fact that the pills are packaged differently and look different that's screwing with me or if its the pills themselves, and then how do I fix this? Would it be alright to call the doctor and explain what happened? I don't see the doctor again for 3 months and I cant imagine feeling this horrible for another 3 months of my life. Anyone have this sort of problem with generic medicines? What did you do to fix this?\", \"Hello, people. I'm a 30 y/o biology postdoc (woman), with a 10 y/o history of GAD and panic disorder (under treatment with .75 mg Xanax/2 die and 100 mg Venlafaxine HCl/die, no psychotherapy) and a past diagnosis of major depression (treated at the time with fluoxetine and psychotherapy). I have a very unfortunate job, both high-pressure and low-pay, which I love very much but also is my main trigger. \\n\\nI've always had sleep-related issues (difficulty maintaining sleep, 7/8 wakings/night), but I've never taken specific medications besides melatonin. Lately, though, I have developed a new symptom, that's basically rendering me non-functional during the day: nightmares.\\n\\nThe episodes are now occurring basically every night and are *very* vivid, not to mention lingering in the wakeful state. The dreams are almost all work related and reflect my well-known insecurities (i.e.: humiliation in the workplace, failure in reaching my goals and deadlines, public exposure of personal failings, etc). The problem is that these dreams have me waking up feeling already physically and mentally exhausted and incapable of falling back into sleep. I am constantly tired, sleepy and on edge. My eyes hurt and I'm starting to become avoidant again. On top of that, remembering and ruminating on these dreams during the day has triggered a wave of panic attacks like I've never experienced before (almost daily episodes). I can't take sick days and the thought of going to work after the nightmares kills me, especially if they happen in the morning. I can't stand the thought of facing the people I've dreamt about, because of the lingering hurt and betrayal I still feel. You can just imagine how unproductive I've become.\\n\\nSo, all in all, I am experiencing a new low in my symptoms, even if my anxiety has always been generally very high, constant and poorly manageable. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in two weeks to adjust the therapy to fit the rise in the basal levels of anxiety and the increase in the panic episodes. In particular, I would like to switch from Xanax to another drug, since it seems I reached the tolerance limit (it's not effective at all anymore for long-term management and I'm starting to feel withdrawal symptoms if I take my drops just a couple of hours later than usual). I also suspect that the nightmares could be a withdrawal symptom from Xanax itself, since they mostly happen in the morning, when the evening dose has weened off. Has this ever happened to anyone? \\n\\nTL;DR: new low in anxiety levels, started having nightly incapacitating nightmares, need to switch from Xanax because I suspect it's the cause. What do?\", \"My apologies up front, this is long. Please tell me if this isn't the appropriate place for this.\\n\\nMy Mum (65) is one of my (36F) best friends and I love her very much, but she's also driving me up the wall. I honestly don't know how to address this with her without upsetting her and/or making it all worse, so I'm hoping you can advise me.\\n\\nMum has always been very capable, travelling around the country to teach design and embroidery and quilting techniques, and is generally a fantastic artist. A few years ago, she started having random heart palpitations and dizzy spells, sometimes panic attacks, often when driving. She saw her doctor and had tests, but nothing physical showed up. She started to dread travelling but continued to do it, because she had made commitments. \\n\\nI live two hours away from her. I work and have two kids so it's not always easy for me to travel to visit her. But her increasing anxiety with travelling has made it difficult for her to come to us. I'm frequently hearing about how much she misses us and how fast the kids are growing. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Mum's sister has been diagnosed with depression and has been on therapy and medications. Mum's relationship with her sister is complicated, mostly due to their mother being a manipulative cow who intentionally tries to make them fight (I've been reading Raised by Narcissists and think it might fit her behaviour). My theory is that both Aunt's depression and Mum's anxiety are a result of their mother manipulating them their entire lives. (Sorry, I'm indulging in a lot of amateur psychology here but it fits, in my mind.)\\n\\nAbout six months ago, Mum was driving up to visit her mother (about six hours away), got an hour up the road, had heart palpitations and a panic attack, turned around and went home. She's essentially stopped driving since then. She will pop up to the shops or go somewhere local, but driving to my place or to visit her Mum is out of the question. She either catches the train or gets Dad to drive her, but the whole thing is a BIG DEAL.\\n\\nRecently, she's having the attacks at home too. She used to be okay in her own space, but that's clearly no longer the case. It's just getting worse. She keeps trying to explain it away by saying it's the antibiotics she's on or something else, but it doesn't make any sense. She's not sleeping property, often waking at 3am or 4am and not being able to get back to sleep, so she's tired all the time, which makes her even more reluctant to go anywhere.\\n\\nBut here's the problem - she will not see a therapist about it. Her sister suggested it to her a while ago because it has helped her with her depression, but because Mum is not on the best terms with her sister at the moment, she rejected the idea. When I suggested therapy, I was told I was being disloyal for agreeing with my Aunt. I've tried a few times since then and get shut down each time.\\n\\nSo we're in this situation now where she wants to visit me and the kids, but each time she does it's a big deal. The most recent issue arose when she made a huge deal of coming to visit us on Christmas morning, despite the fact we were all coming to her on Boxing Day. She has bronchitis and should have cancelled, but didn't because it was so important to her to see us. It didn't occur to me to cancel because she said she wasn't contagious and I trusted her judgement. And now me and both my kids (including my five month old) have bronchitis. It was absolutely not malicious on her part but she's letting her anxiety control her so much that she is making bad decisions. And I'm left not being able to trust her judgement anymore.\\n\\nI just don't know what to do. She's getting worse, she's becoming incapable of dealing with her life, and I just want her to be her old capable self, or at least learn some coping techniques or find some medication which could help. There's a selfish element to this too - I expect her to live for decades to come while my Dad isn't terribly healthy, so I'm afraid that at a certain point I'm going to be primarily responsible for helping her. I love her very much and I don't want to start resenting her. She will have all the support I have to give if she would just get some help!\\n\\nI have no idea how to approach this now. I've written a few letters to her about it but not sent them. I'm hoping you lovely people can make a suggestion. Did your family approach you? How would you do it? I'm almost frustrated enough to make ultimatums but I really can't see that actually helping. How can I help her? She keeps telling herself she's coping but she just isn't.\\n\\nEdit: oh yeah, don't read my post history. I was really mad about this a few nights ago and posted about this to /r/breakingmum. The language was a little ... saltier, lol.\", 'I realize that I should speak with a psychiatrist --and trust me, I will not take medication without the assistance of a trained professional-- but I was wondering about my fellow Redditors experiences with Lexapro... I\\'ve been struggling with OCD for years, and currently I am not medicated. Years ago I was on Zoloft, and then Celexa, but I didn\\'t like either drug because they made me feel foggy and empty.

Taking the year off and living at home with my mom and older sister (who is in college). No job (another thing I could use advice for. Killer anxiety is making it impossible for me to apply anywhere). In elementary school I had extreme anxiety and was a selective mute. I only talked to my parents, sister, and very close friends. I was put on Zoloft for a couple years, it helped a lot. I opened up to people and began talking more. I've never taken any meds since then, other than birth control.\\n\\nI recently lost a best friend I had for over 10 years. No, she's not dead. Her morals became really messed up and did things that hurt herself and almost everyone she associated herself with. She made me feel like a bad person, so I decided to end the friendship. \\n\\nI have a few male friends. But due to Snapchat and all the glorious social sites, I've noticed they hang out quite often. But they never seem to invite me. I talk to them a couple times a week trying to hang out but there's always some kind of excuse. I feel like they just don't appreciate my company anymore. But there's always the realization that I might just be over thinking it. I'll never really know. \\n\\nReally the only person I hang out with is my boyfriend. He agrees I should make more friends. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to understand social anxiety. He's pretty outgoing and has more friends than I could count.\\n\\nI have a couple friends who I've always talked to online, never met in person, that live nearby. We've met through other people. We've talked about hanging out for real so we could actually have a chance to become legitimate friends. But every time they ask to hang out I get that nervous feeling in my stomach and tell them 'probably not'. One of these friends knows I have social anxiety and he understands. But I want to cut it out. I miss hanging out with friends and doing stuff. \\n\\nSo basically what I'm saying/asking: What are some ways to get over this? I don't believe my anxiety is bad enough to get a prescription for it, so I would rather just figure out a way to conquer it. I know I can, I just don't know the right steps to take.\", \"So recently I was taking some medication and while on the medication I was experiencing eye twitches(standard side effect of the medication) and the occasional muscle twitch in my arm, doctor said that was caused by tiredness. A few days ago I accidently took too many of the pills an amount that was classified as an overdose based on what online info said.  I started freaking out, since the overdose warning contained brain swelling/death. I called poison control and they said I infact didn't quite overdose and I should be fine. But I wasn't relieved I was still in a state of panic,  later that night my legs started twitching like crazy and feeling fuzzy. I was so scared it might be some side effect or something I did some reasearch and tried to convince myself it was nothing but I started developing irrational fears of having other conditions like MS, etc I notice my hands shiver a bit when I but my wrist on a desk. Got about 6 hours of sleep that night. Next day, I still have almost constant leg twitching although in the morning it was gone. I can't focus on work, almost failed an exam I'm scared of being scared? I can't get my mind of this thing no matter what I'm doing it comes back into my mind.  I'm scared of having anxiety for the rest of my life I feel so lost.

So in a few years after I graduate from grad school, everything is up in the air and that terrifies me. \\n\\n- I constantly feel like my symptoms bodily (headaches, stomach nausea or the feeling of urgency sometimes with bathroom things, the almost constant fatigue, even drainage) are somehow pregnancy related. Which they can\\'t be because I\\'m not. But my brain says it is. This is probably partially because of the pill, but is also mental. It\\'s possible that the pill exacerbates these things. \\n\\n-if I don\\'t hear from my boyfriend for a while or if we have a discussion, it is sometimes like the end of the world. CLEARLY he doesn\\'t love me, right?!?\\n\\n- I cry. A lot. Over any size of issue, even dumb stupid ones. \\n\\n-I cannot enter into situations with people I do not know. My mother suggested that I make friends by talking to people when I lived alone on my college town or attend club meetings. A couple of times I even got in the car and drove partially there before I chickened out and went elsewhere or back home and justified It with a \"you didnt even want to go\".It\\'s not like stores or anything frighten me, just places where I have to interact with people on a level that\\'s more than everyday interaction.

I thought I was going to have a stroke... which sounds silly now but I have been healthy all my life and went down the webmd rabbit hole. Did x-ray, ekg, nothing found. He asked me about chest fluttering and that sort of thing, which I had not experienced, said numbness likely due to hyperventilation. Felt better, then soon after went through a period where I was overly-focused on my breathing. It was annoying, and I had occasional dizziness but went on.

Also since the Colorado theater shooting I can't go to the movies without watching all the exits for someone. I've never experienced any type of anxiety before these two things happened. I also get really home sick now and don't ever want to do anything if I have to be away from home for long periods of time. I can't tell if I'm just worry way to much about things or if I should call the doctor and get some medication. \", \"I hit the two week mark yesterday on my lexapro prescription.  I did five days of 5 mg and then upped it to the full 10 mg dosage.  At first I had a *lot* of nausea as my main symptom - was also fairly tired and an increase in my general anxiety.  Everything I was reading said the symptoms go away after about two weeks... and today I notice I still feel nauseated.  Not as much, but enough to lose my appetite.  It always seems to hit me about 4-6 hours after I take my pill.  I have an appointment this Friday to discuss the medication with my GP, but I'm curious if this is normal or not?  Shouldn't I be past the start up side effect phase and into the feeling better phase?\\n\\nI'm also a huge emetophobe and can't tell if this is real nausea and side effects or just anxiety induced.  I'm also scared of becoming addicted to xanax and have had to use more xanax these past few weeks to get myself onto the lexapro.  (I'm prescribed 1.5 mg of xanax daily, but prior to this rarely ever used more than .5 mg a day.  Since starting lexapro though I've been using 1-1.25 mg a day... so now I'm terrified what I'm feeling is some form of benzo withdrawal).\", \"I finished my prescription two weeks ago on Thursday (150's) and only had two small panic attacks so far. And I've been getting headaches and intense dreams after finishing up the meds. I wanted to try and see if I can manage my GAD on my own. But today I was at work and was under a lot of pressure to set banquet bars up within a tight time limit. I think it may have been a trigger for me, because within an hour afterwards I got really painful stomach cramps. It's like there's a huge amount of pressure on it and I don't know how to go about dealing with it overnight. I've also felt really nauseous and clammy (as if fighting a fever) tonight. If anyone has any tips for managing this I would appreciate it so much\", 'Hi everyone.  I haven\\'t really posted since my [Rant] two months ago.  But things have improved greatly for me since then.  \\n\\nToday I posted to my old blog for the first time since last April.  I had dropped it like a hot potato because it had become a minor stressor.  Today I posted and told everyone about my anxiety and subsequent breakdown last summer.  I feels like a weight is gone from my shoulders.  I thought I\\'d copy and paste the text here, in the hopes that someone might be inspired or even just feel better. \\n\\nPlease note that I will not take offense if you don\\'t want to read the following wall o\\' text.  Sometimes a wall of text is just too irritating to read.\\n\\nIf anyone wants to see the blog post in situ (there are kitty pictures at the end) you can find it here: [blog post](http://minikatslittlethoughts.blogspot.com/2013/01/breakdown-and-resolutions.html).\\n\\nFor those who would rather just read the **wall of text** without leaving Reddit, here it is: \\n\\n\\n&gt;It\\'s taken me a long time to be able to even think about writing this post.  Life for me has changed drastically since last April and I\\'ve had to make several changes along the way in order to progress.  Before I go into any details, I would like to state a few things.\\n\\n&gt;* This will be the one and only post about this topic.  The journey is difficult and private, but I felt I should explain my absence to my blog-friends.  A few of you have emailed me privately and gotten the run down already, so this will be old news along with new news.\\n\\n* This will be the only post that\\'s made on a non-Sunday this year.  More on that is a bit.\\n\\n* For the animal lovers here, Pollux and Artie are still doing well.  They\\'ve been joined by a sweet little calico named Pixel.  I\\'ll get to her further down.\\n\\n******\\n\\n&gt;Many of you know that I live with a few physical medical conditions.  They make my life a little harder in some ways, and easier in others.  I take them in stride. However I\\'ve never really talked about living with anxiety disorders.  It\\'s not something I enjoying talking about randomly and honestly for a long time they were under control.  I live with GAD [Generalized Anxiety Disorder] and a mild (if one can call it that) form of PTSD [Post-traumatic stress disorder].  Without going into too many personal details, I will say that I was abused as a child.  The resulting anxiety was made worse by being on the lower rung of the pecking order in school and being bullied constantly.\\n\\n&gt;Years of therapy when I was younger made all the difference in the world for me.  Back then the medications for anxiety were in their infancy and not covered by insurance.  They also had some interesting complications for individuals going through puberty.  And back then it was decided I didn\\'t need them.  I wasn\\'t as stressed and therapy alone taught me wonderful ways to combat my fears and actually live every day.\\n\\n&gt;(Now of course the medication available for mental illness are a godsend.  They can help take away the brunt of the pain and anguish, leaving therapy and personal determination to deal with the rest.  I will state that not everyone with a mental illness has access to either therapy or medications, which I believe is a crying shame.  But that\\'s not what this post is about.)\\n\\n&gt;Anxiety is a funny thing.  It can creep up on you and sinuously wind deeper and deeper into your heart and mind.  It can be so subtle, the changes are unnoticeable even to those closest to you.  It can also hit you like a freight train loaded with bricks.  The panic, the chest pains, the sudden fear in seeing that your world is going to absolute hell around you.  The horrifying dreams in which you relived your abuses and cannot take control of the dream, no matter what you try.  It can be a mix of the two, creating an emotional roller coaster of fear.\\n\\n&gt;Stress plays a huge part in controlled anxiety getting out of control.  And so I found myself loosing control of the beast, existing in a fog of fear and doubt, and having more and more external stresses heaped upon me.  More stress than someone without anxiety issues would want to handle: Friends severely ill, some passing away; my father\\'s health declining; worrying about my mother\\'s health as she takes on more of a parental role to her husband; money troubles from all the past veterinary bills; missing my lost critters more and more every day; FH\\'s stress levels from working too hard for too long without a break; needing to find the time to finish projects, including the Panda Nursery and completely overhaul the Guild\\'s webpage.  All this and more. \\n\\n&gt;As time went on, even the little every-day things became major stressors.  Getting the laundry washed, dried, AND put away before the shirts wrinkled.  Remembering to get Pollux\\'s medications refilled on time, not to mention getting him to not vomit up said medications.  Artie\\'s energy level and desire to play making him into more of a bully than a companion to Pollux.  Physically going to the grocery stores and dealing with the crowds of people. Picking up a needle to stitch when the trash needed going out, but it was pouring down rain and I\\'d left my raincoat in FH\\'s car.  Trying to get the workroom organized so I could use it because I\\'d seen a neat how-to on another blog and wanted to play, but I was needed down south for several days.\\n\\n&gt;In July I had a nervous breakdown.\\n\\n&gt;It was all just too much.  And I couldn\\'t handle it all on my own.  I also knew I couldn\\'t make FH carry the weight alone.  He\\'s my partner, not my doctor.  And I wanted my life back.  Simply existing through a day wasn\\'t enough.  I wanted to live.\\n\\n&gt;So I talked to our doctor and was given a short-term medication.  It\\'s highly addictive and not meant to be taken for more than a few months straight or as a \"rescue\" during times of intense anxiety.  But it bought me time and gave me relief enough to do some research into other medications.  And to find a secular therapist in this area who specializes in my type of illness and who works with our insurance.  **As an aside, I won\\'t be mentioning the specific medications, as every person\\'s body chemistry is different.  What works for me may not work for someone else. \\n\\n&gt;We took a vacation in August to Copper Harbor, Michigan.  An actual vacation, the first in seven years, which was both good and bad for me.  Good because I could relax seeing FH relax and because life\\'s about living.  Bad because I was worried about Pollux and Artie, and the house, and my parents, and because we were camping.  There was dirt.  Lots of dirt.  My dislike of dirt being anywhere near my bed was a difficult aspect of the trip.  However the scenery helped to make up for it.  That and the location was so remote, FH would have to drive up a mountain to call into work.  Needless to say, that only happened once so he could tell them there wasn\\'t cell signal.  He relaxed a lot, which helped me relax.  Also our best friend was with us.  There were walks along beaches, toasted marshmallows sandwiched between chocolate mint cookies, and blueberry cobbler in the dutchy.  Also it let FH go and do things with someone when I just wanted to sit under a tree and read.  But we had some wonderful adventures on the trip, including getting pictures of Lambeau Field on our way up.  Happily our route took us right through Green Bay, WI.\\n\\n&gt;When came home, fate had a surprise for me.  We\\'d been talking about getting another kitten to keep Artie company (and relieve pressure on Pollux) for a few weeks prior, but knew we should wait until after we got home from Michigan.  Besides, the pet sitter didn\\'t need to deal with a kitten who wasn\\'t sure of it\\'s new environment on top of dealing with Artie who hates strangers and Pollux who hates being  medicated.  A couple of weeks after we came home, I received a text message from a friend.  Her daughter had found a kitten trying to get warm under the hood of a car.  A calico whose markings reminded my friend of Confetti\\'s.  After she sent me a picture, FH knew the deal was made.  I drove 100 miles the next morning to get her and have her tested for FIV and leukemia.  The tests were negative and I brought her home.  She didn\\'t have a name until later that night when we came up with Pixel.  She\\'s been an important ray of sunlight and hope for me since then.\\n\\n&gt;Shortly thereafter we (our doctor and I) started playing with new medications.  Firstly I had to wean off of the short-term drug.  The got interesting with nightmares, bursts of anxiety, and just not feeling well.  The first long-term medication we tried actually made me depressed as a side effect.  I didn\\'t notice quite what was happening, because the anxiety wasn\\'t there, and that\\'s what we wanted.  However I wasn\\'t making anything.  My doctor knew there was a problem when she walked into the exam room and I was playing solitaire on my phone instead of stitching.  We switched to another medicine that night and suddenly I felt like myself again.  It was like flipping a switch.  I could go to bed when FH did and get up before noon, I wanted to work on projects again, and the anxiety was more of a faded echo in the back of my head.  That was at the beginning of December.\\n\\n&gt;It\\'s important to remember that anxiety doesn\\'t just affect you either.  It\\'s something that everyone you love and who loves you has to deal with.  Dearest FH knew about my past before we even started dating.  He dealt with the fears, the night terrors, the few and far between days when I just couldn\\'t stand the thought of being alone.  Now he\\'s dealing with them more often.  Happily for both of us I am getting better.  He\\'s watched me become the person I was all over again and be happy again.\\n\\n&gt;I\\'ve had to make several changes in the way I do things.  I\\'ve had to remember how to say, \"No, I can\\'t do ____ right now.\"  I\\'ve had to make conscious efforts to use the almost forgotten techniques I learned in therapy all those years ago to calm myself down when the world starts to close in on me.  Things I used to do all the time, but over time got out of the habit of doing because I didn\\'t have time. And honestly, I\\'d pushed the past out of my head because I didn\\'t want it to own me.  That\\'s part of where I went wrong for myself.  What I needed to do was grasp it with both hands, dig my nails into it, and own it instead.  It doesn\\'t need to define me for me to own it either.  I just can\\'t let myself forget that controlling it means owning it.\\n\\n&gt;I know I will have good days and bad days.  Everyone does.  It\\'s just that my bad days can be worse than the average person\\'s in some ways.  The goals here is to make the bad days fewer and farther between and to not let the bad control me.\\n\\n******\\n\\n&gt;This post isn\\'t just about all the ups and downs.  It\\'s also about my goals for this year.  They are as follows:\\n\\n* Keep getting better.  Notice there is no timetable here.  It will happen as it happens, no sooner.  But every day I\\'ll be working toward a positive direction.\\n\\n* Once a week I will finish some type of creative project, big or small it matters not.  It can be a single miniature, a roombox, a section of a dollhouse, a cross stitch, a quilt, playing with a new technique... you get the idea.  It doesn\\'t matter what it is, what matters is a completed project and with it, a feeling of gratification. \\n\\nIF I happen to finish more than one project in a week, good for me.  But that doesn\\'t mean the counter isn\\'t reset on Sunday.  I will have to finish another one the following week.  It\\'s time for a little tough love on myself.  I\\'m ready for it.\\n\\n* Every Sunday this year I will blog about the above mentioned project(s) that was finished during the week.  I will only be posting on Sundays as to limit the amount of pressure on myself to take pictures and write.  I\\'m hoping that by next year I\\'ll be able to post more often, but for now once a week will be enough.  There will also be the occasional photo of my feline helpers of course.  One cannot work without snoop-ervision.\\n\\n&gt;I just want to thank people for reading this wall of text.  It hasn\\'t been easy to write.  Tomorrow I\\'ll be starting my weekly Sunday post with a some gorgeous things I\\'ve finished this first week of January.\"\\n', \"I just had an anxiety dream about work. I just feel like I need to share it in order to make myself feel better and this seemed like a good place to do it. Also if anyone has any tips on how to reduce your stress after waking from an anxiety dream that would be awesome. I work in a group home for people with intellectual disabilities and when giving meds we have a 2 hour window to do so (so if it's an 8pm med then you have from 7 until 9), if it's outside the window you get a med error. Basically in the dream I had waited until the last minute to give meds so I had 15 minutes to do the meds for the four individuals. For whatever reason as I was frantically searching for all the supplies a random group of people showed up and were just standing around not helping me at all. At one point I was yelling at them to turn the lights on so I could read the medications and pop them in the med cup. No one did a thing. So after I got up and turned the lights on and went back to doing meds I started to hyperventilate in my dream. Basically I began to have an anxiety attack in the middle of my dream, not in real life, just my dream. And that's what triggered me to wake up. This was probably one of my more unpleasant dreams, definitely worse than most of my nightmares. \", \"So I used to take Zoloft, and it helped me quite a bit, until summer of 2013, when it lost its effectiveness. (I had been taking it since 2000, so it's completely understandable that it wasn't effective for me anymore.) Then, in the fall of 2013, I started trying out different meds, to see if I could find one that worked better for me. I tried just about every SSRI, and all of them had awful side effects. Then I tried Paxil. I knew nothing about any of the common side effects. I just knew that it was the only SSRI I hadn't tried yet, so I wanted it to work. And it does work for me, but there's one thing...it completely took away my sex drive. I can barely feel anything down there. It's so frustrating because I know I'm turned on sometimes, but there's nothing I can do about it. It's like a permanent case of sexual frustration. Yet I feel like I'm stuck on Paxil, since it's the only SSRI that doesn't make me feel physically ill or jittery or otherwise awful. I'm so fucking frustrated, and I feel broken.\\n\\nSo can anyone else identify?\", \"I guess a little back story is necessary: I was in the hospital pretty recently for a suicide attempt, it was pretty serious but I am almost entirely recovered, sans some surface level numbness in my back and pain that can be overwhelming sometimes.\\n\\nWhen I was in the hospital my mother requested a urine drug test, I had a few things in my system and since I had just attempted suicide the immediate assumption was that I had a pretty serious problem (although I hadn't used in a considerable while and what happened was a result of my bipolar cycle).\\n\\nSo how this relates to meds: Leaving the hospital, the doctors wanted me on no narcotics. This is pretty rough considering I had loads of broken bones -2 burst vertebrae, 2 broken vertebrae, 4 broken ribs, cracked manubrium, broken ulna and radius- and am now off opiate pain meds. I was also on .25mg Klonopin every morning and .5 as needed once a day max. \\n\\nThe Klonopin was the only med that has actually helped my anxiety, but it is a narcotic. I have been on a huge amount of neuroleptic and they either make me feel extremely inebriated/cloudy and/or plain don't help. Really the only negative side effect of Klonopin I experienced was mild drowsiness, but it was nothing compared to something like Buspirone which I am on now or Quetiapine which I could not function on.\\n\\nSo here is where I am having trouble, I don't know how to talk to my doctor or my mother about this. I never abused Klonopin, but I doubt they will believe that and I don't want to get labeled as a drug seeker, especially now since my anxiety has been crescendoing pretty seriously, it is starting to truly get in the way of my social and school life.\\n\\nThanks for your help, everyone :)\", \"So my doctor just prescribed me BuSpar for my anxiety, and I feel a lot better. The things that used to send me in to a full blown panic now just tend to agitate me a little. Thats the good part.\\n\\nThe bad part is I'm getting lightheadedness and occasional headaches that reach 7 or 8 on the pain scale. Can I expect these side effects to stick around or is this just the drug's initial effects? \\n\\ntl;dr: How many water buffalo can you fit in a shipping container?\\n\\n**UPDATE:** I ought to add that BuSpar isn't my first medication. I have also been on Paxil, Wellbutrin and Ativan. I have both anxiety and depression and I have been on and off treatment for several years. I'm giving the BuSpar a chance because I hated the way Paxil made me feel, as well as the sexual side effects which were terrible.\\nAs an update, the headaches are gone, and the lightheadedness is greatly diminished. I'm actually feeling pretty damn good at the moment and have been in contact with my doctor the whole time.\", 'Ive been doing well with them lately, ive noticed that once I have tappered off my meds (Paxil and Xanex) that the severity of the panic attacks have gone down. I no longer feel paralized when this happens, I will just deal with the lump in my stomach and feeling of dread, which was better than total loss of all functions. \\nMy parents are seperating after a long time of being together when they shouldnt have. My mother, brother and I are moving out from living with my father, which is going to be such a great thing for all 4 of us. But my father suffers from mental illness and is not dealing with this sudden change well at all. I feel as if I have been absorbing his anxiety like a sponge. \\nIm sitting at work and I can hardly breathe. Pacing around like an idiot trying to do everything and anything to change the subject in my mind. I thought that I got ahold of this, why is this happening to me again? It hurts, my chest hurts, my mind hurts. I can feel it getting worse and worse. I dont know if anyone has advise. I just wanted to talk. Thats all.', \"I was first diagnosed with anxiety in elementary school, so I have known about my anxiety my entire life and it has never been stigmatized. Although I have always had access to counseling, I found out my freshman year of college that I did not trust myself with anxiety pills because I wanted to take them ALL the time, so after one bottle I never touched them again.\\n\\nEven though I'm pretty familiar with my anxiety, I am experiencing new symptoms that I never had before once I started applying to graduate schools. I get really obsessive about looking up unemployment rates, acceptance rates at school, 2 year graduation rates for MA programs, funding information, etc. I was spending 3+ hours a day at my worst just memorizing university stats for schools I didn't want to go to and programs I wasn't interested in!\\n\\nThis year, I've also become something of a perfectionist, which is COMPLETELY unlike me. Grades were released today and I just found out I got a 4.0 my last semester. This stressed the HELL out of me. I don't know why, I should have been thrilled! I thought I was going to get at least one B, but instead of celebrating, I started picking at my skin and panicking because I felt like it didn't matter, it still wasn't good enough. I feel like any other time I would have been thrilled about this good news, but academic accomplishments just make me sad and anxious now.\\n\\nLastly, am not dealing well with this winter break. I feel like I'm being unproductive and lazy, even though I start my new job in January. I've only been on break for three days, and I've been really self-destructive and really obsessive about school stats again. \\n\\nI've always had anxiety, but this is VERY different than my usual symptoms and much more intense. Can you think of anything that would cause all this just when everything is going RIGHT in my life? I really want to try anxiety meds again, but I know I did not trust myself with them 3 years ago. I just want to enjoy this winter break, but instead I just freak out and worry every day. This is a complete regression.

So you can read this if you like, and I do have some questions.\\n\\nSo my mother suffers from anxiety, one of my grandma's is bipolar, and my other grandma was depressed when she was alive. Mental illness runs in my family, so when I began to show signs of anxiety is was not a big deal since I was used to my mother. My dad is a very rational person, and growing up I was able to handle my anxiety using the part of my brain that I feel I got from him. I don't worry about tests or social settings, what I get severe anxiety about is relationships with SOs and friends/family.\\n\\nI remember my first real panic attack was freshman year when I thought my cousin was cheating on her boyfriend, who had become a part of our family. I couldn't eat or sleep until I confronted her and found out the truth. Two years later, in my junior year, I began my first serious relationship with an older guy. It was a long distance relationship, so it got real serious real fast. He was my first love and we worshiped each other. We never argued and we talked about getting married, which was ridiculous but we were so caught up in our love that it felt normal. Plus he had his own problems which I know now, but that is besides the point. Anyways one day, I just started questioning my feelings for him. As far as I can remember, nothing triggered it. I think it was because I was emotionally unstable during the times we werent together, and something must of just been triggered in my brain. I asked myself if I really loved him, or if he really was the one. For a week, I vomited every night and cried. I couldn't eat or sleep. Finally my mom took me to the doctor and I got prescribed with zolaft because that is what my mom takes. \\nEventually the pills allowed me to deal with everyday life, but the anxiety would still come back every so often. The guy ended up not being able to deal with and turned insecure and mean. So I ended it with him, and was doing very good for awhile.\\n\\nWhen I got into my senior year, I began dating a new guy. This relationship was a real test for my anxiety because his friends were constantly trash talking me behind my back and he was in some ways a pushover. I had panic attacks, but I was still able to deal with every day life, and I attribute that to my medication. I didn't vomit, and I was able to sleep and eat. I constantly questioned his feelings for me and eventually I began questioning my feelings for him. However, this time around I was able to recognize that these feelings were irrational and they were not how I truly felt. Luckily, this guy was able to handle it for the most part, but his inability to stand up for me drove me nuts. \\nUnrelated to our relationship, on Valentines day I was working and I started questioning the point of my life if I wake up feeling like this everyday (the anxiety). I had an emotional breakdown at work because I was seriously considering ending my life. I called my best friend who deals with anxiety and she told me to tell my work. Luckily my work really took care of me and I called my mom to come pick me up because I was in no state to drive home. She was in a panic because I was vague on the phone but when I told her my thoughts it even worried her more (remember she has anxiety). \\nI went to see my doctor and I had realized that I had had a negative reaction to the zolaft after a year of being on it. I knew that those feelings were not me, because I am a very positive person. Since then I have been on effexor and I feel similar to how I felt when my zolaft was working. I know I should see a therapist and I am working on doing that. The week between the two medications was crazy. My anxiety was very high, but I had this unlimited amount of energy. I could sleep, but I didn't have to. I was able to get so much more work done with school and I just felt productive. Right now I am in college and feel like I procrastinate and don't get anything done. I want to get off my medication because I feel like I could do better in school. However, I cannot handle relationships with my anxiety. \\n\\nI eventually broke up with my boyfriend, and I had another one recently who broke up with me and I think it was because of my anxiety. I want to get off of my medication but I don't think I can every be in a romantic relationship without it. I constantly question my own feelings and their feelings for me, and you guys will know how easy it is for our minds to spiral out of control.\\n\\nMy two questions are: \\nHave you dealt with this inability to handle relationships due to your anxiety?\\nand\\nDo you think it is smart to get off my medication if it is clearly helping me deal with everyday life?\", 'I\\'m a 21 year old woman who has never been diagnosed with anxiety. However, I think I probably have it. I get stressed about very small things *very* easily. For example, simply thinking about the act of reading another chapter of my textbook when I\\'m taking a difficult college course will make my chest feel tight. It\\'s a weird feeling... it doesn\\'t hurt, really, but it feels very uncomfortable.\\n\\nAdditionally, talking to 4+ people at a time or doing anything new makes me feel lightheaded and shaky. The shakiness is the worst part of all this for me. I\\'m a nursing student starting in three weeks (woo!), but I\\'m so very scared of trying to do *anything* practical like learning catheter insertion because my hands shake so much when I\\'m nervous. It\\'s more frustrating than anything because I\\'m scared to death that I\\'m going to fail nursing school; we only get TWO CHANCES to do things right during skills evaluation. What if my shaky hands mess me up? Talk about scary.\\n\\nTo get to the point (sorry about all that, it\\'s just new to me to stop beating myself up over the way I am): I want to see a doctor. I\\'m going to have health insurance again very soon, and I want to fix this, at least for nursing school. The only problem is that I simply do not have time for therapy or any quality, long-term treatment. With an insanely demanding nursing program, helping my aging grandmother out, housework, and sleeping, I just don\\'t have any more time to devote. I\\'m wondering if medication could be the best option for now. I just don\\'t want to visit a doctor and tell them I just want meds because I don\\'t have time for therapy... That seems a little sketchy. I don\\'t know if it seems sketchy to doctors or not, but hey, I\\'m from a bad neighborhood. I guess I just assume the worst where drugs are involved. How do I approach the topic with my physician? I\\'m pretty new to this. \\n\\nFor those of you taking medications, could you share your experiences? How much does it help? Are there any side effects you really don\\'t like? How long does it take to \"work\"? Any information you would be willing to share with me would be awesome. \\n\\n**TL;DR I need to \"fix\" my anxiety, but I don\\'t have the time/money for therapy. How can I talk to my doctor about taking medication without seeming like a potential drug abuser?**', \"*deep breath* So, I've dealt with depression pretty much as long as I can remember. It's been treated on and off since I was 12 or so, first just the symptoms-migraines, dizzy spells, etc., but I was finally diagnosed and got appropriate meds around age 30. I'm 45 now, and there have been a few med changes, some dark, difficult bouts, but overall, I've been dealing with things. My SO is super supportive and was pretty much responsible for my finally getting the right doctors and meds. \\n\\nA few weeks ago, we came home early from work and discovered we'd had a burglar. They'd come in through our cat door (we're guessing since there weren't any signs of force &amp; all the doors had been locked-it's a mid sized door), taken the top two drawers of my jewelry box and scooted out the back door. I didn't feel that upset at the time, just glad that they were gone when we got there, the cat was okay, and nothing else was taken. For some reason, filling out the insurance forms freaked me out though. I was supposed to have sent them in over a week ago, but whenever I start filling them out and listing things, I can't breathe properly and I feel faint. This past Sunday, I had those symptoms, plus uncontrolled crying, blurred vision and a migraine. I'm trying to put my finger on what it is about this that has me so rattled. I pretty much only wear my wedding rings and some simple pieces I was wearing at the time and nothing individually was very costly but the sentimental things really bother me: my grandmother's wedding band though, and a charm bracelet that my family and friends had been giving me charms for over the last 30 years, my mom's high school ring-all probably now melted down for scrap. \\n\\nBut that's beside the point anyway. Do panic attacks just go away or will I have these regularly now? Should I get my meds adjusted or changed? I'm not sure what I need to do and everything was working well, so I'm afraid of upsetting the balance.\\nI don't even quite know why I'm bothering this sub with it, but if anyone has any insight or suggestions, I'd be super open to hearing it.\\n\", \"Hello. I've been with my girlfriend for about 2 years and we've lived together for about 6 months. Recently she has been having terrible anxiety and I'm at my wit's end. From the sound of it, it seems quite bad and we're in the process of getting her some professional/medical help. She has intense episodes of anxiety which completely shut her down and trying to talk to her when she's like that is like trying to talk to the wall. No matter what I say, it doesn't help. Often these episodes end in her completely crashing and crying uncontrollably and there's nothing I can do except watch and try to be with her. She also suffers from long periods of depersonalization/derealization.\\n\\nWe're trying to make a habit out of meditation and while it does seem to calm me down, it doesn't do anything for her while she's having anxiety. Her doctor suspected overactive thyroid from her blood samples, so if anyone has any experiences with that, it would be helpful if you share your experience!\\n\\nI know there probably isn't any magic word that removes anxiety, but if there's anything I can do that actually helps I would be more than willing to do it.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** Help confused boyfriend help extremely anxious girlfriend.\", 'I\\'ve been having so much anxiety lately with the feeling that there are butterflies in my heart constantly, fluttering around. As if my heart is being tickled, then that creates this kind of tightness and I have to take a deep breath to relieve it but it comes back.\\n\\nI had been just attributing it to my anxiety and the Concerta I started two weeks ago. I told my friend about this though and she was making a big deal out of it asking how do I know that it\\'s from the anxiety and meds, it could be something serious and I need to talk to my doctor because even if it is a side effect, it\\'s a serious side effect.\\n\\nAnd I mean, it\\'s a stimulant. Yeah, it\\'s going to affect my heart. Maybe my friend didn\\'t understand this?\\n\\nI\\'ve had the fluttering for a year now, once this anxiety stuff began. Recently though, it has become a more prominent thing and really noticeable. I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s maybe more apparent because of the meds and as my \"issues\" have gotten more serious, I\\'ve become a ton more anxious. These things all coincide with one another but what my friend said is still on my mind? Should I talk to my doctor about this? And if so, what medicine do you think would work for me (if the Concerta is part of the issue)? Maybe switching from to Adderall? I don\\'t know. Thank you ahead of time, really.', 'So I\\'ll try to keep this short. A short background on me, I have always had a level of anxiety, but only in college did it rear up really bad and become debilitating. I entered therapy about a year and some change ago, it\\'s helping a little but I\\'m still honestly really struggling. Tried benzos for a short period and they weren\\'t really effective (tried xanax and valium) due to the gnarly side effects. I exercise regularly and try to eat as best as I can (my main symptoms are lack of appetite, GI symptoms and vomiting).\\n\\nSo essentially, I\\'m going back to school tomorrow at a new college, and I\\'ve been struggling all week anticipating it. I\\'m kind of dealing with it OK, as long as I keep my head down and ride out the panic attacks alone. I can\\'t be around others right now, as it increases my anxiety. My social anxiety really destroyed my social life--I haven\\'t been able to make any new friends since I started therapy because I\\'m pretty unreliable (I need lots of time alone to cope). The friends I do have are long-term friends and know about my issue so don\\'t expect a lot from me, and I give them what I can, which is basically hanging out once every couple of weeks, for a few hours. \\n\\nThe trouble is, when I can get myself to go out and be comfortable and relax (for example, class) I appear really social and normal, and lots of people want to be friends with me. But as soon as they ask me to hang out another time (\"hey, what are you doing this Friday? Want to go on a hike?\"), I panic and run. It\\'s a big, big issue. Even texts strike fear into my whole being.\\n\\nThe problem I\\'m having that caused me to write this post is that distant acquaintances (potential new friends) have been contacting me this week just by chance. They are asking me to participate in projects (I\\'m an artist), hang out with them, chat, etc. All things that I\\'m not really ready to do right now. I WANT to eventually make new friends, because I\\'m struggling with loneliness, but since I have spent SO MUCH time alone, simple things like going for coffee or going on a walk with someone else are extremely challenging and stressful. I definitely want to attack this thing soon, but at this moment I\\'m way too overloaded trying to adjust back into school.\\n\\nSo my questions for the community. How do I fend off these people politely, without having to reveal that I have a crippling anxiety disorder? What\\'s your go-to? I\\'m usually pretty honest and try not to be rude, but I\\'m also really ashamed that I have anxiety this bad and that I\\'m so unstable.  \\n\\nI\\'m also wondering about your guys\\' medication stories--BuSpar, ADs. I\\'ve been at therapy for a long time now and I\\'m considering changing therapists since I\\'m not really getting great results (in fact, I feel like my anxiety got WORSE after I entered therapy). I\\'d love to do it without medications, but I feel like I might be in too deep and too afraid of too much to be able to re-integrate into a social life without crashing and burning.

I've also had depersonalization/derealization for many years. The worst anxiety that I developed was around January of this year when I started becoming obsessed with my health. I felt like I had a realization that I never had before; that I would inevitably die. I became so terrified of death so I began to constantly worry about getting cancer, having a brain aneurysm or a heart attack. At the time I actually had a pretty alarming symptom that I had ignored for a year because of embarrassment and just the anxiety of going to the doctor. I finally went to the doctor about it and by June I had tests done that ruled out cancer and so much stress was removed. I feel that this was a big factor in my overall improvement.\\n\\nDuring the appointment where I got the results that confirmed that I wasn't dying, I felt like my focus switched from physical to psychological improvement. I asked my doctor for medication for social anxiety and he prescribed me paxil. After googling paxil, I saw that paxil was also an antidepressant and I was really hesitant on taking it because I didn't think I was depressed. I really hated the idea of taking medication that would numb my emotions. I didn't want a drug to change who I was. I also hated the stigma around such medication. Only my mom knows that I'm taking paxil and I don't think she wants me to. But I'm so glad that I decided to take them because I feel that they are another big factor in my progress.\\n\\nAt the beginning of July, I took LSD for the first time alone. I had bought some many months prior but I was too afraid to take any because I was worried I'd have a bad trip. I think the paxil helped me be more confident but I also had ativan on hand which supposedly helps in the event of a bad trip. Anyways, I ended up having a terrifying experience but I feel like it was beneficial in the end because after it was over I had a new appreciation for everything and I felt more of a need to be healthier, mostly mentally at this time. I immediately started taking vitamin D and B supplements because I read that these can help you mentally. Over the next few weeks I took LSD three more times (I know, too much). Every trip I was met with a terrifying feeling that would just click all of a sudden and it felt so strange and supernatural that I fought it and had a bad time. But when it was over, again I had new appreciation and more motivation to improve myself. I had so many realizations on LSD about the universe and about myself. Growing up with very Christian parents, it has been so hard for me to completely reject the possibility that after I die I may be sent to hell and burn for eternity. The realizations I had on LSD and the strange unexplainable feeling that I experienced helped me to stop questioning whether it's real and just reject it completely. Rejecting Christianity has helped me so much because, well, I'm gay and I've been taught my whole life that gay people are going to hell. I now see myself as having a future where I can consider finding love. Before, I always figured I would have a lonely depressing future because I would live in the closet my entire life. I've become so much more appreciative of who I am and what I have accomplished so far. I no longer fear hell or the concept of not existing.\\n\\nAfter my last trip about 1 and a half months ago I've quit smoking weed altogether. I've also been eating a lot healthier (and have lost some weight), have been more active and social. Also, since I've returned to university about a month ago, I haven't even considered skipping a class which I would frequently do in previous years. I can feel the depersonalization/derealization getting better. I am getting better. For the first time in years.\\n\\nTL;DR: Removed stress, started paxil prescription, tried LSD, feeling better.\", \"I have tried talking myself down but it's actually getting worse. Ruminating the thought of the worst case scenario of my situation just makes my chest tighter and heart race faster. And as someone who is naturally paranoid and anxious this is really turning into a living hell.\\n\\nThis morning I realized I hadn't eaten in 25 hours (looks like I inadvertently celebrated Yom Kippur, haha) and forced myself to eat. Last night I laid in bed just feeling my heart race; I could actually feel the cramps of my heart just getting tired of beating too fast.\\n\\nI take buproprion but I don't feel it really helping with my anxiety. I've been this way since Friday and it seems that everyday I seem to be getting better, only to fall off the purple end crashing into debilitating anxiety that interferes with everything, most importantly my relationship with my SO and my work at my University.\\n\\nWhat can I do? Should I look for a better medication? Distractions are only temporary... Should I just accept that time will hopefully heal this?\", \"I finally gave in and embraced the fact that I may need help overcoming my anxiety and depression this time. I gave up the thought that i'm weak if i don't do it all on my own, and went to see a psychiatrist. It was about an hour session with some pretty easy questions and let me say, it felt GREAT. She let me talk and talk, and talk, and talk, and it felt so good. I told her what i believe my problems were and she kept reassuring me that i am not alone and that it's very justified that i feel the way i feel, almost as if she knew i was needing some reassurance. And when i told her about my severe derealization, i worded it in a way to where i didn't actually say the word, and she knew exactly what i meant. She also said she was very impressed at how informed i was and that i had done my research well. \\n\\nAll in all, I ended up getting started on 10mg of lexapro, even though i'm strongly against medication personally, she assured me that it would help. I'm going to trust her judgment and hopefully it will be uphill from here. Gotta get through the first couple weeks, today is day one and the medicine is sort of making me a bit tired. I'm going to keep on going up from here. \\n\\nSorry for the wall of text, just thought i'd share my experience for those of you thinking of going to a psychiatrist. My advice, go for, it really is amazing.\", \"I was having trouble sleeping. I was on Luvox, before that, setraline. I don't know if either was helping, I was on the setraline for about a month, the luvox 5 days. The luvox gave me terrible insomnia so I called and asked to switch or get something to help me sleep. He switched me to Mirtazapine last night. Holy Shit. I took it at seven, went to bed half an hour later. I slept for about 14 hours and now feel doped up to the eyeballs. I can hardly function. it is taking immense concentration to type. I feel like I am walking through mud and my brain is fried.

The thing that gives me great anxiety is getting a place to call home. I have been very fortunate to have parents that practically gave me a house, i just need to take over payments. The thing is that its far from both our jobs and it just doesnt make sense to live so far. We would rather sell it and buy another place in town. The thing that causes anxiety is doing the paperwork to start a loan from the bank and everything. I feel so overwhelmed and confused and flustered. Ive been trying to ignore it but thats really dumb... I know i need to suck it up and just do it. Right now we live separately, hes renting a room and im living at my grandparents house.

He was scheduled to ship Thursday, but because of some flight cancellations, he got pushed back to tomorrow. So. In anticipation of him leaving, I'm literally experiencing anxiety about anxiety. I can't get myself out of this circle of worrying about how worried I'm going to be once he's gone. I'm in law school, in a very competitive program. I have a huge midterm exam coming up, as well as a writing assignment. All at the same time that he's leaving. I'm afraid I'm going to be such a wreck for the first bit after he leaves that I'll bomb my exams and fuck my future up. \\n\\nHow do I break this cycle? I can't deal with this! I have an appointment with a GP at my university's health center tomorrow morning, so I'm hoping they can help me out a little.

Sigh. \", \"I know you're not doctors or anything. I just want to know if anyone else ever feels like this because this isn't how it used to be for me. \\n\\nBackground: I am scared to death of everything. Some things common (moths, germs, heights, crowds) some things less so (ink/food being on my skin, anything sticky, anyone touching me even slightly). I have trust issues. I'm scared to be in a relationship, I've had a few chances and I always ruin it, seemingly on purpose. I'm 21 and I'm in my first relationship now. The problem is... I'm scared of EVERYTHING. I can't just tell him not to talk at all because literally anything could set me off, that's neither fun nor fair. But in the last couple weeks he's set off a couple really bad triggers for me, memories I've repressed that I *never* want to think about again if I can avoid it. I can't even talk about these specific things, but they haunt me. \\n\\nNow, the question: When these triggers have gone off lately, especially last night, every time I think about the bad memory my head gets numb and dizzy and kind of shocky (not really sure how to explain the sensation, it feels like brain zaps if you know the feeling) but only in the back of my skull. Brain zaps I usually feel in the front or top. On top of this my whole body feels a bit numb but tingly. It all goes away fast but can come back as easily as it goes.

If even one of your lives is changed for the better by my post, I\\'ll feel like it was worth my time to write this out.  \\n\\nSo, before I get to the list of tips, I just want to preface it with a short story about myself.  I had been struggling with stress, social anxiety and depression for a while before this, and it got to a point where I was actually thinking of talking to my parents about it and seeing if I could find some meds that might help me.  Before it got to that though, I decided on doing some research on various topics which might help me with my anxiety.  There is a lot of great information that I came across (which I will mention later), that helped me deal with my problems.  \\n\\nI think the first step we need to take to improve our lives is to become conscious of what we say to ourselves every day.  A lot of us don\\'t love ourselves like we should.  We call ourselves nasty things because we make even the simplest of mistakes.  We do something embarrassing, and we\\'ll beat ourselves up for it for the longest time.  Things on TV and advertisements are constantly telling us that we aren\\'t good enough and that we\\'re too ugly or not skinny enough.  \\n\\nI finally decided that I was sick and tired of always feeling shitty about everything in my life, and I learned that all you have to do is change the way you look at the world.  I was just going to opt for the quick fix of drugs, which mask the problems, but don\\'t deal with the root of it all.  I feel like this is becoming a major problem in the world.  We all have these problems in our lives, so we go get some drugs so we don\\'t have to deal with our feelings.  If you are feeling shitty, it\\'s because there is something wrong with the way you are seeing the world and thinking about things.  \\n\\nI know there are some people who actually do have serious problems such as severe anxiety and depression, and some of those people do need medication to help, but I think a huge number of people diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and a number of other problems don\\'t need to be on meds, and if they can just take the time and effort to better their lives, they can do it.  \\n\\nI wish I could say this is an easy process, but it isn\\'t.  It took me a long time to find the right information, and practice the things I will outline below.  There were a lot of other techniques that I tried, and they didn\\'t work for me, so please take note that some things will work for you while others will not.  You have to find your own way which is effective for you.  \\n\\nSorry for dragging out the intro for so long.  Without further adieu, here are the tips that I have found along my journey which i personally think will improve your life if followed:\\n\\nTips on Improving your Life:\\n\\n#1 - Become conscious of your thoughts.\\n\\n- What are you saying to yourself each day?  Are you constantly criticizing yourself for your mistakes? Are you generally a positive or a negative person?\\n\\n#2 - Practice positive thinking.\\n\\n- Now that you\\'ve realized how you are talking to yourself, it\\'s time to change it to a way that will benefit you.  Every time a negative thought comes into your head stop it!  One way to do this would be to keep a rubber band on your wrist, and snap it every time you have a bad thought.  this way, your brain will equate negative thoughts with pain, and will reduce the amount of negative thoughts you create.  Keep practicing consciously thinking positively.  For a person who is stuck in a pattern of negative thoughts (like i used to be), this will be really hard at first!  Don\\'t give up!  The more you consciously create positive thoughts, the easier it will get.  I would say that if you work hard at this for about a month, it will become a habit, and you will naturally become a positive person.\\nMeditation is also another great way of quieting your mind, and will help you with controlling your thoughts.\\n\\n#3 - Ask yourself the right questions.\\n\\n- This goes off of tip #2 a bit, but listen to the kinds of questions you are asking yourself.  When you make a mistake, are you asking yourself:  a) why am I so stupid?  or  b) What can I do that will help me to avoid this problem in the future?  Try to start asking yourself more questions like choice b).  When we ask ourselves questions, our minds try so hard to find answers, even to questions that don\\'t have right answers.  We might as well be asking ourselves productive questions that will help us improve ourselves.\\n\\n#4 - Love yourself no matter what.\\n\\n- I think this is one of the things that helped me the most.  I used to hate the person that I was.  Whenever I could, I told myself these 6 golden words:  \"I love myself no matter what.\"  At first I didn\\'t believe it, but I kept telling myself those words, and eventually, I did believe them.  Just like with the positive thinking, I think it takes up to a month of these affirmations to really get the full effect, but I guarantee you will start feeling better within the first week of doing this!  Once i finally started to believe what I was telling myself, I felt much happier because I didn\\'t need other people\\'s acceptance or love; I loved myself already.  For that reason, I also reduced my anxiety greatly because i wasn\\'t worried about how other people thought of me because I already accepted myself.  Through this one tip, I became a happier, less anxious, and more confident person.\\n\\n#5 - Be grateful (don\\'t complain or talk negatively about others)\\n \\n- Try to take a moment out of your day to just reflect on the things that you are grateful for.  We live in a beautiful world with wonderful people who love and care about us.  If we are complaining or bad-mouthing others, we are not being grateful.  If you have 5 minutes, watch this video: \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zl9puhwiyw&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player \\n\\n#6 - Work on improving yourself each day.\\n\\n- There is always room for improvement.  look for ways you can improve your knowledge and skills.  Know that you will be a greater version of yourself tomorrow and the following days ahead. \\n\\n#7 - Read and educate yourself.\\n\\n- Make it a habit to start reading books.  Find a good story or read about topics that interest you.  Novels are great, but I would recommend doing a lot of your reading on non-fiction books.  I personally love learning about psychology and reading how our brains work, but like i said, find subjects that don\\'t bore you.  Self help books also provide great information on bettering your life.  I highly recommend reading \"7 Habit\\'s of Highly Effective People\".  It has a bunch of relevant info, some of which I have used in this list.  \\nThere are also a lot of great educational videos out there.  I would suggest starting with these:  \\n\\n- Vice TV:  www.youtube.com/vice\\n\\n     - Lots of interesting documentaries and videos on here.\\n\\n-TED Talks:  https://new.ted.com/talks\\n\\n     - A site filled with a bunch of great talks on various subjects\\n\\n- Diving Deep (Infinite Waters):  www.youtube.com/Kemetprince1\\n\\n     - Just a guy\\'s youtube channel, but he has a lot of insight on how to improve your life and attitude.  I watch one\\nof his videos every morning on my way to work, and it puts me in a great mood for the day!\\n\\nTry to reduce your time spent watching tv shows and movies, not that there\\'s anything wrong with them, but if you are spending the majority of your free time watching tv, then you need to find a better way to spend your time.  These programs that we watch don\\'t give us any useful information.  \\nI\\'m not saying that you should stop watching movies and shows all together.  It\\'s great to have your favorite shows and movies, and there\\'s a lot of great shows and books that make us laugh and feel good.  If something makes you laugh/smile, then it isn\\'t a waste of time.  Just don\\'t make watching tv the only thing you do when you get home.\\n\\n#8 - Find something you are passionate about.\\n\\n- Everyone has something that they are passionate about.  Maybe you just haven\\'t found it yet.  Go out and try new things until you find it.  Having a hobby is a great way of blowing off steam and taking your mind off of things like work.  If you can turn your passion into your work, that is a bonus!\\n\\n#9 - Make guidelines on how you should live your life (a mission statement)\\n\\n- Put some time aside to come up with your mission statement.  What are important values to you?  Always go back to your guidelines and add/refine lines as you are progressing on your journey.  I know this can be time consuming, but once you have guidelines on how to live your life, you will making decisions and behaving in ways that match with the values you have recorded.\\n\\n#10 - Have clear goals, and a plan on how you are going to get there.\\n\\n- Many of us don\\'t have any goals in life, but would you run in a race with no goal or end point?  We need to start thinking of what we want out of life.  Where do you want to be 5 years from now?  What kind of person do you want to be?  We need things to work toward.  And don\\'t just have big goals.  We need the small victories along the way to keep us going.  Start making a to-do list for your day, month, and even year.  It feels so good to check off the things you\\'ve accomplished.  Writing your goals down will also help to motivate you to go through with them, since it is no longer just a thought in your head.  \\n\\n#11 - Try and see things from other people\\'s perspectives. \\n\\n- your first objective in any interaction should be to understand the other person.  Many of us can\\'t wait to have our say, or give people our advice, and we aren\\'t really listening or caring about what the other person has to say or how they feel.  Listen to what they are saying and try to put yourself in their position and feel how they would feel being under those circumstances.  This will greatly improve your communication with others, as well as strengthen your relationships.  \\n\\nWell, that\\'s what I\\'ve got so far.  If I come up with some more useful tips, I might consider making a part 2 of this thread, but we\\'ll see.  I hope at least some of the things i expanded on above will help you along your journey.  If anyone has anything to add, be it any good books or videos relating to anything mentioned above, or if you have some tips of your own, please share them with us! \\n\\nHere are some additional resources to check out that I would highly recommend:\\n\\n- 7 Habits of Highly Effective People:  http://www.amazon.com/The-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/1451639619/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392466718&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=7+habits+of+highly+effective+people\\n\\n- A guide to rational living:  http://www.amazon.com/Guide-Rational-Living-Albert-Ellis/dp/0879800429/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392466803&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+guide+to+rational+living\\n\\n- The Power of Habit:  http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392466888&amp;sr=8-1\\n\\nWill add more if I remember.\\nThank you taking the time to read this!\\n\\n-Paradigm_shift1\\n      ', \"It's been a while since I've posted (or needed to) because my meds have been absolutely amazing (aside from some memory loss).

They all came from playing soccer and never affected me in school or socially. At the start of my 15 birthday i started taking medication for my anxiety, as it was getting worse and forming panic attacks, starting home phobias and social disturbances . I experiences some tragic injuries in my soccer career that gave my a lot of depression, yet i would always get back up. At the age of 16 i got my license and finally got the girl of my dreams. I was in amazing shape and i believe i quitting medication or slowly got off it myself (sorry cant remember) it seemed everything was working out and i grew out of it. By my 17 birthday my girlfriend broke up with me to go to college, it devastated me, because we where the bestest of friends doing everything together and she helped my over come so many of my fears and phobia, some without even knowing it. After that i receive letters and calls to play academy, pro, or college soccer. I broke my leg, my worst injury ever, some doctors saying career ending injury. I recovered and became what i though was my best ability ever, i ended up quitting club soccer and didn't play high school ball because of anxiety. Disappointed my parents, coaches, and lots of people who looked up to me in not playing in the next level, mainly because i had so much anxiety (especially traveling anxiety; riding the bus, car trips), i began seeing a therapist but i was too immature to follow through with everything, and soon quit going. I attend community  college and beginning of my 2nd semester of freshman year i cold turkey my medication and felt great and exercised and went to school clubs and what not. Now the anxiety is back and hitting me several times a day. I scheduled myself to see the same therapist and plan to follow through on everything she says, yet i don't know if i should go back medication. The whole reason i quit medication was because it was making me sick. I have tried several medications and combinations over the 3 years (18 now). \\n\\nBasically what I'm asking is for alternatives to help me with anxiety. Should i go back to medications? What medications would not have the most side effects? I don't mind waiting for it to kick in. \\nThank you for any help.

I quickly spiraled out of control. I was raped by a girl with BPD, and when she had an episode (from guilt, from rejection, I'm not sure) her friends blamed me. I stopped going to class, and almost failed out of college. I was saved by one credit of choir, and was placed on strict academic probation. Luckily, I was able to get a job over the summer, and when I got back to school, I started smoking weed.

I'm a 30 year old single guy with a college degree (and $60k in student loan debt).  I've had a few jobs in my field over the last 10 years, but about 6 years ago I started having symptoms of Anxiety and would have a full-on panic attack about once every month or two.  No big deal.  I worked with my doctor and started taking Lexapro and Xanax.  Over time, though, it got worse.  \\n\\nAbout two years ago it got to the point where I was missing a lot of work and was constantly getting reprimanded for being late, missing too many days, and not being able to get all of my work done.  It turned into a vicious cycle where stress from work was causing my anxiety to get worse and worse.  About six months ago I had to quit my job.  I cashed in my stock options and 401k and have been living off of that, but the money is almost gone.  I only have enough to cover rent and bills for about two more months.\\n\\nMy anxiety isn't getting better, but I have to get a job or I'll be living on the street.  I looked into disability and social security, but they wouldn't even start to cover the monthly costs of my student loans, much less living expenses.  I have no idea how in the hell I'll be able to handle it.  I can barely get out of my house to go visit family nearby without having a panic attack.  My sleep patterns are all screwed up because of my medication (I almost think I may also have chronic fatigue syndrome as well, I sleep for at least 16 hours a day, but still feel exhausted and really anxious when I'm awake).\\n\\nI just don't know where to go from here.  I am starting to become depressed from all of this, and am afraid that there is no viable options.  I'm out of time, money, energy, and optimism.  \\n\\nI don't know what I'm expecting to get out of this post.  I'm really just hoping to connect with people who understand and can reassure me that it does get better, because right now I just don't see it.\\n\", \"How do you cope with it?\\n\\nI struggle on and off with health anxiety after having health issues for about two years, including glandular fever, then a cyst that they couldn't find when I was feeling sick almost constantly. I'm only 20 years old, female, and relatively healthy (should eat better, exercise more, and sleep better, but who shouldn't, don't drink very often, smoke maybe a cigarette a month) and feel like I am finally healthier. \\n\\nI have had a period of feeling well and anxious for about six months. I had a period of time where I barely slept and started going to therapy and taking Endep 10mg to help me sleep. This helped with the sleep and I got off it after a month after it gave me the jumpstart I needed - I'm 20 years old and want to celebrate 21sts with my friends. I feel more relaxed being off medication than on it as I worry about medication side effects. The therapy didn't do a lot and due to money issues/not feeling like the therapy was doing much I stopped going. I now have the means to return however. I am also so sick of telling the same stories to people over and over.\\n\\nBut I still constantly have aches and pains. Headaches localised to the left side, numbness, backache, neckache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, and so on and so forth. I've been to the hospital around 3 times in the past 6 months, for a panic attack that I thought was an asthmatic/anaphylactic reaction, chest pains that were occuring over the course of months, and once when I thought I had meningitis. Nothing was found any of these times and I believe while the physical symptoms were real, all were triggered by anxiety. I never know what to pay attention to and what not to pay attention to. I have a crippling fear of death (even though I firmly believe that we have a contract and when our time is up our time is up and there's nothing I can do about it) and even though it has improved I still struggle with it.\\n\\nI have tried meditation, breathing exercises, and therapy. I think the therapy would benefit me greatly if it wasn't for my pride. I refuse to admit to anyone other than my boyfriend just how bad the anxiety can get, and he's pretty much sick of it/me at this point and if I ask a question (i.e. Do I have a brain aneurysm?) I usually get a sigh in response which just makes me even more embarassed and ashamed. I know I am not weak and if it was anyone I knew I would encourage them to seek help with no embarassment - but because it's me I cannot stand admitting or talking about my problems beyond a very superficial level. \\n\\nSo I'm curious, who here struggles with health anxiety, what scares you the most about it, and what helps you? I try and understand this problem as much as possible so I am not as plagued by it but it's much harder to find information on in my opinion than other anxiety disorders. \", \"I tried to keep this as concise as possible, but it still ended up a little long:\\n\\n* I've been dealing with some mix of anxiety, a panic disorder, and/or depression for the last few years, and it's very severely impacted my life, especially at school.\\n\\n* I was diagnosed with asperger's syndrome/high functioning autism and with mild asthma when I was a toddler. \\n\\n* I've also had an extremely unstable family life. For 10 years, this included a step-father who was very emotionally abusive of my mother and occasionally directly abusive of me.\\n\\n* I was a straight A student through grades 5 to 10 despite often being home sick. I started in a gifted program in grade 9.\\n\\n* Starting in grade 9 or 10, I progressively began to find school more stressful and by grade 11 I was struggling to keep up. Concentrating in class or getting homework done has become more and more difficult for me.\\n\\n* Also starting in the middle of grade 11 (spring 2013), I began experiencing frequent breathing difficulty associated with panic attacks (once nearly to the point of fainting). I thought at first this was my childhood asthma acting up again, and I ended up in an ambulance and/or ER at least three times, only to be told each time there was nothing wrong with my respiratory system. \\n\\n* During these past few years, I've also had recurrent feelings of depression. It's never been quite that overwhelming dark cloud that many depression sufferers describe (not for a long period of time anyway), so I feel it might be best characterized as [Dysthymia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia). \\n\\n* My doctor prescribed Prozac in spring 2014. This has mostly eliminated my breathing difficulty, but I still struggle with things like concentrating on any substantial project (be it school-related or a personal hobby like programming), or dealing with any kind of stress (my response to stress is generally to shut down and stay at home). \\n\\n* I failed my last semester of high school, so right now I'm trying to finish up my last few credits.\\n\\n* I'm also prone to blaming myself (or my lack of self-discipline) for a lot of my issues. I've never really learned how to stick to a proper routine, I rarely want to go to bed at night, and sometimes I'm not sure if I'm experiencing depression or just laziness at a particular moment.\\n\\n* My current emotional state is really up and down. I'll go through a few days feeling fine and wanting to finish up with high school and get on with my life, but then I'll go through a few days feeling anxious or discouraged (some days its difficult or impossible for me to get myself out my front door and go to school.)\\n\\n* Right now, my biggest triggers of down periods are any sort of stress from schoolwork or other things, and drama in my mum's life. I live with just my mum right now, and she's been my biggest supporter through all this, but I'm also really affected by her ups and downs (she has a history of anxiety and depression and struggles with emotional and physical health issues herself.)\\n\\nI know this subreddit isn't for medical diagnosis, but I'd really appreciate some opinions about what my issues sound like or how best it'd be for me to go about approaching professionals. I struggle to communicate this all in person to my doctor or guidance councillors, and I really don't know what disorder I have because I feel like I have a different mental disorder or none at all, depending on the day, and I really don't know if my issues are more psychological from stresses in my childhood or just the chemicals in my brain being all messed up.\", 'I\\'ve had a mix of general anxiety and social anxiety for probably close to a decade (since puberty, basically), and I\\'ve spent most of that time trying to actively overcome my social anxiety.\\n\\nAnd, while I\\'ve widened my comfort zone and improved my ability to get through most situations, I still end up in situations where I feel needlessly intimidated, unsure of what to say/do, and my brain goes into panic mode (which manifests as barely being able to put together a sentence, and experiencing great struggle in doing so). It is especially frustrating when I go into a situation assuming I\\'ll feel comfortable, even knowing what I want to say/do, and panic mode takes over anyway.\\n\\nYesterday, I had to speak with my manager at work because I was in trouble. I stopped taking a medication that I had been taking for a while, and as a result my job performance has weakened significantly in the last few months (don\\'t feel like going into details on that for now). \\n\\nSo I went to this meeting (casual atmosphere, quick conversation-type meeting), and tried to tell him what was going on with me. I couldn\\'t. I was too afraid, so I said something else (basically resorted to \"oh, I don\\'t feel challenged enough, I need a different task to do\"). My manager is nice, and responded positively, and never gave me the indication that he was personally judging me or angry or anything like that. He just wanted to let me know that my job performance was causing issues, and that I need to work on fixing it. Totally reasonable, and my logic brain can process this and understand it. I did feel guilty and ashamed that I\\'d been doing so badly, and felt bad that it was starting to affect other people negatively. But even though I was trying to take it like an adult, I was getting uncontrollably anxious.\\n\\nI left the meeting *shaking.* Full-body, uncontrollable trembling. Red-faced and clammy. I went and sat at my desk and literally did nothing but sit there and let my body tremble like an earthquake for like a minute.\\n\\nThis is something that used to happen to me frequently, especially in situations that would obviously cause this reaction, like having stage fright while giving a speech in front of a class.

I was putting away a cardboard bus display thingy for back to school, and it had flashing lights you could turn on and off, so of course I turned them on to see because boredom. Well somehow (they made no sound at all) I swear I could feel like a pulsing cringe in my \"bad\" ear.

About 2 weeks ago i went to the mental health clinic (air force)  to talk to them about my most recent panic attack where i felt it coming on and took klonopin that i had left over and it seemed to make things worse.

I've had bouts of therapy and medications throughout my teens and early 20's. When I started grad school last year, my anxiety got worse extremely fast. I've been slow to make friends and feel isolated most of the time because of my anxiety with just about everything. \\n\\nThis semester just started and there have been a few people that seem happy to see me and I was personally invited to go to this Grad Student meet and greet/party at someone's house, but I'm starting to psyche my self out of going...I don't want to have an anxiety attack and then need to leave and make everyone have a terrible opinion of me. I would also have to go alone and that makes it super hard for me. I tend to go to more things if I have a friend or buddy. And Lastly, the person who is hosting the party asked to collaborate with me on a project last semester and I said I would do it and then never got back to him...we haven't really talked since...so it just makes me all the more anxious about the whole thing.\\n\\nRight now I'm on lexapro and searching for a therapist. The battle continues...\\n\\nAny advice/support/suggestions? \\n\\nDoes anyone think that not going will be detrimental to my social life?\", 'Note: When my anxiety medication wears off, I now GET anxiety immediately. It is time to quit it. \\n\\nHello everyone. I am 29 years old. I started taking Lorazepam for anxiety when I was about 21, prescribed by my doctor. The dosage would often fluxuate, but about two years ago I was taking around 6 MG a day. After that I decided I didn\\'t want to depend on the medication any more and started working with a Psychologist on my anxiety. We got me down to 2 mg a day. I have been at that dosage for a while now and she recommended I go see a psychiatrist to help me try something new.\\n\\nThe psychiatrist has me on Imipramine (Tofranil). I started it 14 days ago and I felt like it is the right medication to help me quit lorazepam completely. I followed our original schedule and Sunday was my first day with no loreazepam as we cut off .5 mg of it every 3-4 days. By Monday  I broke down and ended up taking a Lorazepam at 11 am. I lasted 48 hours without any at all for the first time in 7 years. With the help of Imipramine I thought I could \"tough\" through it, but from 7 am to 11 am yesterday were the worst 4 hours I have ever experienced. Pacing back and fourth, anxiety making my heart pound through my chest. my legs got so weak that I couldn\\'t pace and when I laid down all I could do was overthink and make things worse. After severs bouts of an upset stomach and nearly throwing up, I had finally admitted defeat and took a pill. Those four hours felt like four days. I never want to feel like that again.\\n\\nI just wanted to know if there has been anyone else here who has battled quitting a benzo (benzodiazepine) such as lorazepam (ativan) or xanex?\\n\\n**Edit: TLDR: I was on lorazepam for 8 years for anxiety but it started giving me anxiety when it wore off so now I am trying to quit taking it but my body is highly dependent on it and it is a lot harder than I thought.**', \"I was having horrible anxiety for quite some time and I went to the urgent care doctor today because I just seriously could not handle it anymore. The lack of sleep and my headaches were justs too much to deal with. I'm reluctant to be on any medications because I used to be addicted to drugs. I have since learned to handle myself, it was just a major issue with me as to why I didn't want to start. They prescribed me xanax, .25, and I took one and for the past couple hours, I have been waking up once an hour and everytime I go to close my eyes again it's like I'm already dreaming again. It's pretty weird. I took Xanax a year ago and never experienced that. What's weird is I'm on the lowest dose.has this happened to anyone before?\", \"I really am afraid I will not get it. Let me explain how bad my anxiety is, and has been.\\n\\nI have difficulty opening up to anyone, including myself. Every job I've ever had causes me to become more anxious, and neglect my health and hygiene even more. I also always eventually break down and feel like I'm going to destroy the property of the work environment or even imagine killing someone. Then I quit my job instead of doing that, and I'm devastated for months about it, sometimes a year or more. Because my whole life I've tried to be functional and my whole life I haven't been. \\n\\nAt one point I went 10000% neurotic and was questioning every body movement and breath I took. Now I have psychosomatic disorders that cause my breathe to be strained and back to be tight, almost constantly. I tell my doctors and they send me to the counselor. I tell my counselor and they send me to the doctor. I can barely even keep up with paper work or shower consistently. And then they get upset at me for not turning in paper work.\\n\\nI try every single day to calm myself, I meditate sometimes. I try to relax and shrug things off. But I'm still not functional yet. I even get anxiety about going to the counselor. I've tried so many medications in my life it's ridiculous. Some do help anxiety, but then they make me pretty suicidal. \\n\\nI'm so frustrated. This world just doesn't do mentally ill people justice. They don't want to deal with the reality, and so they have completely unrealistic expectations of them. I sometimes just wish I was never born.

My second job is at a fast casual restaurant though, and it\\'s sucking the life out of me. To begin with, I applied for a prep position and interviewed stressing how much I want to work with food. Nope, didn\\'t happen. Cashier/salad maker/bakery attendant is what I got. I was hoping after working there for a couple months I could make a strong case for being moved to pastry or food prep, but we got some new managers in and everyone\\'s been affected. They\\'ve cut mine (and many people\\'s) hours, hired a slew of new faces, been scheduling me in conflict with my other job, and changing the schedule a day before without notice. Besides that in general they\\'re hard people to work with. Last Sunday we had a line to the door for about 2.5 hours. It was crazy busy, the stress kept piling up. All those people and all that noise got to me. I had a mini panic attack, which I kept from being a full blown thing (for me, that means I was still able to breathe and speak), but the damage had been done. I couldn\\'t deal with people. I wanted to explode. I felt like a cornered animal and wanted to lash out in rage. I\\'m pretty sure I gave death glares to all the customers. For me it was fight, not flight, all the way. I kept making mistakes. My manager kicked me off register. Later I went back when things calmed down and a coworker joked \"Oh God, you\\'re back on\". She was joking, but it felt like I was stabbed and she twisted the knife. After work one of my managers called me in to say some customers had complained I had no emotion when taking their order, and I do that - emotionally shut down when I\\'m under stress. Yesterday morning was the worst however. I realized I lost my work hat. This is the third time that has happened in 2 months. That was it. I wanted to cry. I felt ashamed and useless and incompetent.

It was just awful, but I got medication and by the time I was 13 I was totally anxiety free. Now I continued this way until senior year in high school. I had a week where I couldn't bring myself to get on the bus to go to school. It was weird, but I managed to get through it without much of an issue. \\nNow I'm 22 and my anxiety is as bad as it was when I was 11. I stopped taking my medication back when I was 18 and from then on it wasn't an issue. I did more things out of my comfort zone, I saw places I hadn't seen, I wasn't afraid of much. But now it's just so severe. Last August I had cut out caffeine, smoking, and worked on being healthier. I'm underweight as it is, but I wanted to exercise and get into good shape. But since I cut everything out, and even a little while before then. My anxiety has been slowly making its way back, and at this point I don't imagine it could get much worse. Which is good and bad for me. I'm not worried about things getting worse for me and my sanity, but I know that this is crippling my life and making me a difficult person to be around. So I was wondering if you guys had any ideas as to what brought this all back? My life style hasn't changed too much. I've been dating a girl for a year and a half, even living with her since May. She has been kind of critical of me since my anxiety became an issue. When we fight it's definitely worse. I honestly think that has something to do with it. If we don't fight I have generally decent days, still anxious, but not as bad in comparison. We have a lot of bad days together, and I sometimes think I should end it. But her daughter is fantastic and when my gf is happy, things are great. So I think part of it is just the state of my relationship, but it didn't start that way.

I can say that it is pretty annoying and much worse than depression in my opinion.

I have been through several traumatic experiences in my life (child molestation, abortion, sexual assault, near death experience, and family probs) that I've all probably just brushed under a rug looking back on it. Now I think these things are creeping out of my subconscious and affecting my everyday life in the form of anxiety. I've tried multiple medications (Lexapro, Celexa, Cymbalta, Abilify, Zoloft, Xanax), and most of them haven't done much for me except relieve my insomnia. It's becoming so bad now that I breakdown at least twice a week, I have panic attacks, I can't function when I'm at work because I'm just worried about everything, and on top of it all my marriage is a disaster. I even did therapy for 2 years (recently) and I'm right back in the same fucking boat. I have no idea what to do and I really am tired of hurting everyone around me because I can't calm the fuck down. Any advice???\\n\\nTLDR: I've been through a lot of trauma I haven't dealt with even in 2 years of therapy and a shit ton of medication. My anxiety is getting progressively worse, interfering with my daily life and my marriage. Help!!!\", 'Part 1\\n\\nThe anxiety I feel lately seems to focus very intensely on certain topics, and I can\\'t stop thinking about them. I \"obsess\" about how to \"fix\" whatever the issue is, but often there isn\\'t a fix, as it is something that happened in the past. A few weeks ago I lost a weekend + a day of my life because of this (laying in bed, trying to sleep it off and failing, absolutely miserable), and I have a few scars (cuts :/ just superficial enough to let blood, nothing major) to show for it too. But I can\\'t really say I have any rituals or compulsive behavior to go with it.\\n\\nThis has happened about once or twice a week, for the past month, usually about different topics, but they are related. (Not the cutting, that was the first time in a long time).\\n\\nOne thing that differentiates this from what I would think of as \"normal\" is that, afterwards, usually the next day, I feel like this \\'wtf was that\\' hangover. Like, what the hell was I so upset about. If it is a legitimate worry, it is more moderate, and persistent, until there is a real solution. But for these \"obsessive\" things, I can\\'t think of anything else, until I\\'m finally removed/distracted from it, and then I look back, and wonder what the hell I was thinking. But while it\\'s happening, it is totally, completely, consuming.\\n\\nPart 2\\n\\nHooookay. So. I\\'ve never been *diagnosed* as an alcoholic, and I hate that label, because I don\\'t think it\\'s particularly therapeutic. (Please don\\'t start on the AA crap, I hate AA. If I\\'m an alcoholic, I want a legitimate, scientifically supported treatment program, not religion in disguise, please. If it helps you, fine. It\\'s not for me. Moving on.)\\n\\nI recently made an appointment to get reestablished with a mental health professional (a psychiatrist in this case) because my anxiety has become unmanageable for the first time in several years. I went in, intending to be very honest, and I was. I told him I feel like I use alcohol \"wrongly\" sometimes, that is, I have poor drinking habits. I drink when I can\\'t manage. I don\\'t know why I\\'m surprised (well I\\'m not really, just annoyed), but this has limited what he\\'s willing to prescribe.\\n\\nNow, before everyone gets their panties in a bunch, let me say that I used to be a case manager for mentally ill adults. I GET what a beast addiction is, and I understand the considerations that Psychs must take when dealing with this. I respect that he is looking out for my safety, that he doesn\\'t want me to OD on benzos and alchohol. From that standpoint, he is being perfectly responsible.\\n\\nBut I guess, since I came from that field, I felt somehow immune to that evaluation, and felt safe being totally open. Now I sort of regret it. I\\'ve had benzos in my medicine drawer for 5 years. I nursed them -- only took them when I was desperate, and NEVER mixed them with alcohol, despite my tendency to self-medicate. I was actually very responsible with them, despite my abuse of alcohol.\\n\\nAbout 2 years ago, I had what I believe was my first panic attack. I went to the emergency room because I thought I was going to die. They diagnosed it as panic, and prescribed Xanax, and my script filled 30 pills. I took my last one about 3 months ago. So... I don\\'t fit the profile of someone who abuses meds.\\n\\nI don\\'t really *seek* benzos. I just want something that works. I\\'m getting married, and I\\'m honestly THRILLED about marrying my fiance, but the \"event\" of the wedding has traumatized me a lot (plus my dad died last October... that has f\\'d with me a lot). So all these things have probably ramped up my anxiety, and if benzos work, I want them. If something less risky works, fine, I prefer that. I\\'m on Buspar right now, and it\\'s doing nothing useful, really. I think it\\'s designed to tone down day-to-day anxiety, which is not how mine manifests. Mine spikes, and it is obsessive in quality.\\n\\nSorry for the book, hoping someone has insight.\\n\\nEDIT: before anyone points it out: Yes, I know I said I went to pysch because I couldn\\'t manage my anxiety effectively anymore, yet, I admit to self-medicating with alcohol. So, it is true that I haven\\'t been managing effectively for longer than I imply. But the drinking made it stretch. I know it\\'s getting out of hand though, hence, the concern.\\n\\nTL;DR\\nMy anxiety spikes periodically, and feels obsessive in nature, but without compulsions. I self-medicate with alcohol and disclosed this to my psych. His prescriptions haven\\'t been effective for my symptoms. I regret my disclosure about alcohol use as it has possibly precluded his prescription of benzos, which ARE effective, and I have demonstrated for 5+ years responsible use of.

The very idea of buying a test scares the hell out of me.\\n\\nI am seeing a therapist a couple times a month, and I am not taking meds (I don\\'t want to be on them).  The therapy sort of helps, I am sort of okay at trying to talk myself out of it sometimes, and keeping busy helps too, but it\\'s really not enough.  I\\'m so damn tired of being burdened by this all of the time.

Anyway, thanks for reading this if you\\'ve made it this far.', \"Well guys just looking for some support here, don't really know if this is the right place for this but I'm getting kind of desperate. I have had some really bad depersonilization after I took Subboxone as part of a methadone program I was a part of in March. It was pretty immediate effects, it kicked in about a half hour and I was really out of it, confused, had no short term memory and basically felt like I was in a dream. So I stopped taking it immediately and I had NO opiate withdrawals for a few days which stumped my doctors. Unfortunately I still have a lot of these symptoms to this day and on top of it they made me go on methadone because they thought that's what was making me feel anxious. \\n\\nCurrently I'm on no meds besides the methadone and my depersonilization is always present. I refuse to go on SSRI's as I took them 4 years ago and they ruined me. Was a zombie for a year or so after stopping. I do not do drugs anymore either. My question is what should I do? Does anyone have any experiences with Depersonalization and if so how did you overcome it? Should I attempt SSRI's again? Thank you if you read all this and sorry if this wasn't very grammatically correct. My anxiety is bad right now and it's hard to think haha\", \"I'm a 20 year-old male, college student. I've been dealing with anxiety and some depression for 1.5 years. I've been seeing a therapist for half a year and I do not take medication (I have lorazepam and beta-blockers but I never use them). For most of the last three months I really thought I was beginning to pull out of this slump I've been in. I feel like I do so much to stave off my anxiety: I exercise religiously, I meditate every night, I've cut back my drinking, I see a therapist, I drink tea, I read, and try to set aside time during the school day to just relax. Despite all of that, during the last week, I have felt more hopeless and miserable than every before. Things have been worst in the last 20 hours. I had a panic attack in my math class yesterday. I calmed myself down and sat through the class. When I went home, I relaxed and did everything I could to assure that I would feel okay today. I woke up today (well rested) and right after breakfast I had what I'm thinking might have been an emotional breakdown? I'm not sure what characterizes an emotional breakdown but it wasn't a panic attack and here's what happend: I went into my room planning on doing homework and just couldn't get myself to do it. I felt so hopeless and miserable and terrified of the future. Usually when I'm feeling anxious or blue I lay down and watch netflix.I forced myself to watch netflix and it only made me feel worse. I paced my room for a little bit, looked at myself in the mirror, and sat and stared at the wall. Its hard to describe how I felt. It was like there was a black hole eating me on the inside. I could't get myself to do anything and I was certain anything I did would only make me feel worse. I'm so angry and sad and scared about how what I'm going through might fuck up my grades for the semester (As I said, since the beginning of 2013 I've been doing pretty well and I've been taking classes seriously and getting good grades..I've been working very hard). I'm scared to go to class tonight, I'm scared to do homework and stress myself out, I don't know what to do. I see my therapist this Friday and I'm probably going to tell one of my roommates what happened because I think it will make me feel safe knowing someone who lives with me knows I'm kinda going through something. What do you think happened to me this morning and what should I do to pull myself together and finish up the semester? (I haven't missed any classes yet. Also, there is always the lorazepam and beta-blockers...worst cast scenario maybe those can get me through the semester? and then what though? I really don't want to start taking anti-depressants and I feel like that's the road I would be going down if used the loraz and BBs.)\", 'I am getting ready for work today and NPR\\'s story board comes on and it\\'s this little kid with cancer.

He said the scouts have done their job, they\\'re sated and they\\'ve done a good job.\\n\\nHe said my scouts are always on alert ALWAYS no matter what, so if I get a weird phone call or if I hear a noise at night or a car go by, my scouts are on full alert that the worst possible case is going to happen and I need to hunker down because it\\'s going to be a dangerous and bumpy ride.\\n\\nI don\\'t know where I am really going with this post.

I recently developed full GAD and depersonalization this January, and my grades have been falling again, perhaps as a result.\\n\\nI am placed in mostly special-ed classes. I am surrounded for most of my day by kids with no future, kids who aren't very bright, kids who have behavioral disorders.

Until recently, I’ve just bottled it up, and just said “it’s not so bad,” and shrugged it off.  However, my abandonment issues have turned into extreme anxiety over the last few months, because I’ve been in a relationship for about a year and a half, and before this relationship, I had never even made it to a year with anyone else, so deep down I always feel like it’s going to go extremely wrong or that something already is wrong, when nothing really is.\\n\\nMy SO and I have been dating for about a year and a half (around November 2013 to now).  He’s a really great guy, and he does a lot for me.  He\\'s there for me when I need help with almost anything, despite living about a 45-minute drive away. He\\'s helped me move, he\\'s helped me with car issues, he\\'s helped me financially, and sometimes when I get really upset and have an episode over literally nothing he\\'ll just hug me and make jokes to calm me down. I know he loves me and I love him and care about him.\\nWe broke up very briefly two times in the first few months of our relationship. The first time was a full-on breakup, and the second time was a two-week break.  Both times made me feel terrible, but we have worked through them. We didn’t have to talk a TON about things, because the quality of our words far outweighed the quantity.\\nFrom March-December of 2014, I was put on antidepressants.  I got off of them due to some bad side effects. From January to June, 2015, my anxiety was the worst it had ever been.  I was feeling so bad that I had to duck out several times a day at work to cry.  Finally, after six months, my gyno, my therapist, and I all agreed I should try getting off of the birth control, and in the month that has followed, I can say that my anxiety has calmed down a lot, but I still have some really hard days, and I still have a lot of trouble relaxing.\\n\\n\\nNow, sorry for the long context, but here is where I need to talk to someone.  During those six months of extreme anxiety and depression, I was terrified of him dumping me even though he showed absolutely no signs of it, and the only thing that had changed was my anxiety. I could barely even talk to him about my anxiety because it made me so anxious to do so, and when I did he didn\\'t quite understand it.  He understands that mental illness doesn\\'t just go away, and he knows how it can affect some peoples\\' lives, but he would sometimes get annoyed with me (when I actually WOULD talk about it) and sometimes still does.  I would tell him I was anxious or sad, but didn\\'t want to tell him that I was constantly afraid of a breakup and that I was really insecure in the relationship (again, for no reason, just my anxiety).  I tried taking Zoloft, but after three days of the adjustment period and crying *even more* I couldn\\'t do it. He also really wanted me to get off the meds as well, so I decided to stop.  When I needed to vent about it, he just didn\\'t really get it.  He would wonder why I was stressing so much about everything and try to get me to calm down.  However, he wasn\\'t the best at this.  He comes off as harsh because he\\'s not very emotional, and he tends to look at the facts and make decisions solely on those *because* he\\'s not very emotional. He lives life day-to-day, and I used to be happy just doing that, but nowadays if I can\\'t plan ahead, I get somewhat upset (not like crying hysterically, but really **really** frustrated).  He also doesn’t quite understand venting, because he figures that if something is out of your hands, there’s no need to keep talking about it. \\nFor example, recently I was venting about something out of my control, and he tried to calm me down, but it backfired. He said that if it\\'s something you can\\'t change, why complain/keep talking about it? I finally told him that part of being my SO was listening to me vent, because if I didn\\'t, I would explode.  He was tense and seemed a little annoyed, but said that it was just something he was going to have to get used to and try to understand (he had to \"get used to it\" because when my anxiety wasn\\'t as bad, I didn\\'t need to vent nearly as much, and even when it was bad for a while I wouldn\\'t because I was afraid to).\\nOur relationship is far from perfect.  We’re definitely past the honeymoon stage, and I’ve never been with someone for so long, which is why my anxiety is so high.  When we bicker, it freaks me out, even though it’s always over something stupid (the, “why didn’t you spray the pan with pam before putting meat on it,” kind bickering).  Although I love him a lot, sometimes due to how he’s handled my anxiety in the past (there were some times where he just made me feel worse but didn’t mean to at all, and there was one time where he got so frustrated he actually got angry with me), I feel…emotionally distant.  I find it difficult to talk about my bad feelings with him, and the fact that I do makes me feel very uneasy.  It makes me feel dishonest, in a way, and every time he makes a connection with someone else about anything that he and I don’t share (stuff about cars, music, little things), I feel insecure.

I have lots of trouble talking to my SO about my emotions because he isn’t very emotional, and I feel disconnected from him and my friends due to physical isolation turning into emotional isolation due to loneliness and moving just far enough away from my college so that I have barely seen my friends in the last year.

Feeling unusual is one of my big stressors. Thanks!\", \"Let's start with my social anxiety. In high school it always kept me from doing a lot of things I wanted to do with my friends. (Parties. I hate alcohol. Messes with my stomach.) I would just want to sit inside and do things. Not go out and have to deal with people. Especially large groups. This anxiety carried on with me through college. I credit me making my whole first year of college to my friends because I had some of them in my classes so I felt comfortable. Then summer rolled around. My brother introduced my to marijuana for the first time. I fell in love with it because it totally got rid of any anxiety I had. I was able to be around groups of people I didn't know and be social. Me! This guy! The guy who wouldn't leave his house in high school. I began smoking marijuana to stop anxiety and for something to do with friends.   Summer passes and my second year starts.  Come second year I have no classes with anyone I knew. Most friends have transferred or are doing other things. Once the second year started that's when my depression kind of started. I would go to college. Come home and be alone. I would cope with being alone from lack of friends by smoking pot. While that would help with my mood/anxiety I still would be alone at the end of the day. I had some friends I made stop over now and again, but I'd still be alone. It sucked. Marijuana made me feel better about it, but it didn't solve it. I prolonged that until my anxiety got the best of me. When the second semester of my second year started I started getting really bad anxiety before school. Same with work. Anxiety so bad it I couldn't leave the house for school. Or work. Pot didn't help. My anxiety has gotten to the point to where I couldn't leave my house. As much as I tried. I would break down and cry before school wanting to go.... but i'd start having more panic attacks. They were so bad. I lost my job for calling in too much. I lost my financial aid for college so now I can't afford it. I've been to a doctor and have gotten some anxiety meds along with depression meds. These last couple months i've spent some days literally just laying in bed not moving with tears in my eyes. Hating myself. I'm scheduling therapy soon because I'm sure it'll help. I just wanted to know if anyone else's anxiety has affected them this much, or if it has ever kept them from leaving the house. \\nTL;DR I have really bad anxiety that makes me not able to leave my house. That led to depression. Depression sucks. Anxiety Sucks. \", \"A little background.  Been diagnosed with adhd and gad for the last few years.  I've been on and off meds and working through therapy.  Currently I am on adhd medication and my doctor has given me the option of starting Prozac or doing .5mg of klonopin in the morning and night.

You do this so much that you have a cognitive disorder because of it. You probably won\\'t even accept my help because you are so stuck in your ways. Oh, and you exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia because you project what you feel about yourself onto your girlfriend and make up her mind for her.\"  \\n\\nSo I won\\'t accept your help because I\\'ve been to a school counselor and a couple of SSRI\\'s didn\\'t work so because I over analyse everything I\\'ll think whatever you say is bullshit and you got all that from 5 minutes of talking? He also assumed I wouldn\\'t consider an anti-psychotic down the road for my anxiety since it may be possible I don\\'t respond well to SSRI\\'s to which I responded yes I would because you don\\'t know me and I\\'ve taken abnormal psychology so I know it is a treatment option. Every time I tried to question his plans he would say I was \"over analyzing again\". So his plan is Abilify and Wellbutrin cool I\\'ll try it but can I do some CBT to help with these thoughts since I over analyse everything? \"No, there you go again you aren\\'t even ready for CBT because you still want to think about it but positively this time you just need to stop thinking\" WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK IS THAT SHIT! How does that make any sense? So to recap I\\'m supposed to take these two medicines and I \"might feel better by Easter\" in the mean time I\\'m supposed to just stop thinking anytime I feel anxious and breathe, not take the klonopin I got from my school doctor that I took maybe three times a week tops, and then he might do therapy. So guys am I exhibiting \"symptoms of schizophrenia\" as he would say or can I fucking say this dude is kind of an asshole without \"projecting\" or whatever the fuck he says? If I was so unreceptive and stuck in my analyzing ways why would I even go? Why is what I wanted in the first place (A new SSRI and CBT) so close to what he said anyway if I\\'m so far off in his eyes? Also, why would he say I wouldn\\'t feel any better till next year if SSRI\\'s reach their peak effectiveness anywhere from two weeks to a month? He told me I have an effective disorder, cognitive disorder (since I analyse everything), and something else I didn\\'t catch. Last I checked over analysis and everything was the fucking DSM-V definition of an anxiety disorder. He started running with schizophrenic symptoms because I project how I feel about me on my significant other and seemed peeved when I told him I didn\\'t hear voices or see things. He got on that in the first place because I said one person in my extended family has it and he sees her as a patient too. I\\'m also not doing this to prove him right and not do his treatment because I am going to try the pills I just wanted to rant and see what others think because I think he\\'s a bit of a douche. \\n\\nOh, he also said I would get diabetes for sure not if when) because it\\'s in my family history and I\\'m overweight even though I explained I gained weight from the old pills (Prozac) and didn\\'t eat sweets.

I started college last year and decided that I would be fine without medication. (It makes me feel like a zombie) That was probably a bad idea. I only knew my boyfriend at college and then I broke up with him 2 months after starting. I then had no friends, and no one to talk to. Four months into college, I met another guy. He is now my best friend, and I hang out in his room a lot with his roommate and other guys on his floor. Being with people really calms down my anxiety and depression.

I really appreciate those of you who stick it out all the way to the end of this post.\\n\\nI\\'m 21/m and have had bad anxiety issues since about middle school. My anxiety manifests itself as negative thoughts mostly in relationships, whether they be personal, romantic, or work, and I overthink and overanalyze everything. I can never trust anyone, and no matter how much I want to believe people like me, all I can ever think about is how they\\'re avoiding me or only pretending to like me because they pity me or something like that. Now granted, a lot of this stems from having had people fuck me over in the past many times, and all (but one) of my few romantic relationships have ended by the person lying to me so as to \"not hurt my feelings\", which makes me always assume the worst in people.\\n\\nI have a great job that I love (I\\'m a full-time salaried software developer making solid money) and I have job security like no other, and yet every single tiny mistake at work makes me fear for my job. I don\\'t have hardly any friends anymore because I moved 30 minutes away from my old town after high school and haven\\'t kept in contact with anyone and whenever I\\'ve tried to branch out and meet new people in the place I live (meeting up with a Reddit group, though that didn\\'t end well because they only ever wanted to drink and smoke pot, and I only enjoyed the first part of that, or finding a group to play Magic: The Gathering with), I generally only stay in contact with those people for a short time before my anxiety gets the best of me and I can\\'t stay in contact with them anymore. They never reach out to stay friends, so I of course assume they disliked me from the beginning and never try to reconnect later. And I have been in 4 (possibly starting a 5th, unclear what the future holds) romantic relationships since the start of high school, and all of them have been hell on me mentally because every day I woke up worried that that day would be the end of it or that if they didn\\'t text me back that day that it meant it was over and it\\'s caused me to ruin opportunities to be with amazing people (I ruined my longest relationship of 5 months because I was afraid taking a break would mean it was over and I completely overthought it and broke it off) even though I\\'m never happier in my life than when I\\'m spending it with someone who cares about me and I can connect with on an emotional and romantic level.\\n\\nIn order to explain the next part of this, and what sparked me to reach out here, I should better define why the next part is bothering me so much. Two of the relationships I\\'ve been in have been long-ish distance. The type that you pretty much only get to see them once-twice a week because they live a good driving distance away. This was always fine with me because we get plenty of time to ourselves, but when we got to see each other, it was generally pretty awesome. The way both of those ended were by the person cutting off all communications for a couple days, then driving out to see me to break up with me in person. While I totally respect what they did, and one of those people I\\'m still in touch with today, 5 years later, cutting off all communication with me obviously makes things difficult in my head.\\n\\nNow I have a chance with someone new that I met online (it\\'s been 3 years since my last real relationship, about a year since my last relationship that was more of an experiment that went wrong) who I seem to really get along with and who seems to like me, and yet no matter what happens, when I\\'m not around them in person enjoying their company, which is most of the time since they live about 45 minutes away, I spend all my time thinking about how it\\'s over when I\\'ve been given no reasons why it would be. And now we\\'re making plans to hang out on Sunday, but even though I\\'ve texted her a couple times to say hi over the past 2 days, I haven\\'t heard back. Now, with this person, it\\'s a normal occurrence because she isn\\'t one of those people that\\'s always attached to their phones, so sometimes it does take a long time, sometimes even a day for her to text back, and I have 0 problem with that; I expect people to text me back when it\\'s convenient for them, not for me. And yet all I can think is that she\\'s cutting off communications so that Sunday she can break it off, even though we\\'re only a couple dates into it and it shouldn\\'t affect me anywhere near this much.\\n\\nSo I\\'m not particularly looking for help here. I\\'ve dealt with my anxiety over all these years by just keeping my mind busy, whether it be by programming, playing video games, watching movies, whatever it may be, if my mind doesn\\'t have time to think about what\\'s keeping me anxious, it goes away. I\\'m not looking for suggestions of therapy or medication, though that has been a real consideration recently, because I know most of the medication has horrible side effects I\\'d like to stay away from. This is just a situation where typing it all out has already helped a little, and I wanted to just spew all of this somewhere in hopes that someone might say something to lighten my mood a bit.\\n\\n**While typing this out, she ended up replying to my most recent text.

Born in New Orleans, was always happy, outgoing, no anxiety/stress, not uncomfortable around people/new surroundings, outgoing. Move after 10 years to St. Louis. Mass amounts of anxiety, extreme depression, reclusive, idealization of suicide, but knew I would never make that choice.  I was good at basketball and made friends through that, but never had many. Move 3 years later to Milwaukee.  Known for being tall, reserved/not talking, always feeling awkward in every situation.  Known for being funny to the very few people I could open up to (like 2).  High school, 2nd year about 1/4 of the way through I open up to my basketball teammates after a game, shock and surprise at how funny I am and that I am speaking more.  Starts becoming a normal thing, but only around my basketball team.  Still can't be this funny, relaxed version of myself with 1 on 1 convo, or with anyone else.  By being around those guys, and other people who didn't know me well, I acted funny, outgoing etc., by what I believe is me acting the way I believe they perceive me (basketball team). This eventually spreads, gaining mass popularity with my school, and I was voted most sarcastic my senior year.  Even at the prime of this comfort ability in my senior year, if I was around people I didn't know, I felt an immense amount of anxiety, was reserved, and felt like I was in physical pain from the fear/anxiety/stress it would put on me.  Come college, I kind of hold on to some of this feeling of comfort, as if I was trying to be an actor and this was a character.

Working mandatory overtime as a server in a hotel, which seems to be helping somewhat.\\n \\n I had been seeing a psychiatrist for a while (since 14) taken all sorts of SSRIs and SSNRIs, benzodiazapines, and adderall(which helped my mind stop drifting so much and calmed my impulsive tendencies down a lot.) sleeping pills, and a lot of other things I can't recall right now.  My parents told me they didn't think it was helping, so they stopped letting me go.  I truly couldn't get any schoolwork done then, because without the medication my anxiety was too unbearable to even make it to the doors of my classroom.  I drank a lot, as I did when i was 16 or so, because it helped me have a break, for once.  It helped me sleep, as my mind races to such extents that I think it's what makes me so smart, but I can hardly ever sleep, sometimes getting 0-1 hours a night for a few nights before I am too exhausted to function and actually get some rest.  My sophomore year of college, I got so drunk (wouldn't take meds when I knew I would be drinking) that I fell off a balcony, broke my neck, which now has two rods in the back of it and a metal plate in the front.  \\n\\nMy parents are allowing me to go back to the psychiatrist, as I haven't seen any of my friends in months. I work more than 40 hours a week, and working as a banquet server means working weekends is mandatory.  It's not that I don't like them, or don't want to see them, and I know the love is there,  but even amongst friends I can only get these moments where I feel comfortable and can be as hilarious as they know I can be.  It's as if every moment I'm  walking into a pack of wolves which people say will be nothing but loving, and I am covered in red meat.\\n\\nIf anyone actually reads all this, I have a lot more to say, a lot of methods I have tried out, (herbs, meditation, etc.) , and could go further into detail, but this is long enough as is.\\n\\nI just want to know if anyone is like my type of anxiety, or if anyone has a way to ease the anxiety that not everyone has heard of?\", \"I'm really self-conscious about my hands sweating and if they do for whatever reason I only notice it more and it's a continuous bad cycle.

Anyone else going or gone through this?\", \"Hey guys. I've been lurking around this sub for the past month or so, but I've never actually made a post.\\n\\nMy anxiety (which developed about 15 months ago) hasn't been great lately. About a month ago (like right after my 19th birthday....I'm a freshman in college btw), it came back pretty hard. After a week with it at school, I went home for Passover Break (yay for Jews) and it just didn't get better. My head was always foggy and I just felt like there was something wrong with the world, ya know. Anyway, since I've come back to school, what I'm worrying about has become clearer. As an almost sophomore in college who is undecided major-wise, I've just started freaking the fuck out about the future and real life (good god is real life scary) which makes me think of me dying too much. I have a psychologist at home who I've called multiple times about it, and he's helped calm down my nerves about this by stepping out of myself and understanding that I don't need to know my major yet, and I can change it 20 times if I want, and also that I'm only finishing my first year of college. This helps usually, but lately it has been hard for me to follow through with the techniques, so my psychologist suggested I get a prescription for a mild medication that'll relax me a bit so I can do my breathing techniques, etc. I'm in the process of trying to get it, but doctors are the worst and I keep on being referred through a chain of doctors. \\n\\nAnyway, that's not why I'm here. Besides worrying about lying on a deathbed or having a heart attack or something stupid like that, I also constantly worry that something bad is gonna happen to me. It isn't quite the impending doom feeling, but when I think about dying I worry about being murdered or getting in a car crash or like falling down a hill or something like that. I'm not quite worrying about dying TODAY, but about dying in the near future. I watch the news or read articles about people dying in everyday situations, and I freak the bajesus out. It's the worst. Anyway, my psychologist believes this may be something else that is bothering me, and I truly have no idea what it could be. Have any of you folks felt like this before? If so, how did you guys cope with it/relax? \", \"Hey everyone, I recently have been suffering alot from depersonalize during alot of my daily aspects, I feel almost detached or on 'autopilot' so to speak.

For context, I went to law school when I was in my late 20s, and graduated at the peak of the financial crisis. I did not respond well to the stress of law school or the harsh and confrontational nature of the professors. Consequently, I did poorly and barely graduated. I struggled to find work, and thought I had finally caught my break when I got a job with a small firm. About a year in, I got a new manager who hated me and made no secret of the fact that she thought I didn't belong there and couldn't hack it. She was relentlessly critical, gave little to no guidance or positive reinforcement, and was not shy about reading me the riot act in front of others. I became so wracked with anxiety that I became completely unable to do my job, and ultimately got fired. It was a horrible period of my life. \\n\\nAs luck would have it, things got better. I landed ass backwards into a job at a prestigious law firm (not practicing, but I was fine with that)-I was making about 10k more a year, had a terrific boss, and the work was vastly less stressful. Best of all, I could see my old shitty place of employment from 28 stories in the air.  Things were great for a while...until March. I made some mistakes on my work-nothing serious, but my boss became concerned that perhaps I wasn't as up to speed as I should be. I was assigned a mentor and really committed myself to improving-but mistakes kept happening. Not every day, and nothing earth shattering, but enough that my boss is questioning my ability to make the judgement calls my work requires. Through this whole process, my anxiety is getting worse and worse. I'm petrified to make a mistake because what if the next one is the one that gets me fired?  I have a house and an amazing girlfriend who is counting on me to keep this gig.\\n\\nOver the last few months I've managed to not screw up enough to keep my head above water, but now my boss is telling me that if I don't improve by the end of July, she's going to have to notify HR which is basically the long slow goodbye.  I don't blame my boss for any of this-she's been nothing but helpful, and almost seems as though she feels guilty about all of this. But she has a job to do and I don't hold that against her. I'm in therapy and have been taking medication but it's not helping. I'm terrified I'm going to lose my job, and the fear is just making things worse. \\n\\nI don't know of anyone can relate or will even care, but I just needed to vent. It could be worse-I'm in a stable relationship, I'm healthy, I'm well educated, etc.  but if I lose this job that will be 2 in 2 years, and I will feel like an utter failure as a man. I'm not wedded to the idea of law as a career (I actually hate it), but I don't know where else I could go and make what I'm making now. \\n\\nThanks for reading.

Several things that shouldn't upset me have been upsetting me way more than they should, though. But today, I'm not sure exactly why this happened, because it hasn't happened to me since I was a lot younger (I'm almost 18 now), but I had a total meltdown/tantrum. I think it was caused by the fact that my boyfriend was unable to come over, even though we had been talking about him coming over this morning.

I recently have had more severe panic attacks so I’ve gone to both a therapist and a couple different psychiatrists. The most recent psych I saw wants me to start lexapro. I take xanax for panic when I have it bad. \\n\\n**My reluctance**: I suppose it’s more a matter of philosophy and principle. I have doubts and questions surrounding a medication that changes the chemistry in your brain. I mean, I know how meds are supposed to work, but then sometimes it is discovered how they actually work. There is a fear that changing the chemistry in my brain (tangent — I believe what you do and all the sums that make up who you are in your brain and it can be rewired by your actions. It may be an broad example but I think there is a lot left to learn about the brain) and changing who I am. My principle is impractical, I know it is. I know that the medication may help. I know I can never know if it may help or impact me unless I try. I mean there is side effects too, but I try not to think about those because it makes me more anxious and weary; I am trying to be more rational regarding my anxiety, I know side effects are different for everyone. \\n\\nSo I’m in therapy for about 3 weeks and now and I feel it’s helping, but there is still days where my panic is crippling. Yeah, I know that is how recovery works, you have good days in a stretch then you have another bad day, this process continues until the amount of good days you have goes on for a while. I am hoping to not recognize and not be fearful of my own anxiety soon.

Obviously I want to be independent. When I was in school I would skip classes because my panic was so bad and that had been the way I coped with it since high school. I would sit alone and write and listen to music just to help the panic pass. I have a fear that once I try to do the things that will make me feel better, the things I need to do, that I will have panic everyday like I used to. Just thinking about this, I don’t even want to try something for fear of failing (because of my panic). I don’t want to have panic attacks everyday but I do want a job and a future and to be able to say that anxiety doesn’t control my life. \\n\\n**What was the point of this post?** Just asking others’ thoughts because I feel like I’ve shared this sentiment with others but not really gotten to talk to anyone who really knows my concerns and how my anxiety feels. I am trying to look at it and ask “what would be worse, taking medication and facing your anxiety and going against an idea you’ve held as a principle for a long time, or not being able to continue and live your life because of your anxiety?”. More and more the answer to that question has been that meds may help so I should at least TRY. \\n\\nBlah blah it sounds melodramatic but going to 3 different professionals and being told 3 different medications will help me does not inspire confidence.

My hope is someone will see that getting better is a journey and not a goal and that you have to keep hopeful.\\n\\n\\n**MY HISTORY:** Several years ago, I began showing symptoms of depression and anxiety... around the age of 28 maybe? It started with a panic attack at work, feeling like I was about to pass out at my desk, then a night of sleep where I\\'d be on the brink of sleep then have a jolt, almost like my heart was going to stop if I fell asleep and my body shot me back up. My family came out to visit me and the day they came I got hives all over my arms and chest, never having them before.\\n\\nMy body started turning against me.\\n\\nI started seeing a counselor and was also prescribed Lexapro, all while making the decision to move back to my hometown 2,500 miles away. Things were going OK but my head would be in a fog, feeling super heavy, and I gained a lot of weight. So emotionally I was feeling better, but I couldn\\'t keep going with the fog. (Also, I was having insane dreams on the Lexapro... some really disturbing, mostly lucid... they were pretty cool, though LOL). So I slowly weaned myself off it, followed by a month of these electric brain restarts that SUCKED.\\n\\nSo, I\\'m off those meds and I begin having panic episodes. Because I had gained a lot of weight, I started wondering if it was my heart. I would get these heart flutters and mentally I just started shutting down, feeling like I was constantly about to drop dead. I would wake up and my immediate thought every day was, \"when is it going to happen?\"\\n\\nI was just waiting to die everyday. My depression was making me feel hopeless, which caused my anxiety to go through the roof. I had an optical migraine followed immediately by a panic attack at a rehearsal dinner one night, probably the worst panic attack I\\'ve ever had. I was outside a restaurant thinking I was about to die, looking at people thinking, \"Don\\'t they realize I\\'m about to die? This is going to be the last thing I see, some schmucks looking at me freaking out.\"\\n\\nI was working out daily and had lost quite a bit of weight (40 lbs?) at this point, trying everything I personally could to help the depression and anxiety. At this point, I was visiting the doctor\\'s office about once every month with a complaint about the heart palpitations, an ache in my side (I thought my kidney\\'s were failing), and freaking out about EVERY pain I felt. It all lead up to one day where I had freaked myself out so bad that I was having these premature heart beats every minute. That was the tipping point.\\n\\nThe next day, I went to the doctors. They had been wanting to put me on depression meds but I had been fighting it. I couldn\\'t take it anymore, though, and finally took whatever they offered. I started on a new medication.\\n\\n**TODAY:** About 1.5 or 2 years later now, the medication is working great, no side effects, and the majority of my symptoms have gone away now. I work in the creative field and I think one of those go-to arguments was that meds may affect your creativity and such. But if you\\'re so bad off you can\\'t work, what\\'s it worth anyhow. Truthfully, for me, it didn\\'t affect me but positively once I found the medication that worked for me.\\n\\nI just came back from the doctor today, about 60 lbs lighter than when I first started going in, blood pressure back to normal, and doing really well. I wanted to share this with anyone going through these issues right now feeling hopeless. ', 'So I made a post a while back about how I tried Effexor XR 75mg once, and it did some serious damage to my brain. I basically went to my school counsellor, who told me there\\'s \\'take as needed\\' medication for anxiety (which I wanted, my anxiety was never that bad), I went to my doctor, he told me it\\'s too addictive and gave me Effexor XR which I took gladly because like I said, my anxiety was topical; I\\'d feel anxious before presenting, or before meeting someone new. It was never an issue I suffered everyday with, and because my anxiety wasn\\'t that bad, I was brave to start this new medication.\\n\\nThe pill I took caused severe panic attacks for about a week. I felt fine for a month, then they started recurring every two weeks or so; it\\'s become anticipatory at this point, because i\\'m afraid of having another, so that gives me anxiety. My anxiety has become so much worse than it was before and it\\'s really set me back.\\n\\nI went to the psychiatrist today who said, \"Yup, sounds like anxiety to me,\" and prescribed me Cipralex because it\\'s very similar to Celexa, which my dad takes so she figured it would be a good fit. She also gave me 30 pills of Lorazepam to take as needed.\\n\\nWhen I got home, I looked up Cipralex and learned that it\\'s an anti depressant too, like Effexor. Knowing how badly Effexor fucked me over, you can see why I really don\\'t want to start Cipralex. Part of me worries that this pill will just do the same shit to my brain as Effexor. \\n\\nI just need some insight. Has ANYONE ever dealt with an issue like this? If not, what should I do?

Keppra might not be the end of me after all ;)\", \"So this is pretty much my first reddit post. I have considered all other things that involve someone with a phD prescribing me meds that I can't pronounce and talking to a councellor but first I would like to gain some perspective on my situation. Here is my story: \\n\\nGrowing up I was an only child. My dad worked late hours so I hardly ever saw him. He was physically and emotionally hurting me and my mother. There would be days I would see her being dragged on the floor with her hair. Then my dad moved us all to a new country. My mother stayed with him. His affairs got worse with other women. He was still violent and verbally abusive. There was a day I had to stay home because my room was messy and he hurt me and broke everything in my room. I know my dad has some issues that could be inherited from his father, who had anger management issues. Then, my father became better, he was not caring but the abuse did subside. He was mean to my mother, really emotionally abusing her. Lied about other women to her. Then he changed his appearance completely. Then he told my mother he was leaving us. He left us, I did not speak to him for months. I blamed my mom for not working on her relationship with my dad. I got physically and mentally screwed up. I began cutting myself as I did previously in elementary school. I attempted to kill myself one day when my dad had already moved out. That was my lowest point. Then I got better, my relationship with my mom was better and I was talking to my dad more. My mom gets diagnosed with cancer. My dad does nothing. I take a term of school off. Her health deteriorates. I take care of her, my dad comes around the last two weeks of her life. Promises her at her death bed he would take care of me. She passes away and then my dad finds out she left the marital home to me from her half title. My dad sues everyone who did that transfer, making me pay for lawyers. My dad stops paying for my education, car, room rental. And I decided to cut all ties off with him because of his toxic personality. Now I am having anxiety attacks and have feelings of depression. My boyfriend also lives 3000 miles away so no way to see him. I feel like an orphan because I have no one else. I am an only child. I have exams now and focusing on school. My stress that has always been suppressed is finally coming out. \\n\\nSorry about the rant, just hoping someone will convince me that I am not a lost cause. \", 'After suffering from severe social anxiety for my whole life and taking meds for 9 years, I decided to start seeing a psychologist 2 months ago.

However, it has never been anything serious; headaches, shortness of breath, sometimes rapid heart beats, and some troubling thoughts here and there. However, 2 months ago or so, I got high for the first time. Previously to that day, I had smoked about 3 times but it never did much to me other than make my eyes heavy. This specific time, I got high and have regret it so much ever since. \\n\\nAs I am sure many of you have experienced, I began to feel lost and unaware of what was happening, as if I was in a dream (No it as not laced!). I began to think of life, and if anything was actually real to the point where I started to panic. Thinking that it at times normal to have a trip the first time, I tried it again and it was the same. \\nEver since I have been feeling horrible. My mind is racing with the most craziest and the most random thoughts you could possibly think off. Some examples; thinking if this world is real, how we possibly got here, if anything we learn is accurate... basically questioning everything. I have always been a curious person, but with my anxiety currently being the way it is, I sometimes feel like I am going crazy. \\n\\nTwo weeks ago I was at my worst: to the point where I would start crying of how scared I was. Sometimes I even felt like sleeping and not waking up. I personally consider myself a strong person, and I know that I will get better. It's been really hard on me, on my life, especially on my relationship with my boyfriend. Aside from my anxiety, I have a low self esteem. Many think I don't have a reason to, but I have been through a lot in my life. I've always felt more mature, and very different from my peers. Being surrounded by all these expectations and stereotypes makes me feel as if i'm not good enough for simply being different. My thoughts on this come and go, sometimes I feel confident, other times I don't. \\n\\nI am glad to say that I have gotten progressively better. Thoughts like the ones I previously stated do pop in my head here and there on a daly basis, especially at night. However, I am staying as active as I can to simply avoid this as much as I can, (I found that staying home was the worst thing I could possibly do).\\n\\nI do have my mom to speak to, as well as my boyfriend. Both have never experienced what I am currently going through but still manage to hear me out and be supportive, which is exactly what I need. I sometimes try to deal with it on my own because I do not want to vex them with my problems. Talking to a psychologist or taking medication and all are not really options for me. I do not find it useful. I think regardless of the help that I will be getting, If I don't believe in myself getting better their help won't do much.

I can still force myself to occasionally though\\n\\n* Every once in a while, there are a few things that set me into all-out panic mode.  I try my best not to think of them, but if they get in my head my heart starts racing, I get shaky, angry, frustrated, can\\'t sleep.  I just want to keep punching the walls and scream until I can\\'t anymore.  This usually lasts for a few hours a day, intermittently for a few days to a week, and eventually goes away when I somehow manage to forget about it.  Luckily it\\'s been like 2-3 months since I\\'ve had that happen.\\n\\nAll these things don\\'t seem too out of the ordinary to me, see the next section though...\\n\\n------------------------\\n\\n**WHY I THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH LOOKING INTO**\\n\\nSo like I said, I always thought this was normal, or normal enough.  That said, last night I injured myself badly.  At the hospital I was prescribed some pain killers, as well as Valium to help me sleep.  I\\'ve notice that after even just an hour after taking the Valuim (while it doesn\\'t make me especially tired) I feel... relieved.  It feels like this giant weight was lifted off me.  I don\\'t even know why, I wasn\\'t feeling anxious about anything at the time.  And even though I would classify all my \"symptoms\" as very mild (agree?) I just feel... better.  This makes me wonder - if it causes such a noticeable difference maybe it\\'s worth looking into.  I should note that I\\'m just guessing it\\'s the Valium and not the painkillers that are causing this effect.  I think I\\'ll try to find out tomorrow by just taking the Valium and dealing with the pain.  Would valium even kick in in just an hour or so?\\n\\n--------------------------\\n\\n**RELATED PROBLEMS**\\n\\nFinally, in addition to this, I think it\\'s just as likely - probably moreso - that I have mild depression.  I know it\\'s not quite on point, but just another reason I think it might help to talk to someone.  While I generally don\\'t feel sad exactly, I never feel happy.  I basically feel permanently numb, the last time I felt truly happy/excited was just over a year ago, and before that maybe in 2010?  I can also go through a list of depression symptoms and match many/most of them, but I won\\'t bore you with the details.\\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n**WHAT DO I DO NOW?**\\n\\nI don\\'t know, maybe I\\'m wrong.  Maybe this is just part of being human.  Then again, maybe not.  While I know you\\'re not medical professionals, could I just get some insight?  How do you generally feel?  Did any of you feel similarly and find a way to turn it around?  Also if I wanted to talk to a professional about this (anxiety/depression) what kind of professional should I talk to?  My general practitioner?  How do you even bring it up?', \"So, some background. F/24. My mom passed away in 2011 from brain cancer. Well 6 months after that I started getting anxiety, I hadn't had it before that. Every time I would leave the house I would black out for a second and get really confused. Then I felt weird, like I couldn't grasp what anything was or who I was. After awhile I eventually felt better. I moved and got a job. I was fine at work, I rarely ever got anxious. But I recently moved again in January and I lost my job because I didn't have transportation to get to work. Anyways, last month my boyfriend and I were out running errands and I blacked out again and started freaking out really bad. It took me like 20 minutes to calm down. It was worse than the first time it happened. A few weeks later I decided I wanted to get out of the house again, so I had my aunt and uncle pick me up. Again, the same thing happened. My aunt and uncle ignored me while this happened. It went on for 45 minutes until I finally just had them take me home. It was terrible. I've never felt so out of control. I haven't left the house since then. I'm really afraid of this happening again. I don't know how to leave the house without this happening again. Also, I've never been to the doctor for this and I'm not on any medications. I also have depression but never saw anyone for it. I've just kind of dealt with it. I don't have medical insurance. I don't know what to do. I don't know what triggered it a month ago, it happened out of the blue. I was leaving the house regularly and I wasn't stressed or anything. Even when this happened the first time it seemed like it happened out of the blue. Has anyone had any similar experiences or have any advice?\", \"So, I'm kind of terrified. I have horrible health phobias and ocd on top of my panic and depression. I've been stressed badly the past two weeks. In those two weeks I moved into a new apartment (with good friends and my boyfriend), lost my job, had my school finals, and had to prep for Christmas.\\n\\nIn the middle of packing, I bit done on a tooth that has some issues going on. It split in half. I just lost it, sobbing, because I couldn't take another thing on my plate. And my mom had almost died of a tooth infection when I was a child, so I'm BEYOND terrified of abscesses. Like, hideously afraid of infections. Ugh.\\n\\nSo I get to the dentist yesterday after an insurance battle (I had FINALLY gotten on insurance, sincere thanks Obama!). She was super nice about my anxiety. She said my tooth needs to be pulled, and gave me some antibiotics because it was infected (GAH!). She said I had had the infection a long time.\\n\\nShe said to only take the pills if I felt it get way worse, if my face swelled, or if I couldn't make it to a surgeon to get my tooth pulled soon. Of course, I've been terrified since last night, thinking that my face is OBVIOUSLY swelling, the pain is OBVIOUSLY worse (there's not even pain, just a very slight dull ache from sinus pressure on it). I've been so scared. But I also am scared of the pills, because I react HORRIBLY to antibiotics. She warned me these were extremely strong and would make me sick. And it's a week's dose, which means I'd be sick on Christmas. (I just finished my finals last night at one in the morning, but I've done NONE of my shopping/baking/decorating/etc for the holiday. And I LOVE Christmas. Sigh.)\\n\\nLuckily, I found a dentist who can pull my tooth in about two hours from now. And I'm terrified. I hate being in a new doctor's office. I hate medical procedures. (I get sick just thinking about it.) I'm terrified of the pain, that I'll be drugged up badly and out of it and feeling sick. I'm scared she'll say the infection is worse than the other dentist saw and will put me on even stronger antibiotics. Ugh.\\n\\nI know, realistically, it'll likely going easily. She'll likely be good about my panic and calm me down. And the procedure will be fast. And all my friends will be home with me tonight (although I'll be alone much of tomorrow during the day). And since she'll pulling the tooth, I'm guessing I may just need milder antibiotics for a shorter stint (she gave me heavy duty stuff in case I couldn't get somewhere before it spread).\\n\\nI just..could use some kind words. A little encouragement. I'm home alone right now and trying not to sob. I feel like I need a hug. I hate asking for anything, but you guys have always been so nice.\\n\\nAlso, I haven't had a single tooth pulled like this before. (Only had major dental work done before.) If I don't get put on heavy antibiotics, is it likely I'll be able to do things this weekend? Like Christmas shopping and baking? That would make me so happy if I could. I saw things online saying it's surgery so you have to not do much for two days and then be easy on yourself for like three or four days. Is that accurate? \\n\\nThanks guys. \", \"So I have to go to the dentist on Monday for two fillings. I've had a filling before and the worst part was definitely the injection. I hated how it stung (even with the numbing gel) and how I could physically feel it and how it seemed to last forever. Now I'm going to have to get two injections and I'm absolutely shitting myself.\\n\\n\\nI'm very phobic of blood, wounds, needles, medical things in general. I will pass out at the sight of blood. My dentist is generally very good, he takes his time with the injection so it hurts less but this causes me to panic because the needle feels like it's in forever. I had to have several injections when I had four teeth out for my braces and those didn't bother me because the teeth pulling was far worse.\\n\\n\\nWhat can I do to keep calm? Can anybody give any advice on making the actual injection more pleasant? I have to have an injection and the only option is numbing gel but I found this ineffective last time. How do I stay calm long enough for the injection and how do I deal with two?\\n\\nAnd what are your experiences with this? It'd help me to hear how others managed.\", \"I've just started taking this medication and had high hopes for it, but this dizziness is very unpleasant.  Any experiences would be much appreciated.\", \"It started when I became unusually nervous speaking out loud in front of others at school. Over the years the anxiety has morphed into general social anxiety and the swallowing tic has leaked into most areas of my life that involve somewhat similar situations. Any time I'm expected to perform well or 'be normal' with others and/or it involves my mouth or throat I get overwhelmed with worry which sets it off, like:\\n\\n- Sitting in silence with 1 or more people close by as they can probably hear my swallowing and think how weird it is. For instance, last year I was in a quiet room with 2 family members and a solicitor while they were signing paperwork, if it wasn't for the small window to distract me I swear my swallowing would've become a panic attack. I had those thoughts of 'I must leave this room' but just about managed to control them.\\n\\n- Laying in the dentist chair with my mouth open, again it's often quiet and close proximity and I'm expected to be still - I probably swallow once a minute or more.\\n\\n- Having to read in front of others, formal or informal. If it's spontaneous and I choose to speak up I can sometimes get through it, if it's a planned thing my mind races. Avoidance is how I cope.\\n\\n- Intimacy, having to involuntarily swallow while kissing isn't the greatest thing in the world. Again, avoidance has taken over.\\n\\n- A planned phone call, a few times I've just stopped mid-word as my throat closed up. I swallow multiple times before even dialling. Again, if it's a spontaneous incoming call I'm fine.\\n\\n- Even thinking about these things while going to sleep induces swallowing until I get distracted by another thought.\\n\\nHow it started:\\n\\nI'm 31 now. Between 8-13 my public/class speaking was often said to be the best in the class, I actually enjoyed it. Then one day, at 13, a small group of us were unexpectedly pulled out of a classroom to see a head teacher for something, as though we were in trouble. We were actually taken to the main school hall and asked to stand in a line on stage and each read out a poem to the head teacher at the back of the hall.\\n\\nIt turned out it was an 'audition' to read a poem at an evening school performance. I knew I was the best there but really didn't want to be chosen as I had no interest in stage performance, I was very shy so figured I'd just turn it down if I was picked a week later.\\n\\nWe had to read this poem twice, the first time went well but while I was waiting for the others next to me to finish their second reading a flood of nerves hit me, I had to clear my throat.\\n\\nI managed the first few lines then bam, swallow. Small cough, another swallow, I got out 4 words before my throat forced a swallow again. I apologised for the pause, heard sniggering next to me, I'd never felt such a confusing fear of doing something I found so easy. The teacher told me not to worry and moved onto the next speaker.\\n\\nSince that day I have never been comfortable reading out in front of others - and even today reading out loud to myself, 90% of the time when reading from books in class I had to swallow after one line of text, then it became every 2 words until the teacher asked someone else to continue. Cue odd looks from 25+ teenagers and self-confidence at an all time low, oddly enough it was never brought up by my peers, not once and outside of the classroom I was absolutely fine.\\n\\n\\nIf I'm distracted enough or enjoying myself I feel fine, it's only when similar circumstances appear that the triggers set off a bunch of alarms I can't stop.\\n\\nI now work from home (successfully) so avoidance has been ridiculously easy, social anxiety and depression bounces around in my head due to very limited interaction with others and reaching this age has made me realise my best years are gone and wasted forever and that I can't continue in this way much longer.\\n\\n\\nI'm not entirely sure what I'm aiming to get out of writing this, no one in the world knows the extent of my problems and my small family never question why I've never had a proper relationship, never developed into a confident adult and so on - I still feel like I'm 20 and it just makes it easier to avoid, quite honestly I don't want them to know and I partly blame them for the lack of intervention/advice. I guess what I'm hoping for is some glimmer of light, a reason to believe that I could get rid of this somehow, preferably without meds.\\n\\nCBT? Maybe. Exposure therapy? That sounds horrific. I currently feel like I can only be happy if I could live on this planet by myself.\\n\\nIf you read this far, thank you.\", \"I've started having panic attacks near the end of my shift at work. I only work part time, usually 3-4 shifts a week, but my work is very physical and near the end of the night when I'm feeling tired and weak is when they happen; I'm wondering if there is some unrelated medical condition I have that I'm not aware of. I'm usually ok working 3-4 shifts in a row, but sometimes they're grouped together 6-7 and I'm getting to the point where I'm wondering if I can do it anymore. I need the money, but I've had to leave work early twice in the past month because of this issue. My boss asked me if I'd switch shifts next week so that a three-in-a-row would become a six-in-a-row, I had to tell him that I just couldn't physically do that right now. Now I feel like a lazy shit. Anyone else get work related anxiety attacks? I'm wondering if it's hypoglycemia or something for me. Last night I'd been feeling sick to my stomach all night, but managed to pull through to the last hour when I started feeling feint and had to leave. I really wish my boss hadn't phoned; I'll be dwelling on this on my day off. \", \"I know this probably looks very stupid to be posting this here before seeking medical advice, but doctors and hospitals make my anxiety flare up to the point of crying when I think about going. Right now I feel like I really need to go to a doctor, and my mum (who is a raging narcissist) is brushing off all of my concerns. The years of gas-lighting combined with my anxiety are making me feel like my worries are not valid. What's more, I feel anxious about going by myself and the doctors &amp; nurses saying there's nothing wrong with me - and me feeling like an idiot.\\n\\nI can't win. :( can someone please talk to me?\", \"He hasn't talked to me all day. I'm so worried. We're from the northeast and we just got hit by the blizzard. I don't know if he's okay or if he's dead. I've been texting and calling him all day. I can't fucking get to him. I just downed some sleep meds. These need to kick in. I'm gonna puke. I want my boyfriend.\", \"I really just need to get things off my chest. Generalized anxiety is getting the better of me in more ways than one, I feel like an emotional wrecking ball and I've suffered with it for many years :( I'm a student at University, and it seems when exam season comes round my anxiety spikes. I worry so much and it just seems that as each day that goes by i'm picking up more and more issues to carry around on my shoulders, although they're probably not that big to some people. \\n\\nI'm having troubles with getting work in on time for University, I can't go on a night out and have a few drinks with friends without my anxiety spiking the next day and panic attacks, caffeine is out of the question to help with having no energy all of the time because it turns me into a big ball of anxiety. I'm also managing my own business on the side which is unbearably stressful sometimes but I need the money, I can't walk down a street without thinking about what every single person I walk past is thinking about me and I have no-one to talk to who will understand why I let these little things get to me properly who will understand fully. \\n\\nThen there's the bigger things which really get to me, like i'm my partners only support and family in his life which is stressful but he makes me very happy, and alleviates a lot of my anxiety most of the time, although he doesn't understand it. I also feel like a god awful cheating person because I gave a family friend a friendly kiss on the cheek goodbye one night months ago (I know, you don't need to tell me how stupid that is, it didn't even faze me until I over thought it the next day and now I carry this about with me each day). I also do a lot of stuff home for my mother to help her with her anxiety and depression, for example in trying to get the house in order and support her and my siblings as much as possible. \\n\\nI have tried some medications which just heightened by depression and anxiety. I'm also useless at remembering to take them every day. I've tried therapy to but I can only get 6 week sessions for free, and I accomplished nothing throughout it over than short term relief of having someone to rant to, but I don't feel like this was the therapists fault. These feelings fade every once in a while but anxiety and negative thinking always comes to bite me at the worst of times. I regularly have suicidal and hopeless thoughts. My friends are great and nice people, but not the kind of people I expect to understand this and I would just feel like an emotional burden talking to them, so I just pretend I'm happy around them instead. \\n\\nI know no-one can magically make my anxiety disappear, but just writing my thoughts up here and ranting has made me feel better to be honest :). Sometimes I worry about so much at once that thoughts just feel so disorganized, maybe some people here might relate to a bit of what I'm saying. I find it so hard to rationalize and deal with stress I just wish this would go away. I suffer with backaches, headaches, and burning in my stomach I get so stressed. I'm sorry if this just sounds like i'm rambling and doesn't make sense I just wrote it up as I thought it. Hopefully I won't feel like this anymore one day!\", \"I know I need to seek therapy for this but currently the financial costs are prohibitive and will be for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nFor as long as I can remember I have had an intense fear of any instrument or treatment at the doctor's (or dentist's, theoretically) that could cause any amount of pain, or that's in any way intrusive. For example, I cannot have blood drawn, injections/vaccinations, blood pressure readings. I have also always got faint in biology lessons when discussing things like the anatomy of the heart, because I quickly become afraid of getting heart disease or whatever and having to go through any sort of medical procedure that's any more invasive than taking drugs.\\n\\nIf I were to guess at a diagnosis, it sounds very similar to [blood-injection-injury type phobia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-injection-injury_type_phobia), except there is no one specific thing that triggers my fear and subsequent faintness - it transfers itself to absolutely anything medical that could cause pain or discomfort.\\n\\nFortunately this fear has not impacted my day-to-day life very much because I am young and physically healthy. But today, for example, I had to go for a meningitis vaccination before I leave for college, and I was so terrified that whenever the nurse touched me I would leap put of my seat and run away (apologising profusely!), and then got faint - I couldn't have the vaccination, despite understanding how vitally important it is and actually wanting to have it.\\n\\nI was wondering if anyone else suffers from something similar, and if anyone has any self-help tips or recommendations, until a few years' time when I can hopefully afford therapy?\\n\\nThank you!\", 'So about a month ago while I was on vacation, I kept waking up in the middle of the night 3-4AM, and just thought it was my body out of whack from drinking.

I also freaked myself out into thinking I had suddenly become hyper or hypoglycemic, or I had begun developing diabetes, or that there was some unknown disease out there that\\'s been causing my problems.\\n\\nFor a month my mind has obsessed over health. It\\'s been relentless. It made me depressed for the first time in my life, to the point where I felt like I couldn\\'t enjoy anything. I wasn\\'t laughing or smiling as much. My mind was constantly brewing a storm of negative thoughts, and my physical symptoms didn\\'t help.\\n\\nFatigue, tingling in the extremities and head, numbness in the face, tight chest, inability to breath properly, vertigo, diziness, feeling like I need to constantly escape my current environment or run and get fresh air, bad dreams, bad sleep, waking up feeling my heart beating, going to bed feeling like my brain was literally turning off, fear of being tired after doing things that should make me tired (like getting up early, working out, etc)\\n\\nAll of this together is terrifying. It got to the point where I felt like the chemistry of everything in my environment was made out of anxiety. Sometimes I\\'d feel as if I was in a dream state...how is this real? How is this my new life? Why is this my new life? I felt so much regret. It didn\\'t help that I broke 3 months of sobriety after a meltdown and had a pint of beer...which literally made me feel terrible (my first bout with anxiety came from alcohol abuse. I quit drinking, and have read just as many things about how alcohol can \"ruin your brain\" too, even though eventually I found it didn\\'t. \\n\\nMy number one advice is this: Accept your anxiety. It wasn\\'t until today that I realized that my mind\\'s inability to escape fearful thoughts was causing stress, which was causing stress symptoms, which was causing my anxiety to flare up, which was causing more stress and more symptoms. \\n\\nIt\\'s an amazing and vicious cycle, but once you realize how little of a hurdle it takes to jump to return to normal, you feel pretty good. Even though it\\'s a long and tough process, I should have reassured myself that this is all anxiety...and in my control...and not some permanent damage I\\'ve inflicted through a drug that doesn\\'t effect anyone like that...lol. Seriously, everyone who claims any type of substance has ruined their brain also has an anxiety disorder they do or don\\'t fully understand. \\n\\nI had my first CBT session this morning, and we didn\\'t even get into any real practices because my therapist had such a good discussion with me about how what I was feeling was, in fact, all anxiety related. How my mind is literally causing these physical symptoms. \\n\\nFor the first day in a month, I was relaxed enough to focus on other things. I was reaccepted into school (my first battle with anxiety led to me failing out), I enjoyed a mountain jog and the smell of flowers for the first day in a while, I was able to be productive...hell...I even had a cup of coffee and enjoyed it...including the symptoms I felt from it, because I knew it was just caffeine. (I\\'m still hypersensitive as shit).\\n\\nAnyway, I know a lot of people with physical anxiety, to the point of fatigue, really don\\'t understand the experience because they can\\'t possibly accept that their mind and thought processes can be directly correlated to very real, very scary physical symptoms.\\n\\nI still don\\'t feel perfect. Hell...my body is a month\\'s worth of constant worry and fear out of whack. But, today was the first day I was able to clear my mind and enjoy the day...even with the symptoms. \\n\\nThis is probably step one of many, but for people who feel anxious and hopeless, I feel like my input could help calm a lot of folks. ', 'I was diagnosed with clinical depression in high school, which, combined with several family related issues, caused me to fail out and generally be in a daze until a couple of years ago when my meds started working and I was able to get (mostly) back on track. \\n\\nNow, in my second year of college, I\\'m off my depression meds and having anxiety issues remembering what happened to me in high school, and it\\'s gotten so bad that I can barely attend classes. I realize that I need help, and counselors at school aren\\'t enough. Problem is, I don\\'t see my psychiatrist anymore and most of my friends and family think that my issues are \"fixed\". I want to tell my parents - I use their insurance still, we\\'re on better terms than before, etc - that I have to do this, but I don\\'t know how to bring it up. My dad in particular doesn\\'t really believe in psychiatry, and thinks it\\'s just a bad attitude and laziness. \\n\\nAnyone have experience explaining this? What were the results? Should I just keep it to myself, even if I going back on medication?\\n\\n(Quick info: F, 21, stressed about school and being around others + their expectations, no medication now but previously on Wellbutrin and Ritalin)', \"I am new to this subreddit and relatively new to serious anxiety.  I have always been a more nervous and worrisome person that most people, but I have never been so crippled buy anxiety.  Well, actually I have before, but that was only when my alcoholic dad was drinking when I was younger (I am 18 now, was 11-16 when that happened and I do not live with my dad) and I think that that kind of anxiety is normal and would be expected in that kind of situation.  \\n   I started college this past Monday and I commute to my classes.  This is all new to me since I rode the bus through high school, but oddly enough, I do not think that starting school is the source of my anxiety.  I get anxious mainly in the morning before leaving for school when I am trying to eat something.  I just cannot get myself to eat anything at all.  I know that I have nothing in my stomach and need something, but I just get eat anything.  If I am not doing something productive in the mornings like showering, packing for school, or brushing teeth, I start getting anxious.  If I'm not doing anything in the morning, I am just sitting at my computer desk watching Youtube or trying to eat.  I even got so anxious just thinking about everything that I would throw up.  I threw up everyday this week except Friday, so I guess I'm getting better.  I think that it became a habit of throwing up, because some mornings, the only time that I would stop being so anxious is when I would finally throw up.  Of course, when I did throw up, I had nothing to throw up in my stomach.  \\n  What really pisses me off is that I spend all this time worrying about going to school on an empty stomach and getting to class on time, but when I finally get on the road, I feel fine and have a great time at the university.  When I am in class, my stomach is growling, which makes me fell like I should be eating breakfast.  It has gotten to the point where I just leave early for school so I do not have time to sit around getting worked up.\\n   The scariest thing about this is that whenever I experience any kind of stress at home, I just start thinking stuff like school and get really anxious.  If my brother starts yelling or my dogs act up or anything small like that happens, I start freaking out and thinking I have to throw up.  Its horrible.  \\n   I have been getting a little better.  I think that this is just caused by my new life with college starting, commuting and all that, and will go away soon when I get used to everything.  I want to have a normal life where I am not held back by my worries.  I want to be like my brother and my friend who don't worry about much and are always relaxed.  I want to enjoy my college career and not remember it as a time that my anxiety got the best of me.  I do not want to take any medicine for this though, because I hear that those can be addictive and do not work long term.  I want to man up and get over this, but I do not think that I am strong enough for that yet.  This is becoming one of the worst phases of my life so far, and it needs to end.\\n\\n\\nI am sorry if this is poorly written, but I did not write this in one sitting and had the week from hell.\", \"I don't like having to post here again since last time I posted about job anxiety, I wound up quitting.  But anyway, I'm on meds this time so hopefully it won't end up like that again.  \\n  \\nSo pretty much, for the past year and half I've been on Pristiq and then for the last 3 months Celexa.  Pristiq worked well and the Celexa even better in addition to being cheaper.  My new found freedom from anxiety allowed me to ace an interview and get a half decent job in a call center.  \\n\\nNow, I know you're thinking that's not a good job for someone with anxiety, but my anxiety isn't with talking to people.  When I applied, I felt comfortable seeing myself in the position.  Also, today was our first day on the phones and talking to people wasn't the issue.  What's triggering my anxiety now is my own inadequacy and inexperience.  I had a few calls where I didn't know what to do and was completely lost; even though we had a lot of support being our first time on the floor, it was still very very stressful.  \\n  \\nI can usually tell normal anxiety from abnormal anxiety because normal anxiety goes away when the stress is gone.  Yet I've been dwelling on tomorrow since getting off today and it's been making me quite miserable. It's like the anxiety is getting too strong for the meds to handle.  I've actually had it happen to me a few times since going on med.  I know it'll get better as the days go on and I gain more experience, but no matter how much I try to talk myself out of it, I still dwell on it and it's been making me miserable...  \", \"So I have a severe form of anxiety of all kinds.

And whenever I do eat something/drink something, I sometimes have a panic attack because I get so scared I'm about to trip hard on LSD.\\n\\n(This fear of acid is sprouted from a terrible trip I had from smoking weed. Since weed scares me, acid is absolutely terrifying to me.)\\n\\nHow can I overcome this? It is taking a toll on my life.\", 'All I could remember was being angry. Upset. Confused. Just yearning to be normal. I was the spoiled kid in special education that hung out with ghetto kids in elementary school. I always lied about who I was. I told everyone I was just like them. But I really wasn\\'t. This actually continues to go on. Continuing on living a lie to people. To make myself feel like I can relate to them in just one realistic way. \\n\\nWhy? Because I never struggled really. I mean, not in terms of getting what I wanted. I always got what I asked for. I never had to really work to get anything. My grades were all F\\'s, sure, but a little punishment and I continued to get spoiled. If I remember correctly I didn\\'t really ever fit in with anyone but the ghetto kids. The ones that truly struggled. Because I saw that they know what it means to be alive. What it means to really suffer. Because growing up, they couldn\\'t simply ask for something and get in within a blink of an eye. They heard excuses. And those excuses probably hurt. All the hurt I knew was being treated like a retard. But, I still got everything I\\'ve always wanted.\\n\\nBy 8th grade, I dropped everything. I refused to hang out with my friends. I refused to live a lie. I just wanted to reflect. And that\\'s all I could remember doing at recess. Reflect. Talking to the yard duties, asking about their life. Asking for advice. I don\\'t remember anything, all I knew is that my friends were all worried, but eventually stopped talking to me. That\\'s when depression hit. Knowing I was moving on into a new realm. High school. I never felt so many twists in my body in knowing I was moving schools. Change was harsh.\\n\\nHigh school hits. I hated it. Oh, did I hate it. At lunch I actually hung out with the retarded kids in their classroom, eating my lunch in silence. If I wasn\\'t there, I pretended to be on the phone with someone. I just felt so alone. And anxious. It was paralyzing. I often felt sick every morning due to the fact that I had to spend lunch alone. Overdramatic maybe? I couldn\\'t concentrate really in class. Didn\\'t honestly care. I was just scared to be alone and everyone seeing me alone. Made friends in later years, they were also, quite ghetto. Then I met someone that goes to church.\\n\\nThen my life changed.\\n\\nI never heard much about religion until then. I gave my life to god and all that. Was fairly happy there but got out once I came out of the closet and the pastor called me out on it before his sermon on Sunday. That\\'s when I knew it wasn\\'t for me. It was cruel. I was hiding for so long and finally came out, thinking they would understand regardless of it being an \"abomination\". I couldn\\'t help how I felt. So I left the church. I left everything I had going there for me. I was big in the youth department and the kids loved me for being so understanding and outspoken. I often visited their families and made sure they were okay. They were all ghetto so, maybe that\\'s why I felt inclined to fit in, once again.\\n\\nThat eventually stops and to make a long story much shorter, I did a few jobs and volunteer work here and there. The seasons always judge my being it seems. Summer I am hyper and extremely extroverted and the winter I am reflective and extremely introverted.\\n\\nTLDR; my past sucks. So does my present. I see cycles now reflective off the seasons. I am essentially two people. Extrovert in the summer, introvert in the winter. I am now very very quiet, even around my own family. I quit my job due to anxiety of being around people and I just sit around browsing around the web for solutions. I am scared of medication as I don\\'t quite believe pharmaceutical companies have the best interest for us, but our money. I have this thought that it just makes you numb and rely on them for money in their pocket. I don\\'t know. I\\'ve done therapy before and one session just made me feel worse.

Just small things like worrying about the future, and the occasional death anxiety, but it would only rear it's head once a month, maybe less. I was for the most part, normal. I functioned, went to University, was the social monkey at all parties, was a bit of a player in terms of the amount of boyfriends I funnelled through, and in general was just your average late teens chick. \\n\\nAnyway, I had my first son young, I was 18. I was all right after that, had a little bit of the baby blues but came right after a while. \\n\\nFast forward several years and I was pregnant with my second son and my anxieties that I occasionally had were picking up. \\n\\nAfter the birth I was initially fine, but now 3 months on I am debilitated with anxieties and constant low moods. My issues surround predominantly death anxieties. The fear of myself dying, or my children dying, is something that lives in my head *constantly*. \\n\\nI had to stop watching programs set in the past, or the future, because they reminded me of when I won't be, or hadn't been. I used to study quantum physics, but now I can't even look at articles surrounding science or the solar system because it triggers my anxieties again. I see an elderly person? Trigger. I see someone being successful on television? I think about how right now I'm not doing that well, and that I am going to die. It's getting to the point where it is absolutely ridiculous. When I go to check on my son, who is now 4 months old, I don't check on him for the sake of checking on him, I go in to make sure he isn't dead. And each and every time I do this, I brace myself for it being a reality. \\n\\nNow, I know that post partum anxiety is a thing, and I know that around 3 months it can flare up. But I've been dealing with these thoughts for years now, it's just that they've sped up to the point where I am no longer enjoying my life. I am so god damned tired of living in the future and not being able to just enjoy the simple things without correlating it to dying. \\n\\nI used to want to study medicine, but I can't anymore because I am too terrified of being around sick people.

Yes, people should always 'live like it's your last day' but not like this. This is fucked up.\\n\\nSo I went to the doctor, who prescribed me Seroxat (20mg dose). Last year I was prescribed Citalopram for similar issues and it fucked me up, big time. I was literally a mess on the 3rd day of using it. I had the biggest panic attack of my life, couldn't breathe, couldn't even leave my bedroom for fear, and ended up having to call an ambulance because I genuinely thought I was dying. So, I stopped taking it. \\n\\nI told my doctor this and he said 'Oh well this drug is kind of like Citalopram but should be better for you'. He was pretty useless to be honest and I really feel like the level of help I got given was poor. I was in the room for under 3 minutes. \\n\\nAnyway, I didn't take any of it because I was terrified. But yesterday I found myself getting angry at my four month old, and I yelled at him. This is a four month old, not a 3 year old that's thrown his food on the floor.

I\\'m not in severe anxiety or depression, I don\\'t want to kill my self or something like this, but I can\\'t feel all the pleasure in all I\\'m doing.\\n\\nFor example: I have now finished my exams with marks over 90% , I\\'m in the last year of medicine school. In September I\\'m marrying a beatiful wife that I love very much. Our parents are helping us now and we don\\'t have any financial problems. And we are making our own house. All is perfect, I\\'m happy about it, I feel the happiness but I can\\' get over the worries.\\n\\nI bought us some tickets for going in a Trip in Europe for 2 weeks, and we have our flight on Saturday.  And my brain is rushing with thoughts: \" OMG, If i will panic in the plane, I we\\'ll crash?\" What if something goes wrong in the city, maybe accident or someone will steal our money or any other \"\\n\\nNow, I\\'m worried that If I wouldn\\'t be able to fall asleep. And If so, tomorrow I will be like a vegetable and depressed, and that will amplify my worries about the trip and all...\\n\\nI don\\'t want psychotherapy or meds. I just want to know CAN I OVERCOME these thoughts and CONSTAT worries by just changing my habit of thinking. Not necessarily ignoring it, but just get your head busy, meditation, chill out, going to gym, eat healthy?\\n\\nOr it\\'s impossible, and all I need is some SSRI ?', \"Hello my fellow sufferers! 12 years of Panic Disorder here, hoping to help share my experience with SSRI's with you all and I hope you can share yours with me. I have been on SSRI's for the past 12 years. When I started 12 years ago, I was taking 100 mgs of Zoloft. About 5 years ago, I cut down to 50. Now, this summer, I am hoping to ween off my SSRI completely. \\n\\nI am currently in the second week of weening to 25mgs. Just started getting the weird dizzy spells and irritability that come with cutting my dosage in half - but I'm powering through! I plan on staying on 25 mgs before I commence cutting down to 12.5, then eventually to 7, then nothing. \\n\\nI'd like to be able to check in with all of you in the process as to help others weening, as well as share the experience for anyone currently on SSRI's or thinking of taking them. Would you all mind if I shared with you all, maybe once a week, how I am doing?\\n\\nPlease share your experiences as well on getting off your meds. Thanks and love to you all. \", 'I don\\'t want to take medicine. I\\'m afraid. But I keep getting told I should. I was thinking of agreeing to try because I\\'m tired of talking about it, because I hope it will help, and because maybe it will be easier to convince myself to take it if it\\'s sitting in front of me. Then I looked on wikipedia and was reminded of nausea as a side effect. Anyway, one therapist would tell my regular doctor to prescribe an SSRI (she said probably Celexa or Zoloft), I guess, and that presumably doesn\\'t take all that long. The other, who doesn\\'t work in the same place, would have me go to a psychiatrist, which she said could take as long as 3 months to get an appointment.\\n\\nI\\'m also kind of jealous of people who are prescribed benzos. Maybe the psychiatrist would have something different to say regarding those. Maybe It\\'s better I don\\'t get them.\\n\\nI have a bunch of questions:\\n\\n1. Does anyone know how common nausea is? How long does it last? Do SSRIs cause nausea without throwing up, or is that more decided by how you handle nausea? Is it all (partially) a mental thing? Like, is it more people who are prone to nausea who are going to get it, or are certain SSRIs just inherently going to give certain people nausea? I\\'m really afraid of throwing up (and to a slightly lesser extent, nausea), but I haven\\'t in about 10 years, and I\\'ve only had one experience where I really thought \"this is nausea\" since then.\\n\\n2. Should I go with the therapist + regular doctor or the psychiatrist? Should I do both so I can maybe start sooner and still see what the psychiatrist has to say later?\\n\\n3. Can you start reacting to the medicine differently later on, or if it works for you will it tend to keep on working?\\n\\n4. I\\'ve seen people say they can start to feel withdrawal symptoms if they miss even a day. Is this within an hour or two after you usually take it, or more like, say, 36 hours since you last took it? Do they go away quickly if you\\'re able to take some? And does weaning off SSRIs generally work to completely avoid withdrawal symptoms, or just make them less severe?\\n\\n5. From what I understand, there\\'s an initial period where you won\\'t feel any better and the side effects tend to happen, and then tend to go away. How would you convince yourself to keep going? should you give up if it\\'s particularly bad?\\n\\nThat\\'s more questions than I planned, but they are roughly in order of importance to me, so I would rather the latter ones be the ones to be ignored.', \"Hey guys,\\nSo, my doctor (well, the doctor at the student health center at my university) prescribed me 150mg of Wellbutrin. I'm on the second day of taking it and I've had a horrible headache for the entirety of both days. I did a little internet research and figured out that this is a side effect... Has anyone else had any experience with this? How long did it take for it to go away? I have so much to do right now with school that I can't afford to not be able to work because of a headache. To be honest that makes me even more anxious than I was on my own before! If this is going to be a long lasting side effect, I'd almost rather deal with learning to control my anxiety without medication. I'm waiting on an appointment with the school counselor, but they couldn't see me until November. I'm probably going to try to go back in and see if she can lower my dose or maybe switch me to something else... or I might just not take it? I don't know. \", \"To start off, I wasn't sure if this was better here or in /r/depression, but I leaned towards here.\\n\\nI'll try to not be too wordy. Basically I'm having a shitty couple of weeks and things are just piling up on me and I guess I need to vent to someone that hasn't heard all my stupid crap several times before.\\n\\nI guess some background? GAD with depression, seeing a therapist. Tried several meds, currently on Prozac.\\n\\nRight now I'm sitting here terrified of going into work tomorrow. We're getting close to a deadline and I'm getting further and further behind. I just can't seem to get myself to do as much work as I should be some days, sometimes I just sit there and stare into nothing really. Of course this is making everything so much worse.\\n\\nI've been trying to work with my therapist, but I seem to have a terrible time breaking out of my old habits. I know what I need to do, but I just can't seem keep myself doing it. No meds have seemed to help.\\n\\nWith worrying about all that stuff I just can't seem to get my mind to stop worrying about everything else too. I moved to my current town a little over a year ago. I didn't know anyone here at all. I have terrible anxiety in social situations, so I didn't really make any friends at work. I kinda shied away from the two people that tried to be friendly and I think I've already ruined that. It's also a smallish/medium town, and I haven't really been able to think of any kind of things I could look for to try to meet people that I'd enjoy right now. I just can't figure out what to do. The only friends I have live a few states away from me. One of them is bi-polar, and I just can't seem to deal with her problems and mine too when she's in a depressed phase.\\n\\nSo I end up just sitting around worrying about things and trying to escape from my worries either through video games or sleeping. Half the time I feel like I just wish I could disappear and never have to worry about any of this stuff again. I just don't know what to do....\\n\\nAnyway, thanks for reading my rant.\", \"A few nights ago I awoke after being half-asleep with a warm feeling in the center of my chest and a brief but sharp stabbing pain followed by a panic attack. Yesterday I start having the same pain, heart palpitations, and dizziness. I went to the doctors on the same day and had an EKG done along with some blood work. The EKG was normal but I'm still waiting on the lab with the blood test results. I mentioned to the doctor that I've had panic attacks before, and he said that the heart palpitations and pain could very well be a result of anxiety. \\n\\nI've had anxiety problems for a while, but pain in my chest has never accompanied it before. The pain has persisted since the doctor, which is the one place it didn't occur (I guess I was very calm being around a bunch of people who could save me if something was actually wrong). I've had chest pains all day today. I'd possibly like to get a CT or MRI to make absolutely sure I am okay, but it's more than likely my own nervousness causing the problem. Does anyone else ever get this? How do you deal with it? I've never taken medication for anxiety before, but I'd certainly consider it as this pain is already starting to drive me crazy. Thanks for any advice.\", \"[I posted another text post a few days back](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ltdsk/rant_electricitywater_might_be_cut_off_at_my/) about me worrying about financial issues because of me having no job at the moment. It just seems that things are getting worse from one day to the next.\\n\\nSo I just found out today that I’m no longer covered now under my mom’s health plan for the antidepressants that I need in order to function normally. And this is despite the fact that I already filled out and submitted forms in order to extend my coverage until I’m 26. So unless I find a job real soon I’ll be in a world of pain once I run out of Cipralex and the withdrawal from my medication kicks in.\\n\\nI feel like I'm in a situation that is very frustrating but at the same time very hopeless. Although my employment counselor says I'm very qualified for the work that I'm trying to get into (office administration), I think that she's lying because I've been unemployed for four months now and have not had one job offer thus far. It just seems pointless to keep going on like this when each day seems to present new financial challenges that are becoming impossible for me to meet unless I find a job. And it seems that I have no value in the job market as my lack of success in finding paid work attests to.\\n\\nI just don't know what else to do right now. I decided to write it here because the other mental health professionals that I've spoken with where I live only seem to focus on increasing the dosage of my medication when finding some sort of regular income would actually be more helpful.\", 'So, I\\'m a 27 year old male who has been fighting anxiety and panic since I was a kid basically. Around 2007 I got these really scary panic-attacks that resulted in me getting SSRI medication, which worked for me. I tried to get myself of them too early though so I ended up getting back on another medication(Mirtazapin, since I had trouble sleeping due to anxiety). I was on Mirtazapin during 2008-2009.\\n\\nI went on with the Mirtazapin for about a year when the anxiety kicked right back. Fuck.\\n\\nI should mention that at both those occassions I went through some nasty periods. In 2007 my mom was committed to an institution for alcoholics and that really, really messed with my mind since my mom had been the sweetest and most awesome person during my childhood. My mom and dad divorced when I was 18 and that\\'s when she started partying hard with her new dude. And I assume that it\\'s these events that drove me to my first real panicattack(felt like I was going insane, bad case of dp/dr etc).\\n\\nIn 2009 I moved quite a distance to get closer to my girlfriend, but since she already lived with a roomie due to them studying together, I moved in with a \"friend\". This also turned out to be a horrible idea since my \"friend\" was a real asshole who didn\\'t care one bit about taking care of our apartment or himself(dude gets up from his chair after playing World of Warcraft for 10h straight and has basically shit himself, for example). To top this mountain of crap off me and my girlfriend broke up and I found myself basically alone in a big city. Needless to say, I moved back home pretty quick. And endured the shitstorm of anxiety that followed.\\n\\nThis is where it gets interesting, I was on Mirtazapin and it had given me peace for over a year, but somehow after I got back home from my stint in the big city, it just didn\\'t do anything anymore. I felt worse than ever. So I talked to my doctor and got back on Fluoxetine which was the first SSRI I got back in 2007, along with sessions of coginitive behavioral therapy. Slowly I crawled out of hell and got back on my feet again. Yay.\\n\\nSo, fastforward to 2011 and 2012. I\\'m feeling rather healthy, just some minor anxiety, like riding the bus and train. But it\\'s overall good. I get a new job working a IT helpdesk for a major corporation(I figured that it would be a great stepping stone since I lack proper technical education). A couple of months in I start getting anxiety since the job is a really mindnumbing and due to the distance I have to travel every morning to get to work from home. So I see that the corporation I\\'m working for is hiring a linux hacker and since I love linux and have been running it since ~2000 I figured I apply. And I got the job. Amazing.\\n\\nWell, not so much. It turns out that there isn\\'t a whole lot of stuff to do in my new position as a linux geek and the guy who I am working with is a real douchebag(not to me but to everyone else in the office).\\n\\nThis is really stressful for me, not having ANYTHING to do all day while being at work. So I try to come up with my own projects, but that\\'s not a permanent solution and I quickly tire.\\n\\nIn the spring of 2012, the company I\\'m working for announces that they will be outsourcing their IT. And my fianceé announces that she is pregnant. I freak out. I\\'m not ready to be a father, am I? But I get over it, I face the reality of it and decide to be the kids dad.\\n\\nI go through the summer with nothing to do, just waiting for the outsourcing to happend. But then I see that our countrys government is hiring linux hackers in my hometown. YAY! I apply for the job.. and GET IT! Once again a dream come true, but with much higher pay and at a walking distance.\\n\\nSo, I have this new job and a child. But on christmas eve my anxiety blossomed up like never before. Me, my fianceé and our baby girl were going to her fathers house, which is quite a travel and in the middle of the woods. I got a major anxiety attack and had to go back home. I couldn\\'t do it for some reason. Perhaps leaving the comfortzone triggered this?\\n\\nRight now I am in a constant state of anxiety with panic and dp/dr. And since my biggest fear is going insane.. well, you get the point, it\\'s just a big ball of painful thoughts. I saw a therapist yesterday and decided to see her again next week. Hopefully that\\'ll actually do some good.\\n\\nI just hate this irrational fear, if I was going insane I would have gone down that road long ago I figure. But my brain doesn\\'t seem to think so. That fucker.\\n\\nSorry for the long and possibly incoherent text(and the bad english), just had to throw it out there and see if someone can relate to this.\\n\\n(And yes, this is a fake-account, solely for this purpose).', 'Hi.

I\\'ve started my first ever relationship.\\n\\nToday I randomly broke down crying and the feelings which I had nearly forgotten about came pouring back in. I\\'m just fucking terrified to be honest. I\\'m really fucking pissed that I have to be on zoloft, and seeing a therapist to begin with. Because honestly, before my OCD episode this year, I had never considered myself to need meds and looked down on people who were on them.

I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety, and mild ADD by several doctors throughout my life. I've tried several different medications, and they do help, but I'd prefer to be off of them because of the lack of enthusiasm I experience for things like creativity and sex. \\n\\nI started seeing a new therapist again a couple months ago, which was going well, but I can't ever get a session scheduled with her anymore. Her appointments are always booked up when I'm available to go. It's frustrating, I don't know why her office even accepted me as a new patient, especially since I didn't ask for her specifically, just anyone who was accepting patients and took my insurance. Kind of burnt out on it because of that, and since I've managed to tackle one or two big issues since then on my own (like reaching out to an ex-religion support group, and confronting my sister on a difficult subject) I've decided to stop trying to schedule appointments with her. \\n\\nI've started self-treatment with herbal supplements like St. John's Wart, B complex vitamins, and nicotine in the form of electronic cigarettes. Since I've started using e-cigs I've noticed some positive effects, less nausea, driving to work is easier, I'm able to calm down quicker. It's also become something to pour myself into, I tend to get obsessed with things that I discover I like. I spend hours researching, reading, online shopping, and ultimately dropping quite a bit of money. My hobbies typically don't last long, once I find a new thing to obsess over, I switch all focus to that thing. Right now it's e-cigs. \\n\\nI discovered there's a convention next month for e-cig enthusiasts, with lots of vendors and things like raffles. It sounds fun in theory, but last time I went to a convention (anime con) by myself I wound up sitting in the corner of the lobby having a panic attack. I do not know anyone who'd be interested in going with me. It's kind of a weird thing to be interested in if you're not an ex-smoker. I already feel like an outsider for that reason. I'm not using them to quit smoking, I'm using them because I can't leave the house sometimes. I want to go, but I don't know if I can make myself. My heart rate is going up just thinking about it.\", \"I have been mostly sleepless for several days trying to decide what to do. I was on sertraline for 5 years for social and general anxiety and ocd. I came to a really good place last year and decided to taper down. I have been med free since February and feeling mostly fine. Finer than before meds. But lately. I don't know. Big awful family stuff happened and then I was in inexplicable pain for two months while they figured out why and then I had to have back surgery and now I just lie here having what the docs would call intrusive thoughts. Nothing dangerous I promise. Just, nonstop revisiting all the things that are bothering me. Pain, uselessness, reliving fights... Can't stop obsessing but I don't want to say out loud the thoughts I'm having, or what happened with my family...and I don't want to take Zoloft anymore but I don't want to test meds until something else works.  5 years of no libido plus I gained almost 60 lbs on meds. I swear my husband should convert to Catholicism so he can collect his sainthood. I'm having brain zaps for the first time since I conquered the Zoloft withdrawals. My family Dr had me on the Zoloft and also ativan for panic attacks. But I have a new Dr now who seems hesitant to prescribe even antibiotics. I'm terrified I will have to actually see a psychologist. My brain is so broken I can't verbalize what's wrong. It wouldn't make sense even if I tried. I'm holding it together but I don't know how much longer I can. I'm afraid if I start crying I will never stop.

Might be important later. If you made it this far, thanks for listening. I don't know what I'm after, posting this but I have to get something out, even silently.\", \"This is my first time posting here and my thoughts are a jumbled mess, so I'll keep this as concise as possible. I'm going to preface this with a quick background: I'm 15, between my sophomore and junior years of high school, and work in a summer camp.\\n \\nMy anxiety started out when I was in the third grade. It began early on as stomach aches on the ride to school but only in the past year has turned into full-on anxiety attacks and extends beyond the morning. Palpitations. Dizziness. Angina. Depression. And the classic stomach aches that my mom always told me was a 'nervous stomach'. \\n \\nAnyway, my 'nervous stomach' took a solid 10% out of my attendance rate every year from fifth grade as it got worse up until this past year when it continued getting worse but became less frequent.\\n \\nAgain, I work in a summer camp. The position I have happens to be (surprisingly) incredibly, incredibly, *incredibly* stressful and I often fall victim to the fuck-up's of others and then pick up their slack for them as it's my job. I'm on the job a little over twelve hours per day without a break. At all. This has blown up my anxiety lately and it's only been a week on the job. I told my mom how bad it's getting and she's finally agreed to take me to the doc after all these years as she's finally starting to realize it's more than a 'nervous stomach'. The interesting thing about this doctor's office is that I've volunteered there on more than one occasion. The medical office is understaffed and need all of the help they can get. It seems like the perfect opportunity to leave the camp behind (albeit a bit early in the summer) and get a spot in the medical office. I can come and go as I please, it's going to look much better on my college app, there's a spotless bathroom right next door to the office where I would spend all of my time processing records and a Dunkin Donuts right on the corner. There's a lot of work that needs to be done there with a whole backlog of records that need to be entered into the system and it's very mindless work that never really bothered me when I was volunteering there. My mom does *not* support the idea of me leaving the camp to go work at the office even though she has a very friendly relationship with the doctor and knows everyone there. I also don't have the heart to walk into the camp office and resign from a position that is practically irreplaceable at this point in the summer. I just wanted somewhere to dump my thoughts and maybe hear what other people think as well. \\n \\nI know this post was a mess but I really needed to reach out and this seemed like the perfect place.\\n \\nThanks a bunch, guys.\\n \\n **TL;DR** My job has made my anxiety a crippling burden and I have the chance to get out. The problem is that nobody around me is supportive and my current position is pretty vital to the workplace and it's a tough position find a replacement for.\", \"Anyone dealing with Anxiety feel like there's a lump in your throat?\\n\\nSometimes it feels like there's a lump in my throat or it's swollen (but physically, I feel nothing swollen or there are no lumps).

I'd love to hear from someone else as I can feel quite alone wich should be no surprise. \\n\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for your replies. I have the full story of my life right here. Warning WALL OF TEXT! Just wanted to give some background. it's not very organized though but it's one of hte first time I was able to do this without getting upset recalling all the details. I was actually trying to get help but the help here is really shitty. I have PTSD because my parents sent me to the psychiatric ward and I got stuck in an abusive group home. Shit sucks. \\n\\nThanks. \\n\\nFor me it's not so much the idea of leaving the house, it's just I'm afraid of going out because I'm afraid of anxiety attacks. What's worse is that I have severe allergies brought on by a chronic sinus infection which feeds into my allergies. Even worse is that I'm (high functioning) autistic/aspergers so I have sensory integration problems, that I am using deep pressure input to prevent meltdowns, but it still feeds into agoraphobia. For example my front yard is not private. If things aren't private I just get uncomfortable. I have to shut all the doors in my house for this reason because it feels uncomfortable if door are left ajar. I always have my back to a wall and I can't sit infront of a door. My Doctor's office is cramped and has fluorescent lights and my glasses are too thick and I'm too blind to wear sunglasses so it all feeds into my agoraphobia.\\n\\nUnfortunately when I was about 15 (23 now) my anxiety problems climaxed because I was overprescribed medications. I had a nervous breakdown because I was hallucinating and got sent to psychiatric wards where I became traumatized. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn saying that I do physically leave my house once a week because of garbage day and I am trying to stick my head out the door or just chill on my porch more but the noise (Sensory problems, hypersensitive) and the fact my property just fucking sucks and it is not private makes me uncomfortable for non-agoraphobic reasons. When I was living at my parents house I was a lot more comfortable outside.\\n\\n2 years ago or longer I was getting help from someone at a home care agency to help me get out of the house more. We were driving at least 3 times a week and going to a coffee shop a few times a week and also doing a lot of errands. Unfortunately since I was working with a BMS who was less than adequate to say the least I felt like I was forced to live with the workers because she treated me like a low functioning autistic person who could not make decisions or my own or a child. She was the one who got me sent to a traumatic group home where I was literally almost killed and traumatized for 7 months and she didn't understand that I just wanted to relax and get used to my new apartment and living on my own before I started adding to it with school, hobbies and shit. She was truly really shitty at her job. The BMS quit and I still stuck with the home care workers but there was no plan in place. The BMS' job was to have a plan so I end up becoming independent and not agoraphobic. So what happened was that my independence actually lessoned because before that point I wanted to do things by myself and I was getting out by myself. I ended up with only 1 home care worker because out of 4 of them two were grossly undertrained, the most trained and senior worker was burnt out from drugs and permanently fried from when he was younger and would sleep on my couch everyday. The last worker I worked with really well but we didn't really accomplish everything besides going out every day. Which was nice but I relied on her too much and my independence vanished. \\n\\nI was also walking almost literally every day or every second day. hen my home care worker left. The sinus infection has been here for 2 years and my allergies have gone wild and prevents me from going outside. It feeds into agoraphobia because if I don't get allergies, which I'm not exagerrating I get everytime I go outside anyways, I'm afraid of it so even in winter I am afraid of going out for allergy reasons.  It sucks because I predicted this would happen with the home care worker and she didn't give me any time before she quit and it just really screwed me over.\\n\\nAround that time my therapist left even though I was telling her as much information as I am in this post about being agoraphobic. I told her I thought I had PTSD from the group homes and psychiatric hospitals and assault and attempted rapes and what not, but she wouldn't listen and we argued about it. Then she quit. \\n\\nChronic sinus infection happened and I became bedridden. My allergies have been absolutely haywire. I stopped walking everyday. I got fat which added to my sensory integration problems.(I'm sensitive to touch so it's really difficult to get used to different clothes and I need new clothes cause I'm a gained like 50 pounds.)  I stopped going out of the house and everything fed into my agoraphobiaAround this time was when my therapist quit. I realized my family doctors were shitty doctors and had to find anew one by the change was too hard to deal with so I haven't seen him much.  My home care worker quit working with me because she wanted a better job. It's been like this for at least 2 years now. Had a friend but he moved to Europe. \\n\\n\\n\\nI have a new family doctor now but I haven't been able to see him. I'm talking to my family at least a couple times a week and my friend on the phone literally everyday. He helps me out if I ever have flashbacks or meltdowns and I'm able to talk about anxiety and stuff with my parents. My parents help me get groceries since I don't go out now, but I understand so much about myself to know it's not going to help my anxiety.

Smoked it every day all day for a good 3 years. I also did alot of MDMA (once a week for a good couple of months). This was there before heading to uni but took over when i was there. I slowly started to enjoy the high less and less until it became normal that I would wig out and get really paranoid every time i smoked it. I felt like i and everyone else were judging everything that came out my mouth. \\n\\nThen, I began to lose it big time. One day I was smoking with a couple of mates and I literally had the biggest depersonalisation trip ever. I got extremely paranoid. We were just chilling and I literally froze. I couldn't move, I was just staring at my mates with a ghostly look on my face not saying a word for like 5 minutes. This creeped them the fuck out (as it would anyone) and i ended up running out the room having a panic attack. They were very supportive the next day but it hit me hard. I began to think that i'd lost my mind.\\n\\nThis was probably the worst experience of my life. I have never lost control of myself so badly before and been unable to think straight. \\nI quit the weed for good and havn't smoked since. That was almost 2 years ago.\\n\\nI havn't been the same since, I have 0 self confidence and social anxiety. it IS slowly getting better but it's still there and i feel like it could be triggered at any time.\\n\\nSTUPIDLY, i carried on taking MDMA every now and then and it wasn't until I had the SAME experience coming down on MDMA that I decided to make a big change in my lifestyle. \\n\\nSince the 1st of January this year, I have been eating healthily, exercising every day and meditating (which i am now extremely good at) and cut out the mates who were intro drugs.\\n\\nThis stuff all seems to be helping but every now and then I feel the anxiety hit me out of nowhere. For example, I was in the shop the other day and suddenly I felt like i was on show and losing control, became hyper aware of all my slightest movements and how i looked to the outside world. I still get pretty frequent hot flashes that make me extremely uncomfortable.\\n\\nI constantly fear losing control like I did that day. When in normal conversations (even with closest family) I am ALWAYS overly aware of my eye contact and if i look normal or more specifically not looking weird. It's so strange as I used to never even think about this shit before EVER.\\n\\nI've tried so much to get rid of it but it still seems to run my life. I'm afraid to take medication because of the side effects and get the impression they don't really work. \\n\\nI do feel alot better in myself than I have done in a long time, but I fear being fucked up forever. If i have a few drinks on a night out I COMPLETELY LOSE my anxiety and feel confident again. It's weird.

Lately, I've been getting this very odd sensation that is hard to explain and I was wondering if anyone else has ever run across it or experienced it.  It would make me feel better if other people have heard of this so I can help myself just forget about it so it goes away if it is just anxiety related.\\n\\nBasically, I can feel my pulse/blood flow/heartbeat.  It isn't pounding or going too fast or too slow or missing beats or anything like that.  I just feel the blood moving through my body sometimes, along with a slight derealization.  As it does so, various parts of my body move along with it.  This can be my hands (if I'm holding my phone, I can see my phone bob with my pulse) or a general feeling in my legs, etc.  I also find myself swaying back and forth, like I'm on a mini rocking chair.  Usually this is just my head doing that.  My head will start moving a very small amount back and forth, left and right, front and back, or nodding up and down, like a bobblehead.  It's a very tiny amount that it moves back and forth.  I have a hard time stopping it, even when I specifically try to.  I've been getting tinging/numbness in my fingers/toes sometimes too but I know that is probably just anxiety because I've experienced that before.\\n\\nI'm currently on (new) medication, Mirtazapine, although this was happening before I started on that.  Benzos are hit or miss on making it better.  I have had 2 ECGs (both in Jan) and they were fine.  Multiple Xrays of my chest and they were fine too.  Last bloodwork I had (about 2 months ago) was good.  Blood pressure is generally normal and my pulse can be a little elevated (probably from just being worried about it) but nothing crazy.  No more than 100 at any time.  My doc told me to wait out the weekend and see how it goes so I doubt its anything super serious but with my health anxiety sometimes I just need reassurance that I'm not crazy and everything is going to be okay from people that have actually experienced it.

Anyone else have this happen?\", \"So, I've posted in this subreddit for a while---hopefully you guys aren't becoming familiar with me. I've not been ill since beginning to suffer from severe GAD 6 months ago. There was a correlation between my anxiety and alcohol intake, and once I cut that out I began to feel a lot better. Since I've only had hypersensitivity in my head--weird aches, pains, pressures and tingling that made me feel claustrophobic. \\n\\nI had been terrified of getting sick that entire time. I knew if hangovers (and possible minor alcohol withdrawal [my doctors didn't seem concerned, but said I could have been having minor withdrawals]) were bad, surely the flu, strep, or something would be terrifying and I'd start self diagnosing myself with everything that's bad.\\n\\nWell, I got the flu (I think) yesterday and had major trouble sleeping last night. Fever, body aches, runny nose, somewhat bothersome throat and aches in my face, along with a few minor headaches. \\n\\nI have NOT COME CLOSE TO PANICKING. I almost feel sedated, like I've been given a zanex. I feel like crap, but there's just a calmness over me. I moved in with my grandmother a few months ago to help cope with stress and keep everything calm, and I didn't want to bother her. I'm 23 and have been very stubborn about dealing with this independently. \\n\\nI've deliberately not read anything online b/c that's a good way to self diagnose yourself with horrifying things. So, I decided my only outlet would be here. If I feel worse I'll see a doc, but I feel like if I can endure a flu with anxiety, with nothing more than over the counter meds, that when I finally wake up feeling better I'm going to feel some major relief from an anxiety standpoint. \\n\\nThis could actually help. Anyone had a similar experience?\", \"Just as a bit of background; My anxiety has been getting progressively worse over the past 9 months or so, to the point where fear has become a constant presence in the background. From the moment I wake up, to the moment I go to sleep the anxiety is there. What's worse, the anxiety ABOUT the anxiety has been mounting constantly. What if I have a panic attack at work? What if people around me see how freaked out I am? etc, etc. About two months ago I went for a 3 day stretch relatively anxiety free and was actually shocked to remember what feeling 'normal' was like. I've been feeling like I'm losing my mind and things are spiraling out of control.\\n\\nAbout a month ago now I started reading 8 Minute Mediation, which I'd had sitting around for a long time and never really looked into. More importantly I started actually following it; sitting 8 minutes a day, every day and really working at it. It's hard work. The book is irritating. The author and his writing style are irritating. In fact I'd have a hard time recommending it to anyone, except that it puts the idea and some methods of meditation in a very basic, straightforward (and dare I say, North American) way. If you can dig out the basic goals and reasoning, it's well worth the effort.\\n\\nThe most helpful thing about it by far is practicing non-attachment. Setting aside a bit of time every day and working at accepting and letting go of thoughts, anxiety related or not. Not arguing with them, not trying to suppress them, not trying to distract myself or run from them, just accepting that they're there and releasing them. I've lately found myself doing it when anxious thoughts start popping up throughout the day. Instead of freaking out about them, or getting drawn up into them, just accepting the fact that I'm having them, they exist, but I don't have to get attached to them. Not only has my overall anxiety level started to feel like it's going down for the first time in over a year, there's also a budding sense of confidence that I'm not running out of control and I actually do have some say in how things play out.\\n\\nIt's not easy, like I said, it's hard work. It's also not instant. At first it feels like it isn't doing anything, but a good way of thinking about it is kind of like losing weight. One trip to the gym isn't going to drop you a pant size, but put in the effort and it starts to add up. I'm also not saying I'm cured, or that I've beat my anxiety or anything foolish like that. It's still there, I'm just starting to feel a little less like it's in control of me. Of course one should consult a doctor, consider medication, therapy, etc etc. But so far, out of everything I've tried (including some prescription meds with horrible side effects and withdrawal symptoms) this has left me feeling the most positive and like it's actually helping, and figured I'd pass it on in case anyone else had been looking for something new, or wasn't sure about trying meditation.\\n\\nTL;DR Following the program from the book 8 Minute Meditation (though it's kind of a crap book otherwise) and really working at not getting attached to the constant stream of thought my brain spits out 24/7 has been the most effective thing I've found so far to help with anxiety.

My co worker took care of my client and I messaged the mom and told her that I had a migraine and needed to take care of myself today.  She never replied.  I know she\\'s pissed.  That\\'s the way she rolls.  My boss was totally cool about it and said it was fine to bounce out, but the main reason I left is due to stress and anxiety.  I could have easily stayed and worked through it, but I felt like I just needed a day. \\n\\nSo now I feel HORRIBLE.  My hands are shaking and I just KNOW that this mom is going to ream me tomorrow.  She will most likely have a \"conversation\" with me about leaving early etc. and it would not surprise me if she freaks out on me.\\n\\n\\nI am at my apartment now and every time someone walks into the building, I\\'m scared it\\'s going to be her.  She has no clue where I live, but still...And as a topper, I saw her father while I was driving home and he honked at me and waved.  I know he\\'s going to say something too, like \"Oh, well she didn\\'t LOOK sick!\"\\n\\nSo, I have to work tomorrow.  I did stop at an emergicare to get some headache meds, but forgot to ask for a note (which I don\\'t actually need for my bosses/work, just an afterthought as a way to \"prove\" that I was actually \"sick\").  I have been home for an hour now and am already dreading having to see her tomorrow.  I KNOW she\\'s going to lose her mind tonight (because being a stay at home mom of 4, with one autistic child is super hard.  Her husband doesn\\'t really help out and she will be with her kids without staff for 3 hours).  \\n\\nI don\\'t know.  I\\'m just freaking out right now.  I really could have worked today.  I really SHOULD have stayed.  I would have been just fine.  I could have dealt with the stress...but I didn\\'t and now I feel terrible.  I texted my co worker and she told me not to feel bad...but god damn...Why do I have to feel bad for taking care of myself?  I\\'m so anxious that I puked as soon as I got home.  \\n\\nAny advice?  I feel like the worst employee ever right now. ', \"I think I may be struggling with anxiety. Honestly, I've been this way my whole life, but I thought it was just part of who I was.

If it is medication, I want help. But I'm afraid that if I were to be prescribed medication, it might change me in ways I'd regret.\\n\\nI'm scared.

He recommended Celexa which made me very weak and nauseous and on top of that I got a cold and had a bad panic attack last Thursday (this one was different in that my hands and face were tingling and my hands were locked up - the EMTs said it was because I was hyperventilating.

I know reddit isn't the right place to seek medical advice, but I'm looking to hear others experiences with Paxil and whether or not anyone with my type of issue has been able to get over it with just CBT and major lifestyle changes.  Lifestyle changes being a much better diet, exercise, meditation, breathing exercises, focusing on relaxing?  I feel defeated every time I have to take a xanax and don't want to add another drug in the mix.  I suppose its worth noting that the only time I didn't have to take my xanax was when I was on Celexa for those two days.  Though, again, my head felt heavy and I couldn't get through the first few days of the side effects (though that could've been because of the cold).  Also, I haven't been to therapy in about a month because the person I went to was 45 mins away and all she tried with me was hypnotherapy which I felt helped calm me down, but it obviously didn't work completely.

I think I ended up turning it on myself, and started waking up in the middle of the night having panic attacks about 5 years ago. At the time, they didn\\'t happen as often as they do now.\\n\\nMy attacks always have something to due with my health. At first, I thought I was having a heart attack, but did not go to the ER. Decided if I didn\\'t wake in the morning, life will go on. \\n\\nThen I thought I had a blood clot in my thigh. Went to the ER, and while they had me hooked up to the blood pressure monitor, I could overhear the doctors outside the room discussing my elevated clotting factor levels. Of course, the machine started beeping faster, and I started getting light-headed and almost passed out. Not knowing anything about this type of thing, I had a full-blown panic attack, but they X-rayed my chest, and sent me home saying there was nothing wrong. They didn\\'t know I was on the other side of the curtain, completely losing it.\\n\\nThis is when I saw a doctor, and was first prescribed Xanax. OMG. ...first time in my life I could just sit. and think. about nothing.\\n\\nAnyway, fast forward a little. \\n\\nHad an earache that lasted on and off for about a year. IT made me insane; I was thinking I wad a tumor or something. Then I thought I was having heart problems, and had a holter monitor on for 3 days. Ran the crap out of myself, trying to make sure it recorded every little thing I could do to cause problems with my heart. Came back fine.\\n\\nSince then, I have had 3 more trips to the ER having panic attacks; all of them thinking I was having a heart attack.

It\\'s not the death; it\\'s what their loved ones go through afterwards\\n- thoughts about aging - I know it\\'s coming, it\\'s inevitable. Why can\\'t I just accept it, and enjoy what is left?\\n- Wondering how many people live past my age being my size - I am 36, I have lost 90lbs since 2010. Finally just under 290. Still scared shitless. If I can feel my heart beating because of walking fast or running, I flip out.\\n- Whether there is a God or not - was raised Christian, but none of it makes sense anymore.. it\\'s like.. I stopped believing in the Easter Bunny and Santa Clause, too. But I feel like I am completely lost now, because I have no faith. in anything.\\n- The grand scale of things - the earth, the moon, the vast emptiness of space..\\n- Knowing that when I pass, everything I aspired to be and learn... it\\'s just gone. All that will be left of my memory.. will be with my kids. This will last for about 2 generations. How can anyone expect to help better society with so little time?\\n- I worry about having to be cleaned up after when I die. I can\\'t deal with the thought of my fiance or kids finding me.\\n- I have panic attacks from worrying about having panic attacks.\\n\\nI feel like just the affects of the stress or worrying about all this crap is going to cause my death; and soon.\\n\\nI have been on roughly 15 antidepressants. Only thing that helped was stimulants. I recently got a prescription for aderall, which was GREAT. No panic attacks until it wears off. Turned into a prescription for Vyvanse. This stuff seems to be a \"godsend\", if you will. All the depression, anxiety.. just gone... for 12-14 hours. Then it wears off. Immediate issues ensue.\\n\\nI am glad to say that I am only needing the Xanax 2-3 times per week, some weeks just once. I was needing it every stinking night just to sleep. Backed myself down.\\n\\nI am not a girly girl. I work hard and I am very physical. I will go until I drop. If I can\\'t walk, I will army crawl if I have to, just so I don\\'t have to ask for help. But this anxiety.. it\\'s crippling. I don\\'t want to me on meds for the rest of my life for it. I want to learn to control it for myself. I feel helpless.\\n\\nI took a Xanax right before I started typing this out. I can tell it\\'s starting to kick in now, or getting it off my chest has helped some.\\n\\nI am supposed to start bio-feedback therapy soon, and am SO hopeful that it can help. Has anyone else here tried it? PLEASE, if you have any input, I would love to get any more ideas on coping with this.  I am scared that my fiance will leave me at some point due to the stress revolving about this.\\n\\nIf you have made it this far, thank you so much for your time. I am sorry if my post has also caused any of you stress through triggers, etc. Hopefully I can get better so that I can return the favor and help someone else.\\n\\nEdited for Speeling and adding a couple of words... because there weren\\'t enough, right?\\nEdit 2: Trigger alert', \"Background; I live in a suburban town, on a dead-end street within the town center.

I just signed a lease on a house last week and I am going to be moving sometime next week. I am even dating a great guy now. \\n\\nBecause things are so good, I want to keep it that way. With the stress of preparing to move and buying everything that I need and finding a job, I can feel myself start to worry and get a little stressed. I know I can keep it in check without medication, but I just want a few tips on how to keep in under control. Any ideas would be great. Thanks!', \"background:\\nPeople that know me in real life would be shocked to know this, but I experience daily panic attacks.  They are usually physical, they sometimes feel like hot flashes, or like a heart attack, or I just zone out with this intense fear.\\nI've made it to 30 with no meds, but this week some shit happened that kind of pushed the anxiety up a level and it's interfering with my ability to be productive and hide this issue.\\n\\nCan you guys tell me whether you use beta blockers or antidepressants for the physical symptoms of anxiety, and why one or the other worked for you?\\n\\nP.S.

I\\'m not on any medication for it and I\\'m not exactly sure what type it is because I just started therapy. \\n\\nI would also like to explain that in general I\\'m very logical, I can see how my emotions or the way I\\'m acting doesn\\'t make sense, that I\\'m over thinking it or whatever, so when I explain how I\\'ve been feeling I know it\\'s stupid, I just need help fighting it.\\n\\nI\\'ve been in a relationship with my first boyfriend for a little over 3 months. I\\'m always afraid that I\\'m going to come off as clingy or something. The main thing I have a problem with is texting/communication. You know, some days I just don\\'t hear from him. And that\\'s really not that big of a deal, we\\'re both really busy people and when we are together it\\'s great. Usually he sends me some sort of an explanation and an apology when he realizes that he hasn\\'t responded to my text(s) or talked to me all day. (Not because I asked him too or get mad at him -- I\\'m too scared to talk to him about this -- he\\'s just sweet.)\\n\\nThe problem is, I should be fine and I understand that we\\'re both busy (I can\\'t always text him back right away or at all sometimes) yet I almost always get super depressed and start thinking these crazy ideas about him cheating on me or that he doesn\\'t love me anymore or stupid shit like that. Especially if it\\'s been a whole day without talking to him. And I\\'m sitting here like \"girl, your crazy. You. Need. To. Calm. Your. Tits. It\\'s just the anxiety blah blah blah.\" The thing is, simply knowing that I\\'m being illogical doesn\\'t really help. \\n\\nIs there anything I can try, phrases to repeat or things to remind me of, that would help me from acting so insane?', 'So I have been on lexapro 10mgs now for about 5 weeks now.

I am just wondering maybe I should lower my dose because now that the medication is at its full effect, maybe it is just too much.

It started when a girl I was seeing for a couple of months finished with me out of the blue.\\n\\nI've been taking meds for about 3 months, and for the last month I've almost felt like myself again. But there's always a part of me that keeps telling myself that feeling ok is a lie, and that I need to berate myself because the constant fear and self-loathing are the only things that are real.

The university has a councilor, but I don\\'t go back until September; this is an issue that affect me most during the summer employment season.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs a bit of background, the vast majority of my family suffers from extreme road rage. It wasn\\'t causing \"problems\" for me until I went on a road trip with relatives in the Arizona mountains... to make a long story short, the driver was very offended by my nervousness and his speeding nearly sent us off the switchbacks. Before then, I would always pretend to drive the car when I was with my mom... I\\'d look out for other drivers, pretend to press pedals, and so on. However, what I\\'m experiencing now is far more severe, and I\\'m starting to realize how much it\\'s been affecting me.\\n\\nAt best, I find myself holding onto things while I\\'m a passenger; if the driver is calm and I\\'m distracted, I might just keep something in my hand. However, if something goes \"wrong\" on the road (something as simple as a sharp turn) or if I even know to the driver to be capable of rage, I experience palpitations, tension, dizziness, and severe paranoia. I find myself holding my breath a lot, clutch on to door handles, and try to slam on imaginary brake pedals without realizing it. I\\'ve also screamed at cars behind us for honking; I don\\'t mean to, but it just comes out. After the trip, I find myself feeling completely drained and almost stunned... I usually have to sit somewhere quiet or lie down after. The symptoms often get worse because, again, the drivers causing this are offended by me not trusting them. I\\'ve been told that I\\'m making it hard for them to drive or distracting them, which makes me more afraid... it\\'s just a cycle. I\\'ve tried everything I could, but even when I freeze up and hold still, the driver notices the tension. I know there\\'s a pattern, but the unfortunate thing is that symptoms carry over to when I\\'m alone, or when the driver is someone else.\\n\\nThe problem here is that I can\\'t bring myself to attempt driving, and it\\'s getting worse. I\\'ve started to panic on quiet roads when it used to be just highways, and I get anxious even thinking about being at the wheel.The major incident happened when I was 15, so I\\'ve been able to put off driving until now... but this issue is making it hard to find jobs. I get anxious thinking about signing up for the written test (learner\\'s permit) and the thought of driving at all causes chest pain. I\\'ve tried looking at dashcam videos of calm driving, but I have to close the video every time. It\\'s just too much.\\n\\nWell, this post has been way too long. I\\'ll cut it here, but anyways... how do you start recovering from something like this? Driving is holding me back from a lot of jobs and opportunities... I don\\'t think I can hold off on this much longer. It just keeps getting worse.', 'So Ive been posting lots of anxiety related things on here recently. A few days ago my doctor advised me that my thyroid was above normal range, 5.03 to be exact. He says I have hypothyroidism. And will need to take meds most likely for the rest of my life. Its not that I dont trust him, because I saw the results and have a copy for my self, but I just want to get a 2nd opinion from a endocrinologist. \\n\\nSince the diagnosis I have started to now notice things like heat flash on the face, some mild headache, muscle pains the usual stuff that I just thought was my anxiety. I also now, have become more dependent on the Valium he prescribed me. Particularly because it helps alleviate the symptoms. \\n\\nIm sad a little, upset a lot about this. But kinda relieved that there is a possible explanation for every damn thing I have been feeling over the past 5 years. However, it also has breeded a new sense on anxiety, maybe these symptoms are made up because I focus on them too much, maybe not. I dont know, I jsut hope that with the right treatment I can eventually stop the valium and get back to somewhat normal life. Even if it is taking thyroid meds daily.\\n\\nI want to tank all of you for taking the time to read my posts. For offering advice, tips, or similar stories. There are truely good people in this world and I know a nice chunk of them are in this subreddit.', 'I was working as usual, when I started to feel pain in my chest. I\\'m used to random muscular pains (Lupus) and took some meds, and the pain went away quickly. But I got worried and just in case notified my parents. 20 minutes later, I was having another chest pain and my hands went numb, I panicked and screamed \"Hospital NOW\". A friend of mine stepped quickly ( everyone in the office is familiar with Lupus, and we all tough the worst [Lupus atacking the hearth]) so we hop in the car real quick. Almost fainting, we got in the car and I was just repeating \"Im dying im dying\" and stuff like that. We arrive at the hospital, me almost fainting, and we scream \"WERE THE FUCK IS ER\". Gates were closed but as soon as they saw us they let us in and helped me. The rest is fuzzy, but after a quick intervention I was stabilizing. Doctor discarded any hearth condition, and explained me I had an anxiety attack. He suspects this will be for life, I don\\'t know if I believe him, bums me out.\\n\\nWell, thats the story. I\\'m ok now. Shaking, and afraid of ever feeling that pain again. Swear to god it was gg. Things have been super rough lately in all matter personal, financial, and health. But this takes the fucking gold medal.\\n\\nSo... how do you manage to stop it when it gets this bad? Trembling, numbness, chest pain...  and I\\'m going to be like this forever now? ', 'So today I had a doctor’s appointment because my friend found a lump in my shoulder a while ago, and it’s slowly gotten bigger and more uncomfortable (I haven’t gotten it checked out before because of my anxiety and partially because of not having time). But today I was supposed to get it checked out. Fuck me though, my insurance company decided to do flip flops and assigned me to a doctor that I haven’t even heard of. So I couldn’t see my regular doctor today, and after spending quite a while anxiously on the phone to try and fix things, I decide to go to the urgent care down the street. Quite a walk for someone who hasn’t gotten out of the house in a few days.\\n\\nBut here’s where it gets more fun. I get there about a half hour after my initial doctor’s appointment was supposed to start, and I sign in. Wasn’t seen for another hour and a half, almost. The nurse puts me in a room, I wait for another 20 minutes for the biggest tool of a doctor I have ever had (and I’ve had a lot of docs in my life, believe me). He asks me what’s wrong, I tell him that I found a lump in my shoulder and that it’s kind of uncomfortable and painful, to which he says, “I don’t see nothin’” before asking me to take my shirt off or anything. So I take my shirt off, and he asks “what the hell is that? a bulletproof vest? take it off” in reference to my binder (I’m transgender). The words “none of your damn business” cross my mind, but I keep my mouth shut because I’m an anxious wreck. I try to get him to feel the differences in my shoulders (it’s only really noticeable if you touch them), so he squeezes them for about half a second and decides that he “doesn’t feel nothin’”, which is a bunch of bullshit. Luckily I got him to order me an ultrasound, but “they’re not gonna find nothin’”, apparently. So I have that to look forward to tomorrow.\\n\\nHopefully my anxiety meds actually work tonight when I’m hanging out with my friends. I feel so sick right now, like what the fuck is the point of doing anything at all if strangers, doctors even, think it’s okay to treat me like shit. It’s really hard to reach any sort of goals and to keep life going at all when these kinds of things keep happening.', \"Hi all, \\n\\nI dont really know what i'm saying here, so i'm sorry if this post makes no sense, or lacks all structure. \\n\\nI'm 28/m in the UK and have been suffering on and off with some form of anxiety since I was about 10.

I have also recently had my meds changed after being on the same ones for 2 years.\\n\\nPast few months, things have been the worst that they have ever been. I have been suicidal (including planning and writing notes to leave for people to find), but the constant exhausting anxiety is what is killing me.

However I am rarely able to employ them, as I get to such a state so quickly. I really want to start being able to help myself more as I cannot rely on the drugs. Does anyone have any ideas or experience with this? I want to help myself but I feel stuck. Right now i'm just in pieces, literally pulling at my hair and struggling to maintain my breath.\\n\\n2) I have had lots of ideas for projects to do while i'm off of work, and I research these things and buy the gear but my perfectionism stops me from doing it. I have loads of woodworking gear, art stuff, photography equipment, family history to research and books to read...but I can't take the first step towards any of it. I feel stuck in such a rut. \\n\\nI apologise if these made zero sense.

I called the pharmacy to refill it but they said it had expired even though I still had refills remaining.  No worries though, I talk to my doctor and she sends in a new prescription.  Absolutely no problem there, she did it immediately when I asked, she really is a terrific doctor.  But they (at the pharmacy) don\\'t process it or fill it for over a week.  I\\'m running out of medication, so I call to see what\\'s going on, and the pharmacy has placed it on hold for an interesting reason... because of \"how expensive it is\".  So now the medication that I NEED, and they were supposed to have, they haven\\'t refilled.  They say they can start refilling it now if I say so, even though they should have started doing that a week ago, or at least asked me that fucking question last week, but no--it won\\'t be ready until tomorrow and I will have to miss a dosage tonight.  This is the exact same medication that I have gotten from this exact pharmacy for almost a decade now.  Yet they didn\\'t think me renewing and refilling my prescription was an indication that I actually wanted my medication.\\n\\nOh and did I mention I have a midterm tomorrow morning at 8 A-fucking-M in the morning.  This is such bullshit.  How I feel tomorrow will be affected by my missing a dosage.  I\\'ve noticed it before when I\\'ve missed a dose, my emotions become very volatile.

Often times the professor will call on someone and they will be forced to speak in front of the class of 100 people about what we were supposed to read the night before. One professor will do this and stay on the person for 20-30 mins. I find it extremely difficult to just say my name in front of that many people so to have to improvise discussing what I’ve read and dealing with interrogation style questioning is almost unbearable (hasn’t happened to me yet). \\n\\n\\nI’m always terrified and get mini panic attacks when I think I might be called on. I have such an intense adrenaline rush that I cannot think straight, voice feels like it will tremble, and heart is beating out of control. This only happens the seconds before I think I’ll be called on. Before that point, I feel completely comfortable an anxiety free. I feel confident up until that point. I rarely if ever experience any anxiety in any other aspect of my life and never to the extent I feel in this situation. The surge of adrenaline I get would be what you would expect if someone were to randomly pull a gun on you and point it toward you. Its hard to perform under this circumstance. Part of what makes it difficult is that there is no out. If you are called on you are on the spotlight for a good amount of time and can’t simply pass or quit. \\n\\nI’ve always hated speaking in groups. In the past when I’ve had to speak in front of crowds I’ve had mixed results. Sometimes I’d do fine. Other times I would be overwhelmed with adrenaline. The last few times I’d take a xanax before the presentation and not have an issue. However, given the fact that I face this possibility of speaking every day I’d have to be taking xanax everyday which I do not want to do. Although I still get anxious, I find that I’m still able to voluntarily answer questions. I just can’t handle being out on the spotlight. I’m seriously considering taking some kind of meds though if there is something that can suppress my extreme involuntary adrenal response.

I remember my mom always being sick and never really knowing why (she didn't at that time either but finally found out when I was about 12/13), I remember always worrying about her and whether she would stop breathing at night (she would always snore very loud and choke like sleep apneia) I would lay in my bed at night and hope to god that she would live to the next morning, when I would get sick I would get worried and scared that I would die. I've always had a fear of death as long as I can remember. When I transitioned from Elementary to Jr. High School I remember my mom getting very sick to the point of needing to go to the ER where she was finally diagnosed with Chrones disease and due to the many years of her living with it, it had become very advanced and required multiple surgeries. \\n\\nGrowing up my mom also worried about my safety a lot, needless to say I was very sheltered and rarely got to hang our with friends or play outside very much as a result I was also one of the fat kids growing up and was teased and made fun of.. a lot.. in Jr. High they nick named my butterball.. this was incredibly hard on me and started my path of destruction as I call it, I remember always trying to diet even in Elementary school so I could be a skinny kid and have friends.. \\n\\nI've always been a person who wants everyone to like them and would change myself in order to do it yet after all those years I never had any panic attacks or anxiety as I know it today. In High School I started dieting to the point where people said I looked grey and sick but I still felt fat. I wanted to fit in more so I started smoking thinking it was the IN thing, it didn't help that my mother would by the cigarettes for me, next trying to impress people my dad's girlfriend son who was the same age as me was a bit of a trouble kid, one night we took his moms car for a drive and he ended up crashing it, that night destroyed the relationship I had with my dad. \\n\\nI got a job to pay off the damage but in turn ended up getting further into a hole, I tried smoking weed and now that I had money could do it but I didn't like it very much, one night my mother had the drug talk with me that changed my life, she told me about the drugs she did when she was younger and that she said it was fine for me to do them as long as I did them at home to make sure that if anything happened she would be able to help me. Now being a teenager with the invincibility complex I though this was great.... what I needed was a mother and not a friend, with this new found freedom I started experimenting with alcohol and harder drugs.. I tried mushrooms but never got into it, one night after work I was invited to a rave where I tried Ecstasy and that was it, I was hooked, it provided me the energy and the confidence to do what I wanted and get fit at the same time. The drug slowly took over me and I ended up doing it for about 1.5 years with a unknown amount, sometimes I try to figure out how much I did but can't. I also tried Acid but never really got into it. At age 18 while taking 'E' (Ecstasy) I had my first Panic Attack or perhaps a bad pill, I'm not really sure but it was the last time I took E, after that I would get chest pains and thought I was getting lung cancer from smoking and ended up having a couple more panic attacks and ended up quitting smoking too... I saw my Dr. at the time who said it's common for teens to get Panic Attacks and gave me an anti-depressant, I took it the first day and thought I was going crazy and felt like it was a mind control substance, this was caused by a class we had in high school called Career And Life Management where they brought in a speaker who was Schizophrenic and told his story to us. For some reasion this popped up in my head and I swore off medication and luckily for me the anxiety/panic attacks stopped as well. \\n\\nFast forward to 2009 and my daughter is born, things about me changed, H1N1 was emerging in the news and I got really sick around that time and I had a panic attack that I had the illness and was going to die.... but I would only get fearful if I got sick and never was bothered from Anxiety. \\n\\nNow fast forward again to January 2012, I was out with some friends and decided to smoke weed as it had been quite some time and we were having fun. We were drinking, smoking sheesha and I had a couple hits of the weed but nothing major, I went to sleep and woke up the next morning dizzy, thinking nothing of it I went home and continued to be dizzy for the next 2 days. Still dizzy I went to my dr and told her what was going on, she said it was something viral and it may take weeks to pass, I went home and did what any normal person does, Googled, all the signs and symptoms came up with a brain tumor, now most people can disregard this but what I didn't mention was that  my step-mother died from a brain tumor about 2 years after having my sister, the same age as my daughter was, that was it, that started everything for me, i was in and out of the hospital getting tests. back and forth to my dr to make sure i was ok and then the unthinkable happened, I received a prescription and was extremely cautious to take it but ended up doing so, either I was allergic to it or had an anxiety reaction cause it felt like my throat was swelling and I had a big lump that was getting bigger and bigger. well I went back to the hospital where they loaded me up with epinephrine and a slew of other things to make sure i wouldn't die and ended up diagnosing me with Anxiety. \\n\\nI've been living with the fear for the last 1.5 years now that the drugs have caused my Anxiety, Paranoia and Panic Attacks but my therapists think other wise...

I also have a lot of anxiety while driving and will often panic. \\n\\nI want to be able to go back to school but I don't want to go back without medication to help me, I don't want to go through all that again and honestly I don't think I would be able to.

I feel like I have issues that no one knows how to help. I sure as hell don't. I've been so negative my entire life that even though I try to talk some sense into myself and meditate it barely sinks in.\", \"I'm a pretty normal and happy guy. I've had some problems with  anxiety in the past but that's mostly gone away. I've never gotten professional help since it only was a minor annoyance. I've noticed that it's starting to come back.\\n\\nMy biggest symptom is general uneasiness. I get a cold 'pit' feeling in my stomach, like something is about to go wrong. It causes me quite a bit of distress at times. I can still function normally, it just isn't comfortable to be on edge like that. I worry about the 'what ifs' constantly whenever I'm in this mood.\\n\\nI've noticed that 90% of the time it happens in the late evening or night. I've been racking my brain trying to figure out what exactly is causing it. When I drink coffee later in the day, it makes it worse, but I get it on days where I haven't even had a sip.\\n\\nI've also noticed that I tend to get more emotional as the day goes on. At noon I feel great and at the top of the world but at say 10 PM everything... just gets to me more.\\n\\nI don't know if it's just me winding down from my day or having more time to think things through and reflect, but I'd really like to get to the bottom of this and learn how to level my mood and anxiety. I'm not really interested in therapy or medication at this point.\\n\\nAny advice?\", \"Hey all. I've been a long time lingerer (not a word, I know). My boyfriend and I both suffer from anxiety. He has been diagnosed and prescribed meds but I have not. My anxiety seems to come up unexpectedly, for what seems like no reason. Last month I was sitting in class and just got an anxiety attack. I went to my boyfriend's, he helped calm me down, gave me one of his meds and I fell asleep until the next morning. I was perfectly fine after that. I just want to know what causes these attacks. I had one again today what is what promoted me to post. I'm a college student so I know I'm under stress and what not but its never bothered me before. My dad has a lot of psychological issues (he is 100% disabled from the military for mental reasons). I worry about him and my mom a lot. And also, I'm a psych major. How do I not know how to help myself? So I know there are possibilities as to why I'm having anxiety. But I'm not thinking about these things when the anxiety happens. Just curious to see what some of you may suggest!\", \"Hey everyone. Im a 20 year old male who has been on every known SSRI because of depression and social anxiety. Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, Effexor, Remeron, and a few others i cant remember. I have been struggling with my social anxiety since i was 13 and i cant find anything that helps with it. By the way Benzo's are out of the question because I'm a recovering heroin addict, i used that to help with the anxiety and depression and just to get high, it worked a little to well. \\n\\nI just want to know if there is any type of medication you fellow redditor's have found that really helps that is non-narcotic? I just switched to a new psychiatrist to see if there is anything else that can help. I am on wellbutrin, 300mg's a day and it does nothing for the anxiety. Any suggestions?\"]\n"
