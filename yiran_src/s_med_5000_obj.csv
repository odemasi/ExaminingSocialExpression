New symptoms not present before:
-Pain in left arm (only began today) and it went away after a few hours, has not returned
-the feeling of something stuck in my throat permanently 
-my limbs go numb really fast when I sleep on them (never used to)
-very constipated(I get enough fiber and drink lots of water)
-my throat feels incredibly dry all the time even after a healthy dose of water throughout the day 
Returning symptoms:
-the feeling of my heart dropping in my chest 
-churning stomach as If I were nervous all the time
-shortness of breath

Last time this happened I had a handful of EKGs done and all looked fine, I'm keeping my meds and aspirin at hand when I sleep in case of emergency but this is driving me insane, I keep having paranoid thoughts of an impending heart attack.",['dobj'],-1
