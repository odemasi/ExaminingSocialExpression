Over the last few years I have babysat for several of my friends that have children (my husband and I do not have children, although we would very much like to. It just has not worked out for us yet.) I have a friend whose children are a bit out of control. The last time I watched them the two year old split her head open because she jumped off a box while I walked to the kitchen to get the older child (5 - boy) a glass of water. While trying to assess the situation the older child kept demanding that I take care of his needs (wanting a glass of water) with no regard to his sister at all. I called my friend to let her know what was happening, but instead of coming right home she stopped to have dinner with her husband making her hours later than she told me she would be back in the first place. This also ruined my weekend plans as I was planning on leaving town that night but that is a different story all together. I do have extreme social anxiety to begin with (which is part of the reason I find it near impossible to say no) I have also felt guilty babysitting for other friends in fear that it will get back to her. I know that most of my anxiety is irrational but I feel that in this one instance it is justified anxiety. I do not want to hurt her feelings, and especially as a non parent come off as judgmental of her children or her parenting. This last time she asked I explained that I was getting my anxiety medicine adjusted a few days before she needed me to watch them and maybe it would be easier for me. Honestly, I thought she would tell me not to worry about it and to just feel better and let her know if I am up to it anytime in the future. Of coarse that is not how it worked out. So I am here ranting :) If anyone has any advice, I would love to hear it. Otherwise, thanks for listening to me rant!! ",['nsubj'],1

I first went it wanting to treat my anxiety which has plagued me for a while but only recently got worse, and he prescribed me some meds. Since then each med I've tried has given me some side effect and when I go to talk to him he gives me another to try.

After about the fifth med he said lets just throw that all out and go for psychotherapy. Problem being, the area I'm in is extremely underserved for psychiatrists and therapists and I have to go with a hospital group that has pay on a sliding scale for uninsured/poor people, and the only one anywhere close is apparently booked for two months.

I've put thought into it, and I still want to attempt to treat it my anxiety with medication, if the option is still viable.

My question is: should I wait until a psychiatrist becomes available, two months from now and go talk to them? Or should I go back to the doctor and tell him I want to keep trying medication? Or, perhaps, should I try and find a different doctor in the area and get a second opinion?


The medications I've tried are

Fluoxetine: Horrible nausea: lasted all day and interrupted work. Though were I not working I might've been able to put up with it for a while.

Buspirone: Caused me increased heart rate and anxiety, headache and light headedness, though only once I moved up to 15 mg after starting out on a lower dose and gradually moving up.

Trazodone: Started at half a pill, moved up to full pill after a week. Caused me panic attacks right before bed.

Paroxetine: I don't actually remember why I stopped this one. Might've also been nausea, but I can't recall.

Cymbalta: Awful nausea and extreme drowsiness. Basically slept for two and a half days after one pill.


I'm currently taking clonazepam whenever I have a panic attack and just going about my daily life. But I'd really like to feel like I'm at least taking steps towards improving my life.","['dobj', 'dobj', 'nsubj']",1

Hey guys, I'm a victim of hereditary anxiety. I'm guessing the right term would be GAD because I have no reason to be anxious, life is going dandy for me. Nothing great, but nothing bad at all with it. And I was/am chronically anxious, every single day. One day it would be the shaky nervous anxiety, the next it would be the ""I'm about to throw up/diarrhea"" anxiety, and then the next would be the ""Where am I, why are the walls moving, am I in a dream?"" anxiety.

&gt;Anyway, I only took clonazepam because my mom had it on hand once when I was having a really bad attack and near forced me to take it. I was worried it would make me feel even worse. To my surprise, it worked. With no side effect other than feeling sedated a little bit. Now I know that clonazepam is not something you take everyday ( I mean you can.. ) but it's something more for emergencies/situational use. Plus I knew I was building a tolerance fast. Only after 5-6 dosages of 0.25mg's, what used to make me feel sedated and crash out now doesn't even affect me. So I had to get onto a maintenance pill. 

&gt;Paxil was my doctor's first choice. I don't know how many mg's the pill was but I took half before bed. I fell asleep, and within an hour I woke up like I was on crack. (I've never used before, I'm just assuming.) My whole body was one giant tremor, I stumbled to my parents room because I thought something insane was happening. They calmed me down and let met sleep on their floor in case I had more trouble. I just remember being eyes wide open and my mind just racing. I tried very hard to fall asleep, I closed my eyes and in what felt like a blink 1am turned into 6am and I was wide awake. I did not feel groggy, I didn't feel like I slept at all. The next day was spent not being able to close my eye lids for more than a couple seconds and constantly shaking a limb. Mentally, this medication made me feel like a zombie. I couldn't be depressed/anxious because I couldn't focus on what was making me sad at the time. In fact I couldn't think about anything for more than 2 seconds without my mind switching to some other topic. I couldn't be sad, but I couldn't be happy either.

This all was when I was about 17. Today I'm 20, near 21, and my anxiety has come back full force. But in a different way. Over the years I've noticed myself being sluggish, feeling like my brain wasn't on or something was wrong with me. But I didn't associate those feelings with anxiety since the only anxiety attacks I've had were panic attacks. Feeling nervous and shakey. Now my anxiety attacks are mellow but not in a better way. Everyday for a couple weeks I spent in bed feeling ill to my stomach. I was very dizzy and lightheaded, and confused at times. I had this feeling that you get right before you're about to puke and you want your mommy and daddy. The feeling that didn't know that paper was due or that the final was today. Constantly scared, but for no reason. I've been a vegetable in my bed for the passed few weeks. I never registered for classes next semester, because I couldn't even fathom going to class in the state that I'm in. And I've been avoiding going to work a lot. (I have a very tolerant and flexible boss and little financial responsibility at the moment, thankfully)

So I went back to the doctor, said I'm not having that Paxil experience again. He prescribes me Buspar. Many hate it or don't care for it, and little love it with a passion. It has many reviews, and they are so mixed. Some people it made nervous and even more anxious, some people said it made them pass out into a pool of their own drool, some say they hallucinated. But whether people said they hated it because of bad reactions, it did nothing for them and they think it's a sugar pill, or it was a miracle drug that turned their life around, they all had one thing in common. It made them incredibly dizzy. I absolutely did not want this, dizziness to me is like being on a roller coaster you can't get off of. And if I was dizzy, for sure I would be nauseous.

&gt; So, being so traumatized by Paxil and not wanting to be dizzy, I literally took a chip off the end of the 5mg pill(The lowest dosage it comes in and I only took half of a half, of a half) and tried to keep my mind off the potential side effects. I was on my phone when I noticed it sort of ""hit"". The phone's colors were a little more vibrant and exaggerated and everything just felt a little odd. Nothing enough to make me freak out yet. I then began yawning over and over for a good 5 minutes and felt like taking a nap, so I did. I woke up from this nap incredibly energized almost like I was on Paxil. But it didn't make me freak out like Paxil did, I just felt like I drank a ton of coffee and I could run 10 miles. My jaw was a little sore though, I think I was grinding my teeth while I was sleeping which has never happened. And while I was awake I caught myself chewing the inside of my cheek or my tongue quite a few times. But the anxiety and dizziness/confusion was gone. I thought to myself, this drug isn't addictive, it's very cheap and if I can build up a tolerance to where I'm not being shocked by overwhelming energy, then I'll definitely enjoy life again while on it.

&gt;This feeling lasted all the way until night time, but wore off a little. I actually had no trouble going to sleep though. The next day I was still feeling it (I know it has a short half life, but I've never had energy like this, I wan't to believe it was this med) and being at a lower level of unnecessary energy, I was feeling actually really good. No more confusion, no more dizziness, I felt almost euphoric. Grin from ear to ear. I thought to myself, ""Is this how normal people feel? Have I just been mentally suppressed my whole life?"" I did have a moment of sadness though, because I thought for a second about how this may not last. How tomorrow I may feel just as bad as I felt a couple days ago. I did not take a pill that day, because I still had a lot of energy from taking the crumb of the pill the day before. Needless to say, I was back to square one the day after. I took the crumb again, and the anxiety went away, I got really happy again and motivated, but the power rush didn't come back. It did give me energy, but not overpowering how it was before. Like mentioned above, I was in my happy place. The day after that is today. I took another crumb, a little bigger this time. And felt happy and motivated with no anxiety. Although this time within 7-8 hours the anxiety was coming back, where as it lasted 2 days the first time, and all day the second time.

Now I have an issue.. It's depressing me a lot to think that for me to be happy in life, that I'm going to have to take this pill every single day. That I'm not the reason that I'm happy, it's these pills. I'm not truly happy, it's just artificial. It's not fixing my unbalanced chemicals, it's synthetically boosting me and it's not natural to feel this euphoric. What if I forget my pills on a trip one day? Why can't I be happy.. by myself? These are questions that are sort of putting me down.","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1

I can't tell my parents because they wouldn't understand, and my mum is desperate for me to go because she thinks otherwise I won't do anything with my life - maybe she's right.

I have had longstanding problems dealing with depressive episodes and moderate social anxiety. When I got there, the anxiety and depression intensified greatly. On the surface, I was successful; I joined a fraternity, made friends, and aced 20 units of classes. But in reality I felt like I didn't have the support network to maintain meaningful relationships. I also had a roommate I didn't particularly care for, and as someone who was already very introverted and anxious, it was very difficult to ever feel calm considering that there were ALWAYS people around, even in the library. I had difficulty fostering my passions like playing guitar and writing because I felt that I could never do them without the privacy of my own space. A lot of times I would just lie in bed with headphones on and listen to music and pretend that nothing was there. I went to counseling for several months, which helped, but only depressed me further when I was cut off by the university and referred to an outside source. I visited a psychiatrist, who gave me general health tips and told me to get over the counter lithium. I didn't try it out of health concerns and reading about the risk of kidney problems online.

I decided to transfer back to go to a state university. I'm already so much happier now that I'm back home for the summer. I still sometimes feel very depressed, but it's mostly subsided compared to what I went through last year. I can just spend my days indoors drawing or playing guitar or reading. It's great. I hang out frequently with a few of my closest friends whenever it strikes me.

The problem is that while the depression went away, the anxiety didn't. It's hard for me to ask anyone outside of my 3 closest friends to hang out. Even replying to emails or sorting out my affairs for enrollment at my new university gives me intense anxiety spells. There are days when I can't leave the house because of the fear of having to ask someone if they want to get lunch. These aren't strangers either; these are some of my best friends for years. The problem is either A) big group gatherings, even if they are all friends, or B) individual meetups with people who I am only okay friends with. Either one of those scenarios results in me making a million excuses and then staying home. It's not even that I say no, it's that sometimes I just get so anxious I can't even reply to a text message inviting me to hang out. I haven't seen some of my best friends all summer out of this anxiety. Today, I was invited to one of my friends' birthday gatherings. I'm trying so hard to get the courage to show up. But I can already anticipate some of them asking me where I've been all summer, or what happened that made me transfer universities and I have no idea what I'll say. I'm still trying to decide if I should go, so if you have any advice on that end, let me know. I've always had this anxiety, but back in high school it was only mild to moderate. Ever since last year, it's been severe and never slowed down. I'm wondering if I should seek medications from a psychiatrist again, at least so I can get it under control in these types of situations and learn how to function again. I have no idea how these medications work or if it's worth starting up during a transition period like the new few weeks when I start classes. I'm honestly a little afraid of going back to classes in a couple of weeks; my anxiety might prevent me from getting help from others in my classes, or making friends at my new school. Any thoughts of advice?

tl;dr -- Got over depression, but social anxiety has intensified to the point where I can't leave the house, which I'm worried is going to make me more depressed. Advice?

Edit: One thing I'd like to add that I was just thinking about. I gave up drinking and smoking pot. It wasn't doing me any favors for either my anxiety or depression, and I was getting sick of feeling shitty because of it. My friends, however, didn't, and have very much ramped up their alcohol and weed consumption over the past year. Now every moderately sized social gathering seems to have drinking or smoking at the center of it. I don't have any problem with people drinking or smoking in a relaxed environment, but it's a little alienating for me to always be sober at these gatherings. I guess that's the nature of college though.",['nsubj'],1

I write really very eclectically, so I apologize if my  train of thought is not an easy one to follow. It's hard sometimes to sort feels.

I've been chronically depressed for about 8 years, with a rather severe anxiety disorder.

For years, I assumed the depression was the major problem, that the anxiety was just a part of it, I hardly even saw it as anxiety. When I was in college, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and at that point, I felt like someone had taken all my years of sorrow and just told me they were irrelevant, and that it was just anxiety. I had become so protective of my depression. It had and has made me who i am &amp; ultimately, I liked that person, and she wouldn't have existed without that depression and the anxiety. I know they didn't say 'just anxiety', but that was what it felt like, since I had no personal  conscious experience with it yet. My sad had been dismissed, I had to rethink a lot of things. But with a new look at my issues, and the awareness of my anxiety, I really saw what I had been going through, how persistent, and hellish and how somatic my anxiety and my depression had been. I remembered anxiety attacks, I remembered feeling helpless and just crazy, a little. But now, I could focus on that, I could focus on it because I knew what it was.

I have anxiety attacks sporadically. Sometimes I get them once or more a day, every day, sometimes once a week, sometimes once a month, sometimes every few days. Recently, I had gone 4 months without one severe enough to require my medication, I was really proud of that. The key was that I was with someone who made me feel valued, safe, comfortable, and happy. That's not something you can prescribe though, and it's something I was ridiculously lucky to find. Today, that changed, I woke up with an anxiety attack that didn't let up for hours on end. It hurt, I cried, I hyperventilated, I continued to cry, my mind snowballed everything out of proportion, and I couldn't speak anymore. The meds didn't help that time, I just walked into walls a lot and felt wobbly woozy.

I kind of looked back today, at what my anxiety has been like

I know many of you, like myself, know you're not alone in what you go through. It doesn't change anything. It's your anxiety, all I can do is be supportive and empathetic, and if you need me, I'll help. I don't know your anxiety, I don't know how deep it digs, how easily it gets triggered, and I don't know what else is at place, and where your mind takes you. 

It's my anxiety, it's mine and you might understand anxiety, but you can't feel mine. Telling me everyone goes through this makes me feel like my problems aren't mine anymore, that they're the problems of the rest of the world, and I am helpless to change them.

When I'm anxious, I knit.
When I'm anxious, I listen to rainy mood and Yann Tiersen REALLY LOUD.
When I'm anxious, I drink tea.
When I'm anxious, I do my make up.
When I'm anxious, I might need a hug.
When I'm anxious, don't hug me unless I ask, you might make it worse.
When I'm anxious, I burn white sage
When I'm anxious, I eat chocolate really slowly, I let it melt on my tongue, tiny piece after tiny piece.
When I'm anxious, I roll my eyes at myself and try to laugh at how hysterical I look.
When I'm anxious, I remember that I have managed to get through so many other attacks.
When I'm anxious, don't fucking tell me to stop being anxious.
When I'm anxious, I want to help people who are anxious, because it feels so alone, having an anxiety attack.
When I'm anxious, I dive heart first into books.

I'm lucky enough to have someone who is supportive of me, and who tries to help me through it, but that's not most people.

My mother is having anxiety/panic attacks.  I’ll try to keep it short.  She had an ear infection and the doctor gave her a prescription for hydrocodone but told her to use it sparingly because it is addictive.  Because she didn’t want to get addicted she then decided to use Klonopin for the pain in her ear instead.  (Yes, we know this was now a mistake.)  She was using the Klonopin for 2 weeks when she started feeling heaviness on her chest and that lead to panic attacks.  The doctor prescribed Zoloft 100 mg which made her feel awful and then Lexapro 10mg which also made her feel awful.  

She went to a new doctor.  This new one had her continue taking the Klonopin 0.5 mg three times a day and added propranolol to help with the heaviness in the chest.  They checked out her heart and it was fine.  Then she was switched over from Klonopin to Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day to help with the nausea she was experiencing.  She felt like “an elastic band that was stretched and then plucked” so they started her on Buspirone 30 mg a day.  This seemed to help a little.  Then they upped it to 45 mg a day and she had extreme nausea.  She can’t eat any food and only has protein like shakes for the past 5 days.  

They cut it back to 30 mg three days ago and the last three days have been hell.  She feels the most anxiety that she has ever felt and would do anything to get the pain to stop.  She is not suicidal, reports no depression and I am keeping a very close watch on her.

My questions:

What is happening?

The only meds she is on now is Buspirone 30mg and Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day.

Are these meds making her nauseas or is it her “nerves”?

She has tried Zofran, which didn’t work, phenegran, and reglan which both had “twitching” as a side effect.  She takes Benadryl which helps a little.  

Is she now addicted to the Ativan?

Does she need a different anti anxiety med?

I know that no one wants make medical advice without having more information but I really could use some guidance here.

Current Meds: Buspar 30 mg, Ativan 0.5 mg, Benadryl 50 mg 

Thank you so much in advance!

It got really bad about 6 months ago when I went to rehab. I had been on klonopin for my insomnia for about 4 years but I became very addicted to it and was on far above the legal dose. I was weaned off of it and over the months I became more and more paralyzed by fear. I have never known anxiety of this caliber ever before in my life until now.

I've tried alternative treatments such as biofeedback and other forms of mindfulness, yoga, supplements, etc. Nothing is providing lasting relief. I also see a psychiatrist for psychotherapy every two weeks and he is amazing. He does help some but it's not enough to get through the every day trials I deal with in regards to my anxiety. I asked him if he could prescribe an SSRI or something to take the edge off just for now but he refuses because I have been to rehab.

She and i had hooked up during the senior summer before i went abroad for a gap year and study. While i was there, she played me for 8 months and left me expecting to be a father that would be giving his child up for adoption. Low and behold it was all a ""practical joke"" and i was left with no explanations and some pretty severe mental distress and trauma that persisted for the next few years. I have suffered from physical anxiety attacks, cyclical depression for the past several years, but this experience elevated it all to a whole new level. It led to the general inability to trust someone in a relationship without inuring the aforementioned issues.

It has been almost 5 years since i have been able to trust someone enough to pursue a relationship. Previous attempts left me suffering with physical anxiety attacks that were an almost daily occurrence. Recently though, i have been able to move beyond those terrors and to ask a gal out for a date. She and i have been together a little more than a month and it was fun, but now she is incredibly distant.

She and i are going to talk next week once we are back from spring break, but in the mean time i am left with my thoughts and fears. It is absolutely terrifying me.

While i know that i'm probably freaking out about nothing, my previous experiences are weighing on my mind. I am terrified that something is wrong, not so much that the relationship might not be working out, but rather that she might be pregnant. I am having flashbacks to the last time before i went abroad and its tearing me apart. I dont know if this is something i can go through again. Even though the first time was all a lie, for 8 months it was very real.

It terrifies me that after receiving counseling and being treated for the physical anxiety that it could be happening all over again. My first time removing the barriers that i put up to relationships, not allowing myself to focus wholly on work and school, and that it could be happening all over again. I just dont know.
She and i will talk and im sure its nothing, but like i said, i cannot silence my fears. Although my medication has worked great for the past months i have been on it, i can feel the anxiety building and im worried ill suffer another large attack, im terrified.

The opinion of the professional was that meds could help, but doing as much natural remedies as I could before turning to them.  And I have; a healthy lifestyle is something I treasure, and probably keeps much of the feeling at bay, along with a dose of daily meditation.

But this last week has really sucked.  I'm a person with very high situational awareness; I sit by fire exits for example.  I always have; being a perfectionist and a lover of the worst-case-scenario, I prepare for it.  But this manifests as bad paranoia when my anxiety hits.  It's not unusual for me not to sleep well; but this past week has been a string of four and five hour nights.  Naps and working out have kept me going, but it's been rough!

So today  I ran even further than I usually do and hopefully exhausted myself enough that I will sleep better.

I know I am probably a newbie at this compared to many of you and haven't been suffering as long, but I'm truly starting to see what many sufferers of anxiety go through, and it is no me gusta!",['nsubj'],1

Among everything else I'm anxious about I also have a phobia of flying. I've been very scared of that for as long as I can remember.

I lived abroad for two years and during that time I had to force myself to fly quite a bit to visit family etc., and things got a little better. I got over my fear of airports after a while and even flying got a bit easier. Not easy but easier. I no longer panicked, even though I was still very anxious, and didn't really experience the physical symptoms of a panic attack.

However, a couple of years ago I had a bad flight and that completely ruined everything I had worked on (when it comes to the phobia) for the past three years or so. After that flight I was right back to square one. I think I might even be more scared now than before it got a little better. I've been avoiding all air travel since then.

Anyway, I unfortunately *have* to fly in the beginning of September and around Christmas and only thinking about it is enough to trigger a panic attack sometimes. I feel like I can't and won't set foot in an airplane unless someone drugs me so today I got some medication. The doctor prescribed 1 x 10 mg of oxazepam (maximum 2 per day). I've never taken anything stronger than beta blockers and hydroxyzine before (both for other kinds of anxiety). Certainly not benzodiazepines. I've got some questions that I hope someone might be able to answer:

- The doctor told me to try some medication at home to see what kind of side effects I can expect, so I'm thinking about trying one tomorrow. The thing is I'm not always super anxious when I'm at home so how will I know if it works or not?

- How do I know if 10 mg is enough for me not to panic when it's time to fly? I'm really worried I'll get to the airport and board the plane and realise that the medication isn't working. Then I will, seriously, think I'm going to die and thinking that you're going to die isn't pleasant so I'd like to avoid that.

Thank you.",['nsubj'],1

I'm still going to try my best though. I'm going to go to the gym, something that's usually familiar to me, even though as I packed my stuff, the thought of going outside and seeing other people scares the shit out of me. I can't get rid of that feeling of a knot in the stomach, and my heart is pounding.

I'm also going to go to class today after the gym. Last semester I skipped weeks of class because I felt terrible in the mornings and could not make myself go outside. Instead I listened to lecture recordings on my own but ended up doing poorly. But I'll take it easy today. I only have one hour of class in the afternoon, and two in the evening. Between that time I'll take a break.

Lastly, I am going to promise myself that I will be patient. I have been on two different types of medication since September, and I don't think the dosage is right for me yet but I won't stop trying. And if medication is not the right answer for me, that's okay, I'll try something else if it comes to that.

I was only told that it was caused by a build-up of stress. One day I realized that I felt strange, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Over the next 2-3 days I developed a migraine that wouldn't go away, a fogginess in my thoughts, tremors, and a stutter so bad that I couldn't effectively communicate verbally anymore.

Yesterday I woke up with a migraine that still hasn't completely gone away. I took something new that my doctor had prescribed (I get migraines 2-4 times a week). I felt foggy for the rest of the day and noticed slight tremors in my hands, but I didn't think much of it and dismissed it as side-effects. Today I've noticed that the tremors still haven't gone away. I feel like there are little vibrations through my entire body. The fogginess comes and goes. It makes it hard to focus on a single thought. I haven't experienced any stuttering, but I'm terrified that it's coming. Last time it took a little more than a month of constantly slowing myself down, reading out loud, and singing to work my way out of stuttering. It was absolute hell. It tanked my self-esteem when I had to speak to strangers (ordering at restaurants, etc.), and I felt like I was going crazy half the time.

I'm not sure if I'm still just experiencing side-effects or what is happening. It's not characteristic of my panic attacks. I trust my doctor, but I can't help wondering if my different medications are reacting poorly with one another. I take Bupropion for anxiety, something for blood pressure that I can't recall the name of, Tramadol for the headaches, and Gianvi (birth control).

Six weeks later, I went back to her and said I was having very strange symptoms/side effects this time: racing thoughts, terrible insomnia, hyperactivity, etc., all things that I'd read online might be associated with bipolar. She completely dismissed me, said those weren't real side effects of Zoloft, and then upped my dose to 100mg. Then last Friday--one week after she increased my dose--I had such a severe panic attack that I had to leave work and go to the emergency room, which has never happened to me before.

I'm really worried about what will happen if I run out of Ativan during the holiday weekend when I'm hosting my entire family for Thanksgiving.

About three years ago, I experienced (what I perceived to be) a life threatening situation, which caused me to have my first panic attack.  I have them maybe 5 times a year, and usually it's when I'm feeling very sick/exhausted/stressed, or when I'm stressed about a situation.  

When I begin to get anxious, I want to slow my breathing but it seems that when I try to concentrate on slowing and controlling my breathing, it sends me into full blown panic attack mode.  My attacks consist of rocking, severe hyperventilating, and my hands clench up, and my fingers go completely numb.  So far, the only thing that has helped is if someone rubs my back.  

What are other coping mechanisms you've found that work?  Controlling breathing doesn't help me, and I don't want to always rely on someone to be there to rub my back to bring me out of it.  I need to learn to start controlling them because my attacks are situational, and meds aren't really necessary at this point.

Well a couple weeks ago, my endocrinologist tested my TSH levels and they were low (hyperthyroidism), so he changed my medication (increased metformin and decreased levothyroxine), then I proceeded to go on vacation and LEFT MY ANXIETY MEDS AT HOME.
I've been on the edge of having a serious panic attack for a week now because I keep thinking I'm pregnant, even though in all rationality, I'm probably not. All the meds I'm taking mimic some of the side effects of pregnancy and I'm sufficiently freaked every time one of them makes an appearance.
I need a voice (or two) of reason. I'm going to college in the fall and I really can't deal with this right now, the idea of having a baby is terrifying and I don't know if I can ever have sex again, because this is really screwing with my mind.

I'm sort of selfish for being a sad sack about this and honestly, I'm a little embarrassed about that I'm so selfish and incapable of dealing with things like everyone else.

My GP put me on an SSRI when I told him everything, but I still usually feel generally bad most of the time. What's the worst though, are episodes where I'm more or less ""triggered"" to think about the relationship and can't stop dwelling on it or I see the ex (today). It just builds up and builds up and I end up cutting myself sometimes, or just sitting bawling like a baby in my room (quite embarrassing to admit) wishing I would just cease to exist. It feels genuinely horrifying. I have discussed this with my GP, but he just doubled my prozac. I have not noticed an improvement.

I am wondering if anxiety medication could be useful for when I have these episodes. They are absolutely terrifying. I'm not sure, however, if they are really ""anxiety attacks"" or if they're just times when I feel like shit. I sort of want to ask my GP, but I'm afraid of two things: 

1. I almost get the feeling he already thinks I am giant pussy for not being able to deal with the end of my relationship (I am male) and 

2. I am afraid of coming off as some dude that just wants to get high on benzo's or something. Technically, if I asked him ""I think I have anxiety attacks and I think anti-anxiety meds would help"" that is drug-seeking. But all I want is some source of help or something I can do to help myself during these times because they are pretty much a living nightmare.

Any sort of help or advice is much appreciated. The more practical, the better. This has been going on for 6 months and I really want to stop being like this...  Thank you.","['nsubj', 'nsubj']",1

Since last week I have been having terrible anxiety in my stomach. At the first time it didn't hurt me a lot but after 2 or 3 days it got really painful. I couldn't sleep at night and my left eye started to jump. When I got to the doctor he told me you need endoscopy but I did that last year and there was no problem in my stomach. finally I couldn't get to work and wasn't sleep yesterday. Last week I got Ashwagandha which was very good and help me to get calm and sleep well but It doesn't work anymore.
This is very very painful and depressing problem. Thank you if you guys know any medicine can help me.",['nsubj'],1

I am on medication for depression and have emergency medication for panic attacks/severe mood swings. So far the mood swings are definitely getting better but not yet nonexistent. As for the anxiety: I am afraid to go out of the house, but it's only overwhelming when I have to take public transport. The big ""what if something happens"" is always the center of my thoughts, even the night before. I usually end up talking myself out of going. I had to quit my first job because I cried in bed every morning, but in this case I wasn't exactly anxious. I loved my job. But for some reason, even the thought of going stressed me out so much that I couldn't take it anymore. High school was even worse; I managed to get my diploma by the skin of my teeth. 

I am in my third round of anxiety therapy, which hasn't seemed to work well in the past. I try to utilize the skills they teach, but somehow the anxiety still takes me over. Anxiety medication is the last resort (again), and I'm kind of hoping they end up putting me on some type of mild sedative, so I can at least do some type of work. I would love to continue doing what I was doing in my old job. 

I just have a few questions and I'm really hoping you could answer them for me. 

I feel like I'm being misunderstood in therapy and in my sessions with my pill doctor (not sure what her title is?). How can I explain myself better to make sure I'm getting my point across correctly?

Does anyone else get these mood swings like I do? They only happen at night, and it comes on as only a slight sadness or anger but then it escalates and I feel restless/incredibly moody.

Lastly, what can I do about dreading to go to work? Eventually I want to go back to my job and start college, but I know I am going to feel the same way all over again. My family thinks I am lazy and they constantly nag about me getting a job. It's not that I don't want to. It's because I can't. 

Thanks for reading this huge post! Feel free to share your similar experience. I'd love to read it and know that I am not alone. ",['nsubj'],1

I usually spend a good portion of the day worrying, but not EVERY second. I know I can't get better by myself, but the thought of being on medication and having it not work scares me to death. What else is there to do if no medications are able to help me improve.

The only medications I've tried seemed to kill my emotions EXCEPT for the anxiety.

It's frustrating to talk to anyone in real life because I don't want it to seem like I'm whining. Everyone has problems, I would rather have my family think I'm ok than have them worry about me or think I'm being a baby.

I am currently on Effexor (150mg daily) Lamictal (200mg daily) and Trazadone for help sleeping (100 mg)

I have tried many benzos on and off from doctors over the years and they are no longer affecting me the way they are supposed to.  After taking Xanax, I feel intense grief.  After taking Ativan, I almost become a different, mean person.  It's weird.

The only benzo that has relieved my suffering is Clonazepam, and I have developed a tolerance to that medication due to using it daily to help me get through my last partners suicide.  The medication still works, but only at high doses (3-4 mg) my psychiatrist doesn't like the idea of giving it to me on an as needed basis because of its long half life, and while I understand the point he makes, it's also hard to accept because it was the only thing that helped me through my darkest moments and panic attacks.

The ativan and xanax were giving to me by this same doctor to see how it went.  I cant contact him now because he is out of the area for another few days.

I don't know what else I can do... right now I feel so sad from the xanax.

I know all about the best sorts of therapy, breathing ect.  I went through a week long 8 hour group therapy session for attempting to commit suicide over a year ago, but none of the techniques are helping the pain of anxiety in my head and belly and my racing thoughts.

Does anyone else have any ideas on what I can try?  I'm trying 4 step breathing, thinking rationally in my head, ect.  but the feelings just wont go away.  I am at a loss.

He said the tingling is probably just compressed nerves, gave me some exercise techniques. He answered all my worries fully so I could comprehend them.

Diabetes? Artery disease? Nope and nope. What about my kidneys? They hurt sometimes. He told me to sit up straighter. The pain went away immediately. Come to find out, kidneys aren't as low as I thought they were. 

So he talked to me about anxiety. First I'd ever heard that that could be my problem. We agreed that I'd try to handle it on my own.

About three months ago I went to the hospital. I was feeling weak in all my limbs for weeks, but that day it wouldn't stop and felt like it was creeping up into my face. I noticed that as soon as I was put into a room and was being attended to, I felt fine. I wondered then if that was my anxiety. Of course, the physician found nothing and sent me on my way.

Then the breathing problems happened. It would be like an elephant sitting on my chest, or that someone had shoved cotton into my lungs. The only thing that kept me sane during these episodes was realizing I was getting plenty of air. 

Then things that normally never bothered me would trigger these episodes. My mom wanting to do nothing but smoke while we were suppose to be out together, leaving her butts in a bottle sitting in my car. My snarky sister and her rude comments. My boyfriend's jokes and tricks. It all became equivalent to nails on a chalkboard for me and would cause my breathing to become a problem. 

Then one night I felt like I literally couldn't breathe. The next night I would try to calm down and sleep through the feeling but if I stopped thinking about it, I'd forget to breathe. I'd feel sick upon realizing I wasn't breathing, then gasp for air. The next morning I went back to my doctor. I was scared they wouldn't be able to put me in which made the drive worse. But as soon as I walked in there and was told to come back a little later, I immediately felt better. 

I love my doctor. He is the best. Answers all my questions and fears in ways I would understand. He gave me citalopram and xanax to take while I waited for the few weeks it would take for the citalopram to start working.

When I first took citalopram, the generic version of Celexa, I had my first real panic attack. My heart hurt and felt like it was beating out of my chest. I got hot and sweaty immediately. It scared me so much. I took a xanax. Felt better. Haven't had anything like that since.

A lot of side effects wore off as the weeks went by and the medication worked it's magic. 

For about a week and a half, after the meds had time to set itself, I felt amazing. I felt like my old self. Little things didn't aggravate me or cause me to have anxiety attacks. I didn't feel sick anymore. Things that greatly annoyed me that didn't before didn't bother me.

But not anymore.

My symptoms and anxiety aren't as bad as they were before, but I want to feel like my old self again. I miss it. I don't like getting upset and ruining my boyfriend's fun or feeling like I have to deal with how my sister and mother make me feel. I still sometimes have problems breathing and if something greatly aggitates me I have to take a xanax. I go back to my doctor in a couple days. I just hope that that week and a half wasn't a one time thing.

I just want to go back to being happy. My old self.","['nsubj', 'nsubj']",1

I've had anxiety for some years now and it feels like I've come to a point where I should really try to get some help.

Some history. For some years ago I had an operation and something bad happend while I was under narcosis that nearly costed my life. After that I got anxiety and got panic attacks thinking that I couldn't breath and all that stuff.

After some time it actually got better, atleast I thought but it seemed like my anxiety just took a new shape.
Now I got problem with eating because I think it's gonna stick in my throat and block my airways and because of that just eating a simple sandwich can take me 30minutes of hard struggle trying to breath, drinking lots of water and just chewing and chewing untill the food is as small as it can be.

I've also noticed that it's just got worse and worse because before when it started I could eat a whole pizza with some struggle but now I can barely eat 1/4 of a pizza and with that I will definitly have a panic attack.

I've been to a psychologist before for this a year ago but I was stressed and didn't feel like I had time to get help also I'm really scared of doing the treatment because he wanted to treat it like phobias.

The way he wanted to treat it was that I should eat something simple and then just continue with harder and harder task at a slow pace, but I just can't seem to do that.

It's really having a big impact on my life as eating can take a hour and I might only eat half a plate even though I'm hungry and at the same time that hour is filled with torture and death thoughts.

Because of this and some other circumstances I think I've started to develope some minor depression as I really have a hard time keeping myself motivated, I get irritated with my family and I basicly feel less joy from things.


Well that's the end of my rant, I guess that I really should try to get some help but I guess I just want a push in the right direction. 
Do you think getting medication can be a good start?

In the past four years, my anxiety and depression have totally subsided and I have learned to control any mild anxiety moments I might have. But in the past four months, I've totally changed. Up to multiple times a day, I feel sick and so anxious. My stomach goes in knots, I get sweaty and light headed and I can barely move, think, or speak.

Before I met my girlfriend I had such bad insomnia. I'd get such little sleep most nights and my life just felt like a blur. After panic attacks when I was a kid and the stress my parents caused me I'd cry so many days through middle school and high school. I never felt as ""alive"" as I wanted, just that everything I did was an automatic response.. And my mind would race always, I'd never have a moment of like relaxation. My heart always beat so fast and I constantly felt like I was wasting time or I felt nervous. But when I met my girlfriend. I could finally be myself. I slept so soundly. I felt alive, I appreciated so much more in life. I made all the improvements I wanted and moved past my self image problems and anxiety. I felt so deeply in love and happiness. I looked forward to every day.

Now that I'm in college, and we go to different schools... It's all just come back, all of those problems. And I feel like a robot sometimes, or in a haze, and I'm just not myself. I love her immensely and I can't ever lose her. I want to be a good boyfriend and never mean or an ass but my emotions just make me someone I'm not and I'm trying to get a better hold of them. 

I had tried marijuana awhile before, in high school, without her knowing... I thought she'd think I was cool (I was a naive teenager) but she was so heartbroken when she found out. After I did it once, I felt really great about my life. And not just during the high, after too. It was such a mind opening experience. I realized after getting high a few weeks later, through some introspection that I needed to stop. I had talks with her about it while I was doing to see if she'd think it would be okay. She was sort of negative towards it but I just listened to myself, she had to be okay with it! So, I did it anyway, ""how could she and so many people have such a negative opinion of something so good?"". 

I felt like marijuana clicked with my brain more than most, I was so ecstatic, it felt amazing, unreal. It was almost a religious experience. What?? I thought stoners were just like loser skateboarder/video game playing teenagers who did badly in school. I felt like I had finally reached my potential. The couch locking mind numbing effects? None of that.. My mind was alive. I later found out this was a ""sativa"" strain, which are very stimulating.

Wow, I never knew about any of this. I always wanted to try marijuana, but I never wanted to do it often. I have read so many positive things about it, so I decided to try it. I knew the risk of addiction was relatively low and it was more of a habitual/dependency thing (which I guess is a lot like addiction). But I have good self control, I could go without anything I think.

But now for the one thing I can't go without. My girlfriend. We had never had a single problem, argument, conflict, ANYTHING besides about marijuana. She just had very strong opinions against it, and I really made a huge mistake there, hiding something from her. There's nothing else I'd hide from her, I love her with all my soul. When I went off to college I felt depressed, anxious, almost suicidal. My grades weren't the best. I didn't have many friends, I didn't like what people did on weekends. I got stressed out when my girlfriend went out on weekends, and I wasn't being as good to her as what she deserves. My girlfriend suggested I see the counsellor. I did, and I realized I just have to help myself, but that she (the counsellor) would help me accomplish that.  We made some progress, but after the happy talks I always felt sad a day later. After a month of meetings, my counsellor said I don't seem like I need to meet regularly anymore, and that I was welcome to come back whenever.

Now, I knew people who go on medication for anxiety+derealization/depersonalization+depression but I feel that I hear so much about those medications leaving the taker unfulfilled, with a void in their life. That there are side effects of derealization, depression, suicide, emotional numbing. I'm very emotional and I don't know if that's always a bad thing, I would only want my anxiety and sadness to change. People who use hard drugs to cope with problems never turn out well. And alcohol and tobacco can lead to a lot of mistakes and regrets. 

My girlfriend kind of brought up, ""well if you want to try marijuana again, and be honest about it, that would be okay."" She is so amazing and understanding. I had vowed to never try marijuana again, I loved it but I'd take my girlfriend over it any day. I thought maybe her idea could work, and now that I don't have to hide it from her we won't have any problems.

Well, I tried it again (a different type of it) and it wasn't the same mind blowing experience, but it completely lifted my depression off, and threw away my anxious thoughts. The problem was she was really upset before and after I did it again. And the next few days were great, well.. after the first few hours where she was sort of down about the whole thing. I was never a mean person again, our relationship got along very well, we opened up to each other more and have more intimate talks over long distance. The next weekend rolls around and I figured ""well she's going out with her friends, I'll see if it's okay with her if I try it again."" And it upset her that I brought it up, and we talked for a long time with her being distant, and she said ""it's okay just do it I don't want you to be sad."" And over the week she kept telling me ""it's okay, you can do it, it's you not me"" and I know that she's just saying that, but deep down it upsets her. And I definitely can't allow myself to continue doing it if it upsets her, I just don't want it to upset her.

We've been together for a year, and have a better relationship than anyone we know. We talk about marriage and making it through college together all the time. She's going to try to transfer to my school next year. All of our other friends long distance college relationships have failed but ours. Now, I just don't want to sound like a stoner or loser. I am really on the right path, since I lifted my depression, I rose an F in chemistry to a B+, got A's on my engineering assignments, calculus assignments, English papers. I worked 14 hours on homework on a Saturday! And I did pretty much 12 hours of work every 5 days for the next few weeks. I made 10$/hr online, I gained almost 10lbs of muscle from working out, I finally lifted more than I did when I played football in high school. I made new friends. I had a big appetite for the first time in my life. This was my big rebound from where I was. I rarely had even spent 2 hours on homework in a night of high school, or ever studied for a test, and I was an A student taking AP classes with a high SAT score! I now do a weeks worth of high school homework/studying in a night, if not more. But I liked it! My friends who were off at different and sometimes more prestigious colleges than me tell me they party on weekdays and never do homework. Their parents are so wealthy, millionaires, and they're expected to do the same with success? No way, the generation of hard working parents has led to lazy and unmotivated children. So now I see myself, a once passive good student, now doing better and working way harder than all my friends. It feels great, and me and my girlfriend are working so hard in our classes so that we have a great life ahead of us.

I know marijuana isn't this cure-all magic drug. But it's helped me. And it still upsets my girlfriend whenever we talk about it or I say I want to do it. I tell her every time she's upset I will quit and never do it again, but she doesn't want me to go back to being sad. I know in the end that I have to just help myself, but this has helped me do that and whenever I show her the literature on it or explain how much better I've been doing she gets upset. Every other moment we're not on the topic, life and our relationship is amazing, perfect, but it's on both of our minds all the time now. Is there any way I can make her comfortable with this or find some compromise? Or am I just a druggie and need to drop this little habit and help myself? I want to know what to do, because all of my options just seem like they will cause a lot of conflict. 

Thank you so much for reading. I know this doesn't take the place of a therapist or actual counsellor but it would be nice to hear some opinions.","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1

As you may have guessed, I've had some sort of anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember (10+ years), have been in unsuccessful on and off counselling, tried Prozac, Zoloeft, Cipralim, all to no effect. They literally could have been placebos for all the good they did.

On Monday I worked up the guts to go to a doctor, had in a letter I'd written (physically am unable to speak in certain situations) and just walked out with a new prescription. I did some reading online and as it turns out I've been given another SSRI. I'm developing the belief that SSRIs don't work on me. I will still take it though, because I don't see what harm it could do...

Except of course if it has bad interactions with other drugs I use off-label. Mostly illegal stuff that I wouldn't dare tell my doctor about. I've asked people in r/drugs and similar places who assured me I'm gonna be okay, but still.

To clarify, this ain't a case of 'oh I feel like shit for a few weeks'. It's a case of 'If I had the willpower and guts, I would end my own life right now if it wouldn't upset my mother'. That's how we're talking. And the anxiety is debilitating. I have a job but struggle immensely to get through each and every day, and definitely cannot hide any of this from anyone. Wouldn't be too surprised if I had other mental disorders that were never diagnosed  too.

So. Anyone have any notable experiences of Paxil? Especially coming from people who don't find other SSRIs useful? Or is it just a fact that meds can only do so much when my head is full of screwed-up thinking that can't even be changed by understanding logic?",['nsubj'],1

Occasionally, I will feel kind of euphoric (but still completely rational) which is what they call hypo-mania. About two weeks ago, I was perfectly fine. I went for a walk with my husband after a productive day and amazing dinner with the family. We got back home and sat down to watch Game of Thrones. At one point, there was an overabundance of nudity. Now, I have put on a lot of weight since being depressed and am no where near as attractive as them. I instantly felt depressed and shut down. It was like a light switch. I spent the next week not really communicating, interacting, and crying fits on and off. I had a constant burning in my stomach and tightness in my chest. I instantly felt jealous and completely worthless at the sight of any woman. The thought of my husband looking at porn or naked women sent me into panic attacks with huge 1 hour long crying spells. Things intensified over the next two weeks. Nothing would help, except when I had sex with my husband... somehow that would make it better for a little while. I also had some pretty severe insomnia. 

Things came to a head this past Friday. I woke up just fine. My husband took the day off of work and we were going to watch a movie while our daughter was in school. I started feeling bad right before we left and it progressively worsened. It is like a sinking feeling in my stomach, that turns into a burning, that feels like I can't breath, then the tears start and I feel physical pain. Over the next couple of hours, it got worse and worse. By this point, after 11 days of pure depression and cycling anxiety and panic attacks, I was feeling desperate. I began to fixate on the thought of inflicting pain on myself to release some of the emotional pain (which I haven't done in 15+ years. I was also wishing I could just go to sleep forever so I wouldn't have to feel this way any more. I asked my husband to go to the hospital because I just couldn't take it. I was place on a 5150 (psych hold) over night. It was terrible. I had a panic attack that lasted for the rest of the day, into the night, and until 11am the next day. They gave me ativan which knocked me out for a couple of hours, but everytime I woke up I would be sobbing and not stop until I was knocked out again. I was allowed to go home Saturday afternoon. The psych on call said he didn't think I would benefit from being admitted, nor was I ""bad enough."" He recommended a partial hospitalization... basically treatment M-F from 9am to 3pm or so and then you go home. It is 3-6 weeks. You see a psych once each week, and a therapist 3 times each week. I felt I desperately needed this. 

I should also mention that I can't see my psych until June 8th and that the meds she suggested I adjust over the phone haven't been working. Also, I see a therapist each week, but today will only be my second appointment (I only started to see her once things got bad... shit move on my part, I know) so I don't know how much help that will be.

However, the last day and a half I am better. I still have a low burning in my stomach, but it occasionally goes away. I haven't had a crying fit in about 3 days. I still have insomnia pretty bad though. However, I'm still depressed. Not quite so severe, but I just spend a lot of time in bed. 

Also, because of how it provided me release, I am kind of addicted to sex now. I obsess over it. I am masturbating a ton. It's bad, I know. It just works better than all my pills. I have never been diagnosed with anxiety before, but I have brought it up to my psych. A bunch. And the one before her. I get some bad anxiety, but it has never been *crippeling.* It has affected my day to day life, but has never been like this. My doctors just keep writing the anxiety off as a part of the depression associated with bipolar. However, I am now CERTAIN that I have a separate issue along side the bipolar that MUST be addressed. 

Okay, so now after my ginormous wall of text with my life history, my question is, since I'm feeling a bit better, should I not go through with that intensive therapy? It seems like it might be overkill now, but somehow the weekly therapy and monthly psych visits don't feel like they will be enough. Additionally, ever since Friday, my husband has been seriously babysitting me and staying home from work. Which I am grateful for, but I feel guilty. Especially since I am a bit better. Maybe his constant presence is what makes it better? I don't know. I also feel like I'm just cried out from Friday/Saturday. Emotionally exhausted, if you will. 

What do you think? I'm assuming/hoping many of you will have much more experience and may be able to make a suggestion?",['nsubj'],1

I'm very afraid to take medication. My boyfriend disapproves of it because he doesn't want me to experience any bad-side effects. I'm afraid people will look at my differently if I accept it. I'm afraid some permits will get taken away from me. I'm afraid I might get zapped into a hollow numb person. I don't want to not feel, I just want to stop constantly panicking. 

This morning I was convinced that my boyfriend didn't love me because he didn't have a retort when I told him a cute comment about our relationship and I've been thinking about it all day long. 

Please, someone tell me that the meds don't make you numb. I want to feel happy, and I want to feel sad when it's okay to be sad. But I don't want to panic anymore.

I tried *so many times* to meditate over so many years…but it was so difficult and it never got easier to do, even though when I was doing it regularly there *were* clear benefits to my mental health.

I used to hang with a yoga/meditation-type crowd and *everyone* had awesome daily practices. When I’d talk to them about my difficulty meditating I got patronizing responses like “it’s difficult for *everyone* you just have to keep doing it until it gets easier” [sub-context, have the will-power I did and someday you will be as awesome as me].

I felt really, really bad about myself. Here is something that clearly would help me…that everyone else I know can do…and somehow I just couldn’t do it. 

A few weeks ago I started taking medication for anxiety/depression. The first time I sat down to meditate after the medication started to kick in I was amazed…at how *freaking easy* meditation is now. I can’t believe I thought everyone was so much “better” than me for being able to do this…if it was always *this easy* for them…I can’t believe everyone (including myself) thought I was *that* unable to sit with myself when most (although not all, of course) of the difficulties came from a chemical imbalance.

I guess what I’m saying is…if you are someone who is able to meditate regularly, I tip my hat to you, and I hope that it helps you in whatever ways that you need.

I quit mainly for my family, health, and to better focus on my career. 

After it started getting in the way of life in general I sought help through my health care provider in the form of therapy, attending an ""anxiety clinic"", and being put on various SSRIs and benzos to help curb the general anxiety and panic attacks.   I've been in treatment now for a year, I feel like i'm getting nowhere with it, in fact I feel like I'm getting worse.  I'm constantly wracked with indecision, regret, and illogical thought patterns ... thoughts that I'm fully aware are illogical but I can't shake them nor can I seem to just rationalize my way out of them even though i'm FULLY aware that these thoughts hold now weight in reality.

The meds didn't work, well they did help with the anxiety, but so far the SSRIs I've been on all make me horribly depressed ... but hey they stop the panic attacks!  I'm currently on NO medication because my last round of Lexapro wanted to make me kill myself.  I'm still in therapy ... and it's a nice place to express my thoughts and I find it insightful, however I just can't make ""talking"" about and ""rationalizing"" these worries and illogical thoughts remove the constant association of anxiety and severe panic that come along with the thoughts merely entering my head.

Has anyone not found these traditional methods of treatment successful?  I'm at the point where I'm becoming fully frustrated with the process, my anxiety is the top thing on my mind when I wake and the last when I go to sleep ... and I feel like I have no end in sight.

Love this sub! (TL;DR at the bottom)

Background: I have generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks and have had this diagnosis for about two years (longer undiagnosed). I've been off my happy pills (Zoloft) for almost a year now. I hate huge social situations where you have to make small talk or if you are on ""display"" for people to see/judge. It'll send me into panic attacks before and during the event.

Event: My grandmother-in-law's 90th birthday party - yay, a large social event full of people I don't even really know that I'm not even related too! Yay. And many of the people in the family (my husband's) are loud social people. But not even the fun type of social people who get you to relax - they're just obnoxious at times and off-putting with their lack of intelligence or general arrogance. Thankfully I was involved in some of the planning and had the forethought to make the party work for me rather than the party working me. 

I offered to make a floral arrangements for the tables - that was ignored. Thanks. Then I offered to make a photo guestbook because it was going to be the ""gift"" and I'm a terrible gift-giver. That idea was given high praise because this family is into pictures - great! I can work with this! I gathered numerous family photos to make the book and as I did I realized that this family can't take a snapshot worth crap.

Side story: As someone who took photography in high school (we had a darkroom and everything) I know a thing or two on how to set up a good shot (looking back now I see why I found the B&amp;W dark room soothing - didn't have to deal with muchless see people lol). I also can't stand bad photography - check the background for the love of God!! No one wants someone derping in the background!! 

So it dawned in me - I'll be the photographer! Yes, I'm having to talk to be people, but I'm not really in the spotlight because I'm behind the camera. And I'm telling them what to do! I'm in control! Also, I can run off and go take pictures of people -- or things -- rather than having to make small talk. ""Ooops sorry! Duty calls!"" And then at the end I can make another photobook for Grandmother-in-law and be the hero! Best advice: find a way to take control of the situation that makes you happy or uses your gifts and talents. I feel lucky I was able to do that in this situation. Not ever situation lends itself to that.

So how did it go and what did I do to survive?

Pregame: Honestly, I probably should have taken small bottles of liquor with me to take the edge of since meds are no longer a thing for me, but instead I pregamed with my crochet (like knitting). I sat in the car (we got there early) and crocheted for a while. I knew I couldn't do it there, but I still slipped my yarn and needles into a bag just in case I needed to peal off and calm down. It's my soothing hobby and keep me from twitching too much - I hate being a twitcher. 

Event: I got to work right away. Taking pictures of the cake, table settings, etc. Forcing people to pose together (yes, evil me came out because I was in control ""no you move there, and you get a little closer, that's it!""). Everyone was behaving themselves and being over all pleasant. It was kinda weird. 

Then it happened. The ONE person who I could go the rest of my life without seeing shows up. We'll call him Walter. 

Back story: A few Christmases ago the family friend Walter was dumped on me. That Christmas I was going through some health issues and didn't feel good. I didn't even feel like moving and thus I fell prey to Walter. Now Walter is generally harmless, but he's a very loud, very annoying man who has an extreme case of aspergers. And before you accuse me of anything, I'm a teacher, I work with all kinds of kids and the aspergers are usually my favorite. But Walter does not even take the bluntest of cues - yes you just have to be blunt with aspergers. The other thing too is how I would treat an aspergers kid in my classroom does not look socially acceptable (you have to be blunt and it doesn't look nice, but there are small social cues that are lost on some aspergers kiddos). It's a hard card to play at a social event like this where you have to be socially polite and I didn't want to have to deal with it! He's a nice guy, but it was neither the time or the place for that kind of stress. And I've been scarred by a previous experience of endless hours of tedious conversation (I'm not a talker).

So Walter walks in - avoid, avoid, avoid - and it's perfect because I have a task to perform. I'll avoid as much as possible, but then he is invited to sit at my table. I noped out of there because I had pictures to take and it was almost cake time! A few times there was just nothing to take pictures of and so I had to sit and be social. I did my best to be polite and when it would get to be too much I would go take pics or skip out to the restroom - lipstick had to be reapplied!

Thankfully the event was taking place in a large building with a lobby near the bank of elevators. And as all people with social anxiety know the cell phone reception is always better in the lobby away from the party. I sat down for a while and did things like checked reddit, texted family, and I also had a friend on stand-by who is my go-to. If I need to get out of anything she will call me with a great excuse - and she's creative - to get me out. I seriously think she should loan out her services!

Having a ""get away"" place really helped in not only avoiding Walter, but also helped to calm me when I felt like it was too much. Coupled with a productive and creative task it was a much more bearable situation. 

Honestly, it was a miracle that I didn't have any type of panic attack although I felt one coming on that morning. Thankfully I was able to fight it off. But I learned that I have to make things work for me and not let things happen to me. 

Postgame: Today I am chilling at home with my pups. I have played around on reddit, written a few lesson plans for the week, and I'll probably put on Christmas music and decorate. It's my re-charge day. I have found it is so important to give yourself time to recharge after large social events. If I don't I will burn out and it's not pretty -- major panic attacks and hugely obsessive and unwanted thoughts.

Conclusion: Went a whole lot better than I could have imagined! I feel like I'm making huge progress with my anxiety! I still can't believe I didn't have a panic attack! It's so weird!

In summary, here's what I learned helped me:

* Involve yourself in the planning of the big event if possible (not always) to make it work for you. Use your talents to create a task for yourself on your terms. But don't give yourself more than you feel comfortable doing. Remember to make it work for YOU and not work you up!
* Pregame a bit - find a pregame task that is going to sooth you - jam out to music, go for a run, focus your attention on a hobby. Avoid obsessive thoughts about what is about to come - that always bites me in the butt.
* Give yourself ""outs"" - like what was suggested from an earlier post make an appointment or have plans that you have to ""rush off"" to. I think having my friend on speed dial as backup helped me even though I never used it. Allow yourself to ""disappear"" if you need. Find a quiet place and ""take a phone call."" Or as one of my high anxiety coworkers says, ""use the excuse of explosive diarrhea - it's too personal and is never questioned!"" I don't like hanging out in bathrooms, but given the alternative it is only a little crappy! 
* Come prepared with a few topics that you feel comfortable talking about or questions to ask people. I find this makes the small talk go smoother. Something I've been doing for years.
* Postgame a bit too: Relax and be alone. Let out a panic attack if needed (I've learned how to hold them in), or participate in your pregame soothing activity. 

I hope this helps someone out there. I find that I get a lot out of reading other people's experiences because I don't feel so alone. Again, I want to thank everyone on this sub who have been so helpful to me and to others. This really is a nice bit of therapy. 

TL;DR Went a large social event, Grandmother-in-law's 90th birthday party, and using my coping mechanisms I avoided a panic attack and only had mild anxiety. Hooray!",['nsubj'],1

I've never taken anxiety medication because of this.  In January, I bit the bullet and began taking Klonopin for my condition while going through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  I was prescribed to take 1-1/2 a pill, 3x daily, though, fortunately, I haven't been taking this large amount, I've been taking ~0.5mg/day.  Sometimes more, sometimes less, but never more than 1mg.  These past few weeks I've only had to take 0.5mg/day.  I decided that I don't like feeling so drowsy and out of it all the time, due to the medicine, and wanted to stop taking it.  Then I began reading around that I can NOT just stop taking it, for risks of severe withdrawals and even *seizures*!  Now I'm a complete wreck.  

My anxiety is at a phenomenal level, one that I have not even experienced ever prior to taking this medicine.  I almost went to the hospital today because of it.  I just want to be completely OFF of it and the fact that I might go through withdrawals or have a seizure if I do so is driving me INSANE!  I believe I'm psychologically addicted to it because once I start experiencing this sheer panic of having a seizure from stopping the medicine, it subsides a second after taking my dose, and I know the medicine doesn't work that fast.  I fear that I couldn't even bear going through a taper due to all of this.  

I feel completely betrayed by my psychiatrist for not telling me this little fact before putting me on it.  I told her I wanted to go through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, not be on any long term medication after she tried pushing an SSRI on me, and even after me telling her this, she prescribed this medication ""just to take the edge off while I'm doing the therapy.""

I saw a new doctor (my old one disappeared) who prescribed me Effexor (low dose). She didn't want to put me on an SSRI again because of the sex drive thing. Huge issue. But when I told her I was having problems sleeping she took me off Effexor and put me on Trazodone.

I toughed it out for awhile because I thought it was a stomach bug and that it had nothing to do with anxiety since I had never had it before. After a couple of months I went to the doctor and was put on Lexapro. After a very short time, things got a lot better, I gained weight back, was able to eat and didnt have to worry about getting sick in public. The only side-effects I remember were excessive yawning and sweating. Then, I can't remember why but I switched to effexor. Effexor worked great (only noticed a bit more sweating) and I took that up until about 5 months ago when I decided that I wanted to try living without medication. I worked with my doctors to taper off of it slowly and still had some withdrawal symptoms but was able to get through the month or so that I experienced them. 


More recently: My anxiety is not nearly as bad as before but I still often get that sick feeling when I go out with friends so I had my doctor prescribe me Klonopin at .5 mg to take as needed because I wanted to try everything that I could before going back to taking meds every day. I noticed that when I would take a klonopin, that I was actually able to sit down and focus even if I didnt take my adderal and its even better if I take them together. This is how I found out that my anxiety was also causing problems that I had with focusing and getting things done (Which Ive had for a while). My main problems that led me to see my doctor again were 

1.) I am always tired mentally no matter the amount of sleep that I get.

2.) My ADD medications were not helping me focus anymore, they only helped combat the tired feeling in my head. I'm having trouble doing the things that I like to do (produce music and DJ)

3.) The Stomach feeling 



Now to the present: I was prescribed Remeron (Mirtazapine 15mg) yesterday and took it for the first time last night. I took it at about 8:30-9pm and I was knocked out cold by 10pm. I wasnt able to get out of bed until about 12:30pm today and even then I went and laid down on the couch because I felt very foggy and zombie like. I was scheduled to work at 5pm but ended up calling out because I didn't feel safe to drive, or even work for that matter (I'm a barback so its pretty labor intensive).


I'm currently working two jobs and my next scheduled shift isn't until Thursday at 7 pm, but then I'm also scheduled on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I'm going to try the remeron one more time tonight but if I wake up feeling the same way, I think that I'm going to have to stop taking it completely and go back to either effexor or lexapro because I can not miss anymore work (there isn't anyone else that could cover for me). I understand that it can take a while for these side effects to go away but I don't have the time to find out as I'm scheduled to work almost 6 days a week between both of my jobs.


I'm just looking for some advice because I do not know if I will be able to get an appointment with my doctor before I work again. I dont know if its okay to stop taking the remeron after two days, if I should just replace it with effexor/lexapro again and try a different route for fixing my focus issues? Sorry this is all over the place, so is my mind right now.

The anxiety rose from there, but I brushed it off as best I could (working out/running, eating better). Instead the anxiety started tearing my life apart. I hid from **everyone**. Friends, family, coworkers. I don't really *do* anything anymore.

/

I saw a doctor about 6 months ago. I was really worried, but he seemed empathetic and prescribed me Buspirone HCL 5mg, twice a day. After a couple weeks things started *feeling* better. During that time I was considerably more active. On my rescheduled checkup I indicated such, and my doctor seemed content.



The anxiety came back though. Seemingly worse, although honestly everyday can be described that way. **Worse**.

/

I should mention that at my first two visits, and several afterward, I was recommended religion. I've never been religious, and told him so, but he persisted that through the church I could rid these emotions. I politely declined every offer and tried explaining the anxiety was getting worse, and I'd been taking the medication as prescribed. He recommended religion AGAIN, told me to try yoga, and basically sent me on my way.

I'm at a loss. That was my last visit (almost a month ago). My medication runs out in almost a week.. and I'm freaking out. Should I see another doctor? Is this common? I feel like I'll just be told the same thing, that nobody is going to help me, and the anxiety echos that so much that I've sat in bed crying for a few nights now.

Lately, I don't like the way I act. I act a certain way around people because I'm really shy and it really frustrates me but I feel so anxious in situations I never do what I think I should. I pretty much get frustrated by my anxiety, due to my anxiety. Because I get frustrated, when I think about things  get anxious and it is a vicious cycle. I'm only like half a person when I am anxious because I am not doing what I want to do or feel all my time. I can't express myself 100% due to my anxiety.  And as I've said, it has really frustrated me and made me depressed. 

But, after being high I started to realize what thoughts were bad thoughts. I would think a thought but before I could over think it or analyze that thought which would make me feel bad, my body was just able to recognize that as a feeling of anxiety and shot it down. I pretty much couldn't feel anxiety and the feeling I had while I was high was me 100% without anxiety. I pretty much just cured my anxiety. Literally, my body is recognizing my anxiety lately and not letting it affect me. I think that this could be because of the medication and maybe it literally one day just kicked in. I've been taking it for pretty much a month. When I am sober I still feel the same way about anxiety and what is bad. 

**EDIT:For example, I just wanted to clarify that for the past few days I was sober and still my brain was recognizing and managing my anxiety. I don't want people to judge me and think that I am high right now, so I got anxious. I didn't want to edit the page because people would see that I edited it. So then I just felt anxious and didn't want to do it. But my brain just then made me feel like that was stupid and I got past that initial anxiety attack and did things. I feel like my anxiety cripples me and have been depressed about it but I now understand what thoughts are bad and I understand my brain now. Like I don't even acknowledge the thoughts anymore, I'm literally not acknowledging the anxiety in my brain. I know Reddit hates this word but I think I'm euphoric. So this is an edit explaining my thought process and how I got over it. **

""Me a week ago would never have edited this.""

 This is a really powerful sentence to me. Everything in my head just clicked. Does that make sense? Or am I crazy?  I typically give in to my anxiety and get frustrated and depressed about myself because I know I gave in to my anxiety but could never really put those feelings into thoughts in my head that counters out the anxiety. I used to try to meditate, where you are supposed to not acknowledge bad thoughts. With my anxiety, I couldn't do it. Because of my medication, not I can. I literally control my thoughts now. My whole life, I couldn't fathom how to control my feelings and with this medication I finally can.

I feel like the chemicals in my brain that send out my anxiety are not really even being produced anymore. I get past that certain panic attack with everything I do. I've only seen life full of anxiety and I guess maybe I had REALLY bad anxiety and now the medication is making me normal and who I am. Wow. Can anyone relate? Is my medication just kicking in and is this a great success story? Or does this not make sense? Maybe I just smoke too much weed? Please, help me out here. I appreciate it a lot.

Since then I've been going to therapy and some groups, and I've improved quite a bit since (yay!)

The thing is, even though I've come a pretty long way, I feel like I've still been experiencing a lot of symptoms. I haven't had a panic attack for almost a month now, and even though I've gotten better at keeping myself from going into complete panic, I still experience the things that go with it, such as shakiness, dizziness, tight chest, lack of concentration, etc. These types of things have been happening often. Therapy definitely has helped me to handle these symptoms, but I still feel like they get in the way of my life. I can still function, but I don't think I'm functioning as well as I could be.

Anyways, medication sounds like it could be a good idea. However, I'm terrified of side effects and all the bad stories I've heard on the Internet. My therapist told me that if my current therapy groups weren't fixing my anxiety, she would reccomend I take a mild antidepressant. I still don't know if I need it, and I'm scared to try it.

I had anxiety pretty much my entire adolescent life, but it really came to a head my first year of university. I was constantly having attacks, and I was so worried about everything that I would just shut down and do nothing. I skipped classes for weeks on end because they were just too stressful. I also was in constant fear of people judging me, which made me not want to leave the house for fear that I would say something stupid, or wear something atrocious, or even be wearing the ""wrong"" lipstick. 
I had been seeing a psychologist to try and deal with it, but it didn't seem to be quite enough. It got to the point where I didn't want to do anything but be in my room and watch movies (which is so not me, because I am highly extroverted). 
Finally, I mentioned to my doctor about all this, and she recommended that I try a low dose of cipralex, which is technically an anti-depressant but works for anxiety as well.
WELL. Within a week, I started to feel like myself again. I actually wanted to go to class, hang out with people, and spend time outside of my room. The little things that were stressing me out stopped scaring me. I stopped being worried about what other people thought of me, and started speaking in class.

I started having chain panic attacks shortly after my first dose, and they lasted for hours until the medicine finally wore off. It was awful. 

It didn't take me too long to catch on that the meds must have caused it, so I looked up the ingredients. The Phenylephrine ingredient's wiki specifically says not to take it if you have a history of panic or anxiety disorder.

Such a bummer that they won't put things like that on the box. I was sick as a dog in the middle of an incredibly busy Walmart during a French Toast Alert (Ice storm warning - milk, eggs, and bread time!) and I just needed to grab something and get out of there. I hate busy places. 

Anyhow, lesson learned. Some side effects are worth researching, and I'll be sure to check out the ingredients in my replacement cold medicine prior to purchasing for sure.

It's been treated on and off since I was 12 or so, first just the symptoms-migraines, dizzy spells, etc., but I was finally diagnosed and got appropriate meds around age 30. I'm 45 now, and there have been a few med changes, some dark, difficult bouts, but overall, I've been dealing with things. My SO is super supportive and was pretty much responsible for my finally getting the right doctors and meds. 

A few weeks ago, we came home early from work and discovered we'd had a burglar. They'd come in through our cat door (we're guessing since there weren't any signs of force &amp; all the doors had been locked-it's a mid sized door), taken the top two drawers of my jewelry box and scooted out the back door. I didn't feel that upset at the time, just glad that they were gone when we got there, the cat was okay, and nothing else was taken. For some reason, filling out the insurance forms freaked me out though. I was supposed to have sent them in over a week ago, but whenever I start filling them out and listing things, I can't breathe properly and I feel faint. This past Sunday, I had those symptoms, plus uncontrolled crying, blurred vision and a migraine. I'm trying to put my finger on what it is about this that has me so rattled. I pretty much only wear my wedding rings and some simple pieces I was wearing at the time and nothing individually was very costly but the sentimental things really bother me: my grandmother's wedding band though, and a charm bracelet that my family and friends had been giving me charms for over the last 30 years, my mom's high school ring-all probably now melted down for scrap. 

But that's beside the point anyway. Do panic attacks just go away or will I have these regularly now? Should I get my meds adjusted or changed? I'm not sure what I need to do and everything was working well, so I'm afraid of upsetting the balance.
I don't even quite know why I'm bothering this sub with it, but if anyone has any insight or suggestions, I'd be super open to hearing it.

A short background on me, I have always had a level of anxiety, but only in college did it rear up really bad and become debilitating. I entered therapy about a year and some change ago, it's helping a little but I'm still honestly really struggling. Tried benzos for a short period and they weren't really effective (tried xanax and valium) due to the gnarly side effects. I exercise regularly and try to eat as best as I can (my main symptoms are lack of appetite, GI symptoms and vomiting).

So essentially, I'm going back to school tomorrow at a new college, and I've been struggling all week anticipating it. I'm kind of dealing with it OK, as long as I keep my head down and ride out the panic attacks alone. I can't be around others right now, as it increases my anxiety. My social anxiety really destroyed my social life--I haven't been able to make any new friends since I started therapy because I'm pretty unreliable (I need lots of time alone to cope). The friends I do have are long-term friends and know about my issue so don't expect a lot from me, and I give them what I can, which is basically hanging out once every couple of weeks, for a few hours. 

The trouble is, when I can get myself to go out and be comfortable and relax (for example, class) I appear really social and normal, and lots of people want to be friends with me. But as soon as they ask me to hang out another time (""hey, what are you doing this Friday? Want to go on a hike?""), I panic and run. It's a big, big issue. Even texts strike fear into my whole being.

The problem I'm having that caused me to write this post is that distant acquaintances (potential new friends) have been contacting me this week just by chance. They are asking me to participate in projects (I'm an artist), hang out with them, chat, etc. All things that I'm not really ready to do right now. I WANT to eventually make new friends, because I'm struggling with loneliness, but since I have spent SO MUCH time alone, simple things like going for coffee or going on a walk with someone else are extremely challenging and stressful. I definitely want to attack this thing soon, but at this moment I'm way too overloaded trying to adjust back into school.

So my questions for the community. How do I fend off these people politely, without having to reveal that I have a crippling anxiety disorder? What's your go-to? I'm usually pretty honest and try not to be rude, but I'm also really ashamed that I have anxiety this bad and that I'm so unstable.  

I'm also wondering about your guys' medication stories--BuSpar, ADs. I've been at therapy for a long time now and I'm considering changing therapists since I'm not really getting great results (in fact, I feel like my anxiety got WORSE after I entered therapy). I'd love to do it without medications, but I feel like I might be in too deep and too afraid of too much to be able to re-integrate into a social life without crashing and burning. My day-to-day life kind of revolves around my anxiety. Did medication help you? How? I'd like to hear your stories.

Anyway, I've always been able to put up with it. I guess you could say it was only mild, except for (at some point in my life) frequent panic attack before going to be. But like I said, I've managed for a lot of my life.

Until last fall when I had an attack, out of the blue in the middle of the day, without any real or apparent (that I can think of) reason. But the loss of control and the highly oppressive feeling had me go to a doctor and ask for help for the first time. They gave me a small dosage of clonazepam to take ""when needed"" and gave me appointement with a psychologist.

I took those meds for about an entire month out of fear of getting more anxious. Within that month, I've experienced what I think is a ""normal"" behavior. I've had less difficulty at school (struggeling to finish an undergrad at 30 isn't always fun), I felt more ""real"" and my fiancee said I've never been so open to what I was living in my life. But to the psychiatrist's advice, I've stop taking the pills to be on it's benefit at all time since it can create addiction. To a point where I started to ""manage"" by myself again and just kept the pills on my desk, just in case.

It's been a little more than two month now, since I've taken a pill. But for the past week of so, I've been feeling weird, can't really explain it. Something has been building inside my chest, but I managed to the best I could. But I started being anxious trying to do write my essays and do my reading. To a point where I literally feel like a magnet being repulsed from the things I need to do.

Now it just got worse. The fiancee went away for the week to see her family, and that ""weird"" feeling I had just exploded. First night I went to a small bar around the corner to get surrounded by loud music and got drunk (not heavily) but just enough so I could just burry the feeling and try to sleep (note: I'm in no way alcoolic per definition. I drink socially, this was unusual behavior). Yesterday I kind of felt stupid that I turned to alcool to go to sleep, so I gathered all my will and finally got to sleep but I had the worse night in a long time. I started to hear sounds that woke me up all night, felt like if someone was in my appartment.

I went to work today, even if I was tired as hell. I came back home and it just started again. But now I'm fully awake... That feeling that there is someone in the appartment (and there is no once, you've guessed), those weird noises that just... I don't know. I don't like?

I'm just, right now, afraid to go to bed. Afraid to do my papers. Afraid to go to class tomorrow.

So I took that pill and at the moment where this is finished, it's effect should start to kick in. Hopefully, that'll be enough to manage and get to bed.

**tl:dr** Speaking of my life up to today, where I have difficulty managing my anxiety. Experiencing new weird stuff, almost like paranoïa, and figure I should write this stuff to wait for my meds to kick in rather then building up more anxiety by letting my brain go free.

She let me talk and talk, and talk, and talk, and it felt so good. I told her what i believe my problems were and she kept reassuring me that i am not alone and that it's very justified that i feel the way i feel, almost as if she knew i was needing some reassurance. And when i told her about my severe derealization, i worded it in a way to where i didn't actually say the word, and she knew exactly what i meant. She also said she was very impressed at how informed i was and that i had done my research well. 

All in all, I ended up getting started on 10mg of lexapro, even though i'm strongly against medication personally, she assured me that it would help.

Disappointed my parents, coaches, and lots of people who looked up to me in not playing in the next level, mainly because i had so much anxiety (especially traveling anxiety; riding the bus, car trips), i began seeing a therapist but i was too immature to follow through with everything, and soon quit going. I attend community  college and beginning of my 2nd semester of freshman year i cold turkey my medication and felt great and exercised and went to school clubs and what not. Now the anxiety is back and hitting me several times a day. I scheduled myself to see the same therapist and plan to follow through on everything she says, yet i don't know if i should go back medication. The whole reason i quit medication was because it was making me sick. I have tried several medications and combinations over the 3 years (18 now). 

Basically what I'm asking is for alternatives to help me with anxiety. Should i go back to medications? What medications would not have the most side effects? I don't mind waiting for it to kick in. 
Thank you for any help. I basicly feel like the forever alone guy.","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1

I was originally started on klonopin (.5mg), worked well for about a year, rarely taking it, like 2-3 times a month at a low dose. Then i wanted something that acted a little faster and my GP gave me ativan and i ended up taking that about 3 times, didnt really note anything feeling different (.5mg). About 2 weeks ago i went to the mental health clinic (air force)  to talk to them about my most recent panic attack where i felt it coming on and took klonopin that i had left over and it seemed to make things worse. I got weak legs, diarrhea, shaking, and really spacey like everyone areound me was doing their normal shit and i was just watching panicking in my head. That had never happened to me before, so now my only reliable medicine is either not working or making shit worse. He the gave me xanax to try (.5mg).

He told me to give it a test run before i had an attack so i could be able to rely on it which i think is my biggest issue. I have not gotten around to that quite yet lol and i have something coming up on sat that i might need it. My main reason for not taking it is because im scared i will have a paradoxical reaction like i (maybe) had with the klonopin, or that i will be allergic to it. My shit normally starts from medical related things like chest discomfort, odd feelings, ect... Health anxiety i suppose. So, naturally taking new meds sucks for me, especially when im reading about bad experiences people have had. 

Tell me im not dumb and to take this shit so i can feel safe again. Sorry if this is written like shit im doing a million things right now lol","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1

I'm currently on medical leave from a job I thought I genuinely enjoyed because one night last week, I had a panic attack and somehow convinced my brainmeats that the only way to make the bad feelings stop was to injure myself. I've known for years that I struggle with anxiety in some way.  I've never had it diagnosed or treated, but there are times when my life seems like I have everything going for me, yet I have so much pent up fear and dread inside of myself that I do ridiculous things. It's led to losing jobs in the past. It's led to losing relationships in the past. It's never been so bad as to make me want to hurt myself but it reached that point that night. I'm hardly able to believe it even as I type this. I've NEVER thought of doing something like that, but in the moment it's all that made sense to me.  

Knowing I didn't want to, nor could I afford to, lose my current job, I scheduled an appointment with the first psychologist I could find on my insurance. The first session with him wasn't bad but he revealed to me that he is against treating anxiety with medication (while, admittedly, meds were what I was hoping for) and insisted that if we went through some of the more troubling memories from my childhood, it would fix everything. I tried to tell him I didn't think that would help, respectfully of course. I don't consciously have hang ups about my childhood even if it was hard. That's certainly not why I felt the need to self harm, not that I could pinpoint what actually was though.. Anyway, I have another session with him soon and I hate to admit it, but I'm only entertaining it because I need him to sign off on my leave paperwork or I lose my job. I'm trying to stay open minded. And having someone to vent to was therapeutic in a way, but I remain unconvinced he understands what is going on in my head or can actually help me. 

Lately, I feel like I've forgotten what carefree happiness feels like. I'm always worrying about something. Work is still over a week away (if I do go back) and every day all I do is worry about when it will be upon me. I have work friends, and even my boss, texting me almost every day wishing me well and saying they miss me. None of it helps to ease my fear. How do I know the night before work wont be like the one last week? I'm just scared. I need some help putting things into perspective. I feel everything but my own fears have been lost to me and I don't see a way out.   

I thought it was gone. Life is pretty good. The first few months of this new job were good. But it just came back... It came back in full force and the feeling inside was the same feeling I had when I lost my last job, moved states to get away from everyone/everything two years ago. I'm a fucking 24 year old woman. I don't need to keep running. I can't.

He was diagnosed with it when he was like 16 months old or something and after three operations he's finally cancer free and is now a 12 year old.

I am not a 12 year old, I am a 30 year old who was just diagnosed with GAD and have been working through it with a variety of methods, therapy, medicine, breathing exercises and stuff like that. It seems to be working but i have my days and sometimes it's hard to get up in the morning. Who am I fucking kidding? Getting up in the morning, getting showered, dressed, fed and out of the fucking door to go to my job is one of the hardest points in the day. The safest I feel is about 10 p.m. in bed knowing that I am going to have sleep for the night, mayby.

So this kid on the radio says something, and I paraphrase here, that he never knew how precious/important/great life was until he almost died, and I started crying. Ever since I have been having recent massive panic attacks and got diagnosed and on meds I have not had an epiphany like this. It makes me feel that all the anxiety I have over problems are really in the long run just a bunch of bullshit chemical imbalances and not really legit and that I am kind of being a pussy about it.

Anyone with this knows that anxiety literally makes a mountain out of a molehill, no matter what. I can look at that little hill and I can say in my mind ""yeah, that is a mole hill, that isn't anything that I can't handle, I'm a strong man."" But then my brain says ""No, fuck you, that's mount fucking Everest, you have no oxygen and you know what you're going to die if you try to tackle it. Just try it, go ahead.""

My therapist describes people as having ""scouts"" inside of a person. He said the scouts are there to protect you and they delight in their job. If you're walking across the street and a car comes crashing out of the middle of nowhere your scouts will pull you back, it's your instincts that he's talking about. He said the scouts have done their job, they're sated and they've done a good job.

He said my scouts are always on alert ALWAYS no matter what, so if I get a weird phone call or if I hear a noise at night or a car go by, my scouts are on full alert that the worst possible case is going to happen and I need to hunker down because it's going to be a dangerous and bumpy ride.

I don't know where I am really going with this post. I know that the meds and the therapy have helped me in these weeks, and helped me realize that I have had this problem for a long time, but I just want to say ""fuck you anxiety, seriously, fuck you. I am sick of you and I don't want to have you around fucking up my life anymore. I am a grown man and I should be able to conquer you, I want to conquer you and goddamn it I am going to do anything in my humanly fucking power to do it. Go to hell."" 

Thanks for listening to my rant folks.

So it's really late here, so sorry for any spelling errors. My anxiety has been really bad ever since summer/beginning high school. I hung out with the wrong people around mid summer, and smoked a lot. I was also an ass to a lot of people, lied to my parents and generally ruined my friends trust in me, but I just wanted to fit in with the cool people.

By the end of summer, many of the kids went to different high schools and some even moved out of the city, or they were a grade below me and still in middle school. So I went to school the first day, walked through the doors, looked around at all the unfamiliar faces and felt like they were all looking back.

Popular girl I use to know calls me over in front of her friends and I awkwardly stand there looking at the floor red faced before the first bell rang, I wandered around looking where to go, clinging to anyone who looked at me, like a lost puppy.

And you know what?,Those were the good days, without the ""ninering""(teasing the newer kids). I actually had friends, and if I went a period without them I was terrified, but I also felt like I was being clingy. As of now I'm a dropout who can barely attend an alternative school. 

Now to the question, I've already been to therapy and it didn't really help that much because she had to leave after the first few months and the minuscule dosage of ativan barely helped. Anxiety attacks are random but mostly related to school and strangers my age.

*necessary stuff*


There is a huge stigma attached to meds in my my household, my mom personally knew a man taking antidepressants who killed himself, and my dad had a terrible father who also abused many substances, so he believes that anything that alters the way you thing is bad and it took tons of convincing to try a barely helpful amount of ativan

I was wondering what the best course of action is. I'm a boy in canada if that helps. Should we go to the family doctor? Seek another therapist? Any specific medications that are all natural? Is medication needed, or even an option? I really need help here guys, sorry again if I made errors. Goodnight","['pobj', 'ROOT', 'nsubj']",1

1.Depersonalization-wise, does anyone know any good strategies to help cope with depersonalization without the use of medication? or ways to help combat/beat it?

I recently have had more severe panic attacks so I’ve gone to both a therapist and a couple different psychiatrists. The most recent psych I saw wants me to start lexapro. I take xanax for panic when I have it bad. 

**My reluctance**: I suppose it’s more a matter of philosophy and principle. I have doubts and questions surrounding a medication that changes the chemistry in your brain. I mean, I know how meds are supposed to work, but then sometimes it is discovered how they actually work. There is a fear that changing the chemistry in my brain (tangent — I believe what you do and all the sums that make up who you are in your brain and it can be rewired by your actions. It may be an broad example but I think there is a lot left to learn about the brain) and changing who I am. My principle is impractical, I know it is. I know that the medication may help. I know I can never know if it may help or impact me unless I try. I mean there is side effects too, but I try not to think about those because it makes me more anxious and weary; I am trying to be more rational regarding my anxiety, I know side effects are different for everyone. 

So I’m in therapy for about 3 weeks and now and I feel it’s helping, but there is still days where my panic is crippling. Yeah, I know that is how recovery works, you have good days in a stretch then you have another bad day, this process continues until the amount of good days you have goes on for a while. I am hoping to not recognize and not be fearful of my own anxiety soon. But I have only got to three 45 minute therapy sessions (once a week) and even though I’m feeling better there is a creeping thought that my anxiety will come back and impede me. 

I am looking to get a job and I’m not in school currently, I’m lucky enough to be supported by my parents. Obviously I want to be independent. When I was in school I would skip classes because my panic was so bad and that had been the way I coped with it since high school. I would sit alone and write and listen to music just to help the panic pass. I have a fear that once I try to do the things that will make me feel better, the things I need to do, that I will have panic everyday like I used to. Just thinking about this, I don’t even want to try something for fear of failing (because of my panic). I don’t want to have panic attacks everyday but I do want a job and a future and to be able to say that anxiety doesn’t control my life. 

**What was the point of this post?** Just asking others’ thoughts because I feel like I’ve shared this sentiment with others but not really gotten to talk to anyone who really knows my concerns and how my anxiety feels. I am trying to look at it and ask “what would be worse, taking medication and facing your anxiety and going against an idea you’ve held as a principle for a long time, or not being able to continue and live your life because of your anxiety?”. More and more the answer to that question has been that meds may help so I should at least TRY. 

Blah blah it sounds melodramatic but going to 3 different professionals and being told 3 different medications will help me does not inspire confidence. Everyone has their own opinions, even mental health professionals. ","['dobj', 'nsubj', 'dobj']",1

Tried some meds, didn't work, and I got worse and worse. Panic attacks every few days, the ones where you think you've gotta go to the hospital. Tried losing weight and working out to find a natural remedy—didn't work. Finally got on the right medicine, life is going so much better. No longer a hypochondriac, can go in stores, and just live my life again.

When I was at my worst, things felt hopeless. When I was looking for help online, there wasn't a lot of hope to be found. My hope is someone will see that getting better is a journey and not a goal and that you have to keep hopeful.


**MY HISTORY:** Several years ago, I began showing symptoms of depression and anxiety... around the age of 28 maybe? It started with a panic attack at work, feeling like I was about to pass out at my desk, then a night of sleep where I'd be on the brink of sleep then have a jolt, almost like my heart was going to stop if I fell asleep and my body shot me back up. My family came out to visit me and the day they came I got hives all over my arms and chest, never having them before.

My body started turning against me.

I started seeing a counselor and was also prescribed Lexapro, all while making the decision to move back to my hometown 2,500 miles away. Things were going OK but my head would be in a fog, feeling super heavy, and I gained a lot of weight. So emotionally I was feeling better, but I couldn't keep going with the fog. (Also, I was having insane dreams on the Lexapro... some really disturbing, mostly lucid... they were pretty cool, though LOL). So I slowly weaned myself off it, followed by a month of these electric brain restarts that SUCKED.

So, I'm off those meds and I begin having panic episodes. Because I had gained a lot of weight, I started wondering if it was my heart. I would get these heart flutters and mentally I just started shutting down, feeling like I was constantly about to drop dead. I would wake up and my immediate thought every day was, ""when is it going to happen?""

I was just waiting to die everyday. My depression was making me feel hopeless, which caused my anxiety to go through the roof. I had an optical migraine followed immediately by a panic attack at a rehearsal dinner one night, probably the worst panic attack I've ever had. I was outside a restaurant thinking I was about to die, looking at people thinking, ""Don't they realize I'm about to die? This is going to be the last thing I see, some schmucks looking at me freaking out.""

I was working out daily and had lost quite a bit of weight (40 lbs?) at this point, trying everything I personally could to help the depression and anxiety. At this point, I was visiting the doctor's office about once every month with a complaint about the heart palpitations, an ache in my side (I thought my kidney's were failing), and freaking out about EVERY pain I felt. It all lead up to one day where I had freaked myself out so bad that I was having these premature heart beats every minute. That was the tipping point.

The next day, I went to the doctors. They had been wanting to put me on depression meds but I had been fighting it. I couldn't take it anymore, though, and finally took whatever they offered. I started on a new medication.

**TODAY:** About 1.5 or 2 years later now, the medication is working great, no side effects, and the majority of my symptoms have gone away now. I work in the creative field and I think one of those go-to arguments was that meds may affect your creativity and such. But if you're so bad off you can't work, what's it worth anyhow. Truthfully, for me, it didn't affect me but positively once I found the medication that worked for me.

I just came back from the doctor today, about 60 lbs lighter than when I first started going in, blood pressure back to normal, and doing really well. I wanted to share this with anyone going through these issues right now feeling hopeless. ","['nsubj', 'pobj', 'dobj']",1

In March, I had a depressive episode severe enough I was referred to a mental hospital where they suggested I up my dosage to 20mg. Due to a miscommunication (escitalopram vs. citalopram), my house doctor prescribed me Celexa 20mg, which I had been taking daily up until 5 days ago.

Whenever the time comes to refill my prescription, this time being the third time, I begin feeling extremely uneasy and anxious at the thought of scheduling an appointment. I live in the EU, and as far as I know, there's no way to have this kind of prescription automatically refilled.

I ideally should be seeing a psychiatrist instead of a GP, but I have the added stress of having to speak a foreign language in therapy is a huge deterrent for me. It makes me anxious, which makes me feel hopeless.

I also have a family history of bipolar (sibling and parent), which I am starting to suspect I may suffer from. I have been in treatment for depression for the last ten years. This is the first time I have taken a medication for it longer than a month.

My question is since I have eight 20mg pills left, would it be safer for me to start taking 10mg a day to taper off, or can I just ride this out? I don't feel like the medication was helping (especially considering the amount of anxiety I still feel about getting refills despite being medicated), but the withdrawal is unbearable.

I don't know if I should get the prescription refilled because it'll just start this cycle all over again. I know my husband can legally pick up a prescription for me, but first I'd have to call the doctor and give them his name. That might sound easy, but it's just more than I can take right now. I'd start crying on the phone.

The only way I can describe the physical discomfort I'm in right now is a sensation of my head being soft if that makes sense. I feel like I can't tell which direction is up; it's like being on the high point of a swing, but it feels like I'm stuck there.

Mentally, I've been extremely depressed and have been having bouts of crying over the past two days. I have very obsessive and negative thoughts. I just feel like giving up. It's hard for me to get the help I need right now because in my mind I just want to check out of life.

So I was going to counselling a while ago because I was having anxiety attacks. Then the anxiety attacks stopped. I learned I was a Highly Sensitive Person.

 Then the counselling changed into relationship advice (i.e. me getting over the inability of me being able to talk to a girl when she's obviously dropping obvious signs... i.e. fear of putting myself out there). 

I stopped going to counselling because I just needed to figure it out at that stage, but the anxiety attacks stopped. 

Fast forward a year later. I come back because the anxiety starts again. My Councillor tells me I need to consider ""Mild"" anxiety medication. I was offended because my initial response was 'that's a bandaid not a solution' then she told me 'well you better consider it because I don't see a reason for us to talk anymore so it's your only option'

TLDR; My Councillor said I'm not doing CBT, go on Anxiety meds. My question is, has anyone else been skeptical about ""Mild"" anxiety meds, given it a try and it actually made a difference??

So pretty much, for the past year and half I've been on Pristiq and then for the last 3 months Celexa.  Pristiq worked well and the Celexa even better in addition to being cheaper.  My new found freedom from anxiety allowed me to ace an interview and get a half decent job in a call center.  

Now, I know you're thinking that's not a good job for someone with anxiety, but my anxiety isn't with talking to people.  When I applied, I felt comfortable seeing myself in the position.  Also, today was our first day on the phones and talking to people wasn't the issue.  What's triggering my anxiety now is my own inadequacy and inexperience.  I had a few calls where I didn't know what to do and was completely lost; even though we had a lot of support being our first time on the floor, it was still very very stressful.  
  
I can usually tell normal anxiety from abnormal anxiety because normal anxiety goes away when the stress is gone.  Yet I've been dwelling on tomorrow since getting off today and it's been making me quite miserable. It's like the anxiety is getting too strong for the meds to handle.  I've actually had it happen to me a few times since going on med.

I guess some background? GAD with depression, seeing a therapist. Tried several meds, currently on Prozac.

Right now I'm sitting here terrified of going into work tomorrow. We're getting close to a deadline and I'm getting further and further behind. I just can't seem to get myself to do as much work as I should be some days, sometimes I just sit there and stare into nothing really. Of course this is making everything so much worse.

I've been trying to work with my therapist, but I seem to have a terrible time breaking out of my old habits. I know what I need to do, but I just can't seem keep myself doing it. No meds have seemed to help.

With worrying about all that stuff I just can't seem to get my mind to stop worrying about everything else too. I moved to my current town a little over a year ago. I didn't know anyone here at all. I have terrible anxiety in social situations, so I didn't really make any friends at work. I kinda shied away from the two people that tried to be friendly and I think I've already ruined that. It's also a smallish/medium town, and I haven't really been able to think of any kind of things I could look for to try to meet people that I'd enjoy right now. I just can't figure out what to do. The only friends I have live a few states away from me. One of them is bi-polar, and I just can't seem to deal with her problems and mine too when she's in a depressed phase.

So I end up just sitting around worrying about things and trying to escape from my worries either through video games or sleeping. Half the time I feel like I just wish I could disappear and never have to worry about any of this stuff again. I just don't know what to do....

Anyway, thanks for reading my rant.",['nsubj'],1

I have been practicing yoga, meditation, and running, eating healthy, and feeling good. 

However, my biggest trigger has happened and I am starting to freak out and I can feel myself losing progress. A few days ago, my fiance told me that he sometimes fears our future because he thinks my anxiety will make things difficult and that he won't be able to manage both helping me with my anxiety and his demanding job. He complained that we don't do anything spontaneously and he feels like he can't make any choices because everything has to do with my anxiety. I reminded him of how well I've been doing, how much I've improved and how I may always have some anxiety, but it doesn't have to interfere with our lives. I promised him I wouldn't cause him to compromise his efforts at work and reminded him that he feared that would happen while he was in grad school and it did not happen. I have supported him, in different ways than he supports me, but supported him nonetheless. 

We talked for a very long time and he ended up saying that he would be miserable without me and has no desire or intention to leave, and wants to marry me. He has spent the majority of his time since trying to lift my spirits and remind me that he loves me. He says that he just needed to get some of his fears off his chest.  I just can't get some of the things that he said out of my head - worrying that I won't be able to be a strong and independent person because of my anxiety is my greatest fear, and he triggered it in a major way. 

Ultimately, I am scared, as always, that I will regress and not make progress with my anxiety, that the meds will stop working or I will get worse with each anxious episode I have - and I am also terrified that my anxiety is going to drive away the person I love, the person I am engaged to marry. 

I worry that he will keep triggering my anxiety by doubting me and my progress. My family, friends, and therapist have all encouraged me, observed and reminded me how much better I've been getting, and have reminded me to be patient and see it through. They insist that I'm not a burden on anyone and that they understand. My fiance is the only person who has told me that I'm a burden (not directly but implied), or in any way complained about my anxiety, doubted my progress or questioned my ability to get better. 

I need faith from him to recover - instead I get doubt. I have tried to explain this to him.

I am so sad. We should be planning our wedding, but instead, we're having long conversations about my anxiety - this horrible illness that seems to affect every single fucking thing in my life. 

Already, I feel my momentum starting to slip. I am supposed to meet friends for dinner and to hang out, but I am anxious and don't want to go. I am debating now if I should force myself to try to return to ""normal"", or stay home and try to unwind and do some of my coping mechanisms (meditation, yoga, and a hot bath before bed) and see if that helps me feel better. 

TL;DR: Was making major progress with anxiety, fiance and I had a difficult conversation and I feel like I'm regressing. Any advice or words of encouragement would be appreciated. ",['nsubj'],1

But today I was supposed to get it checked out. Fuck me though, my insurance company decided to do flip flops and assigned me to a doctor that I haven’t even heard of. So I couldn’t see my regular doctor today, and after spending quite a while anxiously on the phone to try and fix things, I decide to go to the urgent care down the street. Quite a walk for someone who hasn’t gotten out of the house in a few days.

But here’s where it gets more fun. I get there about a half hour after my initial doctor’s appointment was supposed to start, and I sign in. Wasn’t seen for another hour and a half, almost. The nurse puts me in a room, I wait for another 20 minutes for the biggest tool of a doctor I have ever had (and I’ve had a lot of docs in my life, believe me). He asks me what’s wrong, I tell him that I found a lump in my shoulder and that it’s kind of uncomfortable and painful, to which he says, “I don’t see nothin’” before asking me to take my shirt off or anything. So I take my shirt off, and he asks “what the hell is that? a bulletproof vest? take it off” in reference to my binder (I’m transgender). The words “none of your damn business” cross my mind, but I keep my mouth shut because I’m an anxious wreck. I try to get him to feel the differences in my shoulders (it’s only really noticeable if you touch them), so he squeezes them for about half a second and decides that he “doesn’t feel nothin’”, which is a bunch of bullshit. Luckily I got him to order me an ultrasound, but “they’re not gonna find nothin’”, apparently. So I have that to look forward to tomorrow.

Hopefully my anxiety meds actually work tonight when I’m hanging out with my friends. I feel so sick right now, like what the fuck is the point of doing anything at all if strangers, doctors even, think it’s okay to treat me like shit. It’s really hard to reach any sort of goals and to keep life going at all when these kinds of things keep happening.",['nsubj'],1

I dont really know what i'm saying here, so i'm sorry if this post makes no sense, or lacks all structure. 

I'm 28/m in the UK and have been suffering on and off with some form of anxiety since I was about 10. I have been on meds for the past 6 years (on and off before that) and have been seeing different people at my local NHS community health team for a few years where I have received councelling and CBT. I have also recently had my meds changed after being on the same ones for 2 years.

Past few months, things have been the worst that they have ever been. I have been suicidal (including planning and writing notes to leave for people to find), but the constant exhausting anxiety is what is killing me. Feeling constantly teetering on the edge. 

I guess I need to define what i'm looking for here; and I guess that boils down to two questions.

1) I have a folder of 50 or so pages full of different coping techniques that I have been taught in order to stay calm. However I am rarely able to employ them, as I get to such a state so quickly. I really want to start being able to help myself more as I cannot rely on the drugs. Does anyone have any ideas or experience with this? I want to help myself but I feel stuck. Right now i'm just in pieces, literally pulling at my hair and struggling to maintain my breath.

2) I have had lots of ideas for projects to do while i'm off of work, and I research these things and buy the gear but my perfectionism stops me from doing it. I have loads of woodworking gear, art stuff, photography equipment, family history to research and books to read...but I can't take the first step towards any of it. I feel stuck in such a rut. 

I apologise if these made zero sense. I just can't think straight at the moment. ",['nsubj'],1

I'm a bit weary of antidepressants (what my psychiatrist first described). I just want to stay away from those. I'd prefer to take something NPR/as needed, just because that feels safer to me. No long-term commitment. I voiced those concerns to my psychiatrist, and she said really the only thing along those lines would be Vistaril or Atarax.

**So now:** I've been taking Vistaril. And it *kind of* helps, but I feel like I need something stronger and faster-acting (it starts working an hour and a half after I need it to). It's just not ideal in a panic situation.

I kind of get the feeling she's against benzos. But if they'd help, I want to give them a shot. Should I just talk it over with her, or do primary care docs prescribe those? What are the chances that if I just explained the situation and asked, a primary doc would prescribe?

I'm not a drug seeker (I promise) and I don't look it, but I'd feel a little weird just straight out asking. 

**TL;DR** I have panic problems, the medications I've tried aren't great, and I want to give benzos a shot. I just don't want to look like a drug seeker. And I'm overthinking everything. So how do I talk to my doc (and which doc)?

These past 4 months have been interesting. First month off Prozac was amazing, I didn't give a fuck about anything. Then about 2 months in I got back this anxious feeling and I got scared. I managed to push through it and work on my issues. However, now I realized that I am just so stuck in my head. It's a lot of work in order to get out of my head and takes away from living in the present. Prozac did help but I still found myself in my head. What Prozac really did for me was that it allowed me to pause before I had an anxiety attack or anxious moment and realize it wasn't worth being anxious. But that was it. 

Now, what I want to do is try lexapro because after reading about the  drug and reading peoples reviews of the drug I think it might better suit me. Plus, in the case that I don't like the side effects or it doesn't work for me. I can get off it faster than I can for prozac. 

While I was on Prozac, I sort of lost my sense of why I was taking them. I was taking them so I could feel better and get better. I guess I forgot to go to counseling more than I should have. Just meds on their own do not work. I was just sort of feeling so comfortable in my ability to control my anxiety that I got too cocky and just let the meds do everything, and I expected them to do everything.

Anyways enough of my rant;

I'll start off with my background- I'm 28 year old male who suffers from avoidant personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and depression. For years I've had problems that seem to mimic OCD, but don't quite seem to be. It has baffled any of the shrinks I've seen. And it's made my life a living hell. I'm on here now mostly to see if anyone can help me put a name on this so I can better pursue help. As for the problems themselves, I have these ""irrational"" urges, if you will, to do things (often the same things) that are generally meant to sabotage. I have persistent urges to dial 911 whenever around a phone. I have urges to mess with computers (hardware or software) whenever I can think of a way to. I even have urges to delete my reddit posts or report someone just to see if anything will happen. It's an evolving problem that is a lot of the time situational. If I'm in my friends car, I may get the urge to open and close the door while they are driving. The one common factor is that most of my urges are about doing things where I will always be caught, or doing things that will have significant repercussions (calling 911 or the computer sabotage). All of them regardless of how small the sabotage, cause me great distress and anxiety. I've basically been a recluse half my life, drowning in fantasy (video games and movies/tv shows) so I can get my mind off these intrusive thoughts.

I took Macrobid for a UTI in the beginning of August and ever since then I've had decreased sexual feeling in my vagina. I attempted intercourse with my bf while about four days into the meds and it just didn't feel electric or amazing like it always tends to. We had a pretty dang good sex life. So in response to that reaction I totally flipped. I read the side effects of the antibiotic and it says that there have been cases of peripheral neuropathy in users. 

I've been flipping out about this ever since and the few times we've attempted sex has been an uncomfortable, frustrating experience. But is it me wondering about every minute feeling I am or am not experiencing?? I seem to be relatively relaxed at the start but then tighten and dry up due to not enough feeling. 

I've been to the ER with this complaint and they said the neuropathy presents as something totally different, apparently. I also made an appointment with the gynecologist and got a pelvic exam, told her my issues. She also said highly unlikely the meds had a thing to do with it. She prescribed me iron supplements for my anemia and told me to get my anxiety checked out.

I just don't know what to do. It's my only focus right now and our sex life is falling apart because my bf thinks it's in my head but I think it's fucking nerve damage. I've never ever had trouble with something like this in my life.

I find myself often overcome with negative thoughts about my relationship, my future, my apparence, and my interaction with other people.

When I was in forth grade I was diagnosed and treated for OCD, after I became obsessed with the fear of my mom dying. I couldn't leave her site for almost a year, just barley got away with passing 4th grade because of it. Soon After I was treated, the OCD symptoms completely went away. My biggest fear is that someday Ill be triggered by something that will cause an extreme obsessive  thought like that to manifest again. 

After my symptoms went away, my family never mentioned it again. It was something that I hardly thought about. In high school I did a lot of worrying and stressing about my life, but it didn't really become something that drastically effected me till about my sophomore year of college. 

When I was about 20 I completely became withdrawn and depressed. I pretty much stopped leaving my apartment, and ended up being put on academic suspension for a semester because of my grades. After that I started to see a psychiatrist who put me on adderall. 

Adderall ended up really helping me for a while. In my semester off from college I worked a lot and saved money, and when I came back to school, things really turned around for me. Even though mentally I didn't feel perfect, I was able to accomplish a lot, and I was generally happier then before. After about a year on it, I decided to stop going to my psychiatrist because of money and somewhat because of my parents worry about me becoming dependent on it. 
Ever since I've always wondered if things would be better for me if I were back on it. Sometimes I buy a few here and there from friends, and I feel really great for a week.

 I'm at a very challenging time for me right now. I'm about to graduate from college, and I am in the process of applying to grad schools, getting my portfolio together (i'm a designer/copywriter), and applying for internships. I don't feel like Ive been emotionally stable enough to accomplish any of this right now, and they've been piling up and weighing on me more then anything ever has. 
I could go to the psychiatrist tomorrow and get adderall. I know it has worked for me in the past, but i'm convinced that my real problems are anxiety. Or I could try to be treated for my anxiety, and risk wasting precious time that I don't have right now figuring out what medications work for me, etc. 

Reddit, what should I do? I'm leaning toward going back on adderall till the end of the semester and bring up my anxiety problems in the summer, when Ill have time to experiment.

2 years later and i'm balding like crazy. I'm 21 and bald as fuck.

I spend all day everyday looking online for some kind of cure. All the current treatments, procedures, and cover-ups come with their own unique flavor of horseshit that I would have to put up with the rest of my life were I to employ them. 

bottom line - I can't live life as a bald man. I know that I am vain as hell for saying this. There are -billions- of people who would give anything to have the life I have. I understand this, it makes me feel horrible, but I just can't shake it. I live under a hat - can't get a job because it would mean taking my hat off, its ridiculous. 

My girlfriend says things like ""its just hair, whats the big deal?"" as she's doing her own hair in the mirror and asking me how pretty she looks. Goes to show how people only pretend to give a shit. 

I've been on anti-depressants for 2 years now - no change that i can notice. Have seriously been considering suicide for about 6 months. My mom thinks that medication is the only answer, I think its a waste of time, I stay on them mostly to keep her from worrying too much. 

Anyway - didn't mean to ramble.

I'm not so sure about suicide - It feels so selfish and to be honest, I'm scared as fuck. So now i'm considering living in my mom or dads basement for the rest of my years. I'm into video games, playing music, recording music, browsing the interwebs. I'm sure i can keep myself entertained. 

My parents are pretty well off - I wouldn't be a financial burden. I know they would feel pretty shitty that their son has failed at life but ultimately they would rather me be alive and parasitic than dead and dead.

My mom lives in a small fishing town, my dad in a big city. I would certainly gain a Boo Radley - like reputation in the small town, but it would also be the more relaxing environment. I don't know....

I didn't mean for this to turn into a story, I'm interested in reddits opinion. I'm sure a lot of you anxiety sufferers have considered becoming a total recluse. Could it really be so bad? I know I will never be happy either way, but this option would at least take all the stress of modern life away, which i would not be able to otherwise cope with.

I began by going to a therapist to talk about the issues I was having for about a 6 month period. After all was said and done I got diagnosed with mild OCD/GAD; having compulsive thoughts and letting little things bother me and not able to stop thinking about it in my head. Essentially, my thoughts get stuck in a constant loop and begin to overwhelm me. I got put on Citalopram (brand name is Celexa). I've been taking that everyday for a couple of years now. It has seemed to work relatively well. However, with school getting harder and harder (I am a BS Biochemistry and BS Chemistry major) I have noticed my anxiety getting worse at times. Just this year, I've gone into a test feeling very confident on the material and when I get the test I just blank and can't recall much of anything. This is the first time that has ever happened to me. So to my point; I've always smoked weed throughout high school and still do now. I didn't smoke very much 9th-12th grade because I played year round baseball and that basically consumed my life. But this year I've gotten into a routine for about the past 8 months of smoking every night. I never do during the day or when I have work I need to get done. It is simply my way of ending my day and helping me relax and not stress and not have compulsive thoughts of schoolwork or anything that may be causing me stress at the time. Is it possible that me ""self medicating"" is starting to have more of a negative effect and causing increased anxiety without me realizing. I feel like my anxiety is progressively getting worse but I am not sure if it is from chronic marijuana use or if my medicine isn't right for me or what. Has anyone else tried smoking marijuana to help cope with anxiety? 

Sub note: I have never had an anxiety/panic attack or any bad experience whatsoever after smoking. I have had two mild panic attacks in my life but both times when completely sober and never near a time I had recently smoked. ",['nsubj'],1

I've always been anxious, used to have panic attacks when I was a teenager but haven't had one for a year maybe a year and a half. However I am always so anxious that I can't ever enjoy myself. It's hard for me to keep a job because I constantly worry about how I'm doing and dread going in. I feel like a bipolar, one day everything is fine, the job is okay, not the best but I can survive here, the next I have no faith in myself, I hate my job and my life and I hate feeling so controlled. My anxiety holds me back, keeps me from doing things I want to do because of all the ""what if"" thoughts that plague my mind. It controls EVERY part of my life, from work to my relationship to food to sleep.

Is there a medicine that can actually help me? Is it really just as simple as a trial and error, trying one and seeing what happens? It seems too good to be true. 

Bonus ?: I've heard anxiety meds usually make you gain weight--but if it makes me feel better, and helps me relax and not sleep so much anymore (I sleep to avoid the day and avoid feeling anxious), couldn't it actually help me to get up and lose weight?

TL;DR up front: I believe that the majority of recurring anxiety &amp; panic attacks are caused by food (which requires further explanation, see below).  But first, some history:

I struggled with constant anxiety &amp; regular panic attacks most of my life, and depression later in my life, as well as borderline hypochrondriac because I'd have minor annoying problems (light IBS, .  I eventually turned into as much of a hermit as life would allow, keeping to the same routine because doing new things in new places was extremely difficult.  About 10 years ago, I discovered that I had undiagnosed food allergies, which directly caused my anxiety &amp; panic attacks.

As I've met others IRL &amp; online with this root cause, I've come to believe that the vast majority of people suffering from anxiety &amp; panic attacks have undiagnosed food allergies.  To clarify, I do not believe that ALL anxiety is caused by food.  A short laundry list:

1. Most people (aside from most overconfident Type-A people) suffer some anxiety from time to time, that's normal
2. Some people have strong anxiety - separation anxiety from their SO, anxiety about specific things like school or pregnancy, and so on
3. Some people have PSTD from war, accidents, trauma, abuse, etc.
4. Some people have damage from injuries, drugs, etc.
5. Some people have severe mental disorders (bipolar etc.), many of which NEED to be treated by drugs
6. But most people, IME, have food-driven anxiety, and are not aware of the connection between food &amp; how they feel

This is just my opinion, but if you suffer from anxiety &amp; are willing to dig into finding a permanent way out, hear me out.  In a nutshell, food reactions are not limited to going into anaphylactic shock, or having a skin rash or hives, or having swollen lips.  It can also cause emotional problems like anxiety &amp; panic attacks.

Here's a simplified explanation: when you eat foods that you are, shall we say, ""emotionally allergic"" to (to coin a phrase), the ingestion of the food cause a variety of reactions, which typically include:

1. Sleeping problems
2. ""Brain fog"", ADHD, and fatigue - trouble focusing, trouble thinking clearly, trouble thinking past the emotional reaction you feel to deal with different situations
3. Anxiety.  Best description is like when someone scares you or makes you jump, like when an animal runs in front of your car, or the sense of dread you get when you get called into the boss's office or HR, or the principle's office.
4. Along with the anxiety &amp; feeling of dread, feeling bad all the time, feeling wrong.  Having negative emotions stick with you &amp; not being able to shake them - thinking about the negative things over &amp; over again.  Feeling bad a lot.
5. Panic attacks - a rollercoaster ride that gives you sweaty palms, a feeling of hotness, your heart beating fast, and for me, just feeling like I was warping into another dimension.  Horrible.  To date, still the worst thing I've ever experienced in my life.  It go to the point where I was having them multiple times a day.
5. Emotionally bananas.  Usually you can control how you feel, but sometimes you just can't get rid of the negative feelings as mentioned above.  Just lots of weird, random emotional weirdness that you don't have control over.  Instead of you breathing out, it's more like the wind rolling over you - you don't always have a choice with how you feel or react emotionally to different thoughts &amp; situations.  And all of this can be both location &amp; situation-based, like going out in public or to a new place you've never been before, or a crowded place, or anywhere you just don't feel comfortable, or can be thought-based, like thinking about going to a busy place, like wandering around busy school halls.

The easiest comparison is food vs. batteries.  When you plug batteries in, they power something like a flashlight until the juice dies.  When you eat foods that you're emotionally allergic to, they cause reactions until it exits your body (and in some cases, the effects can last longer than that, especially if you have a physically-tied allergic like Celiac's disease - in my case, I feel better after the food exits my body after a few days).

There is a ridiculous ton of information out there about these connections...if you know where to look.  I came across it by accident &amp; it changed my life.  Once I knew the keyword to look for - food allergies - I was able to overcome my problems.  I now live a completely normal life.  Sure, I have the normal everyday anxieties that everyone has, but it's not emotionally crippling &amp; doesn't stop me from living like a regular person.  It's not like before, when home was my ""safe zone"" &amp; other places outside weren't.  I never really got panic attacks at home, although the anxiety, especially the emotional feelings of feeling bad about stuff, were there.

An easy way to tell if you suffer the food allergy root cause is if your anxiety isn't 24/7.  Do you feel better when you're safe &amp; secure at home?  Or with friends, who provide a safety net?  Or going to work where you at least feel comfortable enough to function to some degree?  Those routines provide a foundation for the anxiety.  If you were constantly anxious ALL the time, it would be difficult to ever function at all, so sometimes you have downtime at home, like when you can unplug &amp; surf the net and get away from things for awhile - away from yourself for awhile.

I did everything in my power to fix my anxiety.  I saw therapists.  Boy was that expensive!  I did research online.  I tried medication (which kind of helped, but not really - crappy side effects, and never really solved the problem, and of course you have to keep amping up the doses to get the same effect over time).  Exercise was hard because I was always so tired.  I was always so tired because I didn't have the willpower to go to bed at a decent hour, and even when I did, I had trouble falling asleep &amp; staying asleep.  I never woke up refreshed, I woke up groggy - that's a HUGE sign of food allergies - your brain should be awake &amp; alert the moment you wake up, otherwise your diet is not right!  Naps never made me feel great either, in general.

So back to the point - you eat food you're emotionally allergic to, it stays in your body as a battery powering the anxiety flashlight, and eventually exists.  But you have to eat every day, and a lot of times you get semi-addicted to what your body can't absorb, so that's one thing to look out for.  For example, dairy causes panic attacks for me.  I drank milk more than water.  Always had a candy bar every day.  Stuff like that.  You get kind of a high when your body reacts to food, the defenses it sends in to deal with the food allergen also give you a stimulation - not something you really notice physically, but for a lot of people, eating their food allergies makes them feel a bit better for a period of time, so they always have to have it.  It's kind of like self-medicating, but it creates a viscous cycle that emotionally cripples you through feeling bad &amp; having anxiety.

This isn't something I generally talk about or share with people, outside of allergy support groups, so I apologize for rambling.  As far as the food goes, it can be anything.  There are eight common ones, stuff like dairy &amp; soy &amp; gluten, but there are also ones that are far more hidden, like corn.  Corn exists in most off-the-shelf food, even salt, as an additive or preservative or natural flavor.  A lot of people with a corn allergy or a gluten allergy suffer from mood swings, anxiety, feeling bad (I call it ""sticky bad"", when you can't get rid of thinking about something dumb you did or feel bad about something, especially something minor like not waving someone through a stop sign and then you feel like crap about it for hours, which is ludicrous!).

What people who don't have anxiety don't understand, and even a lot of people who do have anxiety, is that it's an external force.  It's not you choosing to have it: again, it's like the wind, or waves washing over you.  I call it my anxiety motor.  When I ingest something I'm allergy to, it starts the motor up &amp; starts the gears for feeling bad, feeling anxiety, having panic attacks, the works.  And since you're constantly eating, and a lot of foods are in everything (milk, corn, and wheat especially are in EVERYTHING packaged), that motor just keeps running all the time - so instead of the anxiety being full-blown 24/7, you feel better at home, and you also have better days (and worse days), it's not always perfectly consistent, which is based on the amount of foods you ingest that you're allergic to.

You can also be allergic to groups of stuff.  Grains in general (the grass family) are a growing allergy.  I kept reading study after study saying that sugar doesn't make kids bonkers &amp; writing that off because kids always go nuts on sugar, but as I paid attention to it, I realized that only some kids go bananas when they have sugar - they get crazy energy, they have mood swings, they have a high &amp; a low, they lose their ability to focus &amp; go into ADHD mode - for a lot of those kids, they have an undiagnosed grains allergy, which sugarcane is a party of.  So if you give them a Twinkie which is loaded up with corn syrup, sugarcane, wheat gluten, and all that, then it's an emotional time bomb for them.  But then I see people all the time eating them without any kind of reaction other than ""well that was yummy"".

Anywho, she gave me a packet about anxiety as well. After reading it and paying attention to my behaviour I'm thinking a lot of my problems are more related to anxiety. I never thought myself to have it. But when I go to clinicals at the hospital I get weird feelings.

Sometimes I have the ""what ifs"" about my SO. And by ""sometimes"" I mean like multiple times a week. Does medication help the what ifs and the feeling small? Or is that a state of mind I have to completely change? Does medication take away the choking feeling? And maybe the absence of those feelings will make my thoughts better?  

Idk. I'm just sick of feeling bad all the time. Therapy didn't seem to help a lot. I at least know how to tell what triggers certain thoughts. Unless they're completely wild and out of nowhere.

I love her so much and it was the greatest relationship ever. I always spent every second I could with her if it was possible. Until probably the worst day of my life so far arrived. Just to inform, I'm 16 and she's 18. But on this specific day, my girlfriend and I we're having sex (protected of course) and whatnot. It was right before she had to go to work and so after we finished the act, she dropped me off and she proceeded to go to work. 10 minutes after she dropped me off, her Mother called me, she had found out we we're in her house and we we're having sex. Obviously she was beyond furious and nearly blows her top yelling at me. Immediately, I was separated from her, all contact with her was cut until school came around. The week of the event was stressful but wasn't horrible. We we're going to get through this. I still loved her and wanted to be by her side. Later that week however, on the proceeding Sunday, something triggered me to have a odd thought. ""Is it worth it?"" That's all that was heard in my mind for the rest of the night. I was confident enough to comfortably say it was. I didn't want to leave her, the relationship we had was something so special, I didn't want to destroy something I built. However, as the following week continued, the thought transformed into ""Break-up with her."" That's what was only said in my head no matter what. I knew I didn't want to do that. But I fought the thought so hard it started to become worse (probably not the smartest idea at the time) and worse and tortured me for the next 6 weeks. As each week passed, I slowly had other problems pop-up too with the thought. I obtained a lack of focus in school, lack of focus on hearing myself and others, tunnel-vision, tiredness, etc. It became worse too. By week 4, looking at my girlfriend was hard. She didn't even look the same to me. I wanted to cry so much because this relationship was something I didn't want to let go of. I've been fighting these thoughts but also have learned to accept them and don't fight them as that'll induce more problems. Currently, I still don't want to break-up with as I still love her, but the problem still persists. The whole situation has caused tremendous anxiety and I don't know what to do now. I've been to the doctor and they prescribed me with Buspar, but I have yet to take it because I feel like meds aren't the answer. I am also waiting on a call from a psychiatrist to see what to do. I thought earlier today that I could have a fear of breaking up and may have to face it and see where to go from there. But I also fear that if I do that I won't feel the same about her anymore. What should I do? Can you relate? Please tell me about it. Anything helps. I don't want to get rid of this relationship but I guess my anxiety thoughts tell me different.",['nsubj'],1

I recently accepted a new job with a relocation to the USA, and working abroad has always been something I've wanted to do at some point in my life, and it's a really awesome job. I was really excited and happy at first, and I felt confident, now I've just signed the contract and it's got so real and I'm just totally losing it. I've suffered with anxiety for the past year, and it is always triggered by a big change, such as a new job or a new city. I realised that I enjoy feeling at ""home"" at my house and in my job, and moving away from that just sends me panicking, thinking if I am doing the right job, if I am living in the right place, if my life is what I want and all the other big anxieties...

I can't stop crying, I can't eat and I can't sleep well. I see a therapist and take some SSRIs, but I spent my last therapy session crying my eyes out because i was so scared, and the medication doesn't really help when I'm this on edge. I'm scared of not having my support network around me and enjoying my life as I do in London. Every now and again I feel excited but then it just descends into panic when I think about it. I also think about how much I will miss my therapist, as it is again a place I feel safe and secure. I maybe didn't realise just how much that meant to me. It's so difficult and I just wake up in a big panic. I know I can always just quit and go back to London, but then I think about how I will be letting people down and how I will have to live with the regret of not taking this opportunity. 

Has anyone else had any problems with relocation and anxiety? I would really appreciate any comments to help me deal with this. Or suggestions - should I just cancel my contract and just find a new job in the UK if I'm finding it this hard.

One thing that causes me a lot of stress is trying to decide if I want to have a baby now, later on or never. I constantly flip flop on this and think what if this happens, what if that happens. This is just one example. Another would be constant thinking maybe I should go back to school to the point that thinking about it stresses me out. (I have an associates degree in office administration and have a good job in this field but this job is based on a contract that has 3 yrs left and the office may close after that time and I worry I wouldn't be able to find another good job.)

There are times when I can be irrational with worry, especially if I am already stressed. An example of this would be my husband got a 25gallon fish tank in our upstairs apartment and I was convinced that it would fall over and ruin the floor and downstairs apartment and was crying almost hysterically. And now that a few days have passed I see now how irrational that was. 

Like I said my anxiety is greatly increased with stress and aggravation. Sometimes I feel normal. I wonder if possibly not having my time occupied enough causes some of my over thinking/ over analyzing. 

I just want to know if anybody else has had these problems and if they have sought medical help. And if they did what was the outcome? I am just really confused on if I am normal, but just a worrier or if I have crossed the line to having a mental health issue. Also I don't even know if over thinking/ over analyzing would fall under anxiety?

Back to my point, I'm so incredibly sad most of the time. I've tried 5 different medications for anxiety although I haven't been back to the doctor since I got dumped.

I really want to focus on dealing with this, as I have a daughter and I don’t want her to grow up with her mother being this way. I have vivid visions of terrible things happening - my daughter drowning, my husband crashing our car into a tree, my parents randomly dying, choking on a piece of steak and dying, my daughter eating a battery without us noticing and her dying, etc. The other day, my daughter fell (she’s one year old, kids fall, I get that) and she fell on her face, and I completely lost it. I imagined her breaking her neck with the fall and dying, right there on the spot. She seriously cried for five seconds and picked herself up and ran off, but I was completely lost for the rest of the day, crying and unable to snap out of it.

I have severe anxiety in the car and stopped driving six years ago. Even when I’m riding in the car, I’m so worried sick by the time we get anywhere that I can’t enjoy myself.

It seems that every day I’m just blinded by these thoughts, and the happier the day is, the worse they are. If I’m having a wonderful day, the invasive thoughts are that much more pervasive, and I have to remember to smile and force myself to not cry. I have always felt that I can’t allow myself to get too happy, because that’s when shit will hit the fan.

I love reddit, but I’m constantly hitting the “hide” button to keep myself from reading terribly depressing stories. I can only watch tv comedies anymore because I can’t deal with watching anything sad happening in fear of these invasive thoughts.

I could continue, but I think I’ve gotten my point across.

I’m asking two things of you, reddit: 1) what is this? ocd? gad? It doesn’t matter too much, I’m just curious. 2) More importantly, what books can I read to help myself? I understand that I may need more than a self-help book, but this is where I want to begin. I can’t help but think about a therapist sitting there listening to me and thinking “SNOOOOOOORE” while I blather on, and medicine is last resort for me, so I really want to start with some good reading.

I started getting terrible anxiety last year. My nan has problems with her health and has spare valium that she rarely uses. I had my first really bad panic attack last year, and my mum drove me down to her house (5 mins away) and gave me 2.5mg of valium. It helped immensely. So my nan gave me her bottle of valium, which I proceeded to use very sporadically (2.5mg about once a week max) for 6 months.

Gradually my anxiety got worse and I started needing them more. Especially in the past few months, and more so in the past couple weeks. I started taking whole, 5mg, pills. I'm not even fucking prescribed this shit yet am becoming dependent on it. This is bad and probably illegal. 

I need to taper off this quickly before it gets worse. My plan is to take 2mg for any bad anxiety I have and decrease that by 0.5mg each time I need it, eventually cutting it completely, and then finally seeing a doctor about my anxiety.

Two years ago, my world was shaken upside down. I was in my final year of high school. Stress was building with grad plans, university applications, diplomas, etc. I experienced my first ""get me the fuck out of here"" moment during my first round of exams in January, but it was very mild and left me confused momentarily. I suppose it was a sneak peak into what would happen in April of the same year. 

I was at school and sitting in my art class. Convinced I was going to vomit, I left the classroom. I felt awful but nothing was happening. My head was spinning. I had an instinct to run home as fast as I could, and I did. Left class, went home, had a bath, everything was fine. Again, I was really confused. The next day at work, all hell broke loose. It was nearing the end of my shift, and again, had a very strange urge to faint and run my ass out of there at the exact same time, and the room was spinning all over again. I had a feeling like something terrible was about to happen. My sister picked me up after I called her in a panic. I couldn't breathe at all, and I felt insanely out of control. I had to go to the emergency room, waited all night for them to run tests, assure me I was healthy, sedate me heavily, and diagnose me with anxiety disorder.

The next month was my version of hell. Being trapped in your own mind. Feeling betrayed by your own brain is horrible. I was thinking on a whole other level than I was before, as my reality had been fully warped. I literally thought I'd never smile again. I was too scared to live. Going places was extremely difficult if they were far from my house. I gave myself a week to bawl my eyes out at home. And the next week I went back to school. Forget diplomas, the challenge I faced was simply staying in a classroom for the entire class. But I did it, I graduated, and didn't let it stop me from properly celebrating in June. Slowly I got over the depression I faced near the beginning and the fear wore off. I learned to control it and censor my environment. I shielded myself from things that I knew would trigger anxious feelings like crowded places, heavy traffic, far away places, etc. 

In the duration of those few months, I spoke to a couple professionals. An emergency room doctor, a school therapist, and a couple psychologists. It didn't help with the not feeling crazy part, because everyone kept saying, you have a disorder. All I heard was, something's really fucking wrong with you.

I was given medication in April but only used it a handful of times, no pun intended. I've probably taken Ativan 10 or so times in 2 years. I didn't, and still don't, think it was good option for me. I hate the feeling of being numb to my surroundings. And I found that Ativan would make my mind hyperaware of things, while my body was too drowsy to actually make a scene.

Like I said, I've been censoring my environment and that's how I've kept my anxiety silent for the past long while. But last week, I was on vacation with a friend in a big strange city. I didn't have my car, therefore I wasn't in control of where we were going, or how fast we were going to get there. The thought of this made me uncomfortable before I left on this trip, but I honestly didn't even consider my anxiety really flaring up. I left my medication where it's been for the past couple years, in my nightstand.

Day 6 of a 7 day vacation, my mind had enough. I'd been keeping it in for so long that it was bound to break my stride. We were in a stuffy apartment and it was really hot out. Again with the breathing. I couldn't get enough air. My body overheated so quickly that I ran to get an icepack. The next hour is kind of a blur. I spent a lot of it on the ground in a cold sweat. I'd forgotten what it feels like to be that out of control of your mind, thinking SO irrationally, as well as losing control of your body. Attacks affect my hearing as well as my balance. My limbs go extremely tingly. And my mind is a complete disarray.

My flight was in the morning and the thought of this was sending me into more of a panic. I headed to a local hospital to get Ativan even though I was really hesitant. I'd viewed medication for anxiety as a crutch, or a sign of mental weakness. It's not. I don't believe it's necessary for everyone, but at the same time, taking medication when you feel you need it isn't necessarily a bad thing. I took one pill before the flight and got through it without an attack. Which is awesome. But since I've been home, my foundation has been shaken yet again.

I feel like I need to build a new reality. But it's been 7 days since I've been home, and every day has been a bit brighter than the last. 
I've realized my mistakes the first time I got an attack that I really want to share, so if you're still reading, props to you.

I ignored my feelings and emotions regarding anxiety. I wanted them to go away. I didn't want to believe I was ""crazy"" therefore I refused proper therapy. I pretended to be okay when I wasn't, and somehow, I was even fooling myself. I didn't delve into the root or triggers of my anxiety, I just knew what made me feel comfortable and in control and I stuck to that. My second fault was developing too much of a comfort zone. Life begins FAR from your level of comfort. The reason I said anxiety meds weren't for me is because I know once I can be relaxed in situations that make me uneasy, I won't be scared of them anymore, therefore controlling my anxiety. It's getting over the fear by knowing your limits and ignoring them. You know it's just the anxiety talking.

I'm working on doing things that I'm scared of slowly to develop an immunity to my irrational fears. I'm making dietary changes, lifestyle changes, including hot yoga and meditation, and spending a lot of time with friends. I'm on a waiting list for a 12 week therapy program to help combat my worries. I'm reading a bunch of books on anxiety disorders because the more I understand it, the less it scares me. The more I realize how not alone I am, the more comfort I feel. 

I'm sure I'll have another attack again. But I'm not scared anymore. People call anxiety attacks mini deaths for a reason. They are terrifying. Ironically, they're great reminders you're very much alive. Whatever you're feeling in that moment, it's going to pass. You're stronger than your anxiety. Tell it to fuck off. The more attention you give it, the worse it will be. I know it's easier said than done. I know all cases are different for everyone. I've never been a laidback person, always been a worrier. Doctors said it was bound to happen. So my disorder makes sense. But some people have attacks triggered by drugs or other kind of environmental factors. Which might make the attacks different, I'm not sure.

It's going to get better, and the more attacks you have, the stronger you'll become. The first time anxiety hit me, it knocked me down HARD. Like kicked me in the figurative balls, hard. And it scared me. And now, I had a terrible attack, and I'm back at work a few days later, smiling, talking to friends, getting into a normal routine WITHOUT getting overly comfortable in safe zones. Your only safe zone should be your body. I could really talk forever about this. I have a lot of feelings haha. If anyone has read this entire thing, I hope it's shed a bit of light, or helped you feel less alone. I've dealt with this for two years but still consider myself quite a newbie. I'm trying to do what's best for me, and I encourage you to do the same. Never give up hope and there is absolutely no shame in seeking help when you need it.

Also, [this poem](http://www.fleurdelis.com/desiderata.htm) calms me down like no other. My dad showed it to me and I read it whenever I'm feeling anxious.

Some background

After just ""getting by"" with medications I started to do some research and found that the medications can actually cause the anxiety I was feeling. 

So I decided to confront my anxiety and defeat it OR make life changes (divorce, easier job etc) to get healthy. I am even willing to let go of luxuries and lead a simpler life. 

I am 41(M) yr old male. I have been taking benzos and anti depressants for about 15 years and it has just about ruined my marriage. 

My wife and I are just roommates but we are currently staying for the kids and to avoid the total life upheaval. We both had affairs which really fucked up things more. 

My son has all kinds of mental issues and has been diagnosed on the autistic spectrum. He is very challenging with heavy disturbing meltdowns. 

My job is very stressful. Sales engineer with crappy company. Every presentation is one mistake away from being fired. Yet I have succeeded in almost 4 years here. 

Despite this I manage to hold a $150k+ job and raise my 3 kids.

On disability because I can't work. My anxiety and panic is from the fear of vomiting and I get depressed and anxious when the sun is out. First time I had a panic attack, someone told me it was heat exhaustion, and that's why I prefer cloudy, rainy days.

I'm going to be all over so accept my apologies.

And I'd much prefer to ease the anxiety with more natural remedies as I've never tried them. I tend to lead a more holistic lifestyle and don't use chemicals in my house and limit my intake of them in my diet, so ingesting these meds, well, to be honest, I think is going to lead to cancer.

I don't plan on stopping the medication without consulting my dr. I've come off these meds once before and it took me 6 months. 

Anyhow, I feel the meds are killing my marriage and I don't know what to do.

Let me talk about some of the things that make me feel anxious. I'd say one of the big things is the thought that I'm getting worse, that I'm going to end up losing my mind, I'm going to fall into some kind of deep anxiety spiral, etc. Many of the little mistake that I might make (e.g. misreading some words, maybe losing focus for a moment) can put these thoughts into my head. Another thing that can really terrify me sometimes is the thought that I would want to kill myself. Let me specify that I do **not** want to kill myself, but the thing that scares me is just the thought of ever having that desire, or the thought of myself putting a gun to my head. I guess this thought was first put into my head when filling out forms or reading something at the doctor when I first started having these anxiety issues. It said something about getting help if you're having suicidal thoughts or something along those lines. Then it went on to be like ""I don't want to deal with this anxiety anymore, what if I get to the point where I would end my own life to stop dealing with it?"" and just the thought of that really gets me going. 

I guess it's been kind of a rollercoaster for me, sometimes I've been having good weeks where I can almost say I feel borderline normal, and then there are the weeks where it starts going downhill and I feel like I'm really getting worse or something, and I guess the last week has been being one of those bad weeks. I've been having trouble eating over the last few days. This is usually worse in the morning, I might get more of an appetite as the day passes, but I might not even eat anything for the first half of my day. I have been going to the doctor and a psychiatrist. I enjoy the appointments and being able to talk about my experience, and I usually leave them feeling better. 

I've been taking escitalopram/lexapro for the anxiety. It started out at 10mg per day, where after that I felt alright for about a week but then started to go back into the more anxious feelings. My dosage was bumped up to 20mg, and I alternated 10mg/20mg each day until the 10mg ran out. I'm not sure how much the medication is really helping. I've become a very light sleeper I think. I used to sleep like 8-10 hours per night (I'm a college student on summer vacation, so I was able to just sleep at my leisure), but now I might wake up a few times in the night, and usually I'll end up waking up after 6-7 hours of sleep and I won't be able to fall back to sleep. I feel like the medication is to blame for that. I have a doctor appointment in 30 minutes, and I'm considering asking to get the dosage of the lexapro put down to 15mg. I felt alright when I was taking 10/20mg alternating, and I'm not sure how the solid 20mg is doing for my sleep and whatnot. 

Anyway, that's a bit of a summary of my experience with anxiety. Hope it wasn't hard to follow or anything. If anyone has anything to say or any questions, I would really appreciate it. This is really a pain in the ass, and I want to feel better.",['nsubj'],1

I've been feeling terrible lately, physically and emotionally. Although there are stresses in my life that could explain this; for example my dad is schitzophrenic and is currently having issues after years without an episode, my fiance who is my main support is away at college for the next month, I've been ill with kidney and sinus infections and work/social obligations are a cause of great stress for me. On top of that I was abused as a child, emotionally by my dad and sexually by another family member.

Usually I can cope with things pretty well, aside from the odd emotional meltdown (crying and self-loathing). But recently I've been feeling completely overwhelmed by day to day life. I'm always tired and often nauseous, have regular headaches and am not eating or sleeping well. I went to my doctor and told him all of the above. After considering everything he suggested I might have General Anxiety Disorder but said medication wouldn't be his recommendation at this time. I'm also having weekly counselling sessions which are helping with my self esteem and childhood issues. However my counsellor thinks I am a quiet BPD. I was also previously diagnosed with depression which I've suffered from on and off for 10 years now.

Basically I feel like I'm doing everything I can to help myself but nothing is helping very much. I feel like my doctor doesn't understand what I'm going through and I can't talk to my family because they have enough to deal with with my dad. On the bright side my partner is amazing, truly my saviour and my rock. I talk to him on the phone every night. But still for some reason I feel completely disconnected from him (and a little resentful) when he's away for long periods.

This is my first post here so be kind. I don't expect you guys to help me but I've tried everything else. 

Maybe I am just broken.",['nsubj'],1

Let me start at my first panic attack; I got stabbed in the arm with a pencil at school by someone ""screwing arround"" the result was me seeing blood dripping down my arm and then I remember everything sounding muffled going white and waking up on the floor about a minute later with the whole class standing above me. Embarassing right? I had never passed out before, and this was a very uncomfortable feeling. My mother picked me up from school everything was OK I felt rattled but I went to school the next day and was fine. A few days later we were in class and I got a really uneasy feeling and the same thing happened, muffled hearing and then white out and I apparently threw back my head but stayed in my chair this time and passed out/had like a seisure (I guess I was not conscience but was shaking like you would from a seisure, but I'm not epileptic) Following this episode I would get dizzy spells that were quite aweful, it would feel like the floor was moving, and it was very unnerving.

After this my mother got worried and I was sent for a barrage of test. My mother had Lupus (She is now passed away due to other reasons) So they wanted to test me for that as well as a number of other diseases such as Lupus, Diabetes, thyroid, and even Brain tumors. 
So her I am a 18 year old girl, an A student taken out of school to get these medical tests done. Because I'm in Canada these tests take a long time to get, and then a long time to recieve the results ect... Because of all of this I developed Health Anxiety as a result of thinking I had a brain tumour or some other deadly illness at a young age. 

I have been on paxil made me gain 30lbs and brought me upto 200lbs, already self conscience of my weight at 170lbs, it didnt exactly help me and didn't seem to do anything for my anxiety. 

When this medication after 6 or so months failed to do anything I was put on Effexor. I dropped the 30lbs that I had gained and then some going down to about 160lbs, I don't atribute this solely to the drug as I was also taking care of myself as well via working out/eating right, but still it didnt seem to be doing much for my symptoms even at the highest dose.

I was then given a miricle drug; or so I thought called klonopin. I was to take 0.5 a day as needed on top of the effexor. This made it so my anxiety was actually gone! I had about  6-7 months anxiety free, then I started to get some rebound anxiety, nothing major. 

Now I should note that I did not have a family doctor at this time, I was perscribed these meds from a clinnic physcian, and eventually I stopped taking the effexor and only took the klonopin when needed. 
The doctor at the clinnic stopped giving me the klonopin, I had no pills left, no warning nothing just said he wasn't going to fill it for me anymore (he had no reason to do this, I had no prior drug issues or anything of the sort) I went through horrible withdrawls and ended up at the hospital where they then gave me back the klonopin but to be taken once daily. 

Since then I have been upped to 2x a day for the last 2 years. This last 6 months or so I have had worse anxiety then I have ever had. I have been bursting out in crying fits for no reason, I have been having all of these physical ailments which have prompted me to seek medical attention such as lump in my throat that is persistantly there, chest pains, pains in my legs/arms and cramping in my hands and feet. I have started to get the dizzy spells again, and my doctor told me to take 3x klonopins a day when needed but it still doesn't seem  to be working all that great, I'm suposed to start this new pill called cymbalta to try and help with some of the phyiscal pain symptoms that I am having which because of my HA I talked about earlier I'm  not entirely sure is just anxiety



So thats where I stand so far with my anxiety, I'm hesitant to start this new med but when I do I will document it for you guys. Thanks for listening to my story. ","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1

Every pain is now a symptom of a deadly disease (I've never had hypochondria before, but my mom has tendencies). I retreat from social situations unless they're absolutely necessary (ie. going to the store, gym). I don't have a job and I don't go to school and this just causes more stress in my life because I feel like I'm wasting my time and my days are numbered (everyone's days are numbered, but it doesn't help that I'm wasting mine for LONG periods of time. I've been unemployed for about 3 months and I'm searching like crazy with no real luck). 

And then there's my mom. It's just me and her in the house and everything that comes out of her mouth is some form of complaint. Even in casual conversation, there's some criticism about people she encountered at work, or gossip about the neighbors (she can never mind her own fucking business and that goes for most of my family as well), or something about how my deadbeat dad is a piece of shit, or just putting me down in whatever way she can. She compares me to my dad nearly every day and tells me to go get a job when she knows I'm trying (she even did this the very day after I quit my last job when she supported my decision to quit). 

My brother's aware of the things that go on and how unhappy I am, so he got me an appointment with a local doctor. He's paying for it (which makes me feel bad because I don't want to break his wallet. This in itself gives me some anxiety) and says he'll get me a psychiatrist appointment as well.

This time I'm willing to try medication. I'd seen someone previously and she offered to prescribe me pills for my depression (anxiety wasn't yet a factor) but I refused because I thought I could treat my depression naturally and make my life improve on its own. Yeah, that got me to where I am now. Not my best plan, though I guess my heart was in the right place. More or less I didn't want to become a zombie like some people said happened once people were put on meds. But now that I see that my depression isn't going anywhere but instead manifesting itself into other horrors, maybe medication is the right route to take.

The soonest I can see someone is February 17th and I'm happy because this is the first step. But I'm also nervous because that's so far away. I have over a month to deal with my worries on my own. I know it shouldn't be a problem because if I've dealt with it for this long, another month won't hurt, but I'm freaking out because I want answers NOW. Why is my mind torturing me like this? Why is my anxiety creating physical symptoms of faux-maladies? This sucks.

This community is wonderful and always provides great answers to those who come in their hour of need, so I just have to ask: What should I do in the meantime? ","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1

Today, I decided to educate myself and read a lot about anxiety and other people's experiences. Sometimes that's hard for me to do because thinking/reading about anxiety often GIVES me anxiety. I constantly find myself unable to convince myself that nothing is wrong with me, I'm constantly paranoid that something bad is happening/going to happen, that I'm going to die or something is wrong in one way or another. I did a lot of research on fight or flight response and how/when my triggers take effect. I get anxiety while driving, I get anxiety when I'm hungover, I get anxiety when I'm tired or didn't get enough sleep, I get anxiety when someone texts me a paragraph text while I'm driving and I can't read it or respond. I get anxiety when I can't type a text fast enough. I get anxiety when I write in my journal for a long period of time. I get anxiety that I'm going to get anxious around people and people will see me act crazy. I get anxiety when I think about my friends. I get anxiety when I think about my exbest friend and my exboyfriend. I get anxiety when I'm working and I'm scared that I'll get dizzy and crash into someone. I've done a lot of research and I thought I had social anxiety, driving anxiety, I thought I was a hypochondriac, I thought I had claustrophobia, I always think if I've drank the night before that I'm having alcohol withdrawals or I'm super unhealthy, that my ADHD medication is the reason for anxiousness (even though it's never ever been a problem in my 10 years of being on it)... but because I've thought ALL of those things and I relate to each and every single one of those and I know it's unlikely it's ALL of them, I've discovered that it might just be more specific than that. I've narrowed it down and think that I've discovered that what I have is [anticipatory anxiety](http://panicdisorder.about.com/od/symptoms/a/anticianxiety.htm). This means that all of those thoughts/symptoms that I have that fall under each of those categories are all just me anticipating/worrying the worst in each situation. I anticipate and worry in ALL of them.

For the first time I don't feel as crazy. I've read so many of your guy's posts and responses and can relate to ALL of you. For me, this whole anxiety/panic attack thing for the last year and 6 months has left me feeling so alone and different from anyone. I always thought no one understood me and therefore I felt completely lost. For once, I feel like I'm not lost. I feel more confident that I'm going to be okay. That if I have a panic attack, it's going to be okay.

Reading about the ""[Fight or Flight Response](http://www.thebodysoulconnection.com/EducationCenter/fight.html)"" really helped me put my anxiety and my constant ""worrying"" into perspective. I encourage you all read this from time to time, and THINK hard about it and let it be comforting to you that your body is doing this to try to protect you, not hurt you. Try to make yourself believe that worrying about your body doing this to you is what's making your body do that to you. You should accept that your body does this because it's an amazing, complex and beautiful thing. You're body knows how to save itself when you let your mind play a trick on it. You're not crazy. You just have a hard time sometimes. I'm not crazy. I just struggle with my thoughts. I feel for you all, you're not alone. 

I'm deciding right now that I'm going to pick myself up. I'm going to do things for myself that make me feel good and not worry when I'm doing them. I'm going to shower every morning and get ready/do my makeup, straighten or curl my hair EVEN if I'm not going anywhere and don't have anything to do. I'm going to make my bed after I get up, I'm going to give myself manicures and pedicures when I'm bored.. I'm going to floss more, I'm going to hang up my paintings in my room, I'm going to wear lipgloss and not feel like I'm ""wasting"" it because no one is seeing me with it on. I'm going to do all these things.. and it's going to feel nice.

TLDR : My counsellor wants to close my case but I've not learnt any coping mechanisms, and I haven't resolved any of my issues, or even identified them. 

The chunky bit: 
I've had anxiety for years, since as early as maybe 2008. My anxiety was originally to do with my dad's health, because he had a severe infection ( he had a compromised immune system) and nearly died. Since that incident, I've had fears about his death, or ill health. That was at least fine, because I had an identifiable trigger. In 2010, my dad did pass away, and my worst fear came to pass. At that time I thought the amount of grief in me would never let me live again, and I spent 2011 basically in bed. My anxiety became worse, but did not have any identifiable triggers. One of my dad's last wishes was for me to graduate from university, so in 2012, I gave it another try. My anxiety blanked my mind out in exam, and I did badly. 2013, I decided to seek medical help for my anxiety, after realising I was trapped in my thoughts, and unable to move on. 

As part of the recovery process, I was introduced to a counsellor, and my sessions with her was monthly. Despite my requests to have fortnightly meetings, it didn't materialise at all, and my monthly meetings with her were mainly her just catching up on what happened in the month, and that was what we would do for the half hour session. Sometimes I would lose contact with her because of a busy schedule, and she would never make any effort to catch up with me. Until she contacted me to close my case, I had actually forgotten that I had a counsellor.  

In all my sessions with her, I've only talked about my current issues and frustrations, but not made any progress towards correcting my flawed thought patterns and my issues. I don't know what my triggers are, or how to control my anxiety. All I had, and have to rely upon is my willpower to curb the outward symptoms. But because the outward symptoms are controlled (I look fine on the surface, but I might be having a panic attack with heart palpitations, or my hands might be trembling and not much else), my counsellor has kept emphasizing that my symptoms are mild. 

Every session, she would remind me that my symptoms are mild, and she sees others who might be younger than me with worse symptoms. It's had the effect (probably unintended by her, but I don't know for certain) of making me feel guilty for seeking help. 

My closest friend initially bought in to the idea that my anxiety was mild (I also talk to her about my anxiety), but she recently spoke up and said that she doesn't think this is so. 

My friend says to me that even though I have no outward symptoms or severe, debilitating panic attacks, my anxiety is actually permeating every aspect of life, and keeping me from moving out of my very narrow comfort zone. She also says that she thinks I might be downplaying my issues subconsciously because the counsellor keeps insisting that it's *mild*, but when I'm in the grip of an attack and trying to verbalize it to my friend, it's a veritable storm of fears and issues.

And I guess I'm just kind of angry, that my counsellor hasn't helped much, and has kept using language that downplays my issues. I'm frustrated that after a year of counselling sessions (I've actually checked my calendar, and I've only had **four** sessions), she's decided to close my case. 

I've had negative experiences with counsellors in the past. My school counsellor ( 2008- 2009) refused to admit that I might have anxiety, depression or PTSD (from my father's near death) and instead told the principal that I was a danger to my class (nearly getting me expelled) when I told her I was having disturbing thoughts (certainly nothing to do with causing harm to my class or myself, I think I was having visual and auditory hallucinations from stress).

My current counsellor certainly isn't helping me to shift that negative perception that counsellors just don't do very much in general (in my country- I'm from Singapore).

So, aside from ranting, I'm just wondering, **what do you normally experience when it comes to counsellors, therapists or psychologists?** My doctor says I need a psychologist or counsellor to work through my issues, and that medicine only helps so much, which I agree. But I don't really know what these people actually do.

**Quick bio**:

* I'm a 20-something year old male.

* I'm a student in college, it's all I do.

-----

**Preemptive tl;dr**:

About 1.5 years ago I began attempting to treat my depression/anxiety.  So far I've done trials for 5 different medications, each one has failed.  I don't even notice I'm taking the medication, I feel absolutely no different in any way.  I'm unsure if I'm somehow going about this wrong.  The largest source of my anxiety is school, I'm extremely scared of homework.

-----

-----

###Story

So far, every medication I've tried has been an utter failure.  These medications are:

* Effexor
* Zoloft
* Xanax
* Prozac
* Lexapro

I took the maximum allowed dosage for each.  I exercise (though not currently, I'll start up again next month), used to take vitamins B and D (no longer bother to since I saw no difference after a year of use), and have been taking care to eat meals around the same times every day (as per direction of my doctor, I guess somehow irregularity of meals causes depressed moods).

I wouldn't be so angry if I at least felt *something* when I took these medications.  At no time during any of my 5 trials could I even tell I was taking the medication, it felt the exact same when I was taking the medication as when I wasn't.  To test this, when I was supposed to transition off of a few of the medications, I didn't bother to taper off; instead, I went from taking the maximum dosage one day to not taking any from the next day on - I noticed nothing.  I don't understand what I'm doing wrong - I would think that I would at least feel *something*; I'm not expecting anything dramatic, I just expected to feel something.

There were some side-effects, though, mostly related to sleep.  Some of the medications made me very slightly more sleepy throughout the day (which was really bad given that this is actually the largest reason I was seeking help in the first place), but also probably the worst side-effect was intensifying my RLS to the point that I couldn't control my leg movement when I laid down and wouldn't be able to sleep for days.  So I guess I sort of lied... the only effect I've had so far are side-effects.

-----

###Questions

*I guess I have some questions that have been on my mind for a while*:

* What if I'm actually not depressed/anxious?  Is this the reason the medications have no effect on me?  **Would someone who's not depressed/anxious notice any effects from taking medication?**

* I notice that when I'm in a social situation/around people that my depression and anxiety are completely gone (for this reason I definitely want to get a job this summer).  Is this normal for people with depression/anxiety that being around people makes it go away, or is it always present for you at the same degree?

* I'll be honest.  Sure, my depression sucks, but it's something I can live with.  I can't live with my anxiety - it's screwing up my school grades and thus my life.  Should I ask my doctor to only prescribe medication for anxiety only, ignoring my depression until later?

-----

###Goals

My goals with treating my depression/anxiety are as follows:

* Be able to take on my homework without overwhelming anxiety.  I used to be a straight-A student, now I'm averaging at least one failed class per semester because I'll go days/weeks where I can't motivate myself to even open my school bag while I sit in a chair/lay in bed panicking.  Homework has always been extremely scary to me... I have phobias that don't even compare to how scared I am when I encounter homework (and unfortunately homework is a fear I have to face every single fucking day)... but at least when I was younger I could convince myself (after several hours) to just do it, now I can't, something about me changed.

* Obtain the ability to be interested in things again.  I haven't had a single interest since middle school; all I do is school and sleep/eat.

* No longer feel tired throughout the day.

I suspect that I may have Social Anxiety as well considering I will go out of my way to avoid interacting with people including friends. I have a history of depression that I've been struggling with since I was 18. I've been in and out of outpatient therapy since I was 18, usually at my university health center. I started a new course of therapy in July with a new psychiatrist and therapist since I can no longer see my past therapists due to leaving school. 

The psychiatrist switched my meds from Celexa to Pristiq and I've had three sessions of talk therapy for 45 minutes each. I usually can only see my therapist every three or four weeks and my psychiatrist every three months. The med change has made a huge difference and therapy has helped some. Just knowing that I have an anxiety disorder and that I'm not crazy has helped, except that I am still not where I would like to be. I feel like all I do in my therapy sessions is just catch my therapist up on what I've been doing in the month since I saw her, briefly talk about my moods, and then watch her make notes in my treatment plan. I would really like to get to the root of why I'm anxious and depressed, and figure out how to manage my anxiety. 

I had several panic attacks today and my dad mentioned that I might try changing therapists or getting more intensive treatment because 45 minutes of talk therapy a month doesn't seem to be cutting it. I need help, I am tired of being anxious and afraid, I want to get better. I don't want to just take a pill and be done with it, I know that meds won't cure anything, they just make things manageable. The thing is I don't know how to ask for more. Do I just be blunt with my therapist? I'm also worried that since I'm not suicidal or have a history of suicide attempts that I'm not eligible for intensive outpatient, let alone inpatient.

If you have anxiety and you have not tried CBT, that would be a really good place to start.

If you have really bad anxiety, yes, sometimes medication is useful but medication doesn't change your thoughts which means you are more likely to relapse when you go off and you will have more trouble with withdrawal symptoms just because it will freak you out more.

If you have CBT sessions and you are on anti-anxiety medication, your brain will not learn very well to habituate to everything that makes you anxious. This may explain why CBT hasn't worked for you in the past. Some medications are ok to take with CBT, some aren't.

Anxiety is very treatable. CBT should be the first step. There is so much scientific evidence showing that it is a very effective treatment.

Why do I feel like this isn't even general knowledge on this thread?

The aim should NOT be to remove anxiety altogether from your life, but to be able to live with it and not be bothered by it anymore. 

I shall await the downvotes. This just makes me sad.

I deall with some crippling anxiety, I have for as long as I remember. Even when I was young I worried constantly about littl things that I now realize never mattered. I always knew I had anxiety but never seen it as a huge problem, let alone a mental illness spawning from a chemical imbalance. Never really had any confidence. I'm pretty critical of myself, but I've learned to come to terms with my physical flaws. I always feel liike im being judged or evaluated when im in public. As if everyone's eyes are on me and that they're thinking of me as a freak or a weirdo when odds are, I probably blend in like everyone else. My thoughts are constantly racing. I have been taking Celexa since 5th grade (Im in 12th grade now) and recently had my dosage upped to 30mg. Fucking hell. Never have I felt so jittery, depressed, worthless, and unable to communicate. I felt sad so much, figured it was a side effect of the medicine. Brought the dosage down to 20mg again but in transition my anxiety has returned and is burdening me every day. But the worst part of it all is, is that I get emotional when asking for help. I feel so worthless and stupid when I ask for help. I have always been a successful student and pride myself with my education, but recently in my college pre-calc class ( Im dual-enrolled) I have been needing help but cant ask for it without going red in the face and beginning to cry. Im a fucking 17 year old young man and can't ask for help with my math homework without crying. Understand why I feel so worthless and stupid sometimes? I hate this so much. The only way I can describe my anxiety is as if its just 'there'. Always. In my head, churning towards the back of my skull, always always making me worry, putting irrational thoughts in my head. For a while, I was even scared i was becoming schizophrenic, convincing myself i was hearing auditory hallucinations like ""worthless child"" and ""hey fucker"" constantly. I have since, ruled these out to be my own paranoia and irrational thinking. I'm still deeply concerned, I feel so different everywhere I go and so worthless. No explanation behind any of my worries, other than because it's 'there'. It's always 'there' in my head. I don't know where to turn or who to talk to. 


My dad has since scheduled a psych evaluation so hopfully I can get properly medicated because the medicine i take now is always a tossup between crippling fear or crushing sadness. I feel so trapped...

My eyes slowly roam over a disgustingly bright pink lamp. A cheap, store bought peice of crap. The shade has been painstakingly decorated with pink, glittery flowers.

My sight eventually shifts to another of my crappy little 'creations' - an embossed peice of card decorated with brightly coloured flowers - before shifting once again. This time to a ridiculously childish glitter picture I'd once again personalised by adding paint to the outlines.

I sigh miserably. When will I ever use/need any of this useless junk? Why do I bother? I can't remember the last time I felt cheerful or had the urge to make things 'pretty'.

Wait.. yes I do.. Yesterday. Though yesterday feels like at least three days ago. What day is it? My shoulders feel heavier...

.. Until they don't. My breathing deepens. My heart flutters. My eyes open. My spirit lifts, and my world seems colourful. A grin rapidly spreads across my face. I feel energized. Invigorated. The cloud, once again, lifts. I remember.

Monday. Today is Monday. I turn on my beautiful lamp, and brighten my worktable. My hobby table. I pull my awesome glitter picture in front of me, directly into the lamp light - it shines brightly - I get out my paints and hunch over, my face mere inches from my work, concentrating.

After a while I notice my shoulders are aching. I sit up and stretch, and realise my kitchen is a mess. I should be cleaning!

I put away my art supplies and turn up the volume on the TV, which is almost always on. The Real Housewives Of Melbourne is on. I giggle to myself. They're so caught up in so much bullshit... I clean the kitchen, and the loungeroom.. I'm so focused and driven!

Once I finish, I sit back down to my hobby. 'Til I realise my attention is waning. I realise I'm staring into space. I shove my projects away and bring my feet up onto my chair. I feel a sharp pain and a sudden wetness on my fingers. I look down and see blood, then realise I've torn my toenail off again. I switch to my other foot and stare blankly at the television.

The ridiculous Housewives are babbling on about some bullshit, and I glare at them. Why are they so happy? So angry? So self absorbed? What's the point?

My shoulders hunch as my energy continues to wane. That hot tickle of dread returns. If I had the energy, I'd glare at the happy glittery art and lamp. But I don't. I don't care to. I don't want to. I can't be fucked.

My chest feels hot, and I don't need to look down to know my nerve rash is in full force. Angry red blotches from my hair line to my stomach. I'm confused. I'm safe inside... My doors, windows, curtains.. they're all shut up tight. I remember.. I'm going out tomorrow.. that must be it.. that's why I'm so scared. I start to feel sick. I have a crippling pain in my stomach. At least it's not as bad as it used to be; vomiting 'til I pass out... having to sit in a hot shower, letting the hot water run down my tummy 'til the spasming stops..

I sigh and know I'll feel this way 'til tomorrow. Another day, another 10 assorted pills... then I'll feel human again. 'Normal', happy, carefree, invigorated... until the medication wears off again.. Until my next prescribed doseage.

I glare at the TV. Why do they get to stay so light and happy?

My husband walks into the kitchen and starts speaking to me - I scream.. horrified and panicked. He rolls his eyes and walks away.

My heart slows down again... I'll be better tomorrow.. after my meds.. not so useless and high strung..

I sit at the kitchen table.. if I had the energy I'd glare at the happy pictures and the lamp. But I don't. I don't care. I can't be fucked. Until my heart flutters and I'm again a productive human being... But I always know it won't last. Nothing lasts.

Wait! I know! The one other thing that makes me feel okay. Lighter. Happier. Carefree. I pour myself a drink. Wine, vodka, beer, rum, scotch.. I don't mind! I light a cigarette to burn away the horrid taste.

Until tomorrow...

I had a troubling experience with my psychiatrist the other day, and I wanted your input on what to do about it.  I have severe anxiety that starts with chest pain and ends up with stuttering and not being able to breathe.  This has happened at work too where I work at a front desk and deal with hundreds of people a day.  So medication is unfortunately necessary for the time being to calm my body down.  I should also mention that bulimia with anorexic tendencies are intertwined with my anxiety.  I have tried Lexapro, Prozac, and Cymbalta for it, but as you may know anti-depressants can increase anxiousness, which it has every time with me.  The one and only thing that has worked thus far is Xanax.  No, I am not an addict, I barely take it once a week, unless it's a very very bad week, and I use it as a last resort only.  I hadn't seen her in about five months and went through about 20-30 Xanax, and ran out, which is why I went back to see said psychiatrist.  She told me that my chest pain was acid reflux from the purging (even though I said it doesn't correspond to when I purge or eat), but that I don't purge often enough to really be bulimic in her eyes.  She also said Xanax in the long run was not an option for her so she would not be prescribing it for me from here on out, but refused to try to find any other solution other than giving me Cymbalta and kicking me out the door.  Sooo I feel like I was treated a bit like a junkie.  Is that too sensitive of me?  What do I do in this situation?  

I've had chest pain every day in the 1 1/2 weeks since I've seen her and I'm really irritable and talking is difficult.  Should I stick it out, stand up to her, or just see someone else entirely?  I hate finding someone new, it always seems like I have to be on the defense (which maybe I should be, I don't know).

Any suggestions on what I should do or what medications or therapies have worked best for you I would love to hear!","['nsubj', 'nsubj']",1

When she went in, I told her to ask her doctor about a recommendation on who to go for for acid reflux, as it has prevented her from eating properly and is losing weight.  During their consultation the doctor decided (without any testing) that her weight loss is due to her anxiety causing mild anorexia, and sent her home with no recommendation, and instead a prescription for Zoloft (generic). 

He told her she 'could' see a regular doctor if she wanted.  This seems odd to me.  This seems like getting ibuprofen instead of a cast for a broken arm.  We ARE going to seek a second opinion, but my wife wants to start taking the Zoloft immediately because her Neurologist said so, but I am hesitant to start her on mind altering medications just yet, especially over a very mild form of anxiety (especially when Anxiety was not even close to the issue we were there for, See: Epilepsy/Acid Reflux). 

I guess in my ramblings I misplaced my question, but does this seem like odd behavior to anyone else?  Does she really need an SSRI to help prevent acid reflux?  And would you think medication is necessary for someone extremely high functioning?  She works, socializes, does normal human things.  Just gets tense from time to time.

I am new to posting here. I haven't posted before. I am actually suffering through some panic simply trying to figure out how to ask this, especially of people I don't know. My entire life, people have downplayed and negated my anxiety. 

I have had issues with general anxiety for the majority of my life. Beginning in middle school, I was teased so horribly (but forced to endure it silently as per teachers and my narcissistic mother) that I began developing anxiety even surrounding going into school. When I switched for high school, it improved - until my first major relationship broke up. 

I was convinced I was in love with him, he was ""the one."" (Stupid, I know.) 

Two weeks after he left me for good, my grandmother passed away. I was extremely close to her. I had an absolute mental breakdown. Welcome, major depression and extreme panic attacks! 

I was forced into therapy, the wrong therapy. I was forced onto medications, the ones that have caused my current cognitive impairment. I was forced - no one listened because I was not 18. 

With all of those things built up, I began having cyclic panic attacks. Severe ones that would not enable me to finish my high school in the actual building. I had to finish my credits online. 

Over the course of the 5 years following high school, I was involved in an abusive relationship. The panic attacks and physical symptoms were out of control. I could hardly stay at work a full day, I didn't sleep, I was over-eating and over-drinking, I would have panic attacks for no reason... And at this point us when the panic became unmanageable. 

My symptoms go as follows (even to this day): 
-heart starts beating so hard I can feel it through my chest (and see my skin moving) 
-my hands and feet begin to sweat so profusely I can neither hold anything (I'm a hairstylist) nor continue wearing my shoes. 
-my hands begin visibly shaking 
-my breath becomes shallow, no matter how hard I remind myself to take slow, even breaths. 
-my legs grow increasingly weak at the same time as my mind fogs up entirely, always causing me to question if I'm going to black out.
-if I'm inside, I must get outside. That very moment. No questions asked. 
-if I can't leave, I begin bawling on top of everything else. Uncontrollably. I can't stop it, the harder I try ... The worse it gets. 
-if I am at work, I must go home immediately. 
-I will run away if cornered or touched. 
-I end up beating the side of my head repeatedly &amp; calling myself ""retarded"" or ""failure"" 
-every thought in the world rushes through my head. 
-I cannot drive.
-I often cannot speak during panic episodes. 
-I cannot sleep or stay still, I can't sit still at all if I'm panicking.
-I fidget uncontrollably and will not make eye contact. I wait, then I bolt. 
-I can't handle people looking at me funny, talking in low whispers, or even existing in a certain capacity. I just want to run. 
-I will spend hours in bed, in the dark, after having a panic attack whilst in the midst of having a major depressive episode. 
-it causes me anxiety to be dirty, or have dirty spaces... But I have no willpower to clean because I'm petrified of screwing up. 
-I can't go to the grocery store without a buddy. 
-I can hardly remember what I'm supposed to be doing when confronted with others. 
-I can no longer work because of its severity, and the fact that medications triple the severity of every issue I have had (and I've been trying all kinds of meds for over 10 years) 


So, all that out there... My life is pretty miserable at times. I can function but I barely do so. I mostly am unable to do anything without my partner. 

I have applied for disability and medical coverage 3x. I am going on my fourth attempt, after almost 6 months of being unemployed. They counted an employment that lasted two weekends before I left in sheer panic, speeding the entire hour it took me to get home, as ""gainful."" 

That was the first job I'd attempted to take since October of the previous year. That lasted two weekends, as well. I left because my anxiety and I could not handle work (even after months of intensive therapy). 

I am at a loss. I cannot work, and my SO and I cannot afford to not be homeless if I don't get disability this time. They take one look at my age &amp; my condition, and they practically deny me. 

I have yet to refute their claim of not qualifying. I'm wondering if I should have friends &amp; family prepared to send in statements for me. I'm just not even sure where to start, and the whole process is absolutely overwhelming me &amp; adding to my anxiety.","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1

I got fired halfway through an internship in Florida and moved back in with my mom for a while. Came out of the closet, fell in love with an amazing young man (who's honestly been the BEST thing that's happened to me since I moved home), and scraped by on a waiter job until I had enough to move elsewhere.

I found a full-time job that ended up exacerbating my anxiety, as did the next one. I've played brain juice roulette with a total of 3 different medications and 1 supplement, and the 3rd medication is doing reasonably well. My car died September of last year, a couple weeks after I went to the ER for suicidal thoughts; I returned in an ambulance 2 months after that. The last job fired me on my anniversary with them--the longest I've ever continuously been employed with a company--because of those mental issues; fortunately now I'm on Medicaid and unemployment, seeking vocational rehab, and working a part-time job until I can get back on my feet. Unfortunately, my cell phone was stolen right out of my hands on the bus ride home from work last night.

I feel mentally, physically, and emotionally tired and spent and I'd like to take a vacation to someplace warm ASAP. Good news is that I have about a thousand dollars in savings, mostly for rent, as well as some awesomely supportive friends and family.

Several anxiety attacks were had, and I decided to pursue treatment. The therapy didn't really help (it may have just been my therapist), but I began taking medication to clear the fog. It worked wonders, and for a while I felt great. Eventually the medication started doing more harm than good, though. It was simply less effective, and the side effects were getting worse. I quit cold turkey (which was probably really stupid of me), but the weird thing was that I didn't suffer any withdrawal symptoms. In fact, I felt great once I was off it.

I quit about 4 months ago now. Things have been completely fine for the majority of the time. Then, a few weeks ago, I started dating somebody for the first time in a couple years. Things have been going really well, and I'm genuinely happy to be with her. 

For some reason though, this new relationship has caused my anxiety to slowly creep back into my life. It's really distressing, because I don't understand why it's happening. I've been in relationships before and had no problems (granted, those were before my bouts with depression and anxiety began). This relationship with her did start really quickly compared to other relationships I've had. We didn't really know each other that long before we started dating, so a part of me wonders if this has something to do with my anxiety.

Despite everything that's going well, the tiniest negative things can trip me up and color my whole attitude. It could be the way she's says something, or I could say something stupid, and anxiety will just grow out of these really minute things (which I already know is a negative feedback loop). From there it makes it really difficult to focus on my normal day-to-day life, because I'm constantly preoccupied with analyzing those moments over and over. At times it even physically hurts.

I know this is unhealthy, and I know it's just my mind playing tricks on me, but I don't know how to make it stop. There really aren't any problems in our relationship as of right now, and I feel like it's too early to be worrying so much. It's also too soon to talk with her about these things though.

I'm 19, work full time and am on my father's insurance, however he has no idea about my problems and we really don't have a close relationship (I would shut myself in my room for hours and play video games when I was younger just to avoid any social interaction).

Exactly two years ago, I had a massive panic attack which led me to ER. 

Today, I have somewhat controlled my anxiety level, I am still experiencing anticipatory anxiety as well as social anxiety. 

When it started two years ago, I was scared to do anything. Taking a shower alone took me courage to do, driving alone seemed impossible at the time. 

Now I can drive alone fine - though I do get somewhat anxious time to time still- I think I've managed to accomplish the tasks seemed impossible two years ago. 

But here comes the parts that really bother me even to this day. 

My neck is constantly tensed and I get obsessed with my breathing. Like I am manually breathing. Because of this poor breathing especially in social situations, I get really intense neck tension also these compulsive (urges) thoughts that I want to scream or lose control. 

Are there still form of anxiety disorder? 
I haven't taken any med and these days I am starting to consider med because of these consistent thoughts and physical symptoms. 

I was thinking of getting Celexa for these symptoms. Anyone here share similar experiences ? And how did meds help you get better? 

I also get these compulsive thoughts when driving, walking near cars, trains, etc that what IF i lose control of myself and hurt myself? 
Also I feel so angry and frustrated that I am still having to deal with these symptoms for almost everyday... 

Any help will be appreciated. Thank you",['nsubj'],1

I'm on holiday at the minute and feel like I might be at the beginning of an anxiety spiral.

I paid in advance for a tour, then they gave me a map which wasn't correct to get there and incorrect directions on the phone. They then left without me and won't give me a refund. It was 100 euro for all of us, which I paid for as a present.

This is a lot of money to me and it's eating at me. I'm anxious about it and now I'm anxious that anxiety will ruin my holiday. I'm so frightened of spiralling down into my anxiety/depression that I'm anxious. The joy.

I have my medication with me, but this is really bothering me. A few months ago I couldn't really leave the house and was deeply suicidal, so this was meant to almost be a celebration for me, in a sense.

Any tips on how to try to break the spiral? At least the medication allows me to ask other people like you folks for help now.

The actual anxiety attacks come and go, but anxiousness is always lurking. I've heard being bipolar and having anxiety often go hand in hand.

Holy sweet mother of fuck. I've been unable to sleep unless I'm totally exhausted recently, since I've just been straight-up scared of sleeping, or panicked about suddenly dying in my sleep from carbon monoxide poisoning, or thinking about all the horrible ways I could die that I have absolutely no control over. Normally, my anxiety medication is fine for this, but now I'm moving. My family and I have an entire house to renovate, which leads to a lot of arguments about how to best spend our money and time improving the house, and the simple act of just doing all the labor such as putting in flooring and painting walls is exhausting for everyone. On top of this, I'm struggling in school to keep my grades up and get work done, which has me pushing myself harder and harder and harder, but the harder I push the more stressed I get, which exacerbates not only my anxiety, but also my ADHD, which then makes it more difficult to focus on work. I just had a huge combination panic attack/angry shouting session in the car on the way back from the new house to our current one, and that just makes me feel super guilty for being a total asshole to my family. I feel like an enormous douchebag, even though I know that I'm not personally responsible for my anxiety, or for the house (I'm a teenager). Every day is just more exhausting than the last as I try and fail to do what I need to do. I just want to relax. I just want one day, one moment where I can collect myself, but life doesn't work like that.

I didn't know what it was for the first 12 months and i was terrible going in and out of doctors appointments thinking I had cancer or something.

It's been an up and down battle with having weeks and weeks with no anxiety or panic attacks, then it just hits me and gets me down.

Last week was the first time in the past 2 years i've taken the week off work because of my panic. I was having 2 to 3 panic attacks a day as soon as i left the house. I was feeling so defeated and lost hope. Every time I had a panic attack last week, I would quickly leave the situation I was in. I started thinking that I would never be able to leave the house again. Last night I said to myself ""fuck it. You're going to work. This panic disorder won't dictate you're life. You may get a panic attack on the way to work, but it won't kill you, so bad fucking luck. You're going to work"". So I did. I left the house at 8:30am and the panic set in instantly. I had to catch a bus, then go to central station (sydney's busiest train station), sit on the train for 15 minutes and then walk to work. My panic attack only calmed down about 20 minutes ago, so it lasted nearly 3 hours. I was so close to turning around and going home so many times, but i persisted. I kept telling my panic to fuck off and that I wasn't scared of it. It felt like it wouldn't stop, and I had these thoughts that ""i'll only feel okay when i get home"". But those thoughts were wrong. I feel okay now. I feel back to normal. Those 3 hours felt like a week, but I feel better for not leaving. I feel stronger for sitting it out and getting better. So guys, don't run. No matter how long they take to subside, sit it out. You will feel better.
tl;dr: I had a 3 hour panic attack coming to work. I thought I wouldn't feel better until I got home, but I just stuck it out. I feel better and stronger now for not leaving. Don't let the panic win by running from it. Stand up to it, stick your chest, lift your head up and high, and tell your anxiety to ""FUCK OFF. You won't win""!",['nsubj'],1

I needed a safe place to just write everything out and maybe get some feedback or reassurance. My poor husband is so tired of my emails where i am freaking out over something and he thinks i am being dramatic and ridiculous. 

I don't know what started it today because i have been doing really well for a while. I hope this doesn't seem crazy to everyone here, and maybe someone will understand for once. Usually people look at me like i am totally bonkers over what i am stressing about. Anyways, i went to work this evening (i work at a retail store so i can learn to get over my social anxiety and its going well!) and i had a pretty good night. I started at maybe a 5 on a scale of 1-10 though. I had a mild panic attack at one point out of no where. My heart was racing so fast and i couldn't really think straight. But it passed and i went back to work. I was probably at a 3 after that. 

On the way home from work this truck kept playing games with me in traffic where the guy wouldn't let me pass him to get into his lane and he wouldn't let me slow down and get behind him. He did this for the whole 30 minutes it took me to get home. I finally ended up passing him almost 20 mph over the speed limit and he gave up his game and fell back. That jacked me right up to about an 8. 

I get home and suddenly i cannot think about anything except the cracks in the garage floor. They really aren't that big and i never paid attention to them in the 3 years since we bought our house but all of a sudden in February they are all i can think of. We have a single story home on a concrete slab foundation. Despite all this and the fact that none of the walls in the house have shown a single sign of any issue, i convince myself of the worst possible things. I swear the house is going to fall down. Or we will never be able to sell it. Or its going to cost hundreds of thousands to repair. I work myself up so badly that i cant sleep or sit still. 

I spend hours googling cracks in foundations. By all means everything i see says they are okay and just need to be sealed. But i obsess. I could even be found out there measuring the cracks at 3am. I go outside with a flashlight and count the cracks in the foundation around the outside of the house too. If i dont, its the end of the world, i just know it in that moment. Sometimes i worry over other things. But tonight i am at a solid 10 on and the cracks are what my mind has chosen to latch onto. 

I haven't had a night this bad in a while. I feel like a thousand pounds is laying on me. 

Sometimes i want to go to my DR and ask for medication so i can live normal but then i have anxiety that the medication will change me and i wont feel anything. What if because of the medicine i no longer need to turn around at the gas station, drive back to the house and make sure my hair dryer is unplugged JUST IN CASE one of the dogs bumps it and it turns on and burns the house down.... AHHHH 

Sorry this is such a massive wall of text. I don't have anyone to talk to. No one understands. My husband cannot be burdened with this right now, it would be the worst possible time ever. That situation may even be a part of why i had anxiety, knowing what tomorrow is.","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1

Now I'm really angry, so excuse my language. But fuck you, you greedy asshole. You prescribe me this drug after 15 minutes as my first anti depressant ever? And when I ask you if it's dangerous you tell me ""No, it's totally safe."" Yeah, I probably won't die, but withdrawal still is a bitch. 

The meds did help me, I have to give him that. My anxiety is practically gone. It's amazing. But at some point they turned on me. I was irritable and furious all the time. It felt like nothing could excite me anymore. Everything was a annoying and a chore. So I made a stupid decision. Yes, it was stupid. I'm very aware. I decided to quit. Week one I went from 150mg to 75mg. The week after that I took the seven 37,5mg capsules I had left. I had no complications at all. Everything was dandy. Then last week my right ear was suddenly plugged. Next morning the left ear was plugged too with some tinnitus as company. And my back hurt (and still hurts) like shit. The worst though are the brain zaps I'm having since today. I got them occasionally after reducing my dosage, but now I get them every few seconds. 

I really hope it won't get worse. I try to act tough for myself, but I'm scared shitless that this will get worse. Calling my doc is no option. Taking Effexor again is no option. It just isn't. I refuse. Even though it is stupid. Effexor helped me, but now I feel way better without it. I'm alive again. I'm excited to go to work!! How crazy is that? 

So if you have any experiences to share, kind words or opinions please share. I just don't want to be alone with this right now. And what I can say from this whole thing: Get a nice, empathetic doctor. Someone you can really talk to. Because if he told me that Effexor withdrawal is equivalent to heroin withdrawal (true or not. I don't know. I just read a lot about it today) I would've never taken it in the first place.  ",['nsubj'],1

Medication is great to temporarily gain firm enough footing so as to build awareness, however if nothing is changed behaviorally or psychologically, ie if awareness is not being cultivated, the medication is merely masking the problem. 

**Awareness**

Awareness is about coming to the present moment. It is about ceasing to live in the daydream/nightmare that we typically subject ourselves to 24/7.  

Everything I will talk about here involves awareness. Anxiety, on the other hand, often comes from turning away, becoming unconscious to what we perceive to be painful or unwanted information. Anxiety is worry over managing a pretense. Drop the pretense. You thought your idea was reality, but it wasn't. Your idea by its nature is never reality. Become aware of the idea, and that it arises in you, and you will become aware of reality. 

1 - GET REAL - Be open to yourself

Most of the time we go through our lives driven by unconscious impulses. The need to please others is a big one for those who suffer anxiety. Simply ***becoming aware*** of how and when this need manifests itself, whether through your actions, thoughts, or emotions, is a pivotal step to ""waking up"". 

Self-conscious people are not self-conscious, we are **self-unconscious**. The only thing we tune into is how others perceive us. We feel the need to *prove* ourselves to others above all other needs. To be accepted, to receive this approval, is extremely gratifying, and provides a nice little high. So nice of a high that chasing it is how we go about living our life! And when it seems there is no more approval/acceptance to be found, we fall into a depressive state. ""If no one accepts me, I am unacceptable"". ""If no one values me, I am worthless"".  

Because we need our drug, or approval, we put on an act. We put on an act, trying to convince whomever that they should approve of us. We walk on eggshells, playing this game, in order to please this or that person. Because of this, sometimes we feel fake, like we don't have an identity. This is a common feeling for many who suffer from anxiety. Anxiety then also comes from maintaining this act, and worrying that we will at some point be ""found out"". Other people, perhaps close friends, accept us for who we are, without this act. This can be very comforting, however we are still in the game - still feeding off of their acceptance. 

This is just one big illusion we suffer from - the need for approval. There are other illusions to be sure - the need to succeed, the need to please your parents, the need to make x amount of money, the need to drive a nice car and have a nice house, the need to pass on a legacy, the list is endless. Let me save you a lifetime by telling you all of these needs, these illusions, are empty. You get there, you feel good, and you come back down, right back to where you started; always wanting more. That is the nature of the mind.

Find your unconscious impulses. What illusions are driving your actions, shaping your thoughts. Find these shadows and shine a light on them, they will cease to exist if you watch them long enough, non-judgmentally and with mindful acceptance. 


2 - MINDFULNESS - Living in the present moment

Anxiety is always future-oriented thinking, and it always says things are going to suck, get worse, or be unbearable. It's just a trick your mind is playing, but it's an illusion. For the less-anxious ""healthy"" individual, they too have future-oriented thinking, but their mind tells them constantly ""Things will get better, the future will bring me happiness, if and when I attain this or that, things will get better"". This is called excitement. Anxiety and excitement are the exact same energy, and they are both built on erroneous ideas.

What we need to do is move past future-thinking altogether, and live in the present moment. The past is just a shadow, and the future is just a projection. All that really exists, will ever exist, and has ever existed is this present moment, or right now. Think, have you ever experienced the future? No, because it is never *not* **right now.**

A good exercise for moving into the present, ie strengthening the experiential side of your brain, is mindfulness and breathing practice. Here is a link to mp3 on ""following your breath"" - http://www.mediafire.com/?hn3zlwwdqbxqion

Strengthening the experiential side of your brain, the brain that processes present moment, is taking away all the pent up energy we've invested in our rational time-oriented brain. The latter has it's place, but we have let it take control. We need balance.
Practice living in the present moment. What am I thinking now? What am I hearing now? What is unfolding around me, right now, in this moment?  It will seem almost boring at first, but that again is just the mind doing it's thing - judging, labeling, covering up the present moment with feelings of dissatisfaction and desire. Doing this is practicing awareness, the more you practice, the more things will surface, and the more you will become aware of how your mind works. ",['nsubj'],1

At the same time I began seeking professional help for anxiety.  After several weeks of medication, I wasn't seeing much improvement, and felt like my anxiety was just compounding because of this.

Fast forward to July.  My bald asshole of a boss calls my recruiting agency on a Sunday and tells them that the funding for my position has mysteriously disappeared.  On a Sunday.  The recruiting agency sends me an e-mail to notify me I no longer have a job.  The only thing that kept me from going into full panic mode was the fact that I didn't trust the bastard (he'd already proven himself to be a duplicitous hypersensitive coward and honestly I couldn't stand the sight of him) and had already lined up other job opportunities.  

So August rolls around and I start my new job, which is superior in every conceivable way - vastly shorter commute, better pay, more responsibility, and an office full of people that actually care about things like integrity and honesty.  

It has been night and day compared to the other job.  I haven't felt uncomfortable or overwhelmed in the slightest.  I don't know if I can attribute this to the meds (Lexapro + Wellbutrin + Klonopin as needed), or just the fact that the people here have been welcoming and friendly whereas the people at the marketing company (save a couple of cool people) were extremely passive-aggressive and self-absorbed.  

I just crossed the first month mark here at the new job.  At the old job, when I reached that point, I happened to overhear my ""manager"" throwing me under the bus for trying to assist another division with an urgent problem.  The look on his face when he turned around and saw me standing behind him was priceless but the fact that I was already being sold out by someone who should've had my back brought on a horrible anxiety attack.

TL;DR A combination of meds and a new work environment has changed my life for the better.  Maybe meds aren't always enough.  Sometimes it's worth seeing if there are people/environments in your life that are holding you back from recovery and trying to find a way around them.

Now I can have my next appointment and start charting out my next steps.  No waiting.  Cold turkey can work, and it is not monumentally dangerous for everyone if you are under the care of a doctor.

Here's some big text for you, or I'm going to get the hysterical stuff again:  CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE TRYING ANY OF THIS.  CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE DISCONTINUING ANY MED.  Ok, we happy now?

In summary regarding the whole process.  I'm very glad I did it for time's sake and my doctor is glad I'm where I am because we can move on, and because he was concerned about the side effects I was getting on the drug.  It was a terrible experience, but so worth it to me.  Keep in mind I had the luxury of being able to take some time off because I'm between contracts and just negotiating new ones mostly by email.  I also have a ton of Klonopin at my disposal, but all that seemed to do was drowsy me up so I could get some sleep.  I don't think it is needed.  It certainly didn't help with the withdrawal effects.

More big letters to satisfy the hysterical peeps:  THIS HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE, AND ALTHOUGH I'M UNDER THE CARE OF A DOCTOR, IS STILL ANECDOTAL AND SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT UNTIL YOU TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR.  That good enough for you?

Now, about that message.

I originally just wanted to post and bitch about my symptoms.  Then it became clear to me that there was something more.  There's a group of people out there, people who are not doctors, and even some who would have you think they might be by calling themselves mental health professionals, who are absolutely hysterical about the safety of SSRIs and SNRIs.  In my case, it was all about the withdrawal.  but a quick Google and you'll find a lot who are monumentally against these drugs and will do anything possible to scare people off of them because they themselves are the smaller group who have had some adverse effects.

So being the asshole, always looking for a way to expose hype, and someone who has gotten benefit from these drugs, I decided to go straight after these people.  Why?

I'll tell you why.  Because these people who like to stir up hype and hysteria, these people who are not doctors, these people who many times don't even tell you to consult your doctor, are scaring the shit out of others who are in an extremely vulnerable and desperate state.  Scaring them right out of trying what their doctors recommend - taking a drug that can lift the fog and give them some peace, even if it's temporary.  A way of getting their heads above water and assessing their situation with a clearer mind.  Scaring these people away from something that can possibly improve, and in some cases SAVE, their lives.  These people who have all but given up hope, scaring these people away from a lifeline, a helping hand is deplorable, irresponsible and downright sadistic.

Read the comments on my post.  You'll find comments about this very thing.  ""I was prescribed X but am reconsidering because of all the bad things I've read from others..."".  I feel for those people, and I have been in their shoes.  I want everyone to talk to their doctors, get second or third opinions, do research on CREDIBLE sources and make an informed decision.

To all of you who would prevent anyone from doing that by stirring up negative press about ""dangers"" that are present in a small subset of the population who have taken these drugs, shame on you.  No, FUCK YOU.  Save your hyped up fox-news-type fear mongering.  This is not a fucking game where you get to play doctor.  there are desperate peoples' live at stake and you should take a good, hard look at what you say when you perpetuate the belief that it's either dangerous to withdraw from the drugs (many, many peoples' main fear), side effects, or the danger of the drugs themselves.  You are doing a great disservice to these vulnerable people and you could be harming their lives by scaring them into continuing on with a feeling of hopelessness, that nothing will help them.

That's my soapbox rant about it.

Anyone on the fence about the drugs, talk to your doctor.  Seek a second opinion, or a third, or a fourth if you're unsure.  Pay out of pocket if you have to and if you can.  Ask relatives or friends for money to get these diagnoses and opinions from qualified people.  It's the kindest thing you can do for yourself, and it just may be a first step on the road to getting your life back.  Whatever you do make INFORMED decisions based on CREDIBLE sources, and filter fear mongers and med haters out.  Because ultimately, the choice is yours, and you are a unique person with unique circumstances, unique medical issues, and unique genetics.  It takes a qualified doctor to sort through your unique needs.  The people who would scare you are not qualified.

That being said, a few more quick points.  Meds may not be for you.  For a lot of people, their conditions can be controlled by non-medical means, spirituality if believe in that, CBT, ACT, DBT, and nutrition and exercise.  Maybe meditation and yoga.  Make your decisions with your doctor.  I am defending meds, but I realize they aren't the only option.

And there are some for whom meds may be counter-indicated due to extenuating medical issues.  For instance, if you have a heart condition, it's possible you may need something different than a SSRI or SNRI.  Or it's possible you may need to avoid drugs altogether.  People in this group are among the minority.  To see if you are in this group, talk to your doctor.  

Did I mention talking to your doctor enough?  No, I haven't.  Because that's where you start, NOT on the Internet.

And I'm also going to say that if it's at all possible to control your condition through natural means, do so.  Putting chemicals in your body changes your body.  Get with your doctor, maybe see if they can recommend a line of treatment that doesn't include drugs first.  Natural is better.  But sometimes it's not enough.  And if that's the case with you, YOU HAVEN'T FAILED, AND YOU ARE NOT CRAZY OR SOME KIND OF FREAK.  It's just your unique situation.

I feel like I've said enough.  Please, everyone, think about what you say before you say it, and try to do the kind thing and allow people to make their own choices without scaring the shit out of them.

Namaste.  Keep fighting.  You're worth the fight.",['nsubj'],1

I've been suffering from anxiety my whole life, but it has just recently become awful. It's been interfering with my work and my life in general. I've been hospitalized for different things, and each time they are telling me it is an anxiety attack. I think there are different problems, but I've faced and talked about each one to my therapist. I've almost been in a crash, I've had glass explode in my face, and my family has an awful medical history. The crash happened because it was really windy, my girlfriend was driving my car because I was too tired to drive. Her car doesn't have the power steering that my car has, so when the wind almost took her off the road, she pulled the wheel the other way and we ended up swerving into the median bars, and we ended up facing the traffic. The glass was because I put it on the stove, turned around for a few seconds, and I was about to put salmon in it, it burst and shards hit me, thankfully not too badly. The medical conditions in my family is prone to cancer, but also a really bad heart disease known as Long QT syndrome. Basically the heart can just stop. I've had EKGs and I've done an echo on my heart, and so far they say it is good, but the test that will prove once and for all if I have it or not is a stress test that I have on the 11th coming up this month. Whenever I get bad chest pain I start panicking and get an  anxiety attack. Yesterday, the 4th of July, I couldn't enjoy the fireworks because the noise reminded me of the glass exploding. Driving is also a hassle because if I'm on the road too long I start getting nauseous and start thinking about the crash whenever the wind blows a little too hard. At work (I work at a McDonalds) I've had many panic attacks out of nowhere, but at the same time, that's when I'm probably the most calm when I'm around my coworkers having a good time. Almost every night I'm getting a panic attack, and I'm starting to fall into depression. I don't know what to do. I can't find a psychiatrist that takes my insurance, so I can't get meds to help. But at the same time, I don't want to just yet because if I do have a heart problem, the medicine can trigger an episode. I was given Lorazapam to calm me down, but that too will trigger an episode, so I have yet to take it. I'd rather an anxiety attack than a Long QT episode because I know I'll live after the anxiety, but possibly not the Long QT one. I'm just tired of all of this. I've even become a hypochondriac lately too. I'll get a head ache and think it is an aneurysm. My chest will hurt and I think my heart will stop. I don't know what to do. Ever since I've started going to therapy my anxiety has just gotten worse and worse. 

Tl;DR: I'm suffering, and the help I'm getting isn't working. I don't know what to do and I'm scared. ","['acomp', 'nsubj']",1

It's getting uncomfortable and my regular resorts of nicotine, caffeine and a high-fibre healthy diet aren't working.

I'd rather avoid laxatives because I have a vivid history of eating disorders which I would rather not relive, but I'm willing to resort to those if nothing else can help.  In the meantime, I'd love your advice.

Thank you all in advance.",['nsubj'],1

This time last year, before I left for university again, I became aware of some family issues involving cancer. It was not a case of being conclusive, but it was not something we found out about until the day before I left. I had to go. I had to be ready for the start of the year, and I felt guilty leaving behind the start of something that was ultimately going to affect me more than I anticipated.

Sure enough, within weeks of returning to uni, my parent was diagnosed, and sent for surgery, in the hope that they could remove the tissue and not need to enrol her for chemotherapy. At the time, I was handling the situation well. I kept the family together from afar, I kept positivity going in my stead. I was informed of the surgery going as planned.

Within a few days, I was given the truth. In fact, the surgery had not gone to plan, and despite removing the cancerous tissue from the lung, they had become very aware of a more serious issue, emphysema. In attempting to restitch the lung, the lung tore, and half of the lung had to be removed.

Everything was slowly working its way positively until february/march this year. The cancer may have returned, and my parent went for more tests. What had started as a productive year hit me. I felt unable to work, I was unable to process another stint of cancer and the ramifications of it. In that time, my sibling had also been screen tested and there was an abnormality too. Despite being informed from afar, the isolation was tough to handle.

Before I knew I was behind, I failed to submit work at university, I was being ushered towards counselling and was suggested medication. The counselling was incredibly helpful at first, and to be honest, continues to be. Through the university, the standard is incredibly high. I couldn't thank them enough. As for failing to submit, I am on track to submit work for first submission because of the circumstances, again, very reassuring.

The worry, of course, is being suggested to be put on a drug. I was reluctant but felt that there was a reason I was being suggested it. So, for the past 2 months, I have been taking Citalopram. Citalopram is not meant to fix you. It is meant to level you out, put you in a state of ease and create a leveling of your mood, something it has done with great success.

The side effects list is long and worrying to anybody willing to read it in its entirety. Often, you look at these lists and consider that there may only be a handful of people that have had them, however, the list is organised so that you are aware of the basic range of people. Having read about the drug pre-prescription, I was worried mainly about losing erections and orgasming/ejaculating less. I'm being honest about that. Sweating, Heart rate irregularities and Sleep deprivation are all difficult to envisage.

So... Why the thread? Well... it is safe to say I have had a lot of the listed side effects, and persevered through them to be in a much better state. I had sleep problems (and still do), I sweat incredible amounts and have felt nausea (though that side effect only happened a couple of times). I have had agitation, a decreased sex drive, anxiety, nervousness, confusion, abnormal dream, tremors, tingling, numbness, ringing in the ears, yawning, itchiness, pains, tiredness, hallucinations, reduced emotions and indifference, sensitivity to sunlight, involuntary movements, taste changes and definitely problems with my penis. At first, I began getting erections during sleep, in public, relaxing... And would last for long periods of time (to the shock of a flatmate) and since then, I have had some difficulties ejaculating and orgasming. (The orgasm being an effect not listed on the medication list).

I realise this is a thread for anxiety. What I was not aware of, and I say this truthfully and honestly, is that I have been unaware of sexual anxiety issues I must have had for years. When I first tried to masturbate on the medication, it took an incredible amount of time. At the end, the ejaculation was bigger (if only because of time) and orgasm felt different. I couldn't control my body. It consumed me, and truthfully, it is the first time I think I have ever truly orgasmed. It is something you hear a lot of women, but as a young man, I felt confused.

I was not aware that orgasms and ejaculating weren't completely interdependent. I was not aware that I had never actually orgasmed wanking ever before, and I was suddenly more aware of what the medication has done to me. Despite being prescribed for depression, it has help to level out deep anxieties I wasn't aware of.

Now, I have had to buy toys for the bedroom, a veto talking point for most guys (especially when the toys are used alone), and still take a long time to finish. Since then, I have felt so much more comfortable, at least knowing I am not wholly incapable of having fun. In addition, I've experienced true orgasms since then, sometimes multiple times before I am even close to ejaculating. I have never felt so free from anxieties in my life, and I honestly feel I can achieve what I want to. I would never have been able to say that 12 months ago, despite my confidence, despite my optimism, and especially in the sexual repressed state I was in.

What I wanted to do, was share my story. I realise that many people will not be able to parallel this feeling. The medication is not known for helping with sexual issues, though it is certainly responsible for my delayed ejaculations (given premature ejaculations are what they are also prescribed for)....

I have been able to deal with much more, and a lot easier. I have been able to reassess my life, figure out who i'm aiming to be, and set a plan in trying to achieve that. The medication has not fixed me, but it has allowed me to understand myself better and certainly has helped to highlight and eradicate problems I didn't know I had.

I feel like the worst is behind me, and I am incredibly excited for what is in store for me in the next 12 months. No daunt. No worry. Only optimism. I sincerely hope that anybody struggling to get through can read this and be reassured that good things can come, and once you feel you can achieve what you want to, you'll be in a great state for becoming a new person. You'll never be the same person again, but you will be able to get through it.",['nsubj'],1

Well, I stressed, I shook and I panicked - but I went. And I'm so glad I did. The doctor was very patient and friendly (while I, on the other hand, was a quivering mess), took me completely seriously, and talked me through the various options. He spoke about a women with anxiety that he had seen in the past few months, and put me very much at ease.

We discussed medication and counselling, he left the decision of what  kind of avenue to pursue very much in my hands, and in the end he gave me the names of some support forums, and a prescription of low dosage Propranolol.

I really cannot recommend going to see a doctor enough. It was nothing like the terrifying experience that I had built it up to be, and I will be happy to return in the next week or two to discuss how my medication works (or if it does), and whether I need to be given a higher dosage, or try anti-depressants.

I've posted a few times throughout the duration of my struggle, hoping for some insight/support, because the struggle itself was making my anxiety worse! 

Well, today I had an appointment with yet another psychiatrist, which I felt, for the first time, actually went quite well (I was disappointed in my regular psychiatrist yesterday, but I'll get to that later). 

I kept this appointment after a phone call a couple weeks ago that they don't accept my insurance, so it would be $150 self pay. I don't really have that kind of money, but I kept it with the blind faith that I would somehow get it. I put it on my credit card, hoping to be able to come up with it by my May 4th due date so as to not pay interest (my March statement has already ended, it will go on April). 

I went, and got turned around and ended up on the wrong road about a mile away in a city I'm only vaguely familiar with from about 5 years ago. Called the office in a panic (even though Arlington, TX disallows cell phone use in motor vehicles while driving) to get directions there. Was already shaking and nearly in tears upon arrival. She took me in within 2 minutes of finishing my paperwork. Good sign #1. She was very kind and patient while asking questions, and of course detailed. I didn't have to ask for the help I needed because she was thorough. Good sign #2. She could visibly see how shaken up I was. She didn't make any unreasonable requests. When I told her I had to make less frequent visits, because of the costs ($80 after today), she understood. She even asked about sleep. She asked about what medications I've tried (I'll take a list next time). I feel so much better now. 

I now have a prescription for 0.5 mg klonopin 1/2 to 1 PRN for anxiety (#20 for a month), and 50 mg doxepin 1-2 at bedtime PRN for sleep (doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant, not sure if it will affect my bipolar but I'm willing to try at this point for some sleep, #60 for 30 days). I have a refill on each, and will see her again in May. 

This is the first time I feel relieved after an appointment in ages. 

I saw my regular psychiatrist (local mha paid for w/ state funding) yesterday, and was disappointed. He said there's nothing to do with anxiety except increase the effexor (now 225 mg), I'm maxed out on Topamax (200mg), he doesn't want to add anything else, anxiety medication is too addictive so he won't treat it and he suggests I find other ways to cope (as though I haven't tried). I also mentioned that I was having mood swings and not sleeping, and he completely ignored that, except to say ""I don't prescribe anything to sleep, it never helps for very long"". 

I'm thinking of just sticking with the new psychiatrist, even though I have to pay so much and might lose my case worker....","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1

I made a throwaway because for some reason I'm really embarrassed of people I know finding out about how much I struggle with this type of stuff.

So I'm in my 4th year of college, but it took me a while to decide on my major and I transferred twice so I'm supposed to graduate next December, but at this rate it might be later. I had always had problems with ADD and insomnia, but was not allowed to be on any medication for it until freshman year of college. By that point, I knew that I really needed to do something about those two problems or I would flunk out. The first psychologist I talked to about it had me give a history of what my education had been like and what problems I experienced each year. He told me that he thought I had social anxiety (in fact he said it seemed so obvious from such a young age that he might call it a crime that it was not dealt with in elementary school), and that the ADD and insomnia might be separate, but could be caused by anxiety so he wanted to do therapy to improve it over time. That was a hard thing to come to terms with, and I knew that in the meantime I would be flunking out of college, so I didn't go back and went to another doctor to deal with the issues. I got prescribed medication for ADD and insomnia. This helped for a while, but now I'm going to a more difficult university and it's just not enough anymore. Both medications do a little bit to help, but the anxiety, which I was able to cope with or ignore before, gets worse and worse as my classes get harder. It's difficult to go to class more often than not, and I end up missing classes because of it, which makes things worse. Assignments can be so overwhelming that just the thought of them can make me want to just hide under the covers. When I try to work on them anxiety just kind of takes over and I can't even get started. I made great grades in high school and took advanced classes. I did really well at the beginning of college too, but starting last semester my grades have started to go down. In less than a year, I transitioned from thinking I MIGHT take a semester off before going to grad school, to doubting that I will make it to graduation. I just feel anxious and miserable most of the time, and constantly daydream about dropping out. I just have no motivation and feel like I'm drowning constantly. Talking about anything personal is really really difficult for me, especially something like this, but when I do find the courage to talk about it the responses I get from the people I care about are always negative, like ""Oh, you're just really lazy. College is hard for everyone,"" from my best friend, or my dad being like ""Well maybe if you put in the appropriate amount of time and effort like everybody else you wouldn't have to deal with anxiety."" Then that just makes it worse.

I'm sorry that I have rambled on so much and had kind of a pity party. I just want to talk to someone who understands and won't just make me feel more awful about it.","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1

I'm 17 (nearly 18) male, and while I've never experienced panic attacks or anything anywhere as severe as that, I can't help but find social situations more difficult than they should be. 

It's like I'll be with a group of friends/acquaintances, I'll be fine exchanging pleasantries and such - but I'm just horrible at holding conversation, I feel like I overthink things far too much. People will be talking and I'll just stand there, completely unable to find a way to join in, if I can ever think of anything to say I'm terrible at actually bringing that into the conversation, I'll talk over myself and ramble a bit, which gets me flustered and makes it worse. 

The best way I can think to describe it is that I just feel like a tightly wound spring all the time, and I can never unwind and just go with the flow. I find alcohol helps but obviously that isn't much of a solution. I analyze things way too much. Family/Friends are always telling me to loosen up and I really do try, but it's easier said that done. 

Don't have this problem with family or one or two very close friends, but even if I'm just with people I know decently and get along with I just can't interact that well. 

I do feel like I've actually made some improvement over the last couple years in terms of improving my social skills, but it just feels like I've hit a bit of a brick wall really - I was with people the other day and I was stood there saying nothing - not through lack of trying, but I was racking my brain and could not for the life of me hold a conversation, and I just thought I am sick of living like this. 

Anyone feel like they can relate with similar problems, or am I overreacting to what is just a lack of social skills?

The type of work is basically the same as my last job but every company has their own rules you have to learn. Probably the most distressing part is being the new guy. The department is small and everyone is pretty tight. Socializing is very exhausting, and quite frankly I don't need much of it. I have been forcing myself to go to lunch etc with them.

Hey r/anxiety!
I have been putting off writing my story for almost 6 months now, but today is finally the day. I would like to clarify that this is the story of my own personal battle with anxiety. Some of the things that worked for me won't work for you and some of the things that didn't work for me will work for you! Mostly I just needed to write it all down for myself, but maybe some of the info will help someone somewhere!
Now lets travel to the year 2008...

The first Panic attack,
I was 18 and living in a city about an hour away from Toronto. It was my girlfriend’s birthday at the time and one of her favorite bands was playing in the Toronto so I decided to take her to see them. I wasn't feeling well the day of the show but I figured, it's not so bad and I don't want her to have a bad birthday just because my stomach is a little upset. We went anyway, the show was fun but my stomach flu got awful. On top of that we got stuck in a snow storm so our 1 hour drive home turned into a 3.5 hour drive with almost no visibility, trying to keep the car on the road while puking out the window and lots of other fun stuff! I got home and had these huge chest pains which i thought must be related to my flu, I didn't know what a panic attack was.

Year 2, The follow up:
The relationship started to come to an end a few months after that, unrelated to my anxiety ( I think) it was just a relationship between 18 year olds so of course it did. The following summer I didn’t have another panic attack, however,  I started to experience general anxiety. I didn't know what it was enough to identify it. I just knew I often felt like I was ""vibrating"" and I started getting these sharp back pains from stress and tightness. 

Year 3,
 Going back to school in the fall of this year I got a job working overnights. It was the highest paying job I had ever had up until that point so it seemed like a good idea at the time. The crazy sleep schedule threw me back into panic attacks, however still not knowing that's what they were.  I went out for dinner with my new (then) girlfriend at an awesome restaurant, but while we were waiting for our food I began the worst panic attack that I had up until that point and maybe that I have ever had to this day. I excused myself and went to the washroom and had what I honestly thought was a heart attack. Crazy chest pains, and even part of my face falling asleep and tingling. I was terrified. I went to the doctor after to get checked out and that's when I realized as a very active 21 y/o with a fairly clean diet, my heart was fine. It was all anxiety. My GP referred me to the universities mental health specialist physician who of course told me not to worry about things, and just take the drugs she gave me (lorazapam as needed and cipralex ( lexapro) daily.)

Year 4
 None of those things helped me at all.The Cipralex gave me awful side effects. Lorazapam worked of course but it felt like taking a horse tranquilizer. I lived this year numb or having panic attacks and it sucked. Realizing the cipralex was doing me more harm than good I decided to stop taking them. Within about 4 days I got the awful withdrawal symptoms and ending up in the ER because I didn't understand why my brain was electrocuting itself. I was so mad that I was given a pill with such awful side effects, that created such a strong chemical dependency and I wasn't warned about either.  I decided I was going to spend the rest of the year tapering off them slowly. I was still determined to get off them, even though my Doctor very adamantly told me not to. In this year I was done my degree and while applying to jobs in my field I was working as a framing carpenter. It was a very active, physically demanding job that also required me to be outside 9-10 hours a day. Around 3 months into this job my anxiety was at the very best place it had been since the beginning of this story.  There also was no room in that sort of work to display mental weakness. This caused me to learn to cope with things really fast, and suppress panic in ways I had never had to.

Year 5
I finally got a job in my field and went back to working mostly indoors and mostly at a desk. I enjoyed it for the first while, but panic attacks started to happen again regularly. If you remember from the beginning of my story driving was the first time I experienced a panic attack so having a job that required a lot of traveling meant a lot of struggling. I was sort of back to square one. Getting through the day and beating the panic attacks was my main goal, so I lost some control of other aspects of my life ( health, diet, finances etc). That in turn, only made the panic worse.

Year 6... the turn around
The boxing day of year six I quit smoking cold turkey. That was amazing on so many levels. The confidence that came from doing something that difficult, the discipline I learned from it, my new ability to exercise and of course all the money I saved! In the start of this year I looked back on the time in my life when I was working as a framer to try and figure out why my anxiety was so under control at that time. There were 3 things I could think of that might have been contributing to that: Being outside more often, exercise and fighting anxiety every time as opposed to enabling it. I started with being outside more often, it was clearly the easiest. I spent that summer fishing, camping and hiking and it was awesome. Not only because doing those things DID help with my anxiety, but because it felt like I had my life back. On top of being outside more often those things often made me push myself through scenarios that would make me anxious and ended up working 2 or the 3 goals I had set for myself. I adopted this new mantra that “ it’s better than dying in my livingroom.” So for example if a friend asked me to go back country camping I’d have all this anxiety come up. “ We are a 3 days canoe away from society, what if I break my leg?” “what if I get sick and have to throw up in front of all these people?” Whenever I had these thoughts previously, I’d tell my friends thanks for the invite and let my panic win. Now I tell myself, “ you know what? Breaking your leg back in the woods would make a cool story, and would certainly be better than missing out on your whole life (dying in your living room).” When I stopped letting the panic control me that’s when my life really began to change! I wish I could say I went on this trips and I was fine, but that’s not life! The first time I went on one I had a HUGE panic attack on the way there and it was SUPER embarrassing. But the next time I went I worried less about having a panic attack in front of people because A) My friends all knew It was something I struggled with and B) I already knew what to expect and it wasn’t as bad as missing out on the trip. As an added bonus some of my friends would tell me about the experiences they had with anxiety/depression and it seemed to help both of us. When the fall rolled around I decided to work on the whole exercise thing. I tried weight lifting one day and had a HUGE panic attack that scared me away from weight lifting for awhile.

Year 7… Where I’m at now
 On boxing day of this year I decided to quit my SSRI cold turkey as well. I was off work for a week after my quit date so that made it a bit easier. It sucked for about 2 weeks but then I started to feel better than I had in years! I finally had highs and lows again and my panic actually got better when I stopped taking them somehow, it was awesome. I was talking with a friend of mine who was a nurse/weightlifter and asked about the panic attack. He explained it to me that weightlifting releases adrenaline into your body much in the same way that having a panic attack would, so it made sense. With this in mind I started weight training pretty heavily around February of this year and using that adrenaline response to train my body how to better cope with panic attacks. NOTHING and I mean NOTHING has worked better to control my anxiety that weight lifting.  It is not that it’s completely out of my life but it is certainly much more under control than It ever has been. I would recommend r/eeod to anyone ( exercise out of depression). I would even consider starting an exercise out of anxiety subreddit if there was enough interest. 

Sorry this was so long and thanks for reading! Any questions welcome!

Tl;dr- 7 years of anxiety, meds suck, doctors suck, Fresh air and exercise are awesome,

I was off my dose for about two weeks because I literally could not get my car out of the driveway to get my prescription. Now I have my medication again, but it hasn't seemed to kick in yet. I've spent the last week basically hiding in my room and freaking out.

Had my first ever traffic stop, for lapsed registration, the Friday before last, and I think it triggered the reaction. I got things sorted, as far as I know, but I'm basically useless right now, and I don't know what to do until the meds kick in again.","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1

I love her so much and it was the greatest relationship ever. I always spent every second I could with her if it was possible. Until probably the worst day of my life so far arrived. Just to inform, I'm 16 and she's 18. But on this specific day, my girlfriend and I we're having sex (protected of course) and whatnot. It was right before she had to go to work and so after we finished the act, she dropped me off and she proceeded to go to work. 10 minutes after she dropped me off, her Mother called me, she had found out we we're in her house and we we're having sex. Obviously she was beyond furious and nearly blows her top yelling at me. Immediately, I was separated from her, all contact with her was cut until school came around. The week of the event was stressful but wasn't horrible. We we're going to get through this. I still loved her and wanted to be by her side. Later that week however, on the proceeding Sunday, something triggered me to have a odd thought. ""Is it worth it?"" That's all that was heard in my mind for the rest of the night. I was confident enough to comfortably say it was. I didn't want to leave her, the relationship we had was something so special, I didn't want to destroy something I built. However, as the following week continued, the thought transformed into ""Break-up with her."" That's what was only said in my head no matter what. I knew I didn't want to do that. But I fought the thought so hard it started to become worse (probably not the smartest idea at the time) and worse and tortured me for the next 6 weeks. As each week passed, I slowly had other problems pop-up too with the thought. I obtained a lack of focus in school, lack of focus on hearing myself and others, tunnel-vision, tiredness, etc. It became worse too. By week 4, looking at my girlfriend was hard. She didn't even look the same to me. I wanted to cry so much because this relationship was something I didn't want to let go of. I've been fighting these thoughts but also have learned to accept them and don't fight them as that'll induce more problems. And don't even get me started on how easy it becomes to trigger another anxiety thought downward spiral. Currently, I still don't want to break-up with as I still love her, but the problem still persists. The whole situation has caused tremendous anxiety and I don't know what to do now. I've been to the doctor and they prescribed me with Buspar, but I have yet to take it because I feel like meds aren't the answer. I am also waiting on a call from a psychiatrist to see what to do. I thought earlier today that I could have a fear of breaking up and may have to face it and see where to go from there. But I also fear that if I do that I won't feel the same about her anymore. What should I do? Can you relate? Please tell me about it. Anything helps. I don't want to get rid of this relationship but I guess my anxiety thoughts tell me different.",['nsubj'],1

Have suffered from anxiety for a good few years now which I've always put down to traumatic events in my life. My teen years were very upsetting, a lot of family issues, divorce, my mother had a mental break down etc. I'm the youngest of my siblings so I had to deal with it a lot by myself as my brothers and sisters had moved out with partners etc. 

For as long as I can remember I've had palpitations. Even as a child, I always thought it was normal. Then about two or three years ago they became a lot more frequent and eventually one day my heart would not go into normal rhythm it was constant palpitations for a few hours so I went to the doctors who said I had anxiety, he prescribed me propranalol and sent me home. The medication did help. 

After that I've always been getting sharp pains in my chest, and deep aching pains when breathing in which I put down to anxiety again. Once it was so bad my GP sent me to A&amp;E to check for a blood clot as I was displaying symptoms. I was meant to get an ECG but they ended up sending me home instead.The hospital said I was fine. 

However one night during the week I was getting ready to go out,rushing about trying to find my shoes, I ran into the living room and froze on the spot .My mother who was watching TV stopped and said what's wrong? My heart was beating ridiculously fast, and was not slowing down, I started getting dizzy and then panicked, my mother felt my chest and I could see she looked worried, I kept saying it's not slowing down, it's not slowing down on the verge of tears. My mother then made me lie down on the sofa and it immediately went back into normal rhythm. 

Then last night I went to see the dark knight rises and had what I think was a full on panic attack in the cinema. It was too warm and overly crowed, my stomach kept doing flips and I kept getting the sensation when your in a car and you go over a dip in the road fast.My heart was racing and I kept getting palpitations. I eventually talked myself out of it in my head and was able to sit through the rest of the film.


What I keep worrying about now is what if my symptoms are not that of anxiety but of an underlying heart condition. My baby brother who died before I was born had hypoplastic left heart syndrome. My mother has had heart problems along with a mild heart attack and my grandfather who died suddenly from septicaemia had a post mortem done was found to have had old heart attack scars on his heart that nobody knew of. 

So what I'm wondering is do my symptoms fall in line more with someone who has anxiety issues or should I persist on getting my heart checked out? ",['nsubj'],1

Back in March I came to Canada for the first time to meet my long term SO who I have now permanently moved to be with. My anxiety was going pretty terribly at that point as I was dealing with PTSD symptoms after an assault I had experienced a few months prior, but I fought through and that first trip was the most amazing experience of my life.

When I came home things were pretty tough, I had no job and staying close with my SO was hard as the distance took its toll, I was just waiting on a working visa so I could move back and it took 3 months, I made quite a few threads in /r/anxiety during that period though they are probably long forgotten now. But this sub really helped me during that time so I am forever grateful. 

I finally had my visa approved August 19th and in the space of 5 days packed my bags, booked a ticket and decided not to look back. That same week with the support of my amazing SO I made the decision to finally request to be put on meds, that was terrifying for me as I had never wanted to do it, I am very fearful of things like that and was pretty uneducated about it, but I got on 75mg of Effexor and despite a shaky and nauseous first week it had an amazing impact on my life. It had a huge effect on my depression and really helped me to keep things in perspective, I found that I could finally tell myself 'hey, it's going to be ok, it isn't such a big deal' and for the first time in my life I would believe it. I made a thread on /r/anxiety about that as well and got some great advice. 

The first month living with my gf was perfect, her family welcomed me with open arms and I have never felt so welcomed, they really are amazing people her family, anxiety-wise there was the odd moment but overall I was not even giving things like judgement and being liked a second thought, I just acted myself and met all of these people who were just great. Was sad to have missed most of the summer but the few weeks we got were great. 

I also managed to get myself a full-time job for the first time ever, I work at a call-centre and really enjoy my work. I really haven't felt too much anxiety with the job either, my meds seem to keep everything in check and after the first week I knew what I was doing and can keep perfectly calm on the phones with people. The thing I was actually most nervous about with the job was socialising with my coworkers, as in the past that has always been a disaster for me, in school I would hide away in the corner and be physically unable to speak with people. But hey the first week I was quiet but I found myself introducing myself to people and having the occasional conversation, which to me was a huge step, and a month and a half into my job today I can happily say that every day I am greeted by my neighbours in my aisle at work, I spend all night making smalltalk and have a few I would even consider friends. I am yet to hang out with any of them outside of work, but one step at a time. 

Now, it hasnt all been sunshine and roses, we had a few weeks where everything was a disaster. We moved into one apartment which was unsanitary and unliveable and backed out on the landlords, for perfectly legal and fair reasons, but they refused to give back our security deposit so we've ended up having to take them to court, something which I thought I'd never have to do. To top it off after that experience we moved into a new place which a day after we moved our stuff into got burglarised and they stole, no word of a lie: OUR BED. If that wasn't enough during the ordeal our beautiful kitty cat Rosa was terrified and escaped out of the door and went missing for almost 2 weeks. I don't know how I would have survived that experience if I didn't have my SO, she was a rock through the whole thing and I will never know how she held it together so well, because I was on the verge of cracking a few days after, didn't think we'd ever get our cat back and I was looking over my shoulder at every turn.

But all that is behind us now, we have a new bed, our cat is back, and we just adopted our 2nd fuzzy little ball of love who is just starting to get settled in, his name is Magic. 

This thread was super long and I don't know if it will really hold anybody's interest, but I just wanted to share all of this with a community that helped me a lot along the way. So thankyou /r/anxiety , this really is a great community. 

Here's to the future, everybody here deserves to be happy :)

To make things short I have been dealing with anxiety for 2 yrs and for the past few months I've been particularly frustrated and somewhat depressed over stupid habits of mine. 

I believe these are intrusive and constant thoughts provoked by anxiety. 
Not sure if I have an ocd but i do these useless thoughts in my head very frequent and they are somewhat crippling my social and physical lifestyle. 

First thing first, my main concerns nowadays include constant worrying about my breathing, weakness especially when I'm exercising and neck pain. Even after a 30 min walk or exercise I feel tremendously weak. 

I am frequently thinking of and become aware of my breathing and this leads me to have shallow breathing especially in public or social settings like church and concerts. 

For the first time since in two years Im actually considering of taking medication. I just feel so frustrated. I think I've improved alot in terms of how I can manage my panic attacks, but I feel as though the root cause is still there. 

I want to have worries that 'normal' people have like worrying about work, friends, financial problems and just regular day to day worries. Not these worries..:( 

Funny thing is I feel more calm before heading to bed then in the morning or the rest of the day. I feel so out of energy and happiness throughout the day but before bedtime is usually better. 

I just want to know how everyone else is dealing with anxiety/ocd that mainly focus on breathing and how medication could help in improving these habits. ",['nsubj'],1

I had a sizable breakdown the summer of 2012... panic attacks, the whole shebang and I went on Lexapro, klonopin as needed. About a year later I was done with college and thought I could handle no meds. Bad idea. After about a month off meds, I went back on Lexapro for about another year. I've been off of them completely since September. About a month ago I started having heart palpitations and chest pains, and I'm currently going through the whole testing thing, but they seem to think the extra beats are just stress/anxiety induced.

The past couple of days have been hell. I started having panic attacks again that were as bad as the first ones I had a couple years ago. I am starting to think I'm just one of those people who needs medication and I am trying to be alright with that and not feel weak or broken.

So my question to you all of this anxiety subreddit is... What are your experiences with meds? Pros/Cons? Which specific meds worked for you? I've been on Lexapro for 2 years and in that time I gained about 25 lbs, was tired ALL the damn time, no sex drive, but I wasn't having panic attacks. I think what scares me the most is that I'll try a new medication and react horribly to it and gain even more weight on top of it all. Heeeelp me please? I just want to talk things out with people who understand.

EDIT: It's worth noting that I'm referring to the generics for both Klonopin and Lexapro but they're a mouthful. It's also worth noting that the Klonopin has recently stopped being as effective because I've been using it more frequently, another thing that scares the shit out of me. I don't want a benzo addiction on top of all of this. ","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1

Fast forward to this year, a relationship problem caused me to suffer from what i feel has been the worse anxiety/depression yet. It's been long lasting which led me to go to my first psychiatrist. She recommended me to do therapy and try Gabapentin (anticonvulsant). The first week was a miracle! I was hungry all the time, wanted to sleep finally, i wanted to talk to everyone again, and things that would cause my anxiety to sky rocket wouldn't even bother me. 

This leads me to my topic. After a week of taking it i noticed i was having horrible Body odor. Something that no matter how bad the anxiety got i would never have before. I convinced myself it was the medicine and my psychiatrist immediately told me to stop taking it. Its been over a week and the Body odor has not gone away. 

The psychiatrist told me that she has never heard a symptom like this and that the medicine should have been outta my system after the first 5 hours of not taking it. 

Of course alot of people have said that body odor can be a symptom of anxiety, but this has never happened before and i have been struggling with anxiety my whole life. 

Has anyone had a side effect like this? 
Not sure if it could be the withdrawal from the Buspar that i was on for 2 years, or the gabapentin still not leaving my system?",['nsubj'],1

I've been having some health issues the past 6 months that has brought out some anxiety symptoms to the point of panic attacks. Early on they were terrifying but they have gone down a bit (prior to citalopram). So my point is that I haven't been to a psychologist or anything and the only reason I am having anxiety is due to something else. I feel like that should be stated unless that's normal.

Anyway, at first I loved citalopram. I was finally able to stay calm for a bit and I felt the medicine working in the back right of my skull. Today was a little scary. I know there can be a transition period of getting used to a medication, but I experience severe agitation/irritability. It was kind of the agitation you get from ADHD meds such and adderall or vyvanse. (sp?) but without the intensity. This agitation was more concentrated or potent..if that makes sense. I'm going to call my doctor tomorrow because I read that you experience that you should call your doc immediately. I understand reading google can scare the hell out of you but I just want to get a second opinion from someone else who has taken this drug. Is this a common side effect that is a part of getting accustomed to it? 

Let it be known as well that I had an empty stomach when I took it and didn't eat for maybe 3-4 hours. The previous 4 days I ate something as late as 2 hours post dose. Did I wait too long to eat? Also, the other health thing  is becoming anxious after I eat.

I know it's a lot of information but I would love a response so I can know if my brain is going to shut off. That's kind of how it felt today. A more concentrated agitation that felt like ""too much"" and I just wanted it to stop. It wasn't crazy powerful like an OD, but it was just there. Could this be the suicidal side effects? It was just an awful feeling.

Let it be known that this is only a temporary thing until my other health thing is resolved. Nonetheless, I thought this should be addressed here.","['nsubj', 'pobj', 'pobj']",1

My NP increased my dose to 20mg yesterday, and I am hoping to get more than 30 of the .25 xanax to help me through the transition, because I am emotional and not sleeping.  

Unfortunately, after talking to my SO and a few family members, I realized that I am having manic episodes.  Especially the week before and the week of my period.  Also, this time of year has been bad for me as far back as 2007.  

Can anyone relate and tell me their experience?  I am so tired of waking up and feeling like Carrie from Homeland (no offense intended, but that is what I am relating to).

I am a drinker, and know that it is not a sustainable or healthy way to deal, but honestly sometimes at night when I am waiting for the xanax to work, a beer or glass of wine is the only thing that helps calm me down. 

I am not, nor have I ever been, suicidal.  The thought that the meds could make me that way scares the shit out of me and starts my negative thought cycle, but after working with a therapist I got better about that.  

I know that ecstasy can seriously fuck up your brain chemistry, but I recently read that adderall can deplete serotonin, and wonder if all or any of this could be a factor.

Last question, if I have been on lexapro and xanax for as long as I have, am I at risk for seretonin syndrome?  Because that scares me out of taking more xanax, even when I probably should.  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  ",['nsubj'],1

He says my depression is causing me to be anxious, and that's why the Lamictal works and not the Klonopin. Problem solved!

Hey all, I've been having a terrible time recently.  I've just been completely miserable 24/7 with little relief, with panic attacks constantly and waking up all night, throwing up, freaking out before school/missing school/almost missing school.  

My Klonopin was just upped to 1mg/day with 0.25mg as needed, from 0.75mg/day, but that doesn't really seem to do anything when I take it by itself.

The only time I feel somewhat normal is when I take my Lamictal.  I did an experiment the other night, and only took the Lamictal, instead of all my nightly meds.  And within an hour, my mind stopped racing, I could concentrate, my anxious thoughts stopped, and I wasn't depressed anymore.  It seemed like the Klonopin really has been doing nothing for me by comparison, when I take it by itself.

Anyway, I'm wondering why that is working instead of the Klonopin.  Does it help anyone elses' anxiety or does this mean I'm bipolar?  Not that labels matter as long as the medication works but I'm curious.... well, it kind of does matter for me, because my insurance won't approve Saphris on the basis that I'm not bipolar, but yeah.  I will talk to my doctor about this, but just curious if it had this effect on anyone else.","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1

One psychiatrist suggested a whole bunch of physical problems (low glucose, a dimple on my chest that could be a sign of a heart murmur, low magnesium, low 80 other freaking things), none of which turned out to be remotely true. He's convinced it's something physiological, as am I to some extent, which is where medication should come in.

The other psychiatrist barely listens to me and basically throws medicine at me. I'm on 2.5 mg Abilify and 40 mg Viibryd now, and the Viibryd seems to be giving me suicidal thoughts and making me jittery, which is kind of the opposite of what you want them to do. Before this, I've tried Xanax, Lexapro, and Klonipin, and either built up an tolerance to them way too quickly (Xanax and Klonipin) or they didn't help (Lexapro).

And on top of that, I've tried seeing two therapists. Both of them suggested rational thinking, which doesn't help me because my anxiety doesn't stem form irrational thought, it essentially stems from nothing, and the conscious knowlede that I won't die from a panic attack or that there's no reason to panic doesn't help. They've both suggested deep breathing and exercise, neither of which helped. And after a month of talking about my life and going through things, both basically said there was nothing they can do to help me.

So now I'm sitting here, at 2:46 AM, because I'm too jittery to go to sleep, too nauseous to to feel comfortable even if I weren't jittery, and still too anxious to function despite the drugs. So far, between four professionals and myself, we've basically managed to solve absolutely nothing in the last 10 or so months (I'm 22).

I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish right now. But I do feel slightly less jittery after typing this, so thanks.","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1

I’m 31 F, I take klonopin,  Wellbutrin, and am working on figuring out if I need to take vitamin D all the time as I have problems with it bottoming out. I don’t just have an anxiety disorder.  I’m depressed, possible mild PTSD, I’m a finger picker, and a dash of OCD just for flavor.  And I’ve just recently started admitting to myself, my doctors, and my partner that I have problems with suicidal ideation.  

I have a good job that I get up and go to everyday. In fact, I can’t get myself to call out sick even if I need to. I just was promoted to management.  I get to travel the country and run events and smile and shake hands and network and I want to die. 

I have an amazing girlfriend, who is intelligent and kind, and respects me, and is patient with my issues even though she doesn’t understand them. She’s hard working and we share passions and hobbies and interests and I pray I won’t wake up in the morning.
Things come in waves for me. I was really well for a while. But I’m picking my fingers again to the point where they throb so much I can’t sleep.  And I lay in bed thinking of the peace that would come with pills, a blade, a bus, learning one of those super mystical meditation techniques that you can use to stop your heart. Anything to just simply cease to be. 

And I’m terrified.

I don’t have a “plan”. There’s no date set, no method decided on.  I don’t want this. I love life. I love kayaking on a moonless lake. I love making fresh bread.  I love going to the salon. I love road trips, and great books, and movies with lots of explosions. yet I want to be not alive.

I don’t know what to do. I’m so tired of feeling this way. I just want contentment. I’m not even asking for happy.  Just calm. Content. Stable. 
I’m getting my Vit D tested again of Friday. And if my levels are in the normal range right now I will call my therapist. I feel like a liar. To myself, my doctor, my girlfriend, my therapist.  I feel like I’ve made everyone believe I’m getting better when I’m not.  But then I say: Self, admitting you are having problems and talking about them IS getting better.  But it doesn’t feel better. It feels worse. I’m most afraid my meds aren’t effective. Bipolar is strong in my family and most other drugs I could take have a high risk of flipping that switch.  

I want to be better and I want to want to be alive.

I guess I should start out with that I'm sixteen, I'm homeschooled, I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, been prescribed ativan, xanax, and some antidepressants that I can't remember the names of because there's been so many. I've seen psychiatrists and been in the psychiatric hospital twice because I was told it would make me more stable on my meds and therefore make them work better, but never really been in therapy.

I guess I first decided to go after my boyfriend's parents inviting me to go to dinner, and even after taking ativan, I became so anxious that I got sick and ended up watching everyone else eat while I just sat there, awkwardly drinking my water and staring. I felt so embarrassed, I didn't understand why I got as nervous as I did. I thought, maybe I can go to a therapist they won't push me to take meds and I can just figure out how to overcome this. The first few visits were a lot of ""You should really see a psychiatrist and try medication. Really really you just weren't trying hard enough before, you were just trying to be difficult and that's what made the medication not work.""

A few weeks ago she told me that I should start writing in a journal whenever I start to feel negative. The only problem is, I've been feeling pretty great. I even spent a lot of this weekend skyping with a friend while playing video games, something I always feel terrified to do because I think I'm going to mess something up and make them hate me, but it was actually a lot of fun. So, a couple of times now I've come to therapy with nothing written in my journal. My therapist kinda laughs at me and says, ""Come on, I can't do this for you. If I can't watch how you handle your negative thinking and figure out your thinking pattern then we're doing nothing here."" and I apologize, then the rest of the visit is her stuttering and mumbling over some long speech that sounds so cheesy and doesn't even really make sense until she asks for my $30 and books another visit for next week.

She's also told me that the way to approach my anxiety is to throw myself out there and enroll in public school. I spent a while thinking about this, and a few hours ago I told her ""I spent a long time making sure this is what I wanted to do, not because I'm afraid, but because of an actual valid reason. I like my freedom, I like not being trapped in a building full of a bunch of people for hours on end every day, even when I'm not afraid of social situations I still find them draining and need time to recharge and public school just wouldn't allow that."" She told me there is no way I'm going to overcome this if I don't find a way to interact with more people, and that school is pretty much the only way. She then asked me if I wrote in my journal, I told her no and explained why, and she called me a liar. She told me I'm trying to be difficult and fighting back against the healing process. I told her ""I'm sorry, but I don't think I should pretend that I'm feeling more anxious than I actually am."" then she kind of looked at me for a while and said ""Well, we have nothing to talk about then.""

So, I feel kind of dumb. I feel like I wasted both of our time. Another person's opinion would be appreciated here because I don't know if somehow I am being difficult and don't realize it, or if maybe I just never needed therapy, or if this therapist isn't right for me.

I'm at a crossroads what to do right now.  I'm currently going through a divorce, having been separated for two years.  The legal wrangling has been going on for a few months now and look like there's a few more to go.

In the meantime I've had to find a new place to live and re-equip myself with all the trappings, everything from a new washing machine to new bedlinen to a new TV.  The big stuff was expected, but I was surprised at how much 'little' stuff added up!

I have good days and bad days.  Some days I don't think about it and just get on with life, but other days it's all I can think about. 

Some days I feel like I have a constant 'fight or flight' feeling but there's nothing to react to, and I'm sitting there with my heart beating hard in my chest and a tight feeling across my chest and a sick feeling in my stomach and throat.  I get tearful really quickly these days.

I spoke to the doctor so I know it's not my heart.  She said my blood pressure is 'perfect' and gave me ranitidine for acid reflux, though my symptoms don't really seem connected to food.  The medicine does help a bit.

The thing is, I don't feel as though I can't cope.  I can cope, and I will get through this, one way or the other.  I expected it to suck right now, and I expected to feel upset, but I didn't expect these weird physical symptoms and they do freak me out a little.  I find myself thinking '*what if*' a lot.  What if I get burgled?  What if the ex does something with the settlement and I end up with nothing? What if I lose my job?  

I keep thinking I should go see a psychologist but I can't seem to make that step.  I don't want to make a fuss.  I don't want the extra pressure of having yet another thing I have to juggle.  And I have a bit of a general distrust of psychologists due to one I saw as a child.  (She kept trying to put words in my mouth and made a lot of assumptions about how I felt when really I wasn't feeling that way at all).

I'm not sure what I'm trying to achieve with this post actually... I guess, I just would like a bit of support and, your thoughts, as to whether I might have some sort of anxiety or if I'm just overreacting.",['nsubj'],1

This may be long winded, but this is my story and I am desperate for help. Ever since 6th grade, I have had a stomach ache on the first day of class until now (I'm 26). The amount of new people and the stimulation of a new situation would make me sweat profusely and I would receive the worse stomach in my life and would always asked to be excused. This was embarrassing and became a regular thing and as such made me stand out. This would also happen before every exam, and I had to ask the professors to make an exception for me to let me leave the room DURING tests to try and calm down even though that was strictly forbidden for obvious reasons.

In high school, a gang of 7 or 8 jumped me, took my things and broke my nose. They did it again the next day. From then on, there was a pattern of avoiding people, cutting classes, and eventually moving schools. At my new school, I made no friends and avoided socializing as much as possible. I was so fearful of leaving my house because of the thought of bumping into the gang outside my home that i stayed home, played games and never socialized. Even though I was able to make a few friends here and there, I couldn't go anywhere with them. If i got into a car to drive to take a trip even 40 minutes away, I would feel constant physical pain and and need the car to be stopped so often that it became to unbearable and embarrassing to make my friends do that, so I was never able to take a long trip or any road trip with friends. It is the same with movie theaters, it gives me to much anxiety and I just can't go to the movie theaters without having a panic attack. I can't socialize with even cousins because of this anxiety and even though I am able to think clearly and articulate my thoughts in my head or to family members, I can not for the life of me talk to a stranger and make any sense. I'm afraid of asking a retail worker for help, or a waiter for extra sause. It took me 8 years to get my undergrad, because I had to avoid public speaking so often and group projects until I could find professors that would make an exception. 

Now very recently, I have started to get hives when I get nervous. It is definitely not food related as Ive tried all sorts of tests and have never been allergic to anything in my life. These hives are finally too much for me.

I've tried everything to get over my anxiety. I've tried exercising, meditating and most of all logically deducing my way out of anxiety with thoughts like ""if everyone had to do public speaking to get thorugh it, i can too"" and ""its important to be social and have a network to suceed in life"" and ""everyone is unique and awkward just like myself so I should not care"", but nothing is working and I'm still fearful everyday of waking up, of sleeping, of even opening my emails...

I met someone not to long ago and she said she had severe anxiety and told me that she was pescribed xanax which got her through college and was able to slowly get off of it. If theres anything out there that can help me feel slightly more confident and less fear... if Xanax is the answer that can let me experience a less stressful life and feel a bit normal... and if i take it and hold onto that feeling while its there and slowly get off the drug... i may resort to it even though ive been trying to get through it naturally... But now I""m paranoid and anxious about going to the doctor... afraid maybe she'll think I'm another kid looking to score drugs with a made up story , but I'm getting so desperate and I dont even know if it will help... I'm paranoid and teetering back and forth. I really hope the doctor will believe me... but im so scared that I don't know if I can explain it or articulate myself or if she/he will even care.

I know this story is long... but to anyone who took the time to hear me out... thanks... and if you can answer the question... will medicine really help? what kind of help can I get?... if anyone can give some kind of advice. I'd be eternally grateful. Thank you.",['nsubj'],1

So I've had a really bad anxiety problem that started in high school and really stemmed from my fear of public speaking. This led to less confidence and being antisocial. I haven't been evaluated by a doctor but I have all the symptoms of social anxiety.

I just started college and I want to have a good social life but my social anxiety is holding me back. The problem is I can't find the courage to get help. That and I also feel like nothing will help me. I'm really depressed thinking that the meds won't do anything and I'll be stuck like this forever.

This sounds stupid, but how do I build the courage to get help? I feel like a freak at school and I feel like I'm the only one experiencing this. Everyone else seems to like to be in social situations, I feel like sitting in my room playing games and ignoring everyone. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",['nsubj'],1

I finally got to see a doctor about all of this a few days ago and she perscribed me citalopram (celexa).  I took my first dose yesterday morning and about an hour after that I ended up with the worst attack to date. My bp was 170/112 when I got to the hospital. I was convinced I was going to die (oh the irrationality).  I'm so frustrated that I finally could afford too see a doctor and get help and got no where with it. Plus now ANOTHER Emergency room bill.  Major episodes are getting more and more frequent. They scare me so much that just thinking about them can start them. Almost like a ptsd type thing. 

I can't handle this any more. I have two young kids and haven't been able to be all there for them in the past few months. The physical stress of it all is driving me crazy as well. My hair is falling out, my muscles ache from being wound so tight or shaking, and have numbness in my face, chest,and hands most of the day. Sleep is  staggered and I have even woken up in the middle of the night having an attack because of somethung in a dream. My fiancee helps me out allot but I can tell it's starting to wear him down. 

Does anyone have any advice on remaining calm or keeping an attack in check before my bp goes through the roof? What meds have worked for you guys? An old friend of mine gave me some klonopin during an episode and it helped a little but my doctor wants to try this bullshit celexa first. Another doctor a few months ago gave me vistaril but that did nothing but give me restless legs. I don't want to have to go into an in patient program but it's starting to look like that might be my only way to stabilize. Especially with no insurance or family inn the area to help him with the kids. I know it's a bit of an over used statement... but im beginning to feel hopeless. I'm tried of being scared all the time. Hell... I about lost it in Wal-Mart today trying to look for a certain tshirt for a Christmas gift. What started as major health anxiety has turned into major everything anxiety. 

Any advice would be appreciated.",['nsubj'],1

I'm still on the 25mg, and still haven't felt any negative side effects. But over the past souple of months, I've noticed that my anxiety is starting to come back a little bit. A lot of it has been due to life circumstances and actual stressful situations... I *think*.

I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced a lack of effectiveness after a few months on meds? 

I'm going to talk to my doctor about either increasing my dosage, or possibly about whether the medication has done all it can and it's time for CBT, but I like to have a little bit of an idea what I'm talking about before I go in for the appointment.

I kept my cool until I got to my dorm where I went a bit hysterical. No one has recently told me how much xanax I could take at once, but I vaguely remember someone saying no more than 3 mg at one time. I've mildly overdosed on it before but I try to limit it to reduce tolerance and be functional. I took 5 .5mg pills and tried to calm down but ended up self harming anyway. I felt myself getting carried away and was tempted to do something really dangerous so I stopped but couldn't stop thinking about it. I took 2 more. And I felt like a lot of time had passed without improvement (although it was probably like 2 minutes) so I took 2 more. A friend who knows about my mental health stuff asked to come over and I thought some company might be good.

By the time she got there, I was starting to feel my meds take effect and I probably looked a little loopy. She convinced me to go to the school clinic for the cuts which I knew where shallow and clean enough for me to handle but I didn't want to argue. They just cleaned the cuts, put a band-aid on me, and let me go after talking to a councilor.

I started freaking out after that because I felt embarrassed and guilty for wasting their time. I completely blacked out at that point but my friend said I kept talking about it and took more xanax (4 I think).

I slept for 20 hours, was up for 6-8, and fell back asleep for another 14. Which wasn't ideal with finals coming up.

tl;dr- I took 6.5 mg xanax when I should have had a max of 3 sense it didn't seem to be helping enough. Blacked out and slept a bunch.

So if something similar happens again, what should I do? I think if I hadn't taken what I did, I may have done something dangerous. But overdoing benzos probably isn't a good plan of action. ",['nsubj'],1

I've recently come to terms with the fact that I needed professional help. Earlier this week I had my first appointment with the psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with Depression as well as Obsessive Compulsive Anxiety. She gave me a prescription for a low dosage of meds and told me to wait a month for them to kick in. AND that if I reacted positively to the medication then I could start seeing about a counselor. 

I'm excited to say the least to finally take the first step onto a journey of a healthy mental state and a more constant state of happiness(:

As of now, I'm currently sitting on my couch checking my pulse and blood pressure--I do this daily. This ritual ruins my life: takes time away from activities I want to do, time with my wife, and just leaves me drained all day. I usually get a really bad attack once a day--they last roughly fifteen minutes--then the shakiness and fear of another one lasts throughout the remainder of the day.

Whenever I have these episodes, it's because I'm afraid of my heart stopping/having a heart attack. It all started 9 months ago when I was drinking energy drinks to stay awake at work. One day I ingested 4 in a span of 7 hours--I didn't mind the taste of them, to be fair--and that's when the heart palpitations started. From the rapid heart rate, symptoms eventually snowballed into the typical ""impending doom"" feeling, fear of death, constant pacing around the house, and overall sense that I AM GOING TO DIE! THIS IS IT.

Since that night, the night I had my first attack, it's continued and has yet to let up. I have tried many things that have helped me in the course of nine months: breathing exercises, drinking ice-cold water in the midst of an attack, changing my diet (I haven't picked up an energy drink since they caused the attack nine months ago), watching my caffeine intake, and just learning to relax a little more--learning to slow down and not rush. However, they still hit me...and I still feel that impending ""This is it...my heart is about to stop feeling.""

I'm currently taking Klonopin 1.5mgs daily on top of 10mgs of Paxil. My current medications have really helped me.

I have stopped smoking--I am now using a vaping device. I have a cup of coffee in the morning then finish the day with nothing but water--no more sodas--well, maybe one every couple of days. I've changed my diet and have become really body conscious. Sadly I do not have the time to exercise as much as I would like--work hours, errands, and whatnot constrict me from doing so. 

Does anyone out there have anymore tips for me? Please. My blood pressure is usually around the 125/85 range with my pulse around 80 beats per minute. That makes me feel good--I rarely experience any episodes with my heart rate exceeding 100 beats per minute. 

I digress: any tips? Any words of reassurance? I just feel alone with this. My wife is the only supportive figure in my life to listen to me, and I feel as though I make life hell for her when I go through these episodes. These attacks just keep me from living--keep me from enjoying my life...and I need help.",['nsubj'],1

I've been dealing with depression/anxiety/OCD for the last 10 years. I've been on paxil, zanax, seroquel, abilify, zyprexa etc. I tried pretty much everything. Its difficult for me to talk about but here it goes.
I seem to have a fear of sexuality but its kind of difficult to explain. I'm a 25 year old male and i've had a fear of semen for about 10 years which is my underlying problem.

The anti-psychotic medication has helped in some ways to conquer my problem. People who take atypical antipsychotics will know that the loss of libido/sexual function is a very strong side effect. So basically all the medication has done is taken away the stress because I don't have wet dreams anymore and have absolutely no need for sex.

She put me in a weekly therapy group, and told me that if my smyptoms are still there after 8 weeks to make another appointment with her, where she might reccomend that I take medication.

It's been about 3 months, and I still feel pretty shitty. The group helped, but only to a certain extent,  because I'm way to choked up to even to even participate most of the time. So I should make an appointment, right? Except I can't.

I'm looking for you guys to share your experiences if possible! After getting some rubbish infection coupled with a family bereavement I was asked by my GP to try citalopram for a while due to intense anxiety until I started feeling better. To be honest I felt pretty much completely better after 6-9 months and sort of forgot I was taking it. After moving house I mentioned it to my new GP and he suggested I come off completely which I was pretty pleased about. So he immediately dropped my dose from 20mg to 10mg each day and told me after 2 weeks to go from 10mg daily to 10mg every 2 days. About 4 days ago I finished the course. Emotionally I feel pretty alright although physically a few weird things have started to happen.

1) I seem to be exhausted a lot of the time although my sleeping seems to be ok.
2) This is the weirdest one! I regularly keep getting a dizzy/light headed feel in my head. It's difficult to describe because it's not like anything I've ever felt before although it tends to happen with no clear trigger and makes me feel like I might faint (Although I never have, so I'm pretty sure it's fine). It only lasts a few seconds at a time.

I am a student in college who is two years past his intended year of graduation because of burnout in my forth year.  I took on a very difficult major because I was, at the time, very driven towards a career in that field (although in a very niche sector of it), and was simultaneously doing a heavy load of undergraduate research in my third and forth years.  I struggled a bit through the major whilst maintaining a decent GPA and putting a lot of effort into research in hopes that having my name on a paper would be of major help in getting me into a good PhD program. However, by the midway point of my Senior year I started having regular panic attacks and would have massive difficulty in staying focused in class and turning in assignments on time.  Even dropping classes and taking a small break from research wasn't helping me a whole lot, and I still had issues even completing fairly basic assignments.  I was diagnosed around that time with Anxiety/Depression and have been on 20mg Prozac and 1mg Lorezapam since.  Even though the medication helped me get through my panic attacks a little, it was not enough for me to keep up with the material to graduate on time despite being only 3 classes short.

Because I was struggling so much with classes that I would have had no problem with earlier in my college years, I thought that maybe I should take time off to rejuvenate myself.  During that time, I managed to get a job and taught myself programming, which I found myself very interested in.  Since the classes I needed were only offered the second half of the year, I had to wait until then to complete them.  However, when I did return to school, I had complete deja vu of what I was going through despite having time off.  I tried to even see a therapist regularly about this, but he was complete shit and basically of no help.  I wound up having to withdraw from my classes because my anxiety and depression were getting so bad again to the point in which I would be a week late on most of my assignments and failing them miserably.  I switched to a major that mostly overlapped, but had easier remaining requirements in hopes that I could actually get through this shit.  I'm now back in school again finishing these courses and while I'm faring a little bit better, I'm very worried about possibly failing this one very important class.  Because it's only offered once a year and is required, I'd have to wait another year to graduate if I screw up.  Despite being motivated to finish, I feel as if I have such low willpower to focus enough on my assignments that the depression and anxiety are outweighing the drive.  Luckily these feelings aren't affecting other parts of my life, but when it comes to overcoming them while fighting against the tyranny of academia, it has been a non-stop struggle.

I have big assignments due for all 3 of my classes tomorrow and tuesday this week, but I've barely been able to start any of them because I've been panicking most of the day each day since Friday.  None of the few people I'm close with have been able to help lift my spirits up to get my shit together and so I'm hoping you guys could possibly provide me insight and talk about this with me, which might bring me to focus again.  You'll probably chide me for writing this long sob story on reddit while I should be working, but if I'm not distracting myself, my face would be buried in my hands.",['nsubj'],1

Now with the layoff I was staying at home with the kids all summer.  

Yesterday i had a first phone interview and it went fine.  Afterwards I just started freaking out about going to the job itself as if I already had the job.  I just don't know if I can walk into any job ever again.   And I need the money for my family.

For instance: I can't work nearly as much as I used to based of the rate of panic attacks I experience. As hard as I've tried- a full time job is way too trying and I always end up calling in sick much more than is appropriate. I have an addictive personality and easily lose track of what I'm doing with psych/ anxiety meds- so I avoid them and can only receive relief via therapy.  I've also experienced a dangerous adverse reaction to psyche meds leaving me recovering from a series of seizures as a result. So psyche meds are really just an absolute no for me at this point. Above all I am painfully on guard and panic attack prone when doing anything outside of my home (especially in unfamiliar environments) and/or speaking with others I'm not extremely close to.

I recently went to see a GP for the first time in my life. I'm 26 years old and have battled with anxiety issues for the last 8 years or so. I've had several panic attacks and find myself not only living in fear of another attack but also having a general anxious feeling with most things. When I talked to my doctor, she acknowledged that anxiety-related problems run in my family and that she'd like to try me out on the lowest dose of Zoloft (sertraline): 50mg.

She advised me to take half pills for the first week. I'm currently on day #4 of the medication. She also suggested that I take it at night before bed, so I won't have my day ruined by the common side effects of drowsiness and nausea. I find myself not sleeping a full night since I've started taking it. I usually go to bed between 10pm and 11pm, since I get up for work at 6am, but the past three nights, I've been waking up anywhere between 3:45am and 5am.

If the medication is causing insomnia, is it safe to assume that I could take it in the morning rather than at night?


And as a related question, I know I'm not far enough in for the medication to really make an impact yet, but does anyone have any similar experience where it seems like anxiety in the morning is worse than usual?",['nsubj'],1

But how does it feel to have control over those emotions? How does it feel to live your life based around your positive emotions or neutrual moods? These are questions I don't know the answers of. 

I've been suffering a lot for the past month and it's the worst life experiences ever. My chest feels like mush or like a lightning storm is ravishing in my chest. It's awful and I'm used to it. But, there are days I can't handle it, guys. There has been times were I have been calm but, that's when I wake up, I go back to emotional torture. I'm not going to give up of course. I think the worst part is that I'm going through it alone and since my Mom doesn't understand my issues that much it makes it worse.

I know writing this post won't solve all my problems but I don't have many people to talk about this.

I'm starting to feel toxic though, I'm looking for anything that will make me happier. My happiness is so fragile and I worry that I'm going to run out of things that will keep me going. I feel like doing destructive things so I can feel peace. But, I have enough self-control to not do that. 

I filled a sheet for diagnosing my issues and I'm going to give it to my doctor. (She was the one that gave it to me in the first place.) Every once in a while I doubt that medication will work on me and hope everyday it won't make me worse in any way.

I was just sitting in the living room, talking on the phone and out of nowhere the room started spinning, heart started beating incredibly fast and I had trouble catching my breath. I was convinced I was having a heart attack (unlikely for an 18 year old but that didn't occur to me at the time) so I stood up, called for my sister and said we needed to go to the emergency room right away. The doctor took one look at me, thought I was high out my mind and asked a bunch of questions. Gave me something that dissolved under my tongue that helped but also kind of zombified me, told me I'm fine, it was a panic attack and sent us on our way. I went to my GP about a week later and told him everything including my history of general anxiety. I've always been very paranoid and I am really afraid of the dark. Yeah, its pretty pathetic but its making more sense these days now that I know whats ACTUALLY wrong with me. I used to get a lot of heart palpitations at night and never really knew why, I was always a panicky kid and teen and the slightest thing that set me off into rage or crying or extreme fear. I'm very ""sensitive"" - lets just put it that way. The doc gave me 40mg propranolol to get me through exams because I've been studying loads and stressing heaps. This is my final year of school and well... its not going so well. I can live with this until after exams, I have no choice. I am simply far too busy to take a break and seek other options at the moment. The meds help to a certain extent. Night time is still shite no matter what I take or what I do. I have triggers, I know them, I recognise them but I still don't know what to do about it ALL. 
What I really want to know is... Is there anything else I can or should be taking? Are there any exercises or techniques anybody knows of that can calm me down at night in particular? And for exams? (Last year I sat for 40 minutes into my English exam, staring at the clock, unable to do anything because I was so blank and stressed.) After exams, should I see a specialist? Like, a psychologist or psychiatrist? I have a history with eating disorders and depressive tendencies but I've never been diagnosed because I'm terrified of being put on anti-depressants.

32 yo male here, lifelong anxiety and episodic depression. Have been meditating last 18 months.

I have recently seen a new psychiatrist (only ever really seen psychologists before) and he immediately prescirbed Parnate.

I have over the last 10 years tried Zoloft, Effexor, Venlafaxine and Paroxetine, and never really noticed any effects, positive or negative from them. After I withdrew from the last, 2 years ago, Paroxetine, my episodic depression (which is triggered by anxiety, eg can come when change in circs or am really excited about new things) has got more constant, and I'm worried medications are the cause, and that this will happen with Parnate.

Still, if I am in a stable envinroment, day to day, while I can get easily overwhelmed, the depression is minimal and anxiety is the constant.

Reading reviews, it seems to be a useful medication, but people seem to be on it for life, and for severe depression more than anxiety.

Has anyone withdrawn from it, and remained off medication. What were the long-term effects - worse after it then before it?

I'm also concerned about whether it is necessary. When I saw psych, I was having a very depressed week, and while anxiety and depression does effect me every day, when I am feeling well (most of the time, as long as things are not changing too much or other stressors) I feel like I don't want to risk it. That said, most days I do find small things overwhelming and anxiety-provoking, and I know that I could make a success of my business if I could deal with the stress from minor things, self-criticism and 'replaying things in my head' and the over-sensitivity to others' criticism. I have stagnated in my life, and I have struggled with mental issues my whole lie (when a child, anxiety would manifest in 'dizzy spells', hyperventilation etc).

Also, I really struggle to get motivated and positive in the mornings, although in the evenings I often feel great.

I have also recently returned to having 'depersonalisation' when I'm feeling anxious - like I am watching myself from afar (had also as a child).

So is it worth taking? You are welcome to read some of my other posts to see my history.

And I suppose, as a more minor point, how have people dealt with the phyiscal restrictions? (for me, a small price to pay).

Thankyou.

the first two hours of the first pill were the worst. intense dizziness, moderate nausea, mild brain zaps and headache, angry and irritable as fuck. I'm glad I warned my SO before taking it.

after that, it was mostly just mild nausea, lots of irritability and a vague sadness. plus occasional random muscle twitches, mostly in my arms. the second day I got mild dizziness after taking the pill, but it passed quickly.

oh, and there's also the weirdest impulsive-tired feeling. I was concerned that if I thought of something I might just do it, because I just DGAF about consequences. but I also couldn't really be bothered with doing much either. eventually I told my SO (because I was concerned I might say mean things to him, or even hit him) and he reassured me that I hadn't said anything upsetting yet and he was ok with being patient until the meds settled down. :) the feeling faded slowly, and I didn't do anything bad. I have been acting more assertive, though, which is nice. 

around day 4, that tiny feeling of sadness turned into depression. day 5 it got worse. god, I'd forgotten how thoroughly awful that feels. it wasn't like the times when depression tries to reassert itself through insidious thoughts - this just jumped straight to the feeling, and a fair bit of it, and there was no way to think myself out of it because it was caused by the pills. so, I talked to my SO and cried a lot and meditated... and then it passed. and I woke up the next day feeling.. not exactly happy, but.. content, again.

now that I think about it, I don't think I've felt happy all week. too much background pain and discomfort and irritability (from medical issues, not just buspar). but I was getting close yesterday, and I do feel content at times. meditation has helped a *lot* in maintaining my sanity.

today's pill made me a bit dizzy again and very angry. I'm not sure why, but I suspect having my lunch on a rice cracker instead of proper bread affected it. I'll try and have more filling lunches from now on.

now I just wish my brain would un-fracture itself.. I'm having one of those days where I can't seem to actually do what I want or intend to do (I think this is an aspie thing?), and it sucks, and it might make me late to a party, and I'm trying not to worry about whether I'm actually well enough to go... anyways. I'll go now. and then tonight, I'll take the second dose of buspar. wish me luck! :)",['nsubj'],1

So, as far as getting my Zoloft or the paltry amount of Ativan (usually around 10 per year) she would give me for my anxiety and panic attacks, I now have nothing.  My psychologist (only made it to one appointment this year) can't prescribe and the last time I saw her, she did tell me medicine might be beneficial, but was in a hurry because our session was running late and didn't refer me for the med doctor at the counseling center.  I am in serious trouble.  I would go to the hospital with my panic attacks, but that also involves going out.  On top of that, the last time I went, the doctors misdiagnosed me and I ended up much worse than I started.. I also have some bad anxiety about picking up an infection while there, as my step dad died because of that.

How can I get treatment if I can't leave the house?  It's ridiculous.  I was doing okay then I just nose dived into crazy town.  Now that I'm here, I can't get out.  Valerian doesn't work.  Can't drink because of health reasons and my desire not to become addicted to that method of coping.  I take benadryl sometimes, but then I just end up in a zombie headache state if I don't fall asleep.  I have nothing left aside from one doggy Valium at 5mg.. I only had two to begin with.

Basically, I'm sensitive to loud sounds and other irritating sounds, and coupled with many lifestyle changes I've made recently, I've been feeling a great deal of anxiety, to the extent of crying spells and freak-outs at home and at work.
Other changes include moving to a new city, changing jobs, quitting smoking, changing birth control methods, breaking up with boyfriend, and basically adjusting from mountain-country life to city life. It's been a tumultuous 7 months. 

So I finally decided I can't function with my crying spells and anxiety attacks, and got on Zoloft. Also, there's no other real treatment for my hearing issues, but anti-anxiety meds are a common things for us.
So it's been a week, and I'm not sure this is right for me. I'm only on day 2 of taking a full pill, was taking a half for the past week.
I feel really disconnected and detached. My anxiety is less, sure, but I'm also zoning out and feeling so tired I can barely stay awake.  I'm even feeling more anxious today, so much I had to leave my office and go outside to calm down. I had stabbing pains in my left thigh the other day - not sure if that's connected, but it's never happened before. 
Last night, I felt like disconnected from my body, and like I was floating, and my legs felt weird. 
I told my doctor I don't like how I feel, and she said to go back down to half a pill, which I will do today. Ideally, I don't want to be medicated at all, but my anxiety was getting in the way of my life, so I had to do something.
Now I just feel like not myself, kind of weird and out of it. I just want to feel normal again, even if I have anxiety with it. 

EDIT: Just got off the phone with my doc. When I said I felt ""detached"" she said stop taking it right away, and sent me a prescription for Celexa, which shouldn't be so intense.

I'm now 19, the medicine works well for me and I've changed my doses a few times but it's been steady for the past few years and I've been perfectly fine. A little anxiety here and there but nothing insane. 

Early last spring I had gone to a doctors appointment (for my anxiety) and a dentist appointment in the same day. Everything went fine but something about the weather had made me very anxious. It was becoming warm outside but it was breezy and it just gave me some nostalgia or something that made me anxious and I wasn't sure what it was. Later that day I went to work and ended up leaving early because I was so anxious for no reason at all. The whole day had just made me an anxious mess and I couldn't figure out why. The weather had made me remember times when my anxiety was really bad and I knew that's what it was but still, my anxiety began to go wild. From there I went a week dealing with anxiety and anxious thoughts. Most of them were just being anxious about getting anxious (dumb I know) and then Id start to worry about what if I ever became depressed. And I have a good head on my shoulders and I've never once had any thoughts of self harm or anything like that. I know my life is great and that's a stupid thing to worry about. But still, my anxiety would just get me focuses on that and then Id start to worry about every other thing in my life. It ended up going away and I was fine again. 

2 weeks ago, I went to a doctors appointment and dentist appointment in the same day. And I remember thinking to myself how the last time I did that routine I ended up with bad anxiety. But I knew that was stupid to connect the two. But at the same time I was also getting sick again, (strep throat) and when I get sick I start to get anxious that I'll become bed ridden for days or something and then id have to deal with sleeping all day and being sick and uncomfortable and having all my days be off schedule and stuff. So, I stopped drinking coffee because my anxiety was going crazy. And Friday I felt good again. I was able to push my anxiety away and I felt good. The next day I had a cup of coffee and then the rest of the day I was anxious beyond belief. It made no sense. I was so good the day before and then out of nowhere it came back. And today it was bad. I didn't have any coffee but still my anxiety was there and it wasn't about anything at all. I just felt anxious and then id get anxious about being anxious. 
I started keeping a log of my anxiety and how it was and what i had eaten or drank to find a pattern possibly. Just waiting for it all to pass, I find that my anxiety usually comes out when the seasons begin to change because it'll bring back memories of when my anxiety wasn't under control.

I've filled in at other locations plenty of times before, but I've never been to this place. And this place is my new permanent location, and I have to stride on in there tomorrow at 2pm and make a good impression on everyone who already works there. I'm so scared. I don't have any real qualms about the actual job, I'm basically doing the same thing I've always done. The job isn't the hard part, the people are the hard part. 

I'm very introverted, always have been. I have a high level of social anxiety, and I've only just realized how abnormal it is. Even my fiance, who has high anxiety, does not have the degree of *social* anxiety that I feel. I'm Bipolar I and I have ADHD, I've sometimes been diagnosed with a couple other things too. I'm a moron, I've been unmedicated since July. This is not going to help the situation. I've had this thought cross my mind several times tonight: ""If I kill myself, then I won't have to go to my new job tomorrow!"" **(Note: I'm not actually suicidal right now, just ideations)**

I'm always worried about what other people are thinking of me, I'm convinced that most people don't like me. My clothes are dirty looking (live without laundry, too depressed to go to laundromat/can't get to laundromat/not enough time to let them air dry if I wash them in the sink), I'm fat, and to top it all off, I'm going to be arriving *on foot* to this new location because my car is dead. I feel like the image I will be presenting to these new employees will be screaming **piece of trash, arriving now!!**

I don't know how to present myself as a ""normal human being"". I don't consider myself to be one, I don't think anyone I've *ever* met, including friends and family, has *ever* considered me to be anything other than strange as all fuck. Sometimes I wear my weirdness as a badge of honor, but other times, it bothers me. If I'm the one saying I'm weird, I own it. But when it's everybody else who's constantly saying it, it starts to hurt. 

How am I supposed to go in with an air of confidence if I'm terrified of everybody there? I've had bouts of paranoid delusions before (all about other people and not trusting them), what if that happens again? What if they all hate me? 

I have a hard time talking to people, even people I like. Apparently, my fiance has had to assure his friends that I do not, in fact, hate them. I like his friends. I've known them for *years*, I just don't speak when they're around. I'm too timid. I feel as if I have nothing of value to say. I don't entirely mind just sitting and listening to conversation, but apparently my silence makes people uncomfortable. Why do I have to talk to be considered normal? I'm not good at it, it frightens me, so I'd just rather not a lot of the time. 

I called and scheduled an appointment with a mental health facility, I'm going in April. I made the focus of my call my hoarding problem, since that hasn't been addressed in a very long time. I suppose I should mention my social issues as well. I want to make it clear to whoever does my intake that I do not want medication. I've been on medication for the better part of the past 16 years, and my first encounter with the mental health systems was 18 years ago, when I was only 10 years old. I'm sick of the system, and I'm even more sick of medication. The only medication I would consider would be for ADHD, because everything else tends to cloud my brain, and I have enough of that as it is.

So, here I sit. It's 1:45am, and I have that feeling of ""butterflies"" in my stomach. It's more accurate to say that it's the feeling you get when you're falling. It's just a constant, purposeless, feeling of abstract terror. And it gets 10x worse when I lay down to go to sleep, so lately, I stay up until I feel like I'm going to pass out.

I've been medicated since May, which has helped my daily mild symptoms such as shakiness, jitters, and frantic thoughts, but I am still having 2-3 pretty major panic attacks a week. Some of my attacks are so severe that I now have to wear medical alert bracelets because I panic in public and strangers think that I am either having a seizure or heart attack.       


My doctors have only continued to increase the dosages of my SSRI (zoloft) and Buspar. I'm now on 300mg zoloft and 60mg Buspar, which is basically the max dose for my age and weight. These meds have worked WONDERS for my daily symptoms, but I still frequently have panic attacks that I simply can't come down with, or I have bad days where I have several severe panic attacks throughout the entire day. I think it would help my and be in my best interest to have a low rx of a benzodiazepine so that in the event that I have a panic attack that lasts for over an hour, I'll have something to stop it. Yes, I'd be out of commission for the rest of the day, probably, but I would be anyways and at least this way I'm not panicking. I've expressed this to my doctors multiple times, but they absolutely refuse to consider it. 
  
I swear, if my doctors simply double my dosages at my next appointment instead of considering other options I'm going to lose my shit. At some point, prescribing a different kind of drug has to be a better option, right? I hope so. I just want a back-up plan incase I have an attack that lasts for hours. I want to be able to stop it and take myself out of hell on those days when I get stuck in it. ",['nsubj'],1

I'm a broken person. I don't mean necessarily broken in an emotional way, I'm broken in that I'm not able to correctly function in society, and am often confused on how to respond to people or events.

Both of my parents have something called Narcissistic Personality Disorder (I've been to /r/raisedbynarcissists ). Someone who has this disorder is  disconnected from reality and extremely obsessed with themselves. I was what they call the scapegoat. 

Because my parents had this I was never taught the basics of...I don't know how to put it other than interacting with humans. Normal, non-crazy ones at any rate. I was very isolated as a kid. My mother would always keep me home from school, and I was homeschooled for a few years. 

My friends never came over, I never went over to their house. Never called them. I don't really know why. I guess it just seemed normal to not interact with people. My parents never did. Most of the time I only ever was around my mother. My abusive controlling ""mother"" who called me an evil soulless person. This is one of my first memories. That and being pulled out of my mother's arms and dropped on the floor because the two of them were arguing. 

When I turned 23 I was finally out on my own, and in the world (when I tried to do things like get my own bank account my mother would scream, hit me, throw things at me, tell her friends I was a horrible child and have them tell me off on the phone). I got into college met some people (really one person sat down next to me in class and we started talking. I've never actually went after people and have no idea how to). My friends and I would go out, I would do things, or say things, or act some way I thought was normal and I would get comments. Like why would you say that? Or people don't do that. It's hard to explain but the more people I interacted with the more...confused and isolated I felt. I constantly have others misunderstanding what I'm saying. I don't know if I'm using the wrong words. I have a very hard time defending myself.

And strangers would get angry with me, some of them yelled at me. I would have massive panic attacks every time this happened until I stopped going out altogether. I went into therapy for many years, was in the hospital for a week because I had a panic attack for three days (mother was harassing me I don't want to do into it), nothing changed and I only got worse.

I try to go out. I hate being inside. I hate feeling alone. I don't want to be one of ""those pieces of trash on welfare"" everyone's yelling about on the news all the time. I want to be able to go buy food when I run out. I want to live a life.

So then things like this happen...

I went to the bank today. Drove there. I get there and there's a car waiting in the middle for a spot to open. I see people do this all the time. I got behind them and waited in line. A spot opened up, they went through, I took their spot and waited. A truck comes up behind me, honks, then almost clips my mirror coming around me. The man rolls down the window and screams pick a fucking lane then drives ahead. I pull next to him and say, I was waiting for a lane to open up. He rolls up his window and turns his head away. There was another truck behind him who when the first guy pulled through, the second guy rolled down his window and said, you take up two lanes what the fuck do you expect to happen?

So at this point I'm having a massive panic attack. I have no idea why this happened. I just go home instead of getting food because I'm done at this point.

A month ago I had someone clip my bumper when I was waiting at a light to turn left. It was on yield, so I was waiting for a spot in traffic to pull out, he's behind me honking, then when the light turns to an arrow I start to pull out and he comes up to the side of me to turn around me and clips my bumper then drives off.

A while before that I was in wal mart looking at air fresheners and a man who was standing next to me asked me some question about them, I answered, a minute after that he picked up a fake snake that someone had left on the shelf and tossed it onto my chest. I just stared at him and he said, oh you're not scared. I replied no. Then he walked off.

I could make a post dedicated to things like this happening. There must be something about me that attracts them to do this. Random people push me, yell at me, do weird things to me. It's not rare. There's something wrong with me they must pick up on. The looks on my face, the way I stand, the way I talk or dress it has to be something wrong with me.

I don't know how to deal with these people. I don't know how to prevent it. I don't know what to do when it happens. It gets to the point where I fall into a depression and wonder why the hell I'm still here and just want to end it. Therapy didn't, help medication didn't help.

I'm 32 now. I think I've gotten to the point where I can't be helped. It's been going on to long. I think all of this is something that's been engraved in my brain and it's not going to get polished out.

I really wish I were dead. I have no one to talk to anymore. I feel so alone.",['nsubj'],1

Right after high school I went to the Renfrew Center for months for an eating disorder. Finally went to a psychiatrist, got put on Lexapro for depresssion and anxiety. I was on that for about a year and a half but (stupidly) decided to quit cold turkey my sophmore year of college, partly because I genuinely thought I didn't need it any more and partly because more than anything I want to be normal and not have to depend on medication or combat anxiety. 

So, I did pretty well for a few months off the lexapro. I didn't feel very anxious or depressed at all, though I may have been self medicating with weed a little. (Which I must say, at least for me personally, is very helpful.) 

But then right before I went home for the summer, it was like I had a breakdown. I got prescribed Prednisone for a bad respiratory  infection and I became incredibly anxious and my heart began to constantly race. The Prednisone actually fucked me up so bad that it messed up my stomach lining and I had gastritis for a month, and had to take an acid reflux medicine. During that whole time, I had a panic attack nearly every day and my heart didn't ever slow down. I had an EKG done and physically my heart is fine, so I know that it's a product of anxiety. I was thinking that once I got better, the anxiousness would go away, but it hasn't.

It's been about three months since this all started and I'm feeling just about as anxious and depressed as I was before I got put on medication for the first time. For me anxiety is very physical (racing heart, nausea, pit in stomach) and is all about how other people perceive me-do they hate me, are they ignoring me, is everyone tired of me, I bet everyone laughs at me behind my back, etc. I am aware that these thoughts are irrational but I can't really control them. I can go out and see people and interact with them fine, and I enjoy doing so because it eases the worry of whether everyone hates me, but when I'm alone (which college students usually are for the most part when they come home for the summer) it gets really bad. I start to obsess about every little thing I've ever done or said and read way too deeply into the things people are saying to me. My panic attacks usually involve hyperventilating and long crying spells. Weirdly, I think the depression I experience is and has always been a side effect of my anxiety. I get so anxious that I convince myself everyone hates me and that I'm not going to make it through college or make anything of myself, and then I feel deeply sad as a result. 

In the past I self medicated a lot (eating disorder to numb anxiousness, excessive drinking, anything that would calm me down) but I'm trying to avoid that now. I have an appointment with a psych coming up but I'm also kind of nervous that an antidepressant would make me worse, since I do way too much anxious googling and have read some horror stories.

I like threads like these because they help me feel like I'm not alone. So, does anyone have similar experiences with anxiety to mine? What SSRI/medicine helped you the most? This isn't a throwaway account so I'll probably delete this in a few days but in the mean time, I'd like to just read about some other experiences.","['pobj', 'dobj', 'nsubj']",1

Well anyways, both went into remission for the most part, which was great. I was taking lexapro and adderall because I have a really hard time staying awake. Then I got married and my low sex drive became a problem, so doctor decides to take me off lexapro and switch to wellbutrin. Mind you that there was no weaning. 

Bam! Welcome back anxiety. I then had the perfect combo to make me feel like super anxiety girl all the time. Plus the wellbutrin was making me vomit. I brought this up plus the anxiety and still being tired all the time (hypersomnia). So he decided to take me off wellbutrin (again, cold turkey) and up the adderall. 

I have felt like complete shit this whole summer. Old tics are coming back. I finally got the courage to say I wanted to see the other doctor at the practice and I am seeing him tomorrow (15 minute follow up). 

I'm pissed because the old doctor is terrible! I should have known better than to trust his advice. I'm also pissed because it took me so long to get to a place where I wasn't either freaking out or a zombie. 

I know my meds needed to be changed anyways, but it could have been handled way better without me having to suffer like this. I absolutely did not miss anxiety stomach.

I've been trying to do the whole stay up late thing here but it hasn't been working.  I have early classes and I've been getting too tired too quickly to do work late at night.

Long story short, my best friend ran off and married a woman he hardly knew, moved across the country to be with her, and suprise suprise, they have divorced.

quick background....he and i briefly dated about 6 years ago, and stayed friends.  a casual sexual relationship happened, but it was always casual.   he says he loves me, and he should have married me, made a big mistake marrying her, yadda yadda yadda.

Well, now i have plane tickets to fly out there to see him in january.  I haven't seen him since he left to move out there.

He tells me he loves me, but I don't believe him.

I am sick to my stomach nervous about seeing him face to face.  I need help with dealing with these emotions.  I would love to be with him again, but my nerves....always my nerves!!!  

My mind constantly races to the worse possible situation, I fall into a web of lies, and end up hurt.  My medication doesn't seem to help, and I'm almost afraid to get put on something stronger, or change meds.  

Unfortunately, the anxiety sometimes leads me to cutting (i haven't done this for six months, and I want to keep it this way).

I feel like I can't focus on anything else but stalking his facebook and be critical of every single interaction he has on there with any body, especially those of the female persuasion.   

I feel like I can't say anything to him about it because we aren't a couple, and we haven't had that discussion yet, but I need a way to calm my mind.   

I've tried distraction.   Not obsess over things I can't prove.  

I've tried keeping busy, going for a walk, reading a book, surfing reddit, watching a movie....but I find my mind wandering to the ""what if"" constantly.

My stomach is constantly in knots.  I can't focus on anything else, except for what he ""could"" be thinking.  

I find myself wanting to badger him for reassurance, but I know that will push him away from me.

My mind cannot focus on something for a period longer than ten minutes.  I've started to double up my meds, because I feel like I need them, however, they aren't anything fast-acting, just celexa....so doubling up doesn't really do anything quickly.

I wonder how the body works and how things are actually here. How anybody is here. I used to be terrified to fall asleep and sometimes still am for fear that I won't wake up.

  
  Slightly off that subject. I huge part of my anxiety is driving. Especially alone. I panic really bad. I just got used to driving in my hometown of Florida but now I relocated to Hawaii and I can't even drive on a highway. Just being alone with my thoughts is scary, being in traffic is scary, I have to control my breathing and try and keep myself occupied at lights. Lights are the worst. I don't understand. I don't understand where this came from.

I know this is kind of all over the place. Hopefully someone knows what I mean. I've been on so many different medications to try and ease all of this. I'm on my way to being on none know :) Though these thoughts are still very hard to shake.

Is anyone else going through this, I really feel like I'm the only one.

I'm 16, female and currently studying French, Italian and Maths in my first year at college in the UK. For the past few months I've suffered from severe migraines, chest pain, dizziness and many other things. I've been to my GP several times, where they put me on different kinds of medication and I had at least four blood tests in the past year, but nothing came back and the medication only made things worse. I just wanted to know what was making me feel this way so I could try to get better. My mum thought I was over reacting and staying home from college because I wasn't enjoying it.

Starting college this year was a big step for me because my boyfriend and I both applied to the same college but I was the only one to get a place. I'm the only person from my high school to go and it's quite a long way from where I live, but I didn't want to turn down the opportunity. In my last few years at high school I was a grade A student but I would stress and panic when it came to exams. Fortunately they all went fine, and on results day I was so relieved. I'd done so well, I got mostly A's and A*s. I'd even managed to get an A* in my French exam which I'd worked so hard to get. 

Now, I can barely remember any of the basic stuff and I forget things so easily. It's getting to the point where I don't want to go into college any more because I'm scared that I'll keep feeling the numbing pain that's preventing me from remembering anything. I've considered taking a year out and starting my first year again because of how much work I've missed, I just don't know if it will help. Every time I take a day off I feel guilty and become more anxious because I've missed important lessons and I feel like people are constantly judging me because nobody, including myself, knows what's wrong with me. I feel like I can't have a conversation with somebody because I can barely form a sentence. I often find myself saying things completely wrong or stopping mid sentence and forgetting what I was going to say next. 

Before the Christmas holidays things kept getting worse, I blacked out  for the first time and was on the floor for several minutes unable to move and then I started having heavy nose bleeds several times a day at the most inconvenient of times. When I told my boyfriend and my parents they said it is probably to do with stress and that things will ease off during the holidays. I was hopeful, it's been months since I've felt 'well' and I was really hoping to have a fun Christmas. In the first week I could feel a slight difference, I felt less heavy. But I still felt ill. I felt faint and weird still, I could tell that most of the stress and anxiety had gone but something else was wrong with me. It's horrible.
I just want to be able to have a day where I don't feel ill, embarrassed or stupid because I'm getting sick of feeling like this. And I'm pretty sure everyone else is too.

The anxiety however, I have received no treatment for. I put it down to teenage angst and ignored it, though I have had panic attacks before. The asthma is very very very slight and is only an issue if I'm running for extended periods of time.

Anyway recently I've been getting these symptoms and I'm not sure whether to attribute it to asthma or anxiety (I've had some emotional crap lately that has been stressful)

Symptoms are

1) Tightness in my chest

2) Trouble breathing (like I can't properly fill my lungs and can only breath shallowly. Sometimes taking a big gasp gives relief for a few seconds)

I assumed it was asthma because, well, it's logical. However the pollen count is low, and asthma medication does not alleviate the symptoms whatsoever.

Symptoms of my anxiety were sweaty palms, feeling cold and weak, sore, tired, head spinning, low self esteem, low confidence, crazily bad nausea (dry heaving, bloating) and generally not really wanting to have to deal with being alive to experience it all (depression).

I was prescribed amitriptyline a week back, and since taking it I have had NO symptoms. None. I believe some of it was my own doing through not knowing how to 'manage myself' (swallowing air causing nausea and bloating, reflux etc) and since my other symtoms aren't coming through, I am not panicking and *causing* other symptoms.

I've been out *every single day* since I started taking it, talking with strangers and shopping in huge public places... All of it. Crazy progress in a week, and honestly? Unexpected. I did *not* think that medication would help so much.

I've not once had a freak out session. If I look hard enough for it, I can feel the anxiety quietly hiding away in the back of my mind looking for a way out, but if you focus on what you're trying to achieve YOU WILL BE FINE. 

When I started taking this and wasn't anxious and focusing on that 24/7, I noticed things about myself. I don't drink enough water, and definitely haven't been eating a decent diet for a long, long time.. Which probably made things worse for me. With the amitriptyline I am able to focus on **living** instead of **surviving**. 

Side effects (for me!):

Occasional tiredness. Maybe the first 3 days I took it, I was sleepy. Not been tired since that third day though, so I think I 'got used to it'.

Dry tongue. This one happens a lot, pretty much every time. But it causes no trouble, just drink water every hour or so and brush your teeth extra. You *will* have lingering tastes in your mouth from food you ate 11 hours ago!

No nausea or vomiting side effects.
No cramping or aches.
No unpleasantness in general, including poop-wise. Heh. 

Just some food for thought, and I hope if anybody uses the search function for this drug in future, you can find this helpful. *Don't* rely on meds to fix your problems. They can help rub away the anxiety so you can fix the underlying problems without the drama of anxiety attacks getting in the way.

So some quick back story. She used to go to my school but dropped out due to not knowing what she wants to do. In the first month or two we had sex. She has a low sex drive and I have a high one but I try for it to not effect my mood. And when we were in school we'd obviously see each other almost everyday and had sex maybe 3 times out of 3 months because of the work load was killing her.

Fast forward to next semester she lives at home about an hour away and works 5 days a week all day and Saturday is band practice day and Sunday is open. I asked her to spend the night in hopes of having some fun and as soon as she gets there I feel queezy, no big deal I've got this before, then we get to the bedroom and I lie down and I gotta throw up. So I do and I feel better, brush my teeth and lie back down. Comes back again but no vomit this time. 

So now whenever she comes over and I think we may do something I get the same feeling. Last night was kind of the last straw for me because I want to love her in other ways and it's been 3 months since the last time. Plus I beat my record of once to twice a day.

This is why I'm reaching out. I'd rather not see a therapist or take medicine. I would just like to be fine like I've always been. However, if medicine is an only option I'd rather over the counter. I would much rather not go see someone about my problem(s). 

One quick tidbit is when we would have sex it only be at her place, be it in her old dorm or at her family home. Plus I have 3 other roommates that are there as well that may also be a trigger but I'm uncertain. Also when I take a train to her home to hangout I'm perfectly fine so I feel like it is my dorm that causes my anxiety.

TL;DR I throw up when I'm alone with my girlfriend and things might get intimate.",['nsubj'],1

I currently see a therapist once a week and have a doctor to help with medication.

I was mainly wondering if I should see a different doctor for prescription help, but this may be normal behavior from a doctor, I have no idea and live on my own so I have no one to really ask.

My current prescribing doctor has been prescribing anti-depressants, which so far have all given me bad side-effects. He hasn't tried to prescribe anything to help with my 2-3 daily anxiety attacks or anything to help with my insomnia which has become increasingly worse to where I average about 2 hours of sleep a night. He refuses to prescribe new medications or see me in between appointments and won't set up any appointments sooner than 2 months apart. I've been seeing him for about 8 months but have only seen him 3 times.

Each time I recieve a new medication, I have fairly severe side-effects almost immediately and after a phone call, he will tell me to stop taking said medication but will not try anything else until I come back into his office 2 months later. After 8 months I have only been able to try 3 medications and after this next semester I will not be able to take another semester off for medical reasons.

I also have mild depression and its just the way it has always been. I choose not to take medications for it, because I have been able to cope with it for this long and a friend of mine makes me feel guilty for even considering using them.

I have had a panic attack before and am anxious when it comes to making friends/being in large crowds/relationships.

I'm currently a 16 year old high school student who has been diagnosed with anxiety about a year ago. Last year (as a sophomore) I had an extreme problem with taking tests. Many people get test anxiety, and for the vast majority of people it was easy to deal with, but I was convinced I was somehow different. Nearly every time I had to take a test, I had to go to the bathroom, which obviously angered my teachers, one of which did not let me go and I literally put C for the last 10 questions I was on, and my other teacher let me go a couple of times, but then suspected that I went to the bathroom to cheat.

Even when there wasn't a test I would get social anxiety, and holding a conversation was extremely difficult because all I could think about was school. The weird thing about anxiety is that it's exponential, you get anxiety for thinking about your anxiety, which really really does suck.

Well, my mom was convinced that I was having a health problem, so we went to my doctor. One, he diagnoses me with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Psoriasis, and referred me to a psychologist. He told me that anxiety most likely caused the IBS and Psoriasis, and that seeing the Psych would help.

So a couple weeks went by an I was finally able to see the Psychologist. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to help with my anxiety at all, to which she referred me to a Psychiatrist... At this point I thought I was a train wreck, going through 2 doctors to see a third just to help with one problem.

So, pretty much like before I showed up to the Psychiatrist's office. I thought this would be just another uneventful meeting and get nothing done than come to the obvious conclusion that I had a problem. Within 5 minutes of my appointment I was able to tell him about me being so scared of tests that I couldn't think straight, and after that he gave me a prescription for Zoloft. 

After taking it the night before, the next day I felt extremely better. I came into class with an open mind and with no anxious tendencies. But the meds might not of been the only thing that helped me. I started riding my bike to school, and to just feel the wind in my hair and face is almost meditative.

Those of you in high school and have anxiety, you're not alone. If you need any help you can always PM me, I will be happy to try to guide you through the process.

This has happened before when I've had incredible amounts of stress, and I recognize the intolerable amount of tension that precedes it happening.

At the same time, I need a bit more help with depression at this time in my life.

I have clinically diagnosed GAD and OCD  (cleaner, counter, stacker) that actually went undiagnosed up until recently. I have a Type A personality, and always brushed off my anxiety as ""just school related,"" ""just college related,"" or ""just work related."" In July of last year, my panic attacks got more frequent--we're talking one a week, here. I was absolutely miserable. My amazingly supportive husband just looked at me one day and said, ""You've got to do something. This stress and anxiety is absolutely tearing you apart.""   

So! I took part in an anxiety research study first. I had never been on anxiety meds before in my life and didn't know what to expect. I honestly thought there would be this great big epiphany or something. But nope, nothing like that. The six week trial went great, I felt fine, and had no panic attacks. I lost NO days of work to stress and anxiety. I was able to complete assignments and do my normal daily tasks without having a meltdown.  
Fast-forward three weeks. I was off the trial medicine and NOT doing well. Crazy emotional. Raging headaches. Unable to focus. Panic attacks came back. ...and my hair started falling out. My loving husband noticed one day while I was in the bathroom brushing my hair. He was so taken aback, he was scared to say anything. But obviously I cried. He cried. We both just bawled for 20 minutes because of the physical implications of my stress. I lost an entire work week. Five entire days that I couldn't work, couldn't leave my house, and couldn't function.   
So I went to my psychologist, told her all about the research study, the trial drug, my hair loss, and returning anxiety. She prescribed 100mg /daily of Zoloft for both the anxiety (GAD) and my OCD.  

Does anyone have experience (success or failures) with Zoloft or any other meds? I'm heavily ANTI benzos, and really want this medication to work. I should mention that depression runs in my family, but since anxiety and depression are on two separate ends of the same scale, I just happened to get ""lucky"" with anxiety and not depression. My mom has been taking Zoloft for 20 years, and it's seemed to really help her depression.

As a child I had a couple meetings with a psychologist about my intense fear of school/leaving my house in any way. This did not resolve in much besides ""oh she probably has separation anxiety"". My parents did quite a lot to help me, through talking with me and trying to help me rationalize my fears, and by the time I turned 11 or so (yes, from 5-11!) I was very outgoing and generally extroverted. I have always needed alone time to recharge, but I don't see that as a huge problem. Maybe it is...

As an aside, I have been reading through a lot of threads tonight and it seems like another medical issue I've struggled with is made a little clearer - I've always had a lot of issues with my stomach, which I am now thinking is related to my anxiety. I have had literally every test on my stomach in the world and they never show anything. Anyway, I digress...

Over the last 5 years my anxiety has gotten worse and worse and I am to the point that I find it hard to leave my house, get out of bed, my relationships are strained and suffering, and I have serious food/internet/(+other things to distract myself) issues. 

I really feel like I am on the verge of a much more serious dive into the black hole of anxiety/depression. I try to be rational and logical but I generally spend most of my time hating myself, being unable to complete simple tasks without feeling overwhelmed, terrified and exhausted, and about 15 seconds away from tears. 

My family are not really pro-medication and I guess growing up around the stigma of drug=bad, I am very nervous about the possibility of being prescribed medication. Personally, I think medication is a wonderful tool in the process of self-healing, but you know... logic is not always equal to anxiety.

Did/does anyone else feel this way? Is there anything I should know about taking medications? Any stories, advice, or thoughts at all would really help me.

I have been through lexapro, paxil, and effexor as well as my beta blocker but I guess it's just on to the next one.  I have to get this under control now as my #1 priority so I can start living my life again.  It's so draining and thinking back to a time when they weren't so severe and I could just go and live life and make decisions without the worry of ""WHAT IF"" is hard to imagine.   Time to start the cycle over....I'm tired of losing jobs, friends, and life opportunities over this disease. ",['nsubj'],1

It's usually health related.  I do have some actual health concerns but a lot of it is undiagnosed and I think it may be psychosomatic pain and anxiety manifesting into functional issues.  For example, my stomach only gets upset right before I leave the house to go to an appointment, work, etc., something I don't want to attend.  Sometimes the minute I make plans with someone, even if I do want to go do something, I'll get a headache or stomachache and immediately think about canceling.  I get an overall crampy, tight feeling all over my abdominal area but mostly on the upper left side.  It feels like I'm constantly working my abs.

Like I said, it kind of goes in cycles.  I'll go a few days worrying about my stomach, do I have an ulcer, will I bleed out, etc.  And then that fear will be replaced by something new.  I'll get one headache or migraine and it will start a week of worrying if I'm going to start having constant migraines again.

I guess it would be nice to know if anyone else here gets actual pain from their anxiety, I'm so confused, medication doesn't help because I don't think there's anything wrong with me but it feels real!

During the past month, I've had at least 2 anxiety attacks that were so bad that I thought I was going to die or pass out. I've also had others that felt almost as bad. For instance, yesterday I was driving my girlfriend to my house and felt like I was going to have a panic attack, throw up, or pass out. I also have what seems like all day anxiety. My stomach hurts and I have trouble breathing. Just writing this, I've having trouble breathing. I also get anxious thoughts where I feel like I can see my whole life spinning out of control to the point where I die, go crazy, or turn into an agoraphobic. I've suspected I've had general anxiety for at least 2 years now, but I don't think it has ever been *this* bad before.

Now that I've graduated I'm supposed to go back to my waiter job tomorrow. I've been dreading it all week. I get terrible anxiety just thinking about it. I feel have no internal confidence anymore. I'm petrified about fishing trips I had planned, about vacations far away, job interviews in the city, and even simple sometimes shit like just picking up my gf or going to the mall. 

I have a psychiatrist/therapist. I've been seeing him for 2-3 weeks now and maybe 4 sessions so far. I feel a little better since the day after my last really really bad panic attack but not by much. I've been on the lowest dose of klonopins for about 2-3 weeks (cutting it in half taking it twice daily). It kind of worked the first week, but now I feel like it completely lost its effect. I also have xanax that I take when I feel a panic attack coming on. With this anxiety I feel like I can't do anything anymore and that really scares me. I feel like a different person and I don't like it. I'm thinking of going on Zoloft or some other SSRI but my Doc seems hesitant. I had a fucked up childhood and he thinks talking can fix it. But I don't know, I just don't want this interfering in my life anymore. I like my waiter job, and I might have a huge job opportunity coming up in a month in a far away city (nervous about going there alone). I don't want anxiety to get in the way anymore.

Okay, so I guess here are my questions. (Try not to be too pessimistic. I feel like this board is just the blind leading the blind sometimes. One person having a panic attack freaking out trying to talk to another person freaking out. lol) So here they are: How can I make it through tomorrow? Is that the best way to beat this thing? Just keep breaking my comfort zone even if it means I'll have some really bad panic attacks? Can someone give me confidence, tell me I'm not alone, they beat it, and how? Are meds the answer or can I beat this without it? How hard will that be? Is this just a normal thing I'll go through for a few months that a lot of graduates go through, or will I have this my whole life? How will talk therapy (and only talk therapy) cure me of this?

Edit: In case anyone was wondering about my lifestyle. Living at home with just my dad. Get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day by going to the gym, going for a run, or by playing basketball. Haven't had alcohol in 2 weeks. Haven't had a cigarette in 4 weeks. Haven't had caffeine in 4 weeks. Don't do drugs. ",['nsubj'],1

Hi!  I'll try to make this as short as I possibly can, but some of the details are really crucial to everything.  I'll try to summarize.  Basically, if anyone might be able to give me any advice on how to solve this issue? I don't know.  

I'm a military kid (well, was, I guess).  Move around a lot.  Was in Los Angeles from around 7-11.  My favorite place I've ever lived.  Then before my 12th birthday we moved all the way to the NOVA/Washington, D.C. area, which is where I still am.  So, first this was a struggle for me at that age because: moved across the country; huge culture shock between LA and DC to be honest.  I'm kind of a cali-veggie-since-birth kinda girl.  Anyway, it was also the first time I moved alone, all my siblings moved out.  Also, I was homeschooled my whole life, and it was the first time we didn't live on base, so I didn't have friends etc.  Anyway, this really stressed me out, and I think I developed hyperthyroidism, which people in my family have.  I got really skinny and was uncontrollably losing weight and got to 50 lbs.  Though, I will admit, there was some anorexic tendencies there (I had C cups by the time i was 9, so I felt really insecure having a body other girls my age didn't commonly have, and girls would point it out).  Anyway, so yeah, girls made me feel bad and fat about it and ended up almost dying at 50 lbs (5 feet tall, still am).  

So yeah, after recently turning 12, military hospital (walter reed, to be specific) said I was anorexic (which at that point, I was trying to eat and it wasn't working, I really wasn't) and they threatened to take custody away from my parents if they didn't agree to send me to a rehab.  So they did.  It was an out-of-state rehab.  And it was seriously horrible.  

**Summarizing experience of rehab, don't have to read if you don't want to** 
Um, yeah, this place really fucked me over.  When I arrived, keep in mind, I was a sheltered/homeschooled 12 year old girl who didn't even really know about eating disorders... I didn't even know you could make yourself throw up.  So yeah, the usual where they check all your bags and don't let you bring in even a hair clip or a shoe lace, etc.  First night, I was the only person put in a room by myself, across from a meth addict that broke out in the halls and was threatening to slit her throat, was puking up blood, etc.  It was a scary first night.  
Anyway, they were really fucked.  You could only pee twice a day: once at 8 am, and once at 8 pm.  You were forced to sit on a couch all day, and could not move aside from walking to get your medication which was like, 5 steps away, walking to the dining hall, or walking to bed/bathroom.  That was it. If you got up, they told you that you were exercising and burning calories and forced you to sit down.  Also, there were no windows and we were forced to stay inside.  I didn't see the light or the outdoors for around 3 months.  They also made you eat all your food at all meals / snacks in 25 minutes.  If you didn't finish it all in that time, you were given a probation tray.  There was no talking, really, as they said EVERYTHING was a ""trigger.""  They would prick you in the middle of the night and take your vitals without telling you.  Also, you had to gain 1/2 a lb every day, and if you didn't when they weighed you in the morning, you weren't allowed to shower, have your 15 minute phone call, or have your family see you (which by the way, when my parents would come to see me, they would tell them that I said I ""didn't want to see them."" this happened a lot because I have a hard time gaining weight).  There was literally so much crap that went on, it'd take forever to write it all out.  Long story short, my dad had to physically fight a dude to get me out of there because I was passed my time and they were trying to keep me there.  Also, before you're allowed to leave, you have a ""test"" you have to pass, where you have to go to a restaurant with your family and order yourself an appetizer, a meal, and a dessert, and eat every bite.  If you do not, you don't ""pass.""  Fucking hell.  

**end of summary at rehab** 

Anyway, naturally when I came out it was a hell hole.  Also, I was super emotionally damaged and some crap happened and its hard to eat when everyone is force-feeding you.  I was 86 lbs at this point, and my dad said at one point, when I was having a hard time eating, ""you obviously don't care if you live or not, so why should I?  Well, I don't.""  Which I know he didn't mean, at least I don't think he did, but when you're 12 that hurts a bit.  People at church, the only friends I had since I was homeschooled, well, guys would come up behind me and whisper in my ear saying ""you lost your ass"" and stuff (again, I had an extremely curvacious body for a young girl).  Had a friend who lived in cali on base with me move to DC also, visited him, he told me how he had this huge crush on me and I had beautiful curves and now I'm a stick. Yeah. it was shitty. 

Anyway, you're required to see a therapist.  She would try to force-feed me cookies and would tell me I wasn't ""better"" because I wouldn't eat her cookies (I've been a vegetarian since birth and was raised to eat healthfully, although because of these experiences, I now have a really unhealthy relationship with food and eat junk food a lot).  I wanted to go to high school so I could meet friends.  I was about to turn 13 and I worked 2 school years in one so I could go to high school.  She told me I could if I gained 26 lbs in a month and a half... Don't think she's allowed to do that but my mom didn't object so who knows.  So I gorged myself to gain weight... Like I said, hard for me to gain weight, so by gorge, I mean I would eat 2 packs of chips ahoy and 2 normal tubs of ice cream and 2 giant home made burritos while watching garfield.... Like, I can eat.  

So, gained enough weight to go.  Well, almost, I was 92 lbs but they let me anyway... So went to school, orientation, was fitted for gym shorts but was so tiny they had to special order childrens shorts.  Embarrassing.  Also, guy in front of me introduced himself and we were talking about where we were from, etc.  Apparently he was ""popular girl's"" boyfriend and instantly I was a slutty boyfriend stealer before school even started.  That was my entire high school career.  

Anyway, out of high school.  Going to community college. Didn't take ACT or SAT because I assumed I was too stupid to.  My lowest GPA is a 3.0, and that's with me not trying/skipping classes. I know that isn't horrible, but still, I have anxiety.  

Anyway, my passion is acting, but I don't WANT to do it.  I want something practical.  I've spent 3 years trying shit out, and nothing sticks.  So now I'm a fucking failure with school on top of disappointing my parents with fucking up when I was 12 (my dad will comment on how awesome I ""used"" to be when I was a kid). I was awesome.  Now I fucking suck.  I don't want to do anything but act, but again, trying to find something practical.  Nothing works, I'm good at everything I try (I don't mean that in an egotistical way) but I hate it all. So I remain a stagnant failure.  Also everything I went through when I was 12, and the confirmation from everyone that I ""used"" to be pretty or attractive or smart or an over achiever... it's all killing me.  

Now my anxiety based off of all this is because I started this semester doing really well-- my lowest grade has been a 95%  BUT I got sick with a sinus infection in November (recently turned 21, don't live with my dad, he got mail from tricare saying they dropped me and I have to prove I'm enrolled full time to get health insurance back, he didn't tell me the letter was there so I didn't know).  Didn't have health insurance, and they didn't want to pay (understandably) for me to go to a walk-in without insurance.  Well, finally got it sorted out, but still won't have primary care until March 1st, but they were nice enough to take me to a walk-in.  I'm feeling better now, but missed 3 essays, 1 presentation, and 1 smaller homework assignment.  My professor won't let me turn in the 1 presentation or the 1 smaller homework assignment, and I have too much anxiety to finish the 3 papers because I'm so anxious about being a big fat fucking failure. I don't know how to fucking fix anything. ",['nsubj'],1

I hit a point of despair this summer, and right after Robin Williams' death I finally got more scared of the possibility that I'd hurt myself than the idea of going and getting help. I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depression and the doctor started me on 20 mg of Citalopram at the beginning of September. It gave me a severe panic attack at 4 AM the first day. It also made me retch. I spent the whole morning so terrified that my mother had to stay home from work because I couldn't be left alone for more than a couple of minutes or I'd panic again. I went back to the doctor and she reduced the dosage. Over the next 10 days, I continued taking it at 10mg, hoping I'd level out. In the process, I lost 12 pounds and gained a brand new phobia (the fear of vomiting, due to the retching). The anxiety got more and more intense by the day, and I had more attacks. After surviving on applesauce for 5 days, I told the doctor I couldn't hold out anymore, and we agreed no more meds for now.    

I've been in therapy and I'm making some progress. I'm very motivated to get better and I've been trying to act aggressively against my anxiety, rather than avoid things that make me nervous. But it's getting hard to deal with the continuing panic attacks. To clarify, I never had attacks this randomly or this frequently before the meds; the ones I had were uncomfortable, but milder, and they had a *purpose*, like not wanting to go to a job interview or not wanting to do a math test. Now I just seem to panic because... panic.     

I was only on the meds for 10 days, but they've haunted me ever since. It's making me very frustrated and angry. I feel like with therapy I can overcome my older, more long-standing issues, but now I have this brand new thing where I wake up at 4 in the morning and panic for no fucking reason, or for the littlest possible reason. This morning there was one loud thunderclap at about 7 AM, and it woke me up. I thought I was fine, and then I just started panicking, even though I was only mildly startled. A few nights ago, I closed my laptop to go to bed, thought, ""what a good week it's been,"" and... slipped into panic. For no fucking reason. For a while it was triggered by stomach aches (because the citalopram made me so nauseous), now it just happens totally out of the blue.     

I'm terrified I'm stuck with this forever now. I'm scared that I've opened some door that will never close. It's like-- I know how deep the rabbit hole goes now and I can't unsee what was at the bottom. I spent all of today trying really hard to get stuff done but mostly just crying. I don't WANT to try meds again, it's too scary and I don't want to be dependent on them. My luck is pretty universally terrible and I'm scared the next pill will make me suicidal. I am trying so hard. Everyone says I'm doing so well. But I just can't shake this, and it's starting to wear on me. I tried to help myself and I feel like I'm worse off than I was. I don't know if I can carry this weight. I don't want to blame anyone, but in a way, I feel wronged, like someone should have led me toward therapy first and meds should have waited. I'm just so tired of this.     ",['nsubj'],1

Before that, I had 4 sessions with a psychologist. I found that a lot of the advice he gave me, didn't actually have any tangible applications.

The biggest issue's I face in my life is over thinking, worry, fear of being alone, self loathing, and inability to stand up for myself. All of these things have been the cause of every relationship breakdown and the reason I only have 2 real friends as a 25 year old male. 

I just broke up with a girl who 2 months ago I was ready to marry. She was pregnant, I had bought a ring, and things turned to shit basically in the space of weeks. Mainly because of my anxiety. Now that it's over, I'm thinking to myself: Will I ever find someone who will put up with my anxiety? Will I ever overcome these issue's that cause me to repel anyone who get's close to me?

The medication has helped a little. Though I understand 25mg is a small dose. Everyone says that I should get therapy but as noted above, my experience wasn't that great. I left feeling confused and very out of pocket. However, I'm at the stage of my life where my biggest worry, is ending up alone or missing the best time to get shacked down with someone. So I'm willing to try anything to get better. Even if that means seeing someone. 

When I went last, he tried telling me when I would have these intrusive thoughts to just put them aside and carry on with what I was doing. That was the main lesson. But how can one tangibly do that? I can't physically grab my thoughts and put them next to me can I? But because I'm so scared to speak my mind and be confrontational, I wasn't able to ask these questions our of fear. Can someone please explain to me how therapy can be helpful when they can't give you any tangible tools to get over what I feel?

Currently dealing with anxiety that popped up after a UTI that seemed to refuse to go away. I was prescribed Macrobid. A few days into taking the pills I was intimate with my bf and noticed that I wasn't feeling the act as intensely as I usually do. That fact triggered the biggest health anxiety attack I have ever had. I visited the ER and they informed me that it's highly unlikely the medication had anything to do with that feeling. But I can't seem to shake the hypochondria completely and it has been driving me up the wall for two weeks now. I've dealt with hypochondria before but never, ever to this degree. I panicked that it was permanent.

Now I'm triggered by so many odd things; it's as though the floodgates were flung open- songs with melancholy memories make me panic, remembering the struggles and sadnesses of people close to me and how I cannot help them, feeling stuck with a low-paying job in my tiny hometown in a one-room apartment, the feeling that every single day is the same old fruitless meander. The fact that I ended a very intense six-year relationship last year also weighs heavily on my spirit. I feel guilty for enjoying a beer or two in the evenings and often worry that I'm becoming dependent on it, although the idea to those close to me is absurd, apparently. I'm in a live-in relationship with my current bf of almost a year and I know it's taken a toll on him. I tend to get snappy and probably seem unreachable in terms of conversation when I am in the throes of yet another horrible panic attack. And since the hypochondria hit sex has been a fear-ridden test of, ""Can I even feel this...?""

Apologies for being all over the place; I'm typing this as the ideas flow.

Eating has been difficult, enjoying a good latte like I used to has been difficult, conversing with my family has made me feel like running out of the room with nowhere to go, and the anxiety upon waking is killer.

I'm just emotionally exhausted and ready to move on but the fear of being mired in the swamp of anxiety and panic really bums me out. I just wanted to get my feelings out there and see what others have to say. Reading others' accounts here has helped me a lot already.

I may add more here if I think of anything else. Thank you for reading.

Then last night I had an epiphany: *what if it's actually a sudden reaction to one of my medications?*

I called up the prescribing doctor's office, and the on call doctor called me back. I told him that I had trouble breathing, and my inhaler wasn't working, and even though my anxiety doesn't manifest itself this way, I tried taking Ativan and that wasn't helping. I was taking Allegra so it couldn't be allergies. He said that meloxicam (the medication I thought was causing the trouble) can aggravate asthma (I have excercise and heat/cold induced asthma). He said to stop taking it and that since I also have chest pain I need to go to the emergency room. 

*Shit.*

I tell my boss (who was pissed off that  ihad to leave early, claiming that I was breathing fine....  NO I WASN'T), clock out and drive myself over. I'm starting to freak out a little bit. I would have used deep breathing to calm me down but that was the reason I was going to the ER in the first place *I had trouble breathing, especially with deep breaths*. 

My boyfriend was at work so I had to go by myself. *Oh dear God, help me.*

I was so anxious and jittery and hyper in triage that the nurse asked me ""is anything else going on?"" which I think is code for ""Are you on any  recreational drugs right now?"" I explain that I have ADD and anxiety and a needle phobia and get panic attacks and I was presently freaking out.

I get settled in my room, talk with the ER doctor, and he says, ""I want to run some blood work to rule out a blood clot and heart damage.""

*FUCK.*

I start crying and telling him how I get panic attacks, how I need ativan. I've had to have emergency bloodwork done before, so I know I'm capable... but I was really sick when that happened. They don't do pills in the ER for stuff like this because intramuscular injection works quicker. He says he'll give me 1mg of Ativan. I laughed and said that 2mg by mouth isn't enough, that I need more than 1mg IM. He says, ok, I'll order 2mg. 

 I waited 45 minutes (wtf?) before a tech came in to draw my blood. ""woah wait I thought  I was getting Ativan, I have a needle phobia!"" 

When he came back I made sure it was the right dosage, and ugh it hurt and I started getting a panic attack and I cried but  I let him do it.  I felt the vasovagal response build up but then the ativan kicked in and it died down and I felt calmer.

An hour and a half later this super nice woman came to draw my blood. She was great, and really helped me through it. She talked to me, had me talk to her about snorkeling in the Caribbean and was the most patient kind and awesome person I could have had to draw my blood. But then...... I started getting a panic attack in the middle of getting my blood drawn. Damn, damn, damn. It was so uncomfortable. I wanted to stop, but I knew they needed it, and it was mild enough that I was able to let her continue. She kept telling me all of those things my therapist would have been telling me. I started repeating those things to myself. ""I'm fine. I'm going to be ok. this pain is temporary. this needs to be done to see what's wrong. I've done this before. this is the result of a wonky chemical reaction. *I AM GOING TO BE OK.*""

All of my blood work came back normal. No heart damage. No blood clot. But I need to follow up with a cardiologist. This is the second time I've had a drug interaction with chest pain.

It's 24 hours later and I'm still having a little bit of trouble breathing, but I didn't take the meloxicam today and my breathing has definitely improved. I was taking my meds right before work so by the time I got there, they were starting to work and hence I thought I was reacting to something in the air. I happened to have an appointment with a pulmonologist today to get a consultation for a sleep study, and I got some advair. 

TL;DR: Had to face my needle phobia by myself, and didn't have enough ativan in my system to prevent a panic attack, but I let the nurse do her job anyway.

I posted a week or so ago about being forced (due to financial hardship) to discontinue my Lexapro treatment.  I've been without for about 5 days now, having only taken a pill on Monday and experiencing a rollercoaster ride of anxiety and depression for most of the day.  The past few have been up and down as well.

One symptom that I've noticed coming back - and by far the most troubling for me - is a dissociation that I experience.  I haven't dealt with it in a long time, as meds have definitely gotten rid of it, but here it is creeping back again - quite badly today.  

It isn't that I can't function - I can work quite fine.  However I have a hard time bringing thoughts to the surface, and the entire world feels like it's a little less real than it used to be.  I'm not quite ""with it,"" and attempts to engage people or activities feel miles away.  Couple that with a healthy dose of dizziness and a wee bit of nausea and everything kinda sucks.

I'm in such a rut that I don't know how to deal with it, I don't know how to tackle it, and I need to. I can't live my life like this. 

I should start off with saying I get help professionally, I've been prescribed medication which I take, and I've also been diagnosed with ADHD (which I also have medication for) and bi-polar disorder. 

I've gotten so much support, I get so much help and have access to literally every resource I'd need. My medication seemed to really help with anxiety, in just taking the edge off of everything and making life more manageable. That was until about two weeks ago when it started to come back with a vengeance. I've sort of reached the point now where all of the bad luck, and all that has evened out and literally the only thing keeping me from doing everything I want and need to is myself and I don't know how to overcome that obstacle. 

I have literally all the free time in the world, literally all of it. With it, I want to get into good shape (I'm not overweight and I look ""good"" but I'm almost dangerously unfit), I want to volunteer, I want to enrole in some short courses, I want to use my time effectively. But everyday I sleep hours past every alarm I ever set, I tell myself ""I can just do it tomorrow"", and I just do literally nothing. Then I can't sleep because I've done nothing with my day, and I'm angry that I've wasted my time. Then I fall asleep and the cycle repeats. 
When I manage to overcome it, I can never manage more than a couple days of the good routine and then it's back to square one. I get so angry at myself for not being good enough to do what everyone else does, I get so frustrated that no matter how much I want to do literally all these things I can never force myself to do them. I've got all of these mental gymnastics basically telling me, 
""Well you didn't need try, you're good enough.""
Or,
""Well it only happened like that because you didn't try, when you do it'll be different.""
But then it never happens. I literally just sit and wait for each day to end achieving nothing with this mass amount of time I've been given. 

How do I overcome this? How can I force myself to do what I know I'm capable of? How can not waste my life? ",['nsubj'],1

It's like doctors are completely out of touch with me. For the average person with a common textbook medical condition it's all good, they take their medication as prescribed and they go on their way. It's as if they never see anything truly weird and that they choose to ignore anything outside the norm.

About 6 years ago I had an episode where my ability to breath was greatly reduced and the standard allergy meds weren't doing it for me. My throat was slowly closing off. I couldn't even swallow my on saliva. Terrified I get in the car with my parents and off we go to the ER. Upon arriving I'm told since I'm not blue that everything is fine. I wait 4 hours and then I'm told I'm fine and I'm told ""Go home and get some sleep, there is no obstruction"". 

I went home and was unable to sleep. I visit another ER doctor later that night and I'm diagnosed with strep throat, given an antibiotic which I take for the hell of it. I take some more Benadryl around 5 pills. This does very little but I'm able to breathe a little better, still sleep isn't an option at this point. Next day I have the same problem except a lot worse with horrible hives. My family calls an ambulance and I'm given Epinephrine immediately. I was diagnosed with anaphylaxis and was given a script for an EpiPen and told to take Zyrtec every couple of hours. 

It took me three tries to get the help I need and I really do think I almost died. I have never been the same since, life has seemed to have lost its magic if that makes since and I have since given up on religion as I don't believe that a God could allow something this terrifying to happen. This event destroyed me as a person.

I've been having issues with what was diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome for the past year or so it was only diagnosed a couple of days ago, I also can barely urinate. They only thing I have found that works is Cannabis, at first I enjoyed the drug to get ""high"" but have since used it to relieve my symptoms, it removes the hell that I experience, cramps that make me wish I was never born, numbness and extreme discomfort and bloating that I can't describe with words. 

I'm 20 and have only had a single job because of my condition. I am currently trying to find another but it's difficult in this economy and since I live in Texas no one understands that not everyone using Cannabis is trying to abuse it. I'm currently living with my parents and my step-farther would kick me out if he found out I use Cannabis. I can no longer afford to continue using Cannabis as I'm unemployed and all of my horrible symptoms have resurfaced and doctors are clueless, they won't even prescribe pain pills, they say that Acetaminophen is the most effective drug for what I'm experiencing along with laxatives. I can't even eat without regretting it later. 

Anyone else lost faith in the medical system or in a similar situation? I scheduled a appointment with a Psychiatrist but am thinking about canceling it tomorrow as I'm afraid that he won't take me seriously or that he will diagnose me as a psychopath.","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1

I didn't realize I had anxiety until I moved schools this year. I mean, I was aware of it, but I just didn't know how difficult it was. 

School is torture for me. With a combination of ADD, dyslexia, and general disinterest, it makes it hard enough. But I was able to deal with it in my previous school, where it was small and i knew everyone and it was familiar. my new school, however, is not massive, but reasonably sized. 

the first few weeks the interactions were painful. I'd get nervous and anxious whenever i talked to anybody, including teachers. An example of this is when i wanted to ask a girl in my class a question about directions to the train station. for like 30 minutes i built up the courage to ask a simple question, which i knew i shouldn't be so bloody anxious about. eventually i did, but i didn't realise why is took so long and was so painful, when it was just a question. 

it got progressively worse over a period of weeks. sometimes i'd skip classes because i was too anxious and didn't want to deal with it. i'd obsess over sitting next to someone who i wasn't familiar with. i was quiet, withdrawn, so its made it hard for me to make friends this year. and previously I've never had that much trouble making friends, i was pretty well-liked at my previous school. 

during free periods i sit in the library because i can't be bothered with dealing with people, since it brings so much annoying anxiety. so I'm a little bit of a loner at school because of that, and cos I'm a natural introvert anyway. 

I've noticed that when I'm anxious, i scratch my hair, even if isn't supposed to be itchy, or my arms. my heart speeds up. i sometimes feel hot. going to class is a massive deal for me, especially if I'm in one with everybody, and everybody is separated into groups and I'm not in one, so i sorta just sit by myself and pretend it doesn't bother me. classes where I'm next to someone i know isn't such a big deal. 

eventually, i got put on meds, and I'm thinking of increasing my dose once i see my therapist. the meds have helped a little, but not all that much. I'm not as freaked out, i guess, and going to school is a little easier, but i know meds take time and stuff. 

I've also noticed about events in the past that highlighted my social anxiety. when i joined the soccer club, id rush off to the toilets during practice when we were picking partners cos i knew id have to be paired with someone i hardly knew. or if I'm introduced to new people, i don't talk much and try to escape so i don't have too. 

in summary, with all this, I'm just wondering if my anxiety is severe, or mild, or somewhere in between and hear what you guys, with experience with these kind of things, think. ",['nsubj'],1

I still had panic attacks, so later my doc gave me benzos to take as needed.

So, all my life I've suffered from anxiety. I remember experiencing episodes and panic attack-like symptoms at a very young age (6-10yrs) but never knew quite what is was. 

It got worse as I grew, and at age 15 I was diagnosed with General Anxiety, and Panic Disorder. At that time, my mom was obviously still in control of my medical affairs, so she recommended that I opt out of any medication and seek natural remedies and/or therapy. I took her advice, and it helped for quite some time.

Flash forward to age 17.  The at-home therapies (breathing exercise, meditation, yoga, etc) were starting to help less and less. My panic attacks transformed from sudden spikes of anxiety to lingering terror that would last all day. The only time I could find relief was when sleeping, which I could only accomplish with the use of sleep aids. There were days where I physically could NOT leave the house. I felt as though my heart was beating out of my chest. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't eat. It was horrible. 

Age 18 now. This past year I started college and made that terrifying transition into adulthood. It was still a struggle to get out of the house every day, but I managed. Pushing through my anxieties at least made me feel like a person again. Made me feel real... 

And here's where my weirdness comes in. Earlier this year, I started having some different... ""Episodes"". I would feel a strange sensation like I was watching my life as a third party. I was entirely conscious and aware of my behavior/movements, but I felt as though I was living in a dream. I would run circles in my head. I would convince myself that my entire life was all just some fever dream that Id never wake up from. That I was vibrating in some different form of consciousness than everyone around me. 

It was quite unsettling, to say the least. 

Back to the doctor I go. I was then diagnosed with ""depersonalization disorder"". (DPD) had never heard of anything like this before. My doctor told me that while there's no treatment for DPD alone, anxiety medications could help with the symptoms.

Again, I was hesitant to take any medication, as psychiatric drugs have always been a fear of mine. 

My doctor was understanding and fabulous. She prescribed me with a medication that I was only to take on an as-needed basis... On the ""bad days"" 

So, we're just about caught up to now, the medication has helped the episodes some, and I feel as though the meds in combination with self-help techniques are really helping me work through some issues. But, as you ALL know, mental illness doesn't just ""go away"".. It is only managed.


ANYWAY, my question to all of you is... Is anyone out there familiar with DPD? Do any of you have it/think you have it? 
How do YOUR episodes feel? What triggers them? 


I feel like the only person in the world who has this, but I'm sure that can't be possible. I really would love some insight from you lovely souls. 



Thanks in advance.

My counselor and doctor (for medication) had both mentioned looking into it, and today it was made official. This explains why no medication ever made the anxiety completely better. I always felt like there was something missing, and now I know what. I'm so supposed to be making a list of my OCD symptoms to go over with my counselor, and we've already talked about my some of my obsessions and compulsions. She said to read up on it, so I have. A couple of compulsions really stuck out to me: Confessing and reassurance. For me, it goes like this. I pour out my every thought to a loved one, searching for forgiveness for something bad that I'm sure I must have done, because if I don't they will hate me for the rest of my life, or someone will end up horribly hurt. I do this all the time, and it's awful. If I don't confess or look for reassurance, it feels like my entire body is screaming at me to do it. I have texted a person nonstop for weeks straight because of this compulsion, and it destroyed a part of our relationship (I'd rather not say anything more). I hate that I didn't know what it was until now. I thought I was just crazy and unstable, and I'm pretty sure that they thought so too. Now that there's a rhyme and reason to it, I feel incredibly guilty, embarrassed, and full of regret. I lost something I can't get back, so while I may feel better on one side of things, knowing I have the right diagnosis, I feel awful on the other side. I don't know what to do right now. I want to go back and talk to this person, and try to explain why things happened the way they did, but will doing so only perpetuate the need to confess? Or worse, damage the relationship further? We are friends right now, and I can't screw it up. And that's not the only part of my life that feels strange. I look back, and I see things that I wrote off as me being weird, or part of my other anxiety disorders, are actually compulsions and obsessions. I've talked with my therapist about these things, and she agrees with this conclusion. I feel cheated. There were so many things in my life that I could have made better or saved (saving referring to relationships) if I had known what I was feeling. I look at my life, and suddenly I see that all my little rituals, obsessions, and compulsions, have been a huge factor in my anxiety and severe panic attacks. I need to know, should I try to explain my OCD to the person I had a falling out with? I don't expect it to change anything, but I want them to know that I wasn't confessing constantly (harassing over text 24/7.....) to be hurtful or controlling. Even though that certainly doesn't excuse my actions, is it worth it to talk about? And how do I deal with my new diagnosis? I sort of feel like my life's been a lie in several ways. Or at least, not what I thought it was. Lastly, if you have OCD, how do you deal with compulsions? How do you make it a part of your life, without it controlling your life? This is a part of my identity now. This is my brain. And I'd like to know more about it.",['nsubj'],1

Let me start by saying that I'm 22, and I have suffered from anxiety, depression, and hypochondria since late childhood. I've tried taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication, but the anti-depressants never seemed to work, and the anti-anxiety meds (xanax and klonopin) led me to abuse the medicine, so I stopped taking prescription medicine altogether--the only time I take medicine now is if it's an antibiotic or something. 

But, I do smoke marijuana, and I have most of my ""panic attacks"" when I am high, although I have had a few when I was sober. 

**It begins when I start to worry about having an attack.** Usually I'll be standing in a place with lots of people and no nearby chairs, where having an attack would be really embarrassing. I'll start thinking about the last time I had an attack, and then I slowly start to feel light-headed and hot. I begin to sweat, my ears start ringing, my vision goes black, my knees start to buckle, and at it's worse state, I cannot see or hear anything. These symptoms will persist until I sit down. Also, this seems to happen much more often during the summer months, when it's hot outside.

**I just don't know what's going on here.** I know my best bet would be to see a doctor and explain to them what's happening, but, as immature as it sounds, I don't want to have to tell them I smoke marijuana and then get lectured about how I need to stop (although they're probably right). Also, since it really only happens when I worry about it happening, I just feel pretty certain that it's my anxiety. However, I know whatever this is needs to be addressed. The last time it happened I was in a restaurant, and it was extremely embarrassing. Once I sat down (after being guided to a chair by my older sister) and my vision came back, everyone was just staring at me. I never want that to happen again.

Googled anxiety, came out with webmd.com. As I read the article I was thinking about all the stories of people making things seem worse because of the sight. But then I read this; 

Panic disorder: People with this condition have feelings of terror that strike suddenly and repeatedly with no warning. Other symptoms of a panic attack include sweating, chest pain, palpitations (unusually strong or irregular heartbeats), and a feeling of choking, which may make the person feel like he or she is having a heart attack or ""going crazy.""


And that is almost word for word what I said to my friend as she told me to describe what was happening during my attack.

I'm currently at work right now and it has taken me quite a while to type this up because I keep having to distract myself and take deep breaths to hold myself together.

I have not started any medication nor have I gotten any professional help with anything yet. And I understand that what is said here is not necessarily professional medical advice. My friend tells me to get help but I don't trust myself. I feel like I would stop trying to get better once the meds make me feel better. This is because I am relatively lazy, although I don't know if that laziness is because of anxiety or my being lazy.

So what I'm really asking for is a site or discussion board where I can learn more about anxiety. Any help is appreciated.

I've tried so many non-medicine routes and nothing has helped. I just read up on anti-anxiety meds and how they work. I found so many scary side affects and warnings listed which made my anxiety shoot through the roof. How ironic. What has been your experience with meds? Are the side effects worth it? Are they really addicting? Will it slow down my ability to function normally? Should I be nervous about it?  I'm definitely going to bring these concerns to my doctor. I just want to get a feel of what I'm getting myself into. 

Side note: I also occasionally get depression. This usually occurs when I get so anxious that I force myself to stop feeling anything and I just float in this weird 'I'm kind of sad, but just blah and not feeling anything' state.

I have *a lot* (read: crippling) anxiety about him, about something bad happening to him. It was really bad before he came to visit, but I feel like I may have lost my ability to deal with my anxiety now, since he's been here so long, giving me a nice vacation from my anxiety. 

I feel like I have so much to worry about. What if his train derails on the way home? What if I can't afford to visit him when he has surgery and something goes wrong? What if he gets in a car accident and dies? What if this and that? Not being able to ""control"" every situation is driving me crazy with anxiety.

I can't afford a therapist (not even with a sliding scale payment) and medication doesn't help me, so I'm pretty much on my own.

Well, I'm happy to say things got better shortly after that post. She started noticing differences, I definitely started noticing different behavior from her too. It was awesome.

Fast forward a couple of weeks and she still isn't sleeping well, so she went to her doctor and was prescribed low dose Trazadone (like, cut the pill in 1/3rds low dose). She began sleeping better, so yay there too!

Fast forward to now and it has been a bit over 2 months since she started the Paxil and almost a month for the trazadone and I'm starting to worry. She has been really depressed over the last couple of weeks, to the point of tears about trying to get out of bed in the morning, or not wanting to move from the couch to make lunch (a frozen pizza). I do what I can for her but my job is full time and hers is not so she is at home a lot by herself over the week. Whereas before she suffered mostly from excess anxiety now it feels like she is descending into more depressive behavior.

Is this an indication that maybe her medication is too low dose? Should I encourage her to go back to the doctor? Or is this her body just working through things and I should let it work itself out?

I said for better or worse when we married, and I meant (and still do mean) it, but dammit it sucks when its ""worse"" and it feels like I can't do anything about it :(.",['nsubj'],1

Actually, its been ramping up for months, but it got really bad over the past week.  I started taking Citalopram again, which helped a few years back.

Long story short, I got into an uncomfortable situation, which set off what was basically a two-day panic attack.  I wound up in the ER twice because I literally had no way to shake my anxiety.  I was sick, couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, and an emotional and physical wreck.

Thankfully, my fiance helped me through this all.  Unfortunately, its been really hard on her, and understandably so.  I have family history problems in the anxiety realm, so my mom flew out to offer some support.

The ER doc gave me meds - Ativan and Buspirone.  This has helped me get to sleep and take the edge of when I take the Ativan, but I'm afraid to take it because it's addicting.

I saw a psychologist, and will continue that, but it is really hard to find a psychiatrist to help get my meds sorted out - they all have waiting lists for literally months out.  Today I am going to my family doctor.

I haven't been to work this week because I'm on an emotional roller coaster.  There is no sure way for me to function right now, and I have a long commute to work, which makes it tough.  I am anxious about the repercussions, but have a great boss.  I still don't feel like I can tell him about the true reason why I'm missing work. 

I keep dipping into these really low moods, and can't hold myself together.  I have some good periods, but then the anxiety starts, and goes to depression.  It sucks so bad, and it's even worse to see my fiance trying to help me and the hurt look on her face because she feels helpless.

Right now I am terrified to return to work, I am worried that my fiance won't have the support she needs when my mom leaves, and am seriously wondering when the hell this is going to get better - and what will happen if it doesn't.

Any thoughts, suggestions, or support would be great.

First time posting on this subreddit so please forgive me if I've made any mistake in my post (format etc)

I have been flying since I was a kid and often for long flight (usually 10hrs +) but EVERY time I am scared on my entire flight. Yes. For those 10+ hrs I was on a plane scared. I don't like this feeling at all. Especially when there's a turbulence or the plane starts shaking my fear will take over my mind. I tried sleeping it off and distract myself with movies on the plane but when the turbulence came I will be scared. 

Now I will be on a flight soon (about 5hrs) and I am scared. The flight will be in a week but I was already scared since when I booked my flight. I will be going to a relatives wedding (that's the reason I am flying) and I've been cursing him in my mind for the past few days because I need to fly. I am really scared and even sometimes I have difficulty sleeping because of my thoughts of I will be boarding onto a plane soon. (To be honest I never wanted to go to that wedding at all) 

I need help guy and girls. I have been to the doctor and got my clonazepam prescription but I am still worried what if it doesn't work ? What if I try one before hand to see how it works? But if I do that wouldn't it be possible that my body may develop some resistance to it and make the medicine not work ? All these thoughts came racing through my mind and I've been trying to to find some ways to not get onto the flight. I have been even hoping that there's something wrong with my body that's not serious but important enough so the doctor will recommend me not to get onto the plane. (I feel like Randy from southpark whenever this came through my mind. Reference:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjvJu60G-ec) 

I really need help... Yet I really REALLY don't want to get onto the plane. I am worried and afraid. ",['nsubj'],1

But, within that month and especially within the past 3 or so weeks, it has gotten much, much, MUCH worse. I have all of the essays and supplements and work done, now I am just freaking out about the thought of leaving home and other similar worries I mentioned in my post from a month ago. 

But it's like now, even the thought of not having the same shampoo I use at home available anywhere I am applying is really stressing me out. The big picture stuff freaks me out and so does the super small little details. College is literally all I think about. I think about it in class, even the classes I love that should help distract me. I think about it at theater rehearsals, I think about it at home, I can't distract myself no matter how much I try doing things that usually relax me like practicing guitar or reading or listening to music.

I just can't relax, I have even had a few panic attacks while driving to school (I pull over and wait it out), but these are like super super bad panic attacks where I find myself screaming at the top of my lungs for no reason. I cry in school. I have panic attacks at home, I can't relax my shoulder and back muscles no matter how many hot baths I take or shoulder rolls/stretches I do. My whole body has been pretty tense the past few weeks but particularly my back and shoulders. I always feel achey because of it which makes my mood even worse. 

It's just like I really really hate the thought of leaving high school and things being out of my control, I have finally gotten super comfortable in high school and come out of my shell and now I have to leave and when I come back home for breaks during college, it's not like I can just pop in and talk with my favorite teacher like I do every day, or talk to my friends in the same way, and my parents are thinking about moving into the city when I go to college and I hate cities so I don't want to come 'home' to a city and a new apartment. 

Everything just feels really out of control and I feel like I desperately need to have control over something so I am making sure to try extra extra hard in school to control my grades, but besides that there is like nothing that I feel good about. It is very frustrating and it feels like my meds aren't helping at all when before they were. I am just very fed up and I hate crying every day because of this huge looming thing that I just cannot control in any way. I don't even like the 7 schools I am applying to that much except for one, so if I get in there maybe that will help but I don't know. I am very frustrated and starting to feel depressed again, too, which is sucky. I just really hate everything about this. And I feel like I can't articulate why I get so upset at the thought of college to my friends or to people that aren't professional counselors, they just think I am being ridiculous and that is even more frustrating. People try to help by saying ""you can always take a gap year"", but it's like no matter what option I decide on things are going to be very different and very uncomfortable so it doesn't matter what I do when high school ends, I will just hate it no matter what.

I feel like I can't do anything about this either, my therapist has tried helping me find ways to cope with this and make the transition easier but I honestly just can't think of any way to make this easier.",['nsubj'],1

Some days my anxiety isn't that bad and don't feel like I need one.  Other days it feels that I do.  Rarely do I take 2mg. 

I feel like this is a bandaid solution as I have been told that Ativan or benzos in general shouldn't be taken for long periods of time? My doctor has informed me that because I take it here and there, that there really isn't much risk for addiction etc... Oh I should also note I have only had it prescribed since about last May.

However I feel that I may be interested in trying to fix this problem with medication suited for it I guess? I should note I have had therapy, I have taken group anxiety disorder classes which taught cognitive behavioural therapy. The CBT I feel helped but I finished that at the end of October and I feel my anxiety may just be returning to normal again due to life stress (baby on the way, work, etc....)

I guess my questions are: what medications are usually prescribed? which ones are the good ones/bad ones? Meaning what are some drugs people have had success with.  And finally how long are these usually prescribed for? I've heard people say until you feel better, but if the meds make me feel better, why stop?

Nobody knows unless I have told them how I feel, and there's only a few people who know. I have a real good job, own a home (rare around here for a single dude @ 27), plenty of girl-and-guy friends, a family who gave me a great upbringing and would do anything for me, and live a pretty normal life save the normal day-to-day bullshit.

That is how I look (and all of that is true). This is how I feel.

I've always been a worry-wart. I thought I just get it from my mom, she was kind of protective when I was growing up. I think that is what gave me the work ethic I have. I would never let myself screw up. Boss needs me a few extra hours? I'm there. I'd beat myself up too bad if messed up.

When I was 17 I started dating girls. I noticed that they gave me angst,  Why? I don't know. When I was not with them I wondered where they were, if they were okay. (this was during the beginning of text messages). Is she off somewhere getting swooped off her feet by another dude? Is she getting drunk at a party and will forget about me and look for another guy? 

But I knew it was absurd and I would never say anything about it. But it's how I felt and it made me really anxious. I just made it a point to join her whenever she went to a party, etc. (remember, this was when i was 17-18-19 and bars weren't in the picture.

(side note: despite all of these feelings, I have never once had a girl say I was jealous. I've actually had girls say I didn't seem to care enough)

Now I'm older and this is still exactly how I feel. This is how I have felt with every girlfriend I have ever had.

I met an awesome girl and we've been dating for about two months. This girl is everything I could have ever wanted. We get along on so many levels! We have the exact same personality, get along sexually (another HUGE issue and anxiety trigger I've dealt with in past relationships), my friends absolutely adore her. It's incredible, it's like she's been friends with them all along.  ""You guys have been together for two months? It seems like you guys have been together for years!"" I get it all the time. And she's beautiful. 

I am totally head-over-heels for this girl. And I'm afraid I'm going to fuck it up because she's got a lot of guy friends and I'm going to get all anxious and jealous and it's going to fester inside of me until I unload all my feelings in an improper way and really blow it. Or just go nuts inside my own head until my brain explodes from thinking all these thoughts. And I care for this girl more than any other one I've had. 
 
Is this a ""hey powertape33 grow some balls and nut up"" kind of thing, a ""you're just a little insecure, go exercise"" kind of thing,  or is this a ""hey, you should see a therapist or consider anxiety medication"" kind of thing? I took prozac for a while a year or so ago but it absolutely destroyed my libido. 

TL/DR;

I'm always anxious in a relationship, get far more jealous than I should.

I sincerely thank you for your help here.

edit:

I don't know the definition of ""anxiety"",  but I can assume that it's an overwhelming feeling. The way it affects me is that it puts my mind in a fog where I can't focus on anything. Anything at all except the ""issue"" at hand. I can't eat, I can't sleep. Until the issue is ""resolved"". Does that sound like it?",['nsubj'],1

A couple weeks ago, I was in a car accident that left me with a mild concussion. The concussion made me light-headed, dizzy, and nauseous. The nausea from my medication plus the nausea from my concussion was too much for me so I stopped taking my medication (I know!!!). 

Actually, the not taking my medication part wasn't that bad. Didn't have any weird withdrawal. 

But I realised, it's not really my call to stop taking the pills when I was doing so well on them, so I should probably, you know, start doing that again. 

Right before I went to bed I took my 20 mg dose of Lexapro, and I am, for lack of a better term, freaking out. Worst side effects I've ever had with it. I should have slowly worked my way up to 20 mg. 

I have dry mouth, I'm extremely nauseous, I have a stomach ache, I have a headache, I feel numb ect. ect. 

The worst part of it is I'm having my **first** ever case of insomnia which is making my anxiety skyrocket. Oh my god! Insomnia is terrible! I'm so sorry to whoever has it habitually. 

And actually *feeling* intense anxiety again after having it suppressed for so long makes it so much worse. I'm afraid to even leave my bed to go to the bathroom, even though I feel like I'm going to throw up.

I have work in 2 hours and I haven't slept. 

Nothing seems to be working to calm me down because it's the medication giving me my anxiety.

It wasn't this bad the first time I took it, but then again, I started off cutting them in half and taking 10 mg. I honestly didn't think to do that again. Shit, I was actually going to take 2 tonight to somehow expedite the process? At least I didn't fuck up that badly. 

Nothing I can really do right now except ride it out and hope it gets better enough in 2 hours that I can get out of bed and go to work. Tomorrow (well, tonight) I'll cut it into quarters and wean myself onto them again. Then start taking Wellbutrin again. Maybe I'll call my psychiatrist after work.

I made it back to the pharmacy and they said it'd be another five minutes.

Five minutes later, another five minutes.

At this point I just let go and sat down and started panicking - dizzy, nauseous, tunnel vision, can't breathe. Finally my meds are ready.. BUT my Plan G hasn't gone through and nothing's covered. I have to figure out what I can afford to buy today because I've got nothing at home. I went for Ativan (thank god 'cause I'm a lot calmer now) and Seroquel.

I've had some problems with Seroquel I suppose. I've been on a low dosage (25mg) and the other night bumped up to 50mg, I'm supposed to be going up to 150mg. On 50mg I hallucinated - shadows in my kitchen, blankets trying to strangle me and moving - it was enough to send me into a tailspin. I felt like my body was trying to kill itself. 

I asked the pharmacist if hallucinations were a common side effect of Seroquel and he said absolutely not and that I should just stick with what I'm comfortable on and talk to my psych about it first chance I get. 

I just feel lost and desperate. I'm back on the couch and I've been here for weeks. I barely have the energy to brush my teeth or hair, I can't even stand in the shower. I have a bath usually once a week. I know I stink and people don't want to be around me. I find it hard to eat.

Sometimes I'm able to get into positive moods and have a few hours burst of energy where I clean my kitchen and do amazing baking, but the crash isn't worth it.

To clarify my whole diagnosis is type two bipolar, in depression, coupled with panic disorder and developed agoraphobia due to it, and possible ADHD. 

I just don't even know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm never going to be a functioning member of society if I can't even go get my own prescriptions. Living every day on the couch isn't worth it. I just don't want to live like this.",['nsubj'],1

Yesterday I missed my first day of classes of my FINAL semester in college because the mere thought of having to introduce myself rendered me speechless, pale in the face, and barely able to walk. I took the train all the way to campus, walked within 200 ft. of my first class, and turned around. I took a large dose of xanax, waited for my next class, and still couldn't bring myself to go. After this I just went home all together. I no longer know what to do, I have never had anxiety at such a high level for such a prolonged amount of time.

My family are very bohemian and for years warned me against western meds, I tried absolutely **every** alternative medicine you can think of, and only got worse and worse as the years went by.

I feel like when you're tryin to remember something on the tip of your tongue, somewhere between the question and the answer, and this leaves me feeling stuck, and static.

Some days I feel like my eyes become over-focused, almost like they're bulging or going to leap out of my head, and my mind starts to race at a mile a minute as if I'd taken a heap of cocaine and speed. I become hyper aware of everything around me. 

But it's not the superpower it sounds like, quite the opposite, it makes me slow to respond to anything, and distant, because there's so much *noise* going on around me when someone speaks to me it takes a while to get to what they've said and process and respond to it.

When you add anxiety and paranoia to this mix things get frantic, and when you add alcohol I become manic and deluded, and a genuine threat to myself and the people around me.

I feel so overwhelmed lately and have come to the realization that if I don't do something to alleviate my anxiety soon, then things will continue to worsen and the path I am leading towards is agoraphobia. [Sorry this is so long, I just need to get it off my chest]

Basically...
I grew up in Tornado Alley where it stormed constantly. Once (around age 10) my mother was driving in a torrential downpour, thunder &amp; lightning etc. I look out the window and see a funnel cloud and immediately turn and projectile vomited all over my sisters friend. From this moment on, the thought of storms has made me physically ill. For a while it was manageable, a slight stomach ache when it would be storming ... but now things have taken a turn for the worse. I'm not sure what escalated it..other than that it's been extra bad weather this summer, I got stuck driving home in a downpour with 90+mph winds, where I watched a freaking woman grab onto a pole so she wouldn't fly away ... all while my car is rocking back and forth. Then I had to work on the 45th floor of a building downtown, with windows all around me (the view that some would kill for, but a view that made me want to die) because the week I worked there it stormed all week. 

I keep trying to figure out what made this worse, but fall short. I have always had serious anxiety issues, mainly mostly affecting my head where I just worry constantly, but within the past year this fear from storms has lead to full on &amp; multiple panic attacks. My chest feels tight, my heart starts racing and my hands and legs start shaking - which isn't an ideal situation ever but especially not while driving. Sigh. I had to start checking the weather to have an idea if I would need an umbrella when I worked a job with quite a long walk into work...so from there it has escalated to downloading multiple radar apps and constantly staring at them..wondering when it is going to storm. I am pretty sure this makes it worse, considering meterologists can be a joke sometimes..so for example - I spent all night Saturday at work stressing out, preparing myself for the storm that was coming, only for it to rain for like 10 minutes. It's gotten to the point where I will try to get my shifts covered at work if theres a chance it will storm - even though I really need the money, the overwhelming pain I feel from panic attacks doesn't seem worth it. I have always been weary of anxiety meds - as I am already succesptable to tiredness, but the meds my doctor has previously given me (Vistaril) have only made me fall asleep - with no actual relieving anxiety.

-sigh- any help would be appreciated, any medications you take that seem to help...(my doctor recently prescribed me effexor xr but my anxiety is so situational that I don't want to be taking something every day that changes my brain chemistry). any advice would be greatly appreciated, i feel like my life is falling apart..all over the stupidest fear.

[TLDR: storms are causing me panic attacks, making me want to avoid leaving even if theres a possibility of one : i need a thundercoat, any advice?!]

I suffer with a bad case of health anxiety and slight-moderate social anxiety.  Despite this, I've never really been depressed.

If you're wondering how the title relates to anxiety in any way I will explain. I had my first panic attack three years ago after we had an emotional talk from a speaker at school. Back then I had no idea what was happening to me, it was such a scary feeling. They say that some people feel like they're dying when they're having a panic attack and honestly sometimes it does. Up until that day I had never considered the fact that I had anxiety, but after then continuing to have panic attacks, sometimes over nothing, I realised that I may have an issue. This then led to countless counsellors who all tried to get me to tell them about an event that triggered my anxiety. Much to their dismay, I couldn't give them an answer. There isn't an event that caused my angst, I have always been a very anxious person, I just never noticed it. I am uncomfortable in social situations, with new people, in crowds and sometimes with men. No one understands why I am more comfortable with women but that's just the way it is. Earlier this year after having a breakdown at school, I was diagnosed with depression. I was put on meds to help with both with the anxiety and the depression. Sadly they made it so much worse, I wouldn't sleep, eat or enjoy the things I used to and I began to become suicidal. Trying to decide on unis and do my exams whilst not even wanting to get out of bed was interesting. I was seeing my last counsellor at this point and although she said the same as the rest, she did help me. We did a lot of work trying to define my anxiety.We decided to give it a name, Albert. It made it seem less like a monster and more like something I could deal with. Now I've come off my meds and I'm trying to see if I can cope without them. So far I have been happier than I've  been in such a long time. I still have bad days but so does everyone. People with anxiety are no different to anyone else, their body just reacts to things much more. I'm sorry if this is self indulged, I've never done this before but some of the posts on here are really helpful.

A little backstory first. 

When I was in about 4th/5th grade I started to fake sick every now and then so I could miss a test I wasn’t quite ready for, get a break from school etc. Eventually, I was skipping a couple of days at a time. Whenever I would do that though, I would get a little nervous about coming back to school, fearing that I was far behind where my classmates where in terms of work. I hated that feeling and it started making me not want to be in school even more, thus creating a horrible cycle where I would miss a day, dread going back to school and miss another day and that feeling of dread about having to go back got worse and I would miss another day. It didn’t get too bad though until 6th grade. I wasn’t used to switching classes and the amount of people compared to elementary school stressed me out. I think I missed somewhere between 30-40 days total that year, even missing up to a week and a half sometimes. Every time I came back after having missed days, I would always get caught back up very quickly and the rest of the school week went pretty smoothly, but then the weekend would come and by Sunday I would be afraid to go back for some reason. Eventually summer came, and it felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I was free to hang out with some friends, sleep in, and not have to worry about going to school.

Then my grandfather had passed away that summer after 6th grade, and I went into a deep depression. I had been very close to him and his death hit me really hard. This was my first experience with someone close to me dying and I didn’t take it well. Once school started up again for 7th grade, I was missing days like crazy. In two months I had already missed close to 20 days. My mom and I thought that I was having problems with the school and if we moved things would get better. During 7th grade we moved from one state to another and I enrolled in a new middle school there. Things were a little bit better there. I still missed more days than most of the other kids but not as much as I did at my old school.

While the rest of 7th grade went well in the sense that I didn’t miss as many days, it was also a lot worse because I didn’t have any real friends. Sure there was a couple of people I talked to in class but I had never hung out with anyone outside of school. After 7th grade got out and a very sad and lonely summer, 8th grade started. I went right back to being afraid and I had already missed a couple days before the first week was even done. After missing a lot in the first couple weeks I had begged my mom to homeschool me for 8th grade. She was against it at first but eventually caved in and let me be homeschooled. While I thought that was a good decision at the time it only made things worse when 9th grade started. After having a perfect first and second day of high school, I had awoken in the night having one of the worst anxiety attacks I had ever had. For some unexplainable reason I was terrified to step foot in school again and refused to go back to school for the rest of the week.

That following Monday, I had gotten all ready to go to school but all morning I was terrified about having to go back in. I was literally shaking. I missed the bus and had to be driven to school by my mom. When were in the parking lot I broke into tears and begged my mom not to make me go back. She eventually took me home and tried to get me an appointment with a psychiatrist for my anxiety. That didn’t help at all and the meds they put me on made me very moody and even more depressed than I already was. I eventually was unenrolled and started homeschooling again. The plan was to go see a therapist and hopefully get me ready to go back to school when I was ready. However the night before I was supposed to go back, I was so stressed and afraid I had attempted suicide. Luckily right before I had gone through with it I stopped and went to sleep. I told my mother about it the next morning and I had expected her to try and do something to help me but she just told me that I should just forget about it and try to go to school. After begging for her to get me help she took me to the hospital and then I was admitted into a Crisis Stabilization Unit for about a week. I ended up being homeschooled for the rest of 9th grade.

I am now 15 and about to start 10th grade this Monday. All summer I had been feeling pretty good about going back, but there was always a little fear in the back of my mind but I pushed away the thoughts. I’d figured if I didn’t think about it I wouldn’t be nervous. However the last week or two I had been very nervous about going back. It’s currently 4:30 in the morning on Friday night/Saturday morning and I can’t sleep because I’m beyond terrified. I feel so unprepared to go back. 7th grade is the last year I finished at an actual school and I’m supposed to go into 10th grade not having been to a real school in two years and not knowing anything about high school? I’m so scared. I desperately want to be able to just show up on the first day and go to school like the average person but I’m so afraid to go back. I feel like I’m a 7th grader going into his sophomore year and I’m way in over my head. I need help but there’s no one I can talk to. I don't know a single person here. My mom gets mad and yells at me for “not having a good attitude about school” whenever I talk about this. What should I do? I don’t want to be homeschooled again, but I don’t want to go back to public school even more. If anyone has any advice on what I should do, I would really appreciate it.

My SO and I are having a hard time financially right now. I lost my job last may and was unable to find a new one due to GAD and depression stemming from my anxiety. It turned out that my medication (paxil 20mg) wasn't working anymore. I got switched over to cipralex? (generic, it says escitalopram 10mg on the bottle) and it seems to be working. I've had more energy physically but still not enough mentally. My glasses broke and because of how near-sighted I am, I can't work until we get them replaced. My mom has been urging me to go on welfare but because of some things she said a few years ago when I tried to do so I find myself getting attacks every time the subject comes up. 
  

  
Today is my 20th birthday and all of these came together into one big mess. We are over $1000 in debt, not counting our maxed credit card, and we don't even have enough money to buy food. I cancelled a weekend away because I feel like I don't have the strength to be happy. I am shaky and nauseous and I feel like I'm going to faint. I'm having thoughts of self-harm because the pain used to help my brain focus. I took a lorazapam 1mg about 10 minutes ago to try to suppress the attack but I need a way to control it without resorting to cutting or meds. 
  

  
Also I need to know if I should mention this to my doctor. I can't tell if the medication isn't working or if it's just all this stress.

Yesterday, I completely bombed my ""midterm"" (yes, in mid-April), and I mean *bombed*. I had been studying since Saturday, but was paranoid that I wasn't reviewing effectively. (I've never been very good at studying; I have a lot of trouble picking out what's most important, etc.) When I got the exam, I realized I was totally right. I couldn't remember how to do even the simplest problems. I  tried to keep it together, but went into total panic mode about halfway through and only ended up answering maybe 30 points worth of problems (out of 100).

The problem is, I've really been struggling this semester. My anxiety has been extremely high all school year, but it's just gotten worse since I accepted a job offer around March. I'm very excited for it, especially because it's in Tokyo, and I've always wanted to try working in Japan. (I studied abroad there last spring and it was honestly the most amazing experience of my life.) You'd think this would make me feel a little calmer, since I don't have to worry about what I'm doing post-grad. Instead, it's put so much more pressure on me, because now if I can't graduate on time, I'm 99% sure I will lose this job (since I need my diploma for the visa). It feels like all of my future happiness in hinging on this.

So, my grades have been pretty poor all this semester. My workload is probably heavier than it's ever been before, and I'm less equipped than usual to deal with it. I've managed to keep myself *around* a passing grade in all my classes despite multiple mental breakdowns, but I couldn't afford this kind of failure. So now I'm totally at a loss. Everything feels pointless; even if I manage to get 100's on everything here on out (which will never happen), I've got less than a C, which is what I need for credit.

I'm not a bad student. I've never failed a class (even if I've had to drop a couple) or even received less than a B-, and my GPA is about a 3.6, with a major GPA of about 3.3. It feels so unfair that I could lose everything just because of this one awful semester, but I don't know what to do. My doctor told me I should talk to my professor, and I managed to summon the courage to e-mail him last night, but he hasn't replied. (This is really making me anxious, because he's normally very good about answering his e-mails during the week, and I've seen that he's answered questions on the student forum today.)

What can I do to salvage things and make sure I graduate this May? *Is* there anything I can do?

**EDIT:** Some background info. I've been on regular medication for anxiety/depression about 8-9 years (alternating between Effexor and Pristiq, with varying doses). After having several breakdowns last semester, I finally accepted that these medications were not working for me (if they ever really were). I'm seeing a new doctor this semester who is helping me transition to Lexapro.","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1

What prompted me to post this is I just returned home from surgery. Right at the end of October, after years of having anxiety but denying it or thinking I didn't need help, I finally found a decent doctor and started the conversation. She put me on Zoloft and then Ativan for particularly panicky times. It's been amazing. As I read somewhere else on reddit, it's like someone opened the blinds to my brain.

Many say medication may not work for everyone, and it's true. Sometimes therapy is the way to go. After yesterday, I know I need that now too, and it's still hard to admit.

Even though I've been taking my meds, and took them before surgery, and went in feeling just slightly nervous (a miracle, I thought!) my body reactions such as blood pressure and heartbeat were way elevated and they needed to give me something else in addition to my anesthesia. Its common in patients with anxiety they said, which explains why they grilled me about it before the surgery day.

Even if you already sought help, you might need more. If you're thinking you don't need help, you're here, and admitting it is hard, but know that anxiety is doing things to your body without your conscious necessarily knowing. It is very hard to cope with, and that's okay to admit. I just urge you to seek help before you do a lot of damage to yourself, mentally or physically. You're worth it, you're amazing, and getting the help you need will make you even more amazing.","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1

Also afraid of potential dissociative behavior regarding relationships while on it.  Any advice, in general, or suggestions for medicating mid-semester?  With how long it takes for medication to work, will the medication even help me before the end of the semester, anyway?

Okay, now for the full story for those who want to read it.  I am currently finishing my last semester of college and my anxiety/depression has been skyrocketing for almost a month due to relationship issues, lack of therapy, and being overwhelmed with my schoolwork.  I haven’t gone to my last two therapy appointments because I just don’t feel that I can leave the house (thank goodness my school offers some of their classes online) and I have cancelled on my psychiatrist (just gives me meds) twice, as well.

As for medicine, I currently have a few .5 mg Ativan from a previous doctor that I take in extreme emergencies and I have .5 mg of Klonopin and Celexa from my psychiatrist.  Unfortunately, I have NEVER taken the Celexa because the semester was beginning soon when I first received the prescription; I was afraid that it would disrupt the creative process and leave me unable to write the excessive amount of papers that I need to write in order to finish my degree.  I only take the Klonopin when I expect things to be really bad or when I’m desperate to feel better and can wait for the effect.

I am also afraid to begin Celexa because of the relationship issues that I mentioned in the first paragraph.  I had horrible anti-romantic feelings when I took an SNRI last year, along with extreme suicidal urges.  I had to stop taking it cold turkey because I was actually beginning to become afraid for my life.  I am trying to make things work in my relationship and I don’t need something else to deaden me.

My s/o and I have been having issues, particularly around some lying on their part.  This isn’t the first time, but this has been very difficult for me to deal with.  The lies have NOTHING to do with cheating and are not the worst lies someone could tell, but I’m freaking out all of the time since this happened.  We also recently had some extreme disappointment in our relationship, so that adds a layer of sadness to everything for both of us, not to mention this person has anxiety and depression issues that are probably worse than mine at this point.  I try to just keep my feelings in check or at least my actions because I don’t want to cause more problems or start accusing the other person of stuff.  I am just trying to accept things and deal with them, but it is a constant battle not to make them worse simply because my mind is racing with all of the horrible possibilities.  I have become obsessive, checking up on them, accusatory when I don’t restrain myself, and completely distracted and miserable because of my thoughts about what the truth is, if I know everything now, etc.  Truthfully, this person probably hasn’t done 1/10 of the things that I’ve wondered about in my mind, but after the most recent incident, I can’t stop obsessing over it.

I need to do my work.  I need to concentrate.  I need to focus.  I need to be able to finish this semester and have the constant stress of school off my back for a bit.  I need to write (creative, no less) and I can’t do it.  I am consumed with my anxiety and my apprehension regarding everything.  If I take Klonopin, I calm down for a while, but the anxiety seems to come back quicker than I’d like.  I’m extremely intimidated by taking Celexa, especially mid-semester.  I’ve had problems writing on anti-depressants before and it freaks me out that I could just stop being able to write.  I am also afraid of the side effects.  I’m afraid of becoming distant from my partner and screwing everything up further.

Is taking the Celexa worth the risk to my schooling?  I know no one can answer that for me, but have any of you noticed a sharp decline in cognitive skills while on it?  Or creativity, in general?  Failing would shatter me and I don’t want to make more problems for myself while trying to deal with those I already have.","['nsubj', 'dobj', 'pobj']",1

We went upstairs for a cuddle and some of things he said to me just made me feel so much better. He said that he would not have me any other way, and although I said that I felt like I was ruined and scared, he told me that he loved me no matter what. He just held me while I cried and told him how scared my anxiety made me feel. He said that he would never leave me, and we ended up taking a nap. When I woke up, he was looking at me and said, ""See? I told you I would never leave you."" I am so thankful for the love and comfort he brings to me. When I first developed my anxiety disorder, it was a product of a sexual assault from someone I thought I loved and trusted. I honestly never thought I would be able to trust a man a again, or anyone else, for that matter. But, here I am, putting my mental state, and sometimes, my life into the hands of another man. I have never felt so secure and loved by anyone else. I think I'm going to have to marry this man - he truly is my best friend.

I've been on Pristiq (an SNRI) and propranolol (a beta blocker) for my GAD and mild depression for about 11 days and I stopped taking Brintellix 5 days ago after lowering the dose per my doctor's orders. I was only diagnosed with GAD on January 2nd so this is all new to me.

So far I've been having a lot of highs and lows, whereas before, I was either mostly a bit below neutral or pretty low. 

Yesterday was really rough for me. I started spiraling into an episode, and pretty soon I was sobbing for what seemed like a long time and I felt like I had so much pressure built up inside me. I used to have problems with self harm years ago and stopped, but yesterday I just had that same urge to do it again. I didn't hurt myself, but I felt extremely tempted to, and I kept having thoughts of... not death or suicide, but simply not existing. I had to call in sick to work. It was just a bad day. 

On the other hand, sometimes I almost feel slightly manic, like I have energy but no drive to do anything, and I feel like my depression has worsened. Sometimes I feel like I'm talking too much! My anxiety does seem better sometimes though. 

It was tough, but I admitted to my husband that I had been having the self harm thoughts last night, and he said that I should call my doctor. He says I seem very up and down lately too...

I finally did it, I went to a psychiatrist again, last time I went to one was 10 years ago, I barely remember what was I taking but maybe some Rivotril? Wellbutrin too, I can't remember about the other ones.

This time they gave me 0.8g Xanax and Paxil CR 12.5g per day. I think those are very low doses.

My anxiety has been quiet high to the point where I cannot sleep and if I do I'll just wake up several times trembling at night.
I tried to avoid the meds, I even started having sessions (once per week) with a psychologist but 2 months later, yeah I could cope with some stuff but not everything and well, it got to the point where my therapist said ""You anxiety is out of control"".

What triggered this time was that I discovered I have an umbilical hernia and I also felt some stomach and intestine problems, I went to the hospital and they checked everything, some blood test, CT Scan, X-Rays and I even went through an endoscopy to check my stomach and everything was fine. I also went to the surgeon and he said my hernia is very minor right now so I shouldn't operate right now but should be observed (I have two more appointments). But before this, I already switched hospitals 3 times because I wanted to have something and get the operation right away but so far, no luck, I mean I understand that is not urgent but it still gives me a bit of trouble when I walk much and so on, last surgeon told me that yes, maybe I should also attend my mental issues and that's why I went to the psychiatrist last week.

But on the other hand, I am in another country living alone, I haven't take any vacations for almost 5 years (really) and I haven't returned home, of course my family situation is not the best as my parents are living apart now and well, a lot of shit piling up.

I could sleep OK the last two days probably because of the Xanax, but I really feel my anxiety kicking in again about 2 hours before the next Xanax I have to take.

I know the antidepressant is going to work in 2 works or so, I hope everything works fine.

I don't know what kind of therapy should I start working on, I mean, I have many options but I have to ask, there is a big language barrier for that kind of things in here and right now I am using Skype with a psychologist in my country, sadly because of this, I don't have much options either for a psychiatrist and psychologist.

Any recommendations? Because I really know meds are only part of the solution.

""Have you had experience with anxiety or depression in the past?""
I think the question may have stemmed from answering that I'd been a bit stressed lately. and I got a tiny bit emotional when she brought that up.

Yes, I've been very stressed lately. 18 hours of classes, stress over not doing well enough, feeling like I'm unable to do better. Stress over difficulty in relationships...Stress over not having a JOB and only somewhat being able to afford food month-to-month.. So  I got emotional. I don't like admitting when I have a problem or need help, it makes me feel somewhat inadequate, which made me even more emotion.  Thankfully I was not crying rivers, but I did require two tissues which was still horrendously embarrassing for me. But I digress.

I may have been stressed recently, but for a long time I've struggled with sadness. I've never been diagnosed with depression or anxiety (so I was hesitant to answer), but I've never really wanted to be. I've blamed it on periods, bad days, other people, maybe just not getting enough sleep or not eating enough. But this is the first time in my 22 years that someone has asked me that question. And so I said yes.

I'm very hesitant to tell my family or what friends I have about getting medication (started on Escitalopram). They've had to deal with my sometimes over-emotional-ness at times but admitting I actually have an issue sort of scares me.

I guess I should be happy for finally seeking help...but anyway, I just wanted to tell someone.",['nsubj'],1

I'm pretty sure its working at this point as my anxiety has slowly dwindled away.  I still have anxiety but it's not as crippling as before and I actually feel confident in social situations.  Only side effects I feel are some sleep problems (may be unrelated), weird appetite, and depression.  

The depression part was COMPLETELY unexpected.  I mean paxil's an anti-depressant right?  I had finally gotten something under control in my life and this sprung up.  I thought I felt depression in the past but this was just a completely new level of a lack of motivation and emotion.  To be honest I'll take whatever I can get so if I have to trade off anxiety for depression, so be it. 

Here comes the rant: I thought it was my anxiety that kept me from getting a girlfriend.  Time and time again my friends said they wondered how I didnt have a girlfriend.  This really gave me a false sense of hope and I decided I'd just blame anxiety for my lack of relationships.  When the medication started to work I felt really bubbly and confident. I was actively going out and chatting/flirting with girls.

At least I could have a reason why any girl I have an interest in laughs when I even get close.  But its okay when they flirt back and dont have true feelings.  Im so goddamn tired of girls flirting with me and then getting with another guy! Someone tell me I'm ugly and I'll be fine but when I'm getting all this confidence from the people I trust the most and then it gets crushed when the only girl thats ever asked me out is the shy type. Maybe I'm looking at everything the wrong way but the rejections keep adding up and I don't know how I'm supposed to feel anymore.  

I hope its depression that keeps me from seeing my answers or something. I need something to blame.",['nsubj'],1

Now I think it's time I posted something that's been on my mind.  I have recently been diagnosed with Panic Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety, PTSD, and acute Agoraphobia after an extreme two-week spell of countless PTSD flare-ups demolished my mental health.  It all came out of nowhere, and it stopped my entire life dead in its tracks.  I quit eating, quit leaving my room, almost couldn't drive, couldn't sleep, and things were getting worse (my blood pressure has been especially noted to be ""dangerously high"", despite a recent check-up in June showing excellent heart health), so I saw a well-known regional psychiatrist.  She mentioned that it was the worst case of anxiety that she's ever seen from one of her patients, and said that she believes my innumerable anxiety problems stem from the PTSD that I've suffered from since I was roughly 4 years old.  I have been prescribed Clonazepam (to be taken 2-4 times daily as needed), and Zoloft, with a check-up in two weeks to determine if I'm going to be placed on a heart medication and/or switched to zanax/vallium, depending on how current medication is working by then.

So for the question:  Is there anything I should be aware of or any advice you guys have regarding this?  I've nervous about taking all of these drugs, and really don't want to have to deal with withdrawal if I'm ever allowed to come off of this stuff.  I took the clonazepam for the first time ever this evening, and had some shocking results (I actually went into a real restaurant in public where there were people everywhere to eat dinner with a friend, and I didn't have a single panic attack), but it left me a bit foggy in the mind.  Will these effects wear off as I become more tolerant?  Sorry about the block of text, I just know nothing about this (it's all so new to me), and I don't really know how to go into it.

Background: During my entire childhood and up to now (26/m) I have never been able to wake up in the morning and a good nights rest is something to celebrate. I was unable to focus in school and was once diagnosed with ADD (Whichever the child for is). My parents didn't want me to change so they never got the script and instead I ended up getting yelled at every morning because I could not get out of bed, and when report cards came they were less then thrilled.

I got through HS and started working. It was dreadful. I would get bored and find myself doing something entirely different then what I was supposed to be doing and quickly correct myself. This is the same way with hobbies. I could never stick with a hobby. Hell I have never actually finished a video game to the end no matter how much money I payed for it.

My list of friends was very short, and those that I had were getting irritated with me due to my lack of focus on one game or the other. 

If I wasn't worried about women, bills, my job, my car, what everyone thought of me, was I prepared if a tornado came?, would I be alone forever?, then I must have been asleep. I was in a state of constant worry and it ate at me terribly. Stress has a tiring effect on me on top of giving me Canker Sores. When things got really bad, I would be exhausted even shortly after getting out of bed on a day off. 

I have lost friends, and have missed out on many things in life because it feels safer at home. I find myself at times lashing out at those around me, just to turn around an instant later and hate myself for being such a prick. I constantly have the best of intentions and screw it all up. I have planned for the last 4 days to make my parrots some toys, they are still toyless and I feel like a terrible owner. 

I have worked for a trucking company in the shop for the last 3 years, and I have fought to stay afloat the entire time. I am in charge of making and processing a lot of paperwork and getting my mind to stay on task is so hard. In fact, I was supposed to be doing the paperwork when I got bored and decided to write this. 

There are times while driving home after fighting with my gf or having money problems that I think briefly how nice it would be to turn the car into the woods and get some rest. Just get rid of all this worry and all this stress. The stress of hurting everyone around me regardless of how much I want to do good. I would never act on these thoughts though, as it would hurt my gf and my family and they don't deserve that from me.

Fast forward to 6 months or so ago. I finally got convinced by an online ADHD test that I should go see someone. I called one that was local even though he had low ratings compared to others because some of the reviews said he was a no BS kind of guy, and I thought that if all this that I feel is just BS and I am just to much of a bitch to get over it, I need him to tell me. (My mother always told me I was a hypochondriac and I was always afraid she was right).

I set my appointment and got in a month later. I found out quickly I failed to do my vocabulary, and went to a place that only dealt with medication and not a place where I could sit and talk my problems out. But I figured this guy could do the same. 

I was called in after taking my drug test and was in front of a woman who asked me a list of questions and the whole time I was doing my best to be 100% honest because I didn't want to be that guy who faked it, I was so afraid I would get medication and not actually need it because I really was just a pansy on the inside. 

The Dr came in for a total of about 4 minutes...seriously...and said that with my bouncing leg and posture and due to the answers of my questions I had Anxiety. This was completely opposite from what I had expected (ADHD) but I guess the medication is the same for both.

I was prescribed 150mg bupropion, 2 times a day. I was told it would take about a week to get results but I swear to you, on day one, I never once felt like I was going to fall asleep at the desk and even had the energy to go to the next town and tell my parents about how well it worked.

Day 2, I woke up for work on time (This is a very very rare thing, luckily my work is really really laid back on being late). I worked all day and got more done that day then the entire week prior. I felt great. 

One thing that did not change much was my ability to stay on one hobby. I still jumped around and my friends/family/gf were tired of following my game choices because they changed weekly, which I cannot blame them. It makes me feel like a burden, and I hate it. 

I began getting tired again about 3 months into my medication and was upped to 3 pills a day, and have felt no effects. I did however run out for about a week, and for the first time felt the difference the medication made for my Anxiety, I literally teared up in my car and begged my insurance company to allow me to get some meds due to the attack I was having. 

At this point, stopping the attacks is all the meds are doing, which is enough for me to want to keep taking it, but I miss the energy, I was happy for 3 months and it has faded and I don't know how to get it back. 

I have read some of the posts on here and saw that people have it much worse then me, and it makes me feel like a whiner talking about my situation when so many have it worse. Sometimes I wonder if I was even diagnosed correctly, 4 minutes is not much time. I don't know what to do, how to get the focus and energy back. Is there anyone anywhere that feels like I do? 

Thank you for reading, and I hope all is well on your side of the computer.

Say you lived in an apartment with an ant infestation and no matter how clean you kept it or how many baits you put down, or how many times you complained to the landlord, nothing helped.  Ants everywhere.  So you research online about ants, and ant control, and you just constantly research, sometimes spending all day off and on, just researching.  You can't watch TV or a movie thinking ""Oh, I wonder if they have to deal with ants, too.""  It's a TV show!  Ants don't matter to them.  You can't walk down the street without seeing someone and thinking ""Do they have ants in their house?""  It's always on your mind.  Ants, ants, ants.  Your one year lease is up on your apartment and you want to move because you feel filthy living in an ant filled apartment.  They were everywhere.  In your bathroom, bathtub, kitchen, you could feel them crawling on you in your bed, if you had an itch in bed and you smelled that horrible dead ant smell, you realized the itch was an ant crawling in your hair, they're in your closet too, you see them on the table by the couch, climbing by your laptop, and so on.  It's hard to look for apartments because the main thing that's on your mind in ANTS.  Does this apartment have ants?  How about this one?  Oh, this one looks like it doesn't have any ants.  You find a place to live, waiting for the day that the ants come back.  You still have the thoughts in mind, watching TV or whatever.  Ants, ants, ants.  You don't need to research online about ants, because you aren't dealing with them anymore.  Relief!!  Occasionally, you may have the obsessive thoughts pop up in your mind, especially when you think that you may want to move because your rent is going up a little bit too high.  But it's too much to think about.  You love your apartment because it doesn't have ants!  So you stay.  The obsessive thoughts are gone.

Then ... one day out of the blue ... you read a Facebook article from your news station talking about how it's been so warm, ""Are you noticing ants around earlier than usual?"" it asks.  You read the comments because you're thinking ""Oh god, I had to deal with that a few years ago"".  And people are commenting ""OMG yes!  I hate ants!"" or ""I use these Terro baits but they're not enough"" or ""They're driving me crazy!"".  It should give you comfort to know other people deal with them too.  But it doesn't.  What it does is TRIGGER those obsessive thoughts that you haven't had to deal with for a few years.  One person mentions ""Ortho man keeping me ant free!""  You think, whew, if I lived in a house with ants, I could always have a pest control person spray around.  But that doesn't always work.  Oh god, why are we having these thoughts, our apartment is great!  And your brain starts to obsess about ants again.  And then there comes that feeling of ""dread"", you know the one.  The one where you are in the middle of dealing with something that causes you anxiety.  If ants cause you anxiety, you get that feeling of dread living with ants.  If heights/bridges cause you anxiety, you get that feeling of dread having to be on a bridge.  And also have that feeling of hopelessness.  Like you'll never escape your anxiety.  You try to think about other things, but that doesn't work.  It's always in the back of your mind.  So, all you can is wait.  Wait until the thoughts go away.  My meds don't do squat for anxiety or obsessive thoughts.  It just helps with any depression that I may have.

All I want to do is not have something as STUPID as ants bother me so much to take over my thinking like that.  I know eventually I will need to move into a new apartment or house, and I know eventually there's always a possiblity that I'll have to deal with ants in my house in some way, I know I can't avoid them forever, but I just want to be able to deal with them as a regular, rational human being ... I don't want just seeing a few ants around trigger this spiral of obsessive thinking.  I understand there's a difference between an infestation and a few ants.  And I don't remember EVER having anxiety issues about ants before that one apartment where it felt like an infestation.  I've lived in a couple apartments that have had ants around, but it never was that bad, and it never bothered me like it did in that one apartment.  It's like that one apartment literally drove me crazy.  That's what it feels like.

Can anyone relate?

**THE QUESTIONS**

1) As we know, the holidays are full of anxiety for many of us. But my anxiety is a particular one. As a kid events -- graduations, Christmas, Halloween, last day of school, Fourth of July, etc., genuinely meant a big deal to me. Perhaps that was in part due to my anxiety. 

Events were a huge for me that came but once a year, or whenever. Also, as a consumer of TV shows and movies, I became aware that these events were really really important for the characters on TV. When I was in high school, I lived those days perpetually saying to myself ""YOU BETTER MAKE THE MOST OF THESE""; I was all-too-conscious that I was living in the existence portrayed in TV shows like Daria or Saved By The Bell. 

It was hard for me to have unmediated experiences because I was always aware of myself having those experiences in light of having those experiences, if that makes any sense. My sister got married this summer, and I was even then KEENLY AWARE of how I was supposed to feel as an older brother. 

When I went to prom, the first hour of it was me being a little bit nervous because this, by god, was PROM. I needed to have an experience that matched up with PROM, *WHICH YOU MIGHT REMEMBER FROM SUCH COMING-OF-AGE BOOKS/MOVIES/TV SHOWS AS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.*

Now in my 30s, it's hard to experience this decade of my life without looking through a painfully media-savvy viewpoint. Now it's Christmas, and my problem isn't the stress (although there's room for that, in its own way). My problem is a perfectionistic drive to *have the correct internal experience.*

Now, you might say, very reasonably, ""Just sit back and enjoy them"" or ""You feel how you feel."" See, that's just the problem. I fear that my default state is kind of a ""meh."" Maybe it's a kind of emotional perfectionism. 

At this point, I would rather put myself under the strain of forcing myself into emotions that don't come naturally, then be an emotional slacker, just watching the events of life go by. I want a life filled with passion, meaning, and purpose, but I don't seem to be able to feel that way without forcing myself to feel that way.

It's a bit like feeling happiness for me. I can count on left and right hand the number of times I've felt something approaching happiness this year. To feel happiness, I have to will myself into a thinking process, where I think of some Event That Should Make Me Happy. 

What I then do is one by one subtract all of the self-critical beliefs and unspoken anxieties that I suspect are blocking me from appreciating my achievements. I have achieved quite a bit in my life, but due to my patterns of thinking, I cannot appreciate them. 

I gain no real satisfaction from them, and it's hard to see how I could without lying to myself. Rationally I know this is silly, but it's the way I feel. To get around my anhedonia I have to put a lot of dismantling thought into these processes.

It seems like a double bind. 

On one hand, the problem of trying to feel real genuine emotion (fake it 'till you make it, right? right?) puts me under stress, it makes me feel like a phony, it makes it hard for me to just experience life, and it gives me anxiety about the experience (""Oh. It's Xmas again. Time to rev myself up and get into the mood"") and anxiety about feeling anxiety (""If I haven't figured out the trick this year, I'll feel anxious). 

On the other hand, just surrendering to what comes, I am afraid, will put me a position of lobotomized indifference. Maybe it's been so long that I've forgotten how. 

This feeds into I like for my life to be exciting. Sometimes I wonder if my biggest fear isn't boredom, but it is this state of not-giving-a-shit about anything. That I'll become a selfish little lazy consumer particle, who half-asses verything or doesn't even manage a half-ass for anything. The part of me that justifies anxiety says ""Hey man, anxiety is just excitement filtered through the wrong circuits. You like feeling excited, right? You like feeling wonder at everything, right? Well this is a different form of that."" 

Also, I believe very strongly in compassion, but I also think to be especially compassionate, we have to will ourselves into the other person's shoes. What will happen to my ethics if I stop the effort of going beyond my own selfishness? Won't I become a sociopath? 

**How do I experience things genuinely? Won't giving up mean that I'm not trying?**

2) Happiness as anxiety: during the times when things have gone *really* well and I feel either happy or really positively excited, that happiness or excitement is almost always tinged with anxiety. I remember going to Disneyworld as a kid and although I was happy, I was full of the same anxiety of ""I wonder when I'll stop feeling this good. I don't want to waste or spoil this."" This ""don't waste, don't be spoiled"" feeling has been with me for as long as I can remember. 

When my little sister was born (I was almost 2), I seem to  remember feeling guilty that I had wasted my years as a single only child. Yes, in all seriousness. That happened. So it's pretty rare that I've felt happiness unalloyed by anxiety. My happiness always travels with anxiety. I get a perfect moment and I'm worried about it breaking right away, or how long it will last. 

**What should I do? How do I separate happiness from anxiety about happiness?**

3) That said, it's genuinely hard to feel much of anything through the perpetual white noise of anxiety. I mean, I feel negative emotions like anger, fear, guilt, and so on, but few good ones.

**If I deal with my anxiety in a helpful way, do you think positive emotions will come back?**

4) I've got excellent social skills. But when I entered the adult workplace and a new environment with it, I had to tone down my own nature and force myself to be social when I didn't really want to be. 

I had to be sociable and friendly even when I didn't want to be either. This has led to a strange existence where, no matter how genuine I think I am being, I always ask myself if I am actually feeling that feeling or if I'm just pretending to feel that way for social gain or to get people to like me. 

In and of itself, this is not surprising. I've been diagnosed with OCD before by a psychiatrist. A lot of patients who have OCD suspect they might be secretly violent or depraved because when they see somebody, they imagine having sex with them or that person murdered. 

So maybe what I'm going through, always suspecting myself of being a phony no matter what, is a version of that. The fact that my anxiety makes it very difficult for me to tell if I'm having genuine emotion complicates matters. I know I should just say, ""I feel what I feel,"" but, if you've read the above, you know it's not so easy. 

This has gotten to the point with girls where when I talk to them, I am so very concerned with wanting them not to think that I am a creeper stalker who's only talking to them to get to bed that I deliberately am as emotionally dull or neutral as possible. I hate, hate, hate thinking of myself as a skeeze. 

**How do I stop background anxiety which makes me feel like I'm the world's biggest phony?**

5) Finally, and this perhaps is my goofiest belief of all, I worry that if my anxiety is diminished/solved, I won't have anything to do and my life will become empty. It sounds goofy to type it out, but it's something I actually do worry about. 

I've worried about stuff for so long now that I assume not worrying about living a passionate, meaningful life would make me mediocre; that not worrying would make my life so very dull. I assume that worrying equals trying. 

It's hard for me to think of a world where I don't worry. When I try to imagine myself totally happy or at least placidly free of unnecessary worry, I begin to worry how long such an existence could last. 

**One reason I keep my anxiety is because I'm afraid a life without worry would become an empty, ennui-filled passionless expanse of time.**

**If you could help with any of these, I would be very grateful, guys.**

----------------------

**SALIENT FACTS:**

I'm 32 year-old male, active but aside from walking daily no regular exercise. I don't know what you'd call my kind of anxiety, but I've been diagnosed with OCD. I don't think that's appropriate, but that's what I got diagnosed with in the past. 

Triggers are what I've discussed above: **a lot of my triggers are ""meta""-type stuff**. Other triggers: **Important events, genuine moments, certain kinds of social interactions.** I've tried Celexa, Effexor, Wellbutrin, and a whole lot of everything else, and I'm more or less convinced meds aren't my answer. 

My experience (and a limited amount of therapy) suggest to me that the problem is mostly in my patterns of thought, and must be addressed there. I live in Texas, in the United States.

A little background on me, I'm a 25 year old mom to a 2 year old boy (definitely going through his terrible twos).  Throughout my teenage years I used to take Ritalin then Adderall to concentrate in school but found that it made my anxiety unmanageable.  No one really did anything regarding treatment because it was brushed off as a side effect.  Also I've always been a little OCD.  I have to have things done when I want them, how I want them or it makes me physically uncomfortable and I dwell on them until it drives me crazy.

I've always been a chronic ""worrier/what if-er"", most of the women in my family are.  My anxiety used to be mostly mild and manageable until as of late, recent events in my everyday life.  (divorce, work, boyfriend, money, kid, etc)  I found myself having more and more frequent panic attacks.  I try my best to explain to my boyfriend what it's like so that he understands because I feel so bad that he has to deal with this with me.  He does his best to help calm me down during my anxiety or panic attacks.  I explain how it's like there's a tiny conscious part of me aware that I'm just freaking out for whatever reason but there is nothing I can do to stop it; like a tiny version of me sitting in a huge room, aware but unable to do anything.  I'm aware that things I say sound crazy or that I should calm my breathing or there's no reason to be sweating profusely or that it's all in my head but there is nothing that I can do to stop it.  I have anxiety just thinking about it.  Even my doctor pointed out that I have anxiety about my anxiety/panic!  As far as how I constantly feel, it's like I'm always on edge.. like a runner at the start of a race, every inch of my body constantly feels like it's getting ready to run for it's life.  I'm constantly making up scenarios in my head that are so implausible then taking it out on the people around me.

I finally decided to seek out medical counsel because nothing else seemed to be working for me.  The first doctor I saw prescribed me Ativan.  I took it and I kind of questioned whether or not I felt it, like I was searching to feel the calm and couldn't find it (which just put me more on edge because I was so desperate to feel even a moment of relief).  The second doctor I saw prescribed me a low dosage of Xanax and Celexa.  This was very recent so I'm crossing my fingers the longer term Celexa will kick in and temper some of my anxiety.  As for the Xanax, I took my first .5mg yesterday and finally felt some relief.  It was like exhaling for the first time in a long time.

I'm scared of the possibility of dependency so I am only taking it as needed, when I know I'm encountering a trigger.  I want to make myself aware that it is in my head and I have the power to control it.  Someone recently asked me what the relief from anxiety felt like, getting to have medication.  I explained it like this:  I think of my anxiety like a huge prison, inside this prison I do what I have to to stay sane and what I feel is ok, even things I don't want to.  Taking my meds is like the prison finally letting me out into the courtyard.  I'm not free, but I get to feel fresh air.  I get the hint of freedom and all I can think is, this is how it always needs to be.. this is what I need to work for.

I'm just rambling at this point.  Was waiting for my medicine to kick in.  I'm currently in the midst of helping plan a wedding as well as dealing with a death in the family, so it's been a little high stress lately and I decided sharing with strangers was one thing I could do to make myself feel better.

I'm borrowing my dad's truck since my truck broke down last week. It's a $1k repair on an old chevy with a billion miles. She's served me well.

 Anyways, back to my evening. It's a peaceful ride home with the rain pelting the windshield of my dad's very nice diesel truck that he can't afford to drive. I love the truck. I get home, turn on the lights and see what my pet frogs are up to. I was worried about them since I just cleaned their tank yesterday and one jumped into their heat lamp and burned itself. He is fine, and being properly taken care of but I handled the frogs a lot. 

I get in my pj's. Grab my gallon jug of water, my computer, and turn some Beavis and Butthead on the tv. Start drinking my water. Realize my nose is still runny. Remember that my girlfriend got sick the last day we were together. Start to wonder why she got sick. The thought enters my mind.

I then wonder if my water is somehow contaminated from insufficient hand washing. I already drank a bunch. Im certain that I have exposed myself to some parasite or microbe that is sure to make me sick and hallucinate even though my frogs are harmless american tree frogs and carry no real threats. 

Even if I'm sick with just a common cold, I can't take any cold medication. I can't trust myself to remember to take the propper dose. I accidentally once overdosed on sleeping pills because I forgot that I had already taken them. So no more medicine ever again unless administered by a doctor.

I had conquered my anxiety and spent the past three months feeling amazing! But, a few hits from a bowl of weed sent me into a major panic attack two weeks ago. That night was rough, the morning I felt very odd and had brain fog. It was scary. 

After that I spent days out of equilibirum. I'd wake up feeling exhausted--like I had run a marathon. I'd feel vertigo and heart palpitations during the day. At night I could literally feel the adrenaline playing around in my head, to the point where I couldn't sleep. 

I even scared myself more by actually believing that a few tokes of weed (I don't smoke regularly) could have ruined my brain. I also broke 3 months of sobriety and had a pint of beer two days after this first panic attack. I was feeling awful every day...not being able to get my mind off of my health, and literally feeling hungover for days on end. This was the worst my anxiety had ever been, and I felt like my life was coming to an end. I began to feel depression and was so scared I needed my grandfather and parents in the room with me for three straight days. I couldn't stop fearing and breaking down in tears...tears that weren't helping. My life felt like it had ended. I've never been more desperate. 

Did I have chronic fatigue syndrome? How's my blood sugar? Great, I'm diabetic. I even had some people share with me some story of a kid who smoked pot once and ended up stuck in brain fog. Google isn't a good friend. 

After four doctor visits, including an urgent care one, I finally walked into my Behavioral Health waiting room today with a smile on my face. I don't feel perfect...head pressure and a little bit of trembling here and there. Last night I kept getting really subtle but noticable head zaps. 

But, also last night I went to an AA meeting for the first time. I also sat down with my parents and promised them I'd let them lead the way...trust them when they tell me I'm fine, rather than Googling for solutions. 

It's like the anxiety has begun to leak out of my body. Today I've had peace of mind, enjoyed thoughts about football, girls, enjoyed the cool air of the vents in my room, the sounds from having my windows down.

Today is when I finally realized that the most powerful weapon against anxiety is also the thing that causes it. You can fight your mind with your mind. My mindset change from the past few days has yielded changes to very physically real and exhausting symptoms. I feel like I began to earn my life back. No meds needed. 

I'm beginning therapy to help build a foundation to deal with my anxiety in the future, but I never realized until today how your own thoughts will dictate your perception of existence. Don't ever feel trapped or out of control, no matter how bad you feel. 

For those who get exhausted from their anxiety, understand that it really is ONLY your mind causing you to feel the way you are. Workout, eat right, sleep right, have some herbal tea, make sure to laugh and share a conversation with someone in the morning, afternoon and evening, do something creative with your mind, read, and relax. 

You're going to be fine! ",['nsubj'],1

Alright, so I have a really weird anxiety - I can't eat with others! This is really hard for me to explain. For some unknown reason, I get horrible anxiety when I have to eat out with others. My throat locks up and I can't swallow unless I force it down with some drink. If I don't force it down with a drink I will end up chewing the food forever. I end up eating close to nothing even though I have to force food down with a drink. It always feels like I'm going to vomit so, again, I have to take a sip of something. 

This is why I avoid going out to eat with friends. And at work my co-workers would sometimes plan days ahead to eat out as a group. I choose to go because I don't want be THAT GUY. Plus, I see them 8 hours a day throughout the week, I don't want it to seem like I don't like them. The thing that's really killing me is that the days before we actually go out to eat, I will experience these symptoms at home just thinking about it! So if they plan to eat lunch together in a week, I would literally feel like shit for that whole week until AFTER lunch. I would eat maybe only a 1000 calories worth of food a day. I just feel like sleeping so that I don't have to think about anything - even it's only temporary. It's almost as if I fall into a deep depression. Is that how depression feels like?

I really just want to be able to enjoy eating out with others like a normal person. I want to seek help, but I don't even know how to approach a doctor about this. I know meds should be a last resort, and I'm not even sure if medication can help with something so weird, but I'm looking for anything to help me get rid of this - even if it's for an hour or two. 

To make things worse I'm a 26 year old man. Stuff like this shouldn't happen! :(

I was never healthy as a child... lots of broken bones, a few weeklong trips to the hospital including an infection that nearly killed me, and a lifelong affliction with eczema.  None of this ever bothered me until I cared for my grandparents as they were slowly but inexorably deteriorating.  I'm guessing this is a familiar story.

Shortly after that I had some odd neurological stuff going on.  Random numbness, weird senses, loss of muscle definition/control on one side but after going to many doctors and a clear MRI the best I got was ""we think you are having Migraine's without pain but with aura.""  It stopped getting worse about a year later so I just lived with it.  Not to say that it wasn't a year filled with absolute anxiety.

Fast forward to now, I went to the doctor's 1.5 months ago for a routine steroid shot for my eczema flare up and I've been in high anxiety mode ever since.  I guess it is a side effect of the medicine I've never had but I just can't control it anymore.  I had to take antibiotics for the past month+ and every pill I was worried I'd have a super rare reaction and even though it battled the infection I was convinced that I'd be the 1 in a million to get killed by the drug.

Even now after the meds are over I am focusing on something odd I feel in my tooth and wondering if it's a piece of food that is going to get infected despite it being there for at least a week or two or who knows how long.  Calling all around for a dentist only to find none available to monday.

Sorry this is more of a rant.  I think I need help... I've looked at CBT... but nobody in my family thinks I should go to therapy.  What do I do?

I've recently come to terms (with some forceful help) with the fact that I have problems, and I understand I can't deal with it on my own and I need help. I am terrified. I've never been able to open up about my issues, to anyone. The only person in my life who has ever helped me was my (now ex) fiancee. She is the one who has helped me realize that I do in fact need to talk to someone.

The thought of it kills me. I suffer from anxiety, to what extent, I don't know. I push through the attacks as best I can. Sometimes I hide in the bathroom at work. It's pretty bad I would guess. The idea of having to open up to a complete stranger about my issues makes me shake. On top of that, with the recent happenings in my life involving her (and some other outside influences), I'm suffering from severe depression. My mind is constantly in a very dark place. No matter what I try, I can't seem to focus on anything but what I've lost and the pain that accompanies it. I have to force myself to eat these days. I just never have an appetite. When I do finally get sleep, it's nothing but nightmares.

I've never...reached out before. I've always been able to take care of myself and my problems. Even on this type of forum, I've never asked for help. I don't know how to ask for help. Nobody in my life but my ex knows, to what extent, how I am now. There is one other 'friend' who has somewhat of an idea, but the only advice I get is 'you're only miserable because you want to be', or 'just smarten up and snap out of it', and such things. How do you people cope? How did you build up to talking to a therapist? I'm at a complete loss.

I want help. I hate who I've become, and who I've hurt because of it. But I don't know how...where to start.

I am open to the idea of medication, though that frightens me too.
When we were together, I helped her, as best I could, through her anxiety problems. We sought help for her together, as far as the meds part of it. I don't know if she's had any therapy since we've been apart. But I saw her progression and how the meds helped her stabilize.

So, please, any coping skills with anxiety and depression, anything any of you can suggest when it comes to seeing someone. Please tell me. The only person I trust enough to let know how I am is nowhere near me anymore to help. I don't have any support outside of her texts, and I refuse to involve my family. This would kill them. I wont hurt anyone else.

More details: I tried prozac about a month ago. My side effects were so bad that I didn't make it through the first week (constant nausea and diarrhea, with increased anxiety) and I am absolutely terrified that this new medication (Zoloft generic) will make me feel the same way I felt on Prozac. I'm going to be starting on only 12.5mg, and I logically know that the only way to know how I will react is to take it but I just can't seem to get that pill in my mouth. I have a phobia of vomiting so the thought of doing something that could cause nausea is very overwhelming. At the same time, everything is overwhelming right now and my anxiety has left me unable to work or attend school as normal so obviously something needs to change.

So after trying to face down my anxiety mano el mano for 2 months I've decided to start taking my medication. I'm really scared/nervous/anxious about it. I've been prescribed Paxil and Klonopin. I'm scared that these medications will turn me into someone I don't want to be, I'm honestly kind of afraid to confront my non-anxious self after 2 months (of what feels like) transformative anxiety. 

The reason I'm finally taking it is that it has seriously interfered with my relationship. I love my fiance more than life itself, but the constant crying and just ""brokenness"" of me in my anxious state has created distance between us. Today that came to a head and I spent the whole morning convinced that our relationship was going to end, doubting my love for him, and all around just puking and feeling awful. 

I know that to get better I need to actually take the steps I need to, but what if once I'm on medication I realize that I don't want to be in this relationship??? I'm terrified of that prospect. I know that I love Nick and I KNOW I want to be with him...I'm just really scared. This is my first time taking medication so any advice/support/love would be much appreciated.

Now this may not work for everyone but I think it's still worth a shot. I'd also like to add that I think it's still important to have a good diet and exercise regimen that includes some type of breathing exercises such as meditation or yoga in order to best treat some of your symptoms.

I'm a 28 year-old guy and I started feeling really bad anxiety symptoms about 2 years ago. I would describe myself as queitly confident and the anxiety just hit me out of the blue and was probably due to a particular period in my life about 4 years ago where 4 people I knew/were related to, died all within a 6 month span. I had also moved cities, went back to university, and was about to embark on a new career path.

*One thing I've learned:*

**Anxiety is horrible.** 

Absolutely horrible. And until you've experienced it, it's very hard to relate to someone with it. It eats away at your confidence and drains the colour from your life. For me, at its worst, every day became an exhausting battle just to be able to do very seemingly normal things.

I think the crux of it (for me, at least) is that I'm constantly worried that my body will do something and embarrass me. On the one hand I can see that this is a totally irrational fear but on the other, the fear is incredibly strong.

It's like anxiety likes to try and latch on to anything it can to induce the fear response and the ocd thoughts.

I'm gonna write out some of what I've went through (and am still going through). It's crazy and sometimes very laughable (and embarassing!) but here it is:

* fear of wetting myself
* fear that I'll get an erection
* fear that I'll ejaculate
* fear that I'll faint
* fear that my hands will noticibly shake

The fear of getting an erection is a very laughable one. But c'est la vie, it is what it is!

Personally this manifests in the desire to constantly check myself, especially when I'm wearing shorts in the gym.

""Am I getting an erection?""

""Is my penis sticking out?""

""Do I have a wet patch on the front of my shorts?""


People might be able to relate that these thoughts/feelings get worse when I'm in situations where I'm percieved to be trapped, i.e., driving with other people in the car, when I'm taking my coaching class, when I'm in class, when I'm sitting in lectures.

Here are some of my thoughts:

""What if I wet myself right in front of these people?""

""What if I get an erection? Does this mean that I'm a pervert? Is that a twinge a feel? Oh, god, am I getting hard? Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with me?""

All of these situations that I fear have happened exactly ZERO times in my life. They have occured many, many times in my head, but ZERO times in real life.

And that is why anxiety is a deeply irrational thing! But irrational or not, the fear response remains the same.

**So, how do I deal with it?**

* The very first thing is acceptance. Accept your body and accept your thoughts but - and this is extremely important - don't identify with them. Watch them almost like some sort of scientific experiment. Watch and accept.
* Make peace with the worst-case scenario in your head (this is obviously a very individual thing). Be ok with that worst case scenario:

""Ok, so tomorrow I'm gonna be giving some people a lift and I'm going to wet myself. Embarrassing? Yes, definitely. But the world'll keep on spinning, the sun will set, and tomorrow'll be a new day.""

When I consider that I'm on a floating rock surrounded by other members of my species and none of us know what the hell is going on, the insignificance of such an incident is mind-bogglingly small.

Now this is the difficult and scary step:

* Do everything you can to expose yourself to the fear. Really, really try to NEVER aviod a situation purely on grounds of anxitey and irrational fears. Everytime you do, you validate the fear and it grows a little stronger.
* YOU ARE A WARRIOR! When things are going crazy inside your body simply sit and breath. Do nothing else but feel the feelings, accept them, let them go, and breath. Do not try to aviod them and totally avoid any little safety-ticks that you have.
* Anxiety is a tricky little devil. It'll throw in a new bodily sensations to try and make you think that this time it's real! This time you're really gonna wet yourself! But be steadfast; do not be the first to blink! Anxiety is ultimately the wizard behind the curtain. Expose it for what it is.

For me, I want to so much look down and see if I've wet myself or if my penis is sticking out. But everytime I do, I validate it, and everytime I don't I weaken its grip on me.

And this is scary, believe me. Fear is fear, regardless of irrationality or not.

**In conclusion:**

Anxiety is perfectly normal. Trying to get rid of it is a goal that is rooted in failure because you won't. Ever. 

What we *can* do is reduce it back to a normal level because, for some reason or another, our anxiety dials have been stuck on high. For some, medication is a great way to get a handle on it, for others, it may be some sort of therapy. Our amygdala 'dial' may even revert back to a more normal level simply through time.

Our problem - and the reason we're different from other seemingly 'normal' people - is that we've become hypersensitive to our bodily sensations. Someone without an anxiety disorder has similar feelings but mostly they don't consciously register with them in the same way that they register with us.

Relax: the sensations are normal. Our body is a magnificent machine that takes care of an insane amount of tasks each and every second that we're alive. Try not to get too hung up or worried about a few twinges/tingles. Our body takes care of itself. You, by and large, are just a passenger.

Meditation sorta helps, but it can be really hard to do in this state. I choose not to take pills, ive taken them before later rebelling against psychiatry due to not getting the proper support while seeing a psychiatrist.

Ok so this may turn into more of a rant... I was on meds for anxiety for a year. It was a very strong med, an a-typical antipsychotic called Zyprexa to be precise. The drug really really effected my mind in a negative way for the year I was on it. It basically took a smart brain, and turned it too mush. My thinking has not been the same since.

I went off that drug after deciding to go the naturalistic approach. Vitamins and  Minerals fully dosed. 

As you all or most of you probably know, medications have withdrawals. Well I have been off that drug since June 25th, 2011. Things sort of gradually got better, and my anxiety is not as constant. But I have been left with these symptoms that come and go. Symptoms being chest anxiety and BRAIN FOG! which I believe the mental confusion now causes these physical anxiety symptoms.

I have been through hell. That withdrawal felt like an eternity, it went on for over a year, and I may still be experiencing it on and off. All I know is things have settled down drastically. No one really knows how hard it was, I was basically living a near constant panic attack with all these crazy withdrawal symptoms to boot, I would get these weird head aches leaving me in bed for a week!

Anyway over the past 3 months or so my mind has been clearing up more often, I just started reading books because I now my anxiety hasnt been so bad. But this brain fog keep coming back, and when I start googling what it is I get my self all anxious over it. I have tried diets and all sorts of things, the most clairity I had was like a week of light brain fog a month ago. It filled me with hope, but then not feeling that well for a couple weeks now, just kind of brings me down and makes me unhappy :(.

Its a bad case; had to stop working multiple times totaling several years overall, including the whole past year. Two SSRIs, heavy dosage of benzos, seroquel (both regular to sleep and SR daytime), multiple group therapies, followed closely by a psychiatrist, a psychologist, an ergotherapist, a nurse and a specialized educator. Multiple hospitalizations. Treatment is almost a full time job for her by now. Nightmares every night, has a hard time even opening the blinds of her apartment, the shakes, panic attacks over very little, can't be in a grocery store, the works. Depression and bulimia as side dishes, but the root of the problem is the generalized anxiety, which brought about the other conditions.

She has multiple local resources. We have good UHC, she has excellent work insurance so at least money's not a big issue. Her doctors are good and they're doing alot - she has resources like a 24/7 hotline and therapists coming to her home weekly. Yet I remember her just 6/7 years ago when she was *perfectly fine* and since there was no major trigger, it's obvious the problem is biological (heavy history for that on one side of her family, with a trend of issues popping up mid-20s) and that the meds aren't getting the work done.

I want to help beyond what the system can provide and I wonder often if there's therapies outside Canada that can address the biological axis better than how we do it here. An obscure team of overpriced Viennese specialists or something. It can't be behavioral therapy because frankly that option has been exhausted, just as commonly prescribed medication has been. I'm thinking more along the lines of experimental biological therapy. For this specific issue money would be no object, I'm just trying to find out if there are options beyond the usual pills and alot of talk, given that these are clearly not working. 

I realize I'm grasping at straws, but if someone can suggest any options of the sort, it could be of tremendous help. We just want to find something else to try at this point, even if the costs or the success odds are not ideal.","['nsubj', 'nsubj']",1

Quick background: I've battled GAD, panic disorder with agoraphobia, and depression pretty much my whole life. However, I wasn't formally diagnosed until I was 18, when I went on Prozac. Was off and on Prozac for 10 years. It worked okay but I did experience some side effects that I really hated - mainly delayed ejaculation and fatigue. 

I went about a year with no medicine but then a lot of change happened all at once and I found myself slipping back into a bad anxiety/depression state. I met with a psychiatrist and decided to try something new. He put me on Viibryd first. Worked up to 40mg. Although I think the Viibryd helped a lot with my depression it didn't do a ton for the anxiety and there were some bad side effects - a subtle annoying eyelid twitch, some digestive issues, and again the delayed ejaculation. Of course this is just my experience. It could work for you. But the side effects were a deal breaker for me. 

So we decided to try Buspar. It's been about a week - started at 30mg twice a day (I know that's high) and recently cut back to 15mg twice a day. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster. At moments I think it's really helping, but at others my anxiety is as loud as ever. 

Granted, it takes time for meds to balance out and become effective. But holy hell the dizziness too. I'm trying to ride it out, hoping that it'll help, but if the dizziness and vertigo side effects don't disappear I can't do it. It's hard to tell if it's helping the anxiety when the side effects CREATE anxiety. I've read some threads about Buspar but would love to hear from more of you. Have you had success with it? If so, how long did it take to balance out?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on these drugs and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about my experience so far with them.

I'm 22. About 6 months ago I started having problems with my thyroid that led to increased anxiety. Shortly after I had a couple of full blown panic attacks that pretty much controlled my life for a couple of months, as I had to stop going to a couple of classes. I went on Lexapro and Clonazepam, which helped a bit, and thought I was fine.

However, now it's 4 months later. My thyroid is fine, but I still have the anxiety. I've been constantly nauseous for the last four months or so, and have tried multiple medications for that which haven't worked. The nausea has basically been in my chest and throat, which makes me think it might be anxiety related instead of a GERD, but I'd still hope that the anti-nausea medication would help.

Now, I'm having panic attacks again, which unsurprisingly coincide with the end of my school semester (I have to give presentations and have awful speech anxiety). My psychiatrist put me on Brintellix and Clonazepam again after about 5 minutes of listening to me (no idea how he could make a diagnosis that quickly). I've tried therapy, but all my therapist did was try to get me to do CBT, breathing exercises, and rationalize my anxiety, all of which I already do without it helping (part of what makes me anxious is that I DO realize it's irrational and still can't do anything about it.

Basically, I have no idea where to go from here. I have no idea how to get rid of the nausea, or how to figure out what's causing it (I can't tell if it's the anxiety, and unfortunately Brintellix can cause nausea). I have no idea how to get rid of the anxiety without becoming dependent on Clonazepam (will Brintellix alone do that?). I have no idea if I'm getting adequate medical care. I have no idea if this is something that could be helped with therapy, or even where I'd go to find a therapist.

Basically, I'm lost, and have no idea where to go from here.","['pobj', 'dobj', 'nsubj']",1

I was always really against meds, I avoided them at all costs, so I went to see a mindfulness coach. Through him I learned meditation techniques and how to keep my mind off of my fears. I had one session with him and learned a whole lot more than I did going to multiple sessions with a shrink. It really helped for a little, but I started to slip again. I was in a constant brain fog and always on the verge of exploding. I got talking on break one day at work about mental illness and one of my co-workers confessed that she suffered and was on meds. I continued to tell her that I would rather meditate and do mindfulness exercises to keep myself calm. I told her that the meditation wasn't really cutting though and she shared information that maybe changed my life. She said that through meditation and prayer she came to peace that medication was the right move for her. After that day I thought about meds all the time.

I'm a 22 year old male in my 4th year at university (5 year program).  

I have been plagued with horrible anxiety at points in my life, and just recently I got hit with the worst wave of it yet.  

My girlfriend and I of over a year had a temporary break up (i told her we needed to talk about some things because we've had some unspoken issues recently, and we mutually decided to break it off despite the fact the we both love each other and didn't want to do it) and later that night (this was all two days ago) she called me around 10pm saying how this just isnt right and that we made a mistake and we still need to be together, and I agreed and went and spent the night over there.  About two days prior to the day we broke up, I felt a sense of impending doom and anxiety (because I sensed that I needed to talk about the issues, and that a breakup could be possible depending on where the conversation would go), and when we broke up for that short time I felt like someone had died and almost wanted to throw up because I was so upset.  I understand that is a common feeling when breaking up with someone you love, but the fact that it was mutual and that neither of us wanted it to happen and we both love each other made it that much worse.

Now I'm back to being so happy that we're together, but facing the same crippling anxiety from before because I'm so scared of the relationship ending.  I'm not sure how to handle this.  I really love her so much and I realize that if we were to break up permanently that I would eventually get mostly over it, but still the thought of it happening makes me sick to my stomach.  I know if we were to permanently break up that for a loooooong time I would be unable to see her without still having feelings for her, and I feel like she would have the same reaction to seeing me.  When we had our temporary break up, we were saying things like ""We NEED to still be friends because I can't go on without you in my life"", and ""You are literally my best friend, I can't just go on living without talking to you every day.""  But what scares me is I don't think I can be just friends with her, at least not for such a long time that I might have to be out of touch with her for years and years.

This is not, however, a story just about my love life problems.  This situation is not the only situation in my life which has gotten me this upset.  I've had full blown panic attacks about: being afraid of having a sleepness night, being depressed about my time consuming job (40 hours a week, + 3 hours of driving to and from the job), being afraid of failing classes, and even once when I was just anxious about going to a musical concert the next day. 

The anxiety gets worse and worse every time it comes back, and I really don't know where to turn.  My girlfriend and her mom really think that I should be on some sort of medication (Xanax or something of the like, my girlfriend has ADHD and takes Concerta for it and she said it changed her life), and my parents don't really want that to happen and they don't really seem to fully understand my problem.

Whenever I talk to my parents about my anxiety issues my dad usually just says that I need to remember to look at the grand scheme of things and realize how little these things matter in the long run.  I really appreciate his advice and I realize how little these problems matter but the thought doesn't help me even slightly.  My mom is more open to discuss my issues and talking with her often helps, but she doesn't seem to quite get it either.

I feel imprisoned in my own mind and I can get these f'ing thoughts and anxious feelings out.  I just need to hear from someone who understands me.

As a side note, I also would like to know if anyone here has found good results with drugs like Xanax?  From what I hear, they mostly work if used ONLY during times of extreme stress so that your body doesn't get used to it and build up a tolerance to it.

I seriously don't know what to do.  I can't talk to my parents about it because they don't quite seem to understand and they just seem to think it's a problem that can be resolved simply by reasoning out why I'm upset or something.  I CAN talk to my girlfriend about my issues because she has similar problems and is easy to talk to, but I don't want to drive her away by making her think I'm some sort of self-depressing lunatic.  All I want right now is a game plan, specifically to get some meds to calm down this long-duration panic attack, but since this had to happen on Christmas Eve/Christmas day, there's not any way to even contact someone to begin getting help.

One last thing:  Going back to my girlfriend.  I'm looking for a bit of advice.  Part of me thinks that if this doesn't work out soon that we should break up, at least for longer than half a day.  But this will NOT solve my anxiety problems, and furthermore, I feel like my anxiety is causing a lot of the issues in the first place!  So the other part of me thinks that if I can find a way to get my anxiety in check, I'll be a better partner and many of our issues may resolve.  I really feel like anxiety is the center issue here, and that breaking up with my girlfriend will be painful at first but would eventually resolve THIS anxiety, but I would still have all of my other anxiety issues to deal with. So in short, I think I need to solve my anxiety problems before I make another rash decision about my relationship.

Edit:  It was brought up that I didn't mention whether my girlfriend was the source of my current anxiety, or the fear of losing her is.  My anxiety right now is caused by the fear of losing her.

It was recently explained to me that what I am currently experiencing is 'Depersonalisation', as a result of years of anxiety. From what I've read, the description of dp is on the whole accurate, especially the deadening of emotion, to the point where the anxiety itself doesn't seem to manifest either emotionally or somatically anymore. Rather I'm just zoned out 24/7 and pretty much nothing affects me. This I am starting to understand and come to accept.

 More worrying for me of late (I have only recently started to address these issues, having previously thought the dullness I was experiencing was part of my personality) is the cognitive toll it has taken. It feels like my mind is blank for large portions of the day. I lack creativity, organisation, clarity in my thinking, that is when I am thinking at all. My memory is atrocious across the board, whether it be short term, long term, relating to facts/dates/names/things I've read literally 5 minutes ago. My ability to process information has declined significantly. If I am listening to someone speak, I hear the words but I am not registering what they are actually saying, not understanding. I come out of a lecture and am hard pressed to recall what exactly we've been talking about. I also get a feeling of intense pressure in my head after trying to concentrate and take in material. Not like a headache per se, it's difficult to describe. It's making things really hard for me academically.

 There's two levels to it, the depersonalised me is apathetic to it all and just goes about his business, uncaring. But then there's what I consider to be the 'real' me (who hasn't surfaced in sometime), who would find the subject material interesting and would love to think about it and talk about it and explore it further. I often think of myself like this. Divided. I have had brief periods of (relative) clarity and have felt closer to the 'real' me and I can only describe those periods in one word: elation. These periods were mainly brought about by a short period of using Aniracetam, though and the effects wore off after a few months. I've read up on DP/Anxiety a bit and these specific cognitive effects (specifically the blank mind, which is very concerning) are not mentioned all that much. Does the emotional deadening go hand in hand with some of these cognitive deficits? By working on reconnecting with my emotions (with the help of a counsellor), will it lead to improvements in my mental functioning? Would medication be of use in such a situation? I'd love to hear your thoughts. I'm 21 and want to make progress, but it's all a little overwhelming right now and I'd love to get your thoughts on this.

I really appreciate any response to this.

Thanks :)

I don't know what to do an have nowhere to turn with this, but I am currently having a bit of a breakdown. For several years, I was dominated by my anxiety. I did not leave my apartment, did not socialize at all, I even withdrew from a semester in college. My psychoatrist had me on xanax, lithium, zoloft, and focalin. Had panic attack multiple times a week. Would literally skip therapy because of panic attacms. 

Fast forward a few months and, well, I got better..... somehow. I started working out and eating clean and weaned myself off of all of the medications. I even stopped seeing my therapist. I blame my diet and inactivity for all of those years of anxiety and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. In the past 8 months, I have not had a panic attack. I sometimes feel down, but am quick to snap back up and there has been no indication that I would regress. I have been socializing more, spending time around people every day. I am friendlier and more likeable. Everything has been great. 

Until today. For the past two weeks, I have been feeling anxiety creeping back. But, I would spend time around people and hide it, acting outgoing and normal. My friends like me now, whereas before people thought I was weird or bitchy and such. Needless to say, I don't tell them anything about the anxiety. I just have been forcing myself to just ignore this feeling I've had knotting up in my belly. While out with a friend, though, I started having a panic attack. Luckily she was taking me home anyways, so I just hid it and went inside. I don't think she noticed, so that is good. This panic attack, which lasted about 20 minutes I would guess, was like the flood gates of all these months was released. Even after I calmed down, I just started sobbing and have been inconsolable since.

I feel horrible. And I am so scared. :( I am so scared that I will go back to how I was before and I can't take that. I have come too freaking far. I thought I had gotten out of this cycle. But I guess there really is no cure. 

Tl; dr - First panic attack in months after thinking I'd 'cured' my anxiety. No meds, no therapist to talk to, obviously going to a friend is not an option, but I am still upset and crying. I just needed to get this off my chest to people who would understand.","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1

I've never sought help for this as quite frankly I have too much anxiety over the whole process, finding a psych, calling them up, making an apt, actually dragging myself there all feels so incredibly daunting and so I've pushed it off. Not to mention the cost of doing so, which I wouldn't be able to pay for and so would have to reach out to family  for money, all who which have been rather dismissive of my anxiety in the past (""get over it"", ""suck it up"", ""its all in your head"" attitudes). 

I've experienced what I thought were panic attacks in the past, but it wasn't until today that I experienced something of this magnitude. It all stemmed from a work email that I wrote and accidentally messed up by ccing somebody who should not have read what I forwarded. It was crazy, I was trembling, felt like I was about to faint and for the life of me could not catch my breath. The worst of it passed in a couple of minutes, but now 4 hours later I still feel a shaken up.

How did you tell your family / convince them what you feel is real?

Anyway, whether or not that's relevant I don't know but I can tell you that I believe my anxiety levels were about as bad as it can get. I was in a state of constant panic and confusion. I had only just stopped taking Valium about a week prior and since I had to see a new doctor (my other one is now 3.5 hrs from me) I couldn't get another script right away. 

The best she could do was Mirtazapine and told me to take one 15mg as I got home and then another an hour before bed. It put me to sleep and the next day I had no more panic. I still had a great deal of anxiety and I still do; I'm now on 60mg a day and I only spill over into full panic on occasion, instead of 10 times a day.

10 times a day is an understatement, really it was ALL DAY with a rare gasp of minor relief but even my previous doctor with whom I had good rapport denied that a panic attack would last that long.

It's really hard to describe how bad I really was. Even now, living with my lesser anxiety I find it hard to really understand how bad it was. I still suffer, I am still very far from peace but I do believe Mirtazapine has made it all much easier to sit with. 

If you are finding your medication unhelpful or you can't get a benzo script for emergencies for whatever reason perhaps you could bring up Mirtazapine with your doctor and see what they think. ",['nsubj'],1

I am 30. I have been dealing with what I now believe to be an anxiety disorder for basically my whole life. It really kicked into gear after my parent's divorced and I hit puberty. Started to have panic attacks in High School and am now on 20 mg of Paxil daily.

The Paxil is definitely not enough though. While my panic attacks are somewhat at bay- I still have times of severe anxiety and the depression that comes along with it. I'm pretty certain my main issue is anxiety, though. And my primary care physician agrees, I guess since he still prescribes me the Paxil.

I also smoke weed. I have smoked daily for maybe five or six years now. Smoked a few times a week for about four years before that. And I really think when I have weed and can smoke it or even knowing that I have some, helps my anxiety immensely. But because it is illegal in my state, it is common to run out of it.

Also, my wife does not support me smoking and so if I use up my weekly supply after five days then I am just out for two days until she allows me to re-up and those two days are always hell for me. 

I stopped smoking at her request awhile back. After six weeks I was flipping out and having all kinds of anxiety-related issues- cutting, emotional outbursts, questioning our marriage, etc. I went to my doctor and told him the situation. He prescribed me Seroquel to stabilize my mood. This worked for about three days and then it was just as bad as before. He confirmed that what I was dealing with was still my anxiety disorder and not withdrawals from weed (which my wife thought is what it was). 

My doctor is very reluctant to prescribe anything else. As I think he is concerned my just trying to get high.

I exercise and meditate on occasion. Both help, but don't really relieve the stress or stop panic attacks. 

I feel like meds are my best option to have normal levels of anxiety and not freak out and go back into that hole.

But how to I get my doctor to see that? Or do I try a psychiatrist? Or do I try to really convince my wife that the weed helps immensely and that for me to be cool, then we need to make sure I have it- since I can't control if I have more anxiety one week compared to another. All of it means more $ which I don't like, but I hate feeling like this and I know it is no fun for my wife either.

After a lot of tinkering I think I've found a solution that really helps me remain consistent in dealing with my anxiety: Excel spreadsheets. What problem doesn't Excel solve, right? So I made a chart that covers 4 major categories related to my anxiety: Sleep, care, medicine, and overall outcomes. Every day I create a new row with the date. I note:

Sleep

* Wake time
* Bed time
* Whether I had nightmares (since I have night terrors)

Care

* Meditation (# of minutes)
* Cardio exercise (# of minutes)
* Alcohol (# servings)
* Caffeine (# servings)

Medicine

* Morning medicine (whether I took it, y/n)
* Evening medicine (whether I took it, y/n)
* Ativan (whether I needed it, # taken)

Overall outcomes

* Whether I had any panic attacks (y/n)
* My level of productivity, 1-10
* General overall feelings about the day, 1-10
* Any notes (e.g., if I changed my prescription dosage)

This system is working really well for me right now for a few reasons. 1) It's almost like a detailed personal checklist reminder system, and it's all in one place. 2) It only takes 3 minutes to fill out in the morning and evening. If I didn't do something (like go to the gym), I just have to give myself a zero and try again later. 3) It's a really great record of my symptoms and behaviors, which makes it easy to identify correlations between them. And when my psych says, ""So how is the new medication working?"" I can just bust this out and show her.

That's my new plan. It's been really great for me. Hopefully this is helpful information for someone out there too.

**TLDR: Created a sweet anxiety accountability and record system that's helping me stay on track.**","['appos', 'nsubj']",1

Had to adjust to a higher dose over the holidays. It was tough. It's been tough since the beginning, but I want to get better so I've been trudging through it without feeling like anything's changed. 

Today I had my first real ""aha"" moment that maybe the citalopram and talk therapy are working so I should keep going with this path of treatment. I want to share and see what yours was, what was the first positive change you noticed that helped you push forward?

I'm now living with two new people in my house after 5 years of living with my (now ex) boyfriend. For the past couple years I had routines and systems and things were done a certain way. For instance I had a system to my dish cupboard and it used to bother me when things weren't put away ""my way"". It was something so trivial but would set me off. I would have to reorganize it right away because if I sat on the couch, I'd know the glasses weren't right. I'd get anxious and annoyed. Not a major anxiety attack, of course, but definitely not the response of a normal person who found that the small glasses were switched around with the tall ones.

Today my newest houseguest decided to be nice and empty the dishwasher. She's only been here a couple weeks so she doesn't know where everything goes. Most of the glassware and plates had been washed up,so the cupboards were blank canvasses.I opened the cupboard to find she put it away completely differently than I would have. And I just grabbed a glass and closed the cupboard.

It's something small, not earth shattering, but something that 12 months ago me would get worked up over. Even six months ago I would have taken everything out and put the dishes away "" in the right place they belonged"" because the anxiety of having my order upside down would upset me. But today it didn't bother me, and I thought, ""this is progress.""

It's enough to keep going at it. I can see that if I'm not spending so much time letting little things lead to bigger anxiety issues, I am letting go of some of my triggers and can focus on more positive things.I can see it starting to work and it gives me some hope.

***tl;dr*** I finally saw that my medication is working with my anxiety when I didn't freak out over dishes not being put away how I was used to. Interested in everyone else's first realization that maybe things were getting better?",['nsubj'],1

I had my first intense panic attack/disorder episode about a year ago. It came on randomly and I was sent to the er as a result. I wasn't able to sleep for about five days in a row and began hallucinating at the worst of it. I'm not sure if it was an average panic attack as the anxiety lasted nonstop for around 10 days. It was more the fear of fear than anything else. It was the worst feeling in my life. 

I eventually came to after my gp told me that the medicines the er and another nurse practitioner I had seen were way too strong (seroquel) . It had actually made my attacks worse. So he said I should be on xanax instead and that it was made specifically for what I was going through. Just hearing him say that snapped me out of my anxiety and I was more or less ""cured"". 

Ever since then however I'd occasionally get nighttime anxiety. Never as bad but it was always a struggle to sleep. I think I was traumatized from not being able to sleep for days and whenever I'd be dozing off I'd get a surge of adrenaline like I was about to be attacked or something and was wide awake afterward.

I didn't even had to take the xanax back then. Just hearing my gp say that was like the thing I needed to hear. fastforward a year and I had another semi attack last night. I was stressed out and got that same horrible anxious knot in my stomach that still hasn't gone away. I took xanax to help me sleep and it made me tired as hell but as I tried to doze off I just felt that rush if adrenaline trying to wake me up even though the xanax was slightly dulling the feelings.

Needless to say I didn't get any sleep. I took more xanax and it doesn't seem to be having any effect. I'm afraid of trying to sleep tonight. I can't go to a Dr anytime soon as we just moved cities and I'm on medicaid and it takes time. I will also have to be alone all day tomorrow as my mother has to work and can't get time off since she just started a new job. I am a social recluse with no friends to take comfort in. stuck inn a city I don't know with no vehicle and no way to see a new gp. I am at a loss.",['nsubj'],1
3742,3742,0.10375744089294724,0.8962425591070354,0.17300000000000001,0.6829999999999999,0.14300000000000002,"There are some things I want you to know about me and my condition.
I am not necessarily shy, that's not what having a panic disorder is. I am an outgoing person who often feels trapped inside a wall of fear. I get really angry sometimes because what I feel like is the real me is trapped behind my anxiety. I probably want to be affectionate and laid back and fun at any given time but you make me nervous. It's not your fault, it's just people- it's nothing you do or did. I can only become desensitized to people by spending a lot of time with them and even then sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes, with some people, it works right away.

I know that what I'm afraid of isn't real. I know that the threat is an illusion and that I'm not really going to get hurt, but my body is telling me otherwise. I try to talk myself out of it but ""fight or flight"" is one of the most basic and powerful instincts of the body, and it doesn't always listen.

I am working really hard to combat my anxiety disorder. Some days I start to give up because I've been fighting for so long and it doesn't seem to change, or I make progress and then I backslide. It's inevitable that I get depressed and may not seem to be working to help myself. Having an anxiety disorder is really hard and I promise I'm doing what I can. Much of the fight that goes on with my condition happens inside the head, so while it might not seem like I am trying to help myself, I am.

I am constantly exhausted. If your body went through intense terror each day (or sometimes, just from time-to-time) and then crashed, you'd be exhausted too. I have to make myself move when I am crashing and sometimes I just have to sleep. My body doesn't present that as an option; it's just an order- ""You. Sleep. Now"". Sometimes I don't get things done because I am tired. Please don't get mad at me if I don't always do everything I am supposed to do- it can be a real struggle to do little things that most people don't think twice about, like walking into a store, running errands, sometimes even leaving my house.

Some of my behavior might seem pretty odd at times. I might make someone go with me to places I ought to be able to go to alone because I need a ""safe"" person there. I might come off as clingy and dependent on others, but my reasoning is not what you might assume- ""safe"" people are our anchors to sanity. Real or not, we assume we can count on them to help us if we become terrified, and that can make the difference between fleeing a place or being able to stick it out. We develop triggers in specific places and that place, as innocuous as it might seem to you, scares me to death. I don't want to feel that way; it's embarrassing, but I do. How would you feel if you were terrified out of your mind in a place or around a person you know is harmless in your heart?

I try many things to combat my anxiety. If you've heard about a technique, I've probably heard about it. I've tried meditation, yoga, acupuncture, keeping active, positive self-talk, cognitive behavioral therapy, regular therapy, and medication, among things. I've probably tried lots of different medication. Anxiety disorder (and depression, since the two are linked- you'd be depressed if you had an anxiety disorder) often get treated with strong medication, and strong medication has side-effects. When I am trying new medications I might be ""off"" and irrational. Please forgive me, it's not me, it's the meds. Also, some meds make me extra tired or dizzy or any number of other things that aren't my normal or desired state. Most medication used to treat anxiety is something the body becomes immune to over time, so the dosage must be increased. So, occasionally I may relapse when I am not expecting it. I don't necessarily know the cause.

Please don't make fun of me when I am experiencing a panic attack- it's horrible enough without you ridiculing me. You wouldn't be laughing if you were the one whose body was revolting in fear. I'm not making anything up, I'm not trying to use panic attacks as an excuse not to do things, and I surely don't want to be a burden on you or effect your life negatively. Knowing I sometimes am and sometimes do adds to the misery of the condition. What I really need is for you to let me hold your hand or your arm tightly at times, and to humor me and just tell me it isn't real and I don't have to be scared, even if it's the millionth time you've said it. Tell me you'll protect me and I might just believe you, because I want to so badly. I want to be tough and independent and in control, but something (psychological and chemical) inside of me won't let me be free.

Panic disorders are almost always genetic and are chemically related, though they're often triggered by a traumatic event. Before realizing what is happening to us, most panic disorder sufferers go through a terrible period of thinking that we're dying when we're having a panic attack, or that something terrible is about to happen to us, etc. It's impossible to understand when it first happens, unless someone is there to warn you. There usually isn't.

Many of us live in terror of letting other people know we're freaking out, so while we might seem normal, in control, and calm, our insides are often a different story. It's ok to tell us we seem stabler or more confident- we'll appreciate you noticing. Just know that sometimes it might be an illusion, sometimes true one day but not the next. Acting like it's a result of something we didn't do is a double-blow, the first one being our own senses of failure for not being able to just ""tough it out"", ""grin and bear it"" etc.

Sometimes, just walking into a room by ourselves is the accomplishment of the day. Sometimes, we could lead a parade. Please, give us the credit for living with something so tough and managing to do anything. Please, just support us and help us, and listen to us. It's natural to get annoyed sometimes, but if you're annoyed, we're probably beating ourselves up because we're a self-critical lot. That's part of how we got this way, by being too self-aware.

We are trying to win the battle, but some days we just want to give up.

Anyway, while I know my anxiety isn't nearly as bad as a lot of people it is  impacting me in a very scary way. I get very bad anxiety when I'm being watched. I know that's not really unusual, but it's very crippling. It completely blocks my ability to think and I start panicking. The last time this happened was when I was doing a driving lesson with my instructor. I managed to get through the hour without killing us but it was *terrifying*. I just felt so nervous and my mind just became blocked, all while I was trying to drive.

This happens in other situations as well, when I'm expected to do a certain thing and I don't want to fail.

I've had anxiety for years but this is the first time I've felt like it's become a danger to my life.

Anyway, I'm not really sure if I should bother talking to my psychiatrist about it and just try to suffer through it. At first benzos sounded like they would be perfect for me, but after reading more, they sound more terrifying than helpful. I know there are other anti-anxiety medications available, but if I'm correct, the ones I know of are all long-acting and take weeks to build up, which I really don't want to do. The last time I tried a long-acting medication (Intuniv) it was awful and gave me very bad headaches all day. I know not all would be like that but I'm still turned off by the idea of the medicine being built up in my brain permanently. I like being able to know exactly what medication is doing to me, which requires comparing how I feel without it with how I feel on it frequently. But if I'm never off it, I couldn't do that.

The medication I take makes me anxious on top of my already bad anxiety.

Done with the preface rant.

So I got a Wii U last week to help me take my mind off of things. I saw  Call of Duty is on sale at Toys R Us (60%) off for some clearance sale. Hell yeah! I made my way to the store after class. One thing that makes me anxious is being somewhere I've never been to, especially in public. Also, I took a highway I've never taken before, which *also* makes me anxious because I tend to go slower than normal when I'm not driving on routes that I do every day for school.

I saw the game, I stood around *waiting* for a clerk to ask me if I needed help. I picked the game out, got home. Loaded it up.

Oh boy. Black ops two. Not the new one. I wanted call of duty ghosts and ended up being so anxious I picked the wrong game out.

I'm not going back. I just ordered the right game and letting them deliver to me.

After a difficult breakup I started blinking very hard. Not a full facial tic, but a hard wink. It's something that still happens, especially when I am tired or stressed out.

At first I was mortified and embarrassed. My career requires a lot of public interaction and sales, so I went through a few different treatments, but I've never cured this tic, only reduced the severity of it. Now I can go long periods without blinking, days even sometimes. A combination of SSRI/Buspar has worked out for me fairly well. 

And since this is going on over 10 years now, I can tell you that just age alone slow down anxiety somewhat. Just getting older puts you in a position to give less of a shit about what other people think.

I'll start with a question- Does anyone else blink? What meds have you tried? I've tried most everything but ADD meds/stimulants and I'm curious if they would work for me. My brain reacts differently to stimulants, for example cold medicine with sudafed makes me sleepy. I was on a weight loss stimulant (phentermine) once and it made me very sleepy as well. I think my brain my be in reverse when it comes to stimulants.

Moving on-

A few lessons about anxiety that I've learned from dealing with this for decades.

1. A lesson from mindfulness. Wherever you are now is ok and you can only live in the present moment. You can't change the present moment. It must be accepted. Learn to appreciate what is in front of you. If you find yourself failing at something because of anxiety, make it a long term goal to address that problem and takes steps, but accept the present moment for what it is. You live in the present, and existence is a beautiful thing. I was not the most disciplined mindfulness student, but I have kept with me an inner voice that I use when I am anxious. I just repeat ""There is nowhere to go, there is nowhere else to be, there is nothing else to do, you are here, you are ok."" I have social anxiety so that comes in handy when I feel the need to get up and leave (I hate long dinners).

2. Anxiety reduces your ability to make decisions. Do your best every day and be proud of how hard you have fought. You have less choices, and I believe your free will is compromised when you have anxiety. That is, there are certain decisions you just can't make when your anxiety is out of control. If that happens, it's ok. You are ok.

3. What you can control is trying new treatment options until you find something that works. You will be limited by your anxiety in this as well, but think long term and try to try new ideas every few months until something works. Remember, the present moment may be horrible, but it is your moment, find something to love that is in front of you. And address your thoughts. If you are replaying embarrassing moments in your head from junior high, address that thought directly, address that memory directly. Challenge those thoughts, and ask yourself if you can change what happened in the past. Then minimize that open window in your mind, and move on.

4. Quit drinking. It's amazing short term relief, works better than any pill or exercise of meditation. Really, I used to really come alive after a few drinks, but the next few days were hell. Rebound anxiety is real, and it's terrible. It can lead to substance abuse as well.

5. Careful with the benzos. If you have rebound anxiety with booze then benzos will cause problems. Get a doctor who knows what he is doing (psych not your family doctor), and watch out for tolerance. I found that when I used benzos I needed higher doses to keep the anxiety at bay. When I was on them I felt nothing (which was an improvement) but when I was coming off of them I felt horrible rebound anxiety.

6. You have more options and information now than anyone in the history of the world. Really, try dealing with this shit in the 80s and 90s. Pre internet days people thought anxiety meant you were weak, and doctors didn't know much about treating it beyond xanax. I would have loved to have a forum like this 20 years ago.

8. Talk about your condition. It's not a weakness, it's a condition like any other. The more I hid from the fact I blinked or was anxious the weaker I was. You can't hide this condition, and the more you can speak about it, the less power it has over you. I have achieved amazing things in my life, and I have done them in spite of my anxiety.

9. Anxiety can have an upside. Before overly afraid makes me work harder and prepare more than others. I see enemies and traps everywhere, and it has helped me in my career. No one out works me because I'm always thinking 10 moves ahead. It also makes me very creative, that inner dialogue that never stops makes me an above average writer and a decent musician. 

10. On reproduction- I do not have children, and I am not sure I ever will. I have other friends with mental health issues (and yes, you have one, it's ok, it's just a label), and some have chosen not reproduce because of all the time and energy their condition takes to manage. I'm not saying don't, I'm just saying I don't, and one reason is my genes. I'm not sure how I would react and I am not sure how I would handle a child who had the same issues I do. So in that area I am cautious. There is also the feeling that I now have this under control, so I don't want to rock the boat with a major life change.

Turn on the tv and someone tries to sell me something. Turn on the radio, go on the Internet, look at my god damn telephone phone, everywhere. It's unavoidable. If I didn't turn one of those things on myself, at several points throughout the day, someone around me will and I'll be forced to see it. 

People everywhere getting high on drama. Their obsession with celebrities. I was in the waiting room at my dentist's office the other day. The only magazines on the table were covered in ""this celebrity is fucking this one"" and ""20 ways to be this predetermined kind of sexy"" and ""15 ways to fuck better"" and ""10 women who wore the same dress to some arbitrary ceremony where awards are handed out to the most popular artists""

And if that's not bad enough to make everyone in the waiting room see, the TV was playing TMZ. A show about famous people going to the grocery store and fighting on Twitter with other famous people. Half of which are only famous because they were on another show about going to the grocery store. 

Fucking Kim Kardashian. She's famous for having a sex tape. She's basically an amateur porn star who was in one porno and she's one of the most famous people in the world. 

All this shit makes me so anxious and angry that I can't even sleep at night sometimes, let alone focus on anything for long enough to be of any use to anyone. I get so fed up that I can't turn my natural intelligence into anything to better myself. I'm almost always broke. 

I think to myself that the ability to see the forest for its trees is a quality in a leader. Someone who could see through the bullshit and can manipulate it to better the world or at least harmlessly make a living but I can't focus on anything long enough to make that happen for myself. It's never a productive feeling. I like to think I'm better or stronger or smarter than most ppl but when the day is over It's just cynicism and it doesn't do me any favors. But it's how I've always felt. 

So I smoke a pack a day, I drink enough coffee to accomplish whatever I have to and I go to bed and sleep like shit or too much. 

Anytime I try to read something I get anxious because it's too long. So I skim through it quickly never remembering any specific details. Any time I try to write, which was once a dream of mine, I get anxious and abandon it. The same could be said about any kind of work. And every dream I've ever had. 

Except touring. Which I basically stumbled into accidentally. That's the only thing I've found( I admit I haven't looked for many other things) that inspires me to work hard. I feel in my element. But even then im constantly doubting myself and seeing ppl who've accomplished more and im convinced I'll never be as good as them. 

TLDR: I constantly feel alienated and incapable of taking comfort in any accomplishment. I fear I'll never be able to focus on anything thoroughly enough to succeed in any satisfying way. I can't get past my anxiety and anger and I just wanted to admit it. And I don't want to be on a medication, though I've never tried it. It just feels wrong.  I tell myself that I should be strong enough to fix this inside my own mind and meds are cheating. ","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1

Doctors hand these drugs out like candy for any little emotional problem someone has and they fail to tell you that these drugs can cause permanent side effects.

Honestly, I think SSRIs cause permanent brain changes. They erase all your emotions and sexuality, sometimes permanently even after a few doses (it happened to me). All from a 15 second conversation I had with a general practitioner asking about mild anxiety.  In fact, why are general practitioners allowed to prescribe psych meds?  That should be illegal.  

I only had anxiety before and was never depressed, but I am now.  Mind blowing how something called an anti-depressant caused my depression.  I don't like that name for these medications.

I know some people say they love their anti-depressant and they should if they really absolutely needed it. Those are the people that should get them.

I feel like SSRIs can sometimes take away depression, sadness, and anxiety, but can they also take away your happiness. I think people on these drugs ""think"" they are happy only because they don't experience lows anymore. Which I suppose that can be a fair trade off if all you experience are lows.

Now, this is just my opinion. I'm not against these drugs completely. I believe they have their uses, but only in much rarer cases than they are now.  I'm amazed at how many people I've met personally that have been on an anti-depressant.  I wonder how many of them really were depressed or anxious enough to get on medication.  SSRIs are way over prescribed and advertised as being mild, better, less addicting alternatives to Benzodiazepines. Yes, Benzos can have withdrawal, but SSRI withdrawal can be just as bad if not worse.

SSRIs can take away sadness and anxiety yes, but they can also take away love, happiness, motivation, and sex drive permanently. These pills can make you a functioning zombie. Like a chemical lobotomy in some cases. They can delete your humanity.  Its like some people on these medications don't realize whats happened to them and the meds have made it to where they don't really care.  For some its like they don't care about anything anymore.  

Its like these medications are being so over prescribed, that the world may one day be like a dystopian sci-fi novel such as The Giver or the movie Equilibrium.  Except at least in a move like Equilibrium, once people stopped the medication they got their emotions back.

For me, I only took a couple of these pills and had a horrible reaction to them 3 years ago.  I have never felt the same since.  My mind is cloudy, I no longer can feel pleasure anymore, and I have been permanently castrated.  My brain, body, and genitals all feel numb.  A touch from a woman used to be heavenly and now I feel nothing from it.  I feel distant in conversations and can't connect with people like I used to.  Alcohol used to give me a happy euphoric feeling, but now I feel nothing from it.  Days go by like a blur it seems now.  Life's littlest pleasures are no longer there anymore.  I can't believe I've lost the beauty of life because of one pill.  I can't believe how happy I was before all this.  It makes me want to cry.  I pray every night that I will some how one day recover.

I blame myself for this.  I sort of asked to be prescribed something.  And when I was prescribed an SSRI, I should have read up on the it first before taking it, but I believed my doctor when she told me it was a mild medication that takes weeks to notice any effects.  Why wasn't I recommended talk therapy first or just prescribed a low dose benzo?  Oh yeah, because benzos are ""too harsh and addicting"".  Which hey they can be, but only if you abuse them.  For me though, I have regretted that day I took the pill ever since.

I'm wondering if I should write a letter to the FDA requesting that they put more warnings on SSRI medication.  None of the warnings say anything about chances of side effects being permanent.  People need to know this.  I wish I knew this.  

The FDA needs to put more control on SSRI distribution.  These meds should not be available to the public from general practitioners and only be available from psychiatrists.  AND only used as last resort treatments!  I expect that pharma companies will not like this and probably pay off the right people to make sure these meds will always be easily accessible for anyone who wants them.  And they will continue to tell doctors and the world that these meds are safe and relatively side effect free.

I beg if anyone is considering trying an SSRI anti-depressant for anxiety or depression, please try other methods first.  Please.  Try talk therapy.  Try exercise. Try supplements.  Medication should be your absolute last resort for your depression or anxiety.  Yes, an SSRI could save your life from depression or anxiety, but be prepared to be changed as a person.  Possibly forever.  If you're someone with only anxiety, stay away from an SSRI if you can.  Try any of the methods mentioned above first before any medication.  Maybe a try benzo as a last resort before the SSRI last resort.  BUT always ask a doctor before you do anything!  

Also, ask a doctor for things you can try before resorting to medication.  A doctor will absolutely help you with that.

I have GAD and am a chronic worrier (most likely genetic). My anxiety is severe. I was prescribed medication but I refuse to take it because of its horrible side effects. The medication prescribed was clonazepam and it has terrible side effects and horrible withdrawal effects. Even though it has great ratings, I just spent a year and a half on meds and I don't want to be on them anymore. 

I've tried many natural treatments such as: 

- Mindfulness Meditation (Anxiety is too severe) 

- Passionflower (ineffective) 

- Breathing exercises (Don't help a lot) 

- CBT (ineffective) 

- Exercise (helpful in relaxation but I still have muscle tension.) 


What I am looking for is something natural that I can consume that would help my severe anxiety. I'm still on the meds but almost off them and I can only consume the natural alternative once I no longer take any meds. 

Note; About Kava, I have seem to have a liver problem that the medications have caused over a year and a half but there is still some bloodwork to be done. Since Kava is related to liver problems, I'd like to avoid it as much as possible.

Lastly, I'm looking for natural cures to severe anxiety/worry. Anything that is mild probably won't work, and since it had and is having detrimental effects on my life.

On that same thought, do you find it difficult to talk to your opposite gender about anxiety? I personally don't.

Before citalopram, I NEVER had actual panic attacks. 20mg of citalopram gave me my first, complete with the entire fight-or-flight response and also dry heaving, which was an incredibly traumatic experience. It happened at 4:30 in the morning. In the past two weeks I have had two more early-AM panic attacks (no retching but I'm always TERRIFIED it'll happen again), and I've barely been able to eat (because what if I get nauseous and panic and retch?). It was absolute hell-- I was anxious all the time, either on the verge of another attack or collapsing into tears. There were three days where I ate almost nothing at all. I've lost 11 pounds. I quit taking citalopram 8 days ago, after taking them for 10 days. My doctor agreed with my choice and both my doctor and therapist agreed that maybe meds were not the treatment for me, as my anxiety and depression are highly situational and at a second glance, aren't the type of thing you want to treat with medication first. I desperately wish we'd figured this out before I was traumatized so badly.     

All things considered, on citalopram-free day 8 I am definitely doing better-- I've stopped twitching constantly and falling over crying quite so often and I sleep more than 4 hours a night-- and I've been able to focus on doing some other things. But anxiety is still a constant factor. Eating is still very hard. I can't stand to be alone; previously, I needed at least 3 hours of alone time per day or I'd lose my mind. Sleeping is the hardest; I'm terrified of the possibility of waking up in the midst of another panic attack, which, of course, makes me anxious. I had such a good day yesterday, and then sleep didn't take-- I woke up 20 minutes later, petrified. Going to sleep, waking up, and eating are the high-anxiety activities, and it's killing me.     

The meds should technically be out of my system now but I'm still so anxious. I'm so scared that now I've seen how deep the rabbit hole goes, I'm stuck like this. And I'm so, so tired. I haven't had a moment of total, unaware calm in weeks. I start CBT tomorrow but I'm just... I'm so tired. I want this to be over. I'm so angry at myself for trying this in the first place.

People at my school talk about beta blockers like ""steroids for athletes"" and therefore ""musicians that use them are cheaters"".  I also hear conversations about how they ""get rid of that performer's edge that one needs"", and beta blockers make one an empty shell.

I have confided in some people that I take these,  and for the most part people are understanding.

On another note, I just stopped taking Tramadol (Ultram) last week after a month of having it. I read that Tramadol and Wellbutrin don't mix well, so will it be safe for me to start taking the Wellbutrin now that I'm no longer taking the Ultram?

So, I've been battling anxiety for some time, but refused to seek the necessary treatment to fight my anxiety. Finally, I went to see my MD and she prescribed me generic lexapro. 

No surprise, the minute they started to work, I stopped using them. That was a mistake. I had a full blown anxiety attack at work, and needed to leave. It was one of the most embarrassing moments in my life, to need to drop my responsibilities to take care of this problem! 

After that episode, I got back on the meds, but after 2 months, I think they've stopped working for me. I have already made the appointment with my doc to discuss the next step as far as meds go. 

I come to you guys today to ask, what can I do until I meet with my doctor this coming week?

And when it's not a burning fire of torture inside me, it's hot coals, reminding me each moment that it's still there. 

I've got an arsenal of ginger product and root, anti-nausea, and sleep aids just to make the day bearable. Does anyone have any advice to make this a comfortable time until I can start on a new drug? I want to enjoy my family. I want to enjoy being alive. But right now it's a struggle to do anything out of fear of triggers. 

I'm in the process of meeting with a psychologist, but finding the right one for me will take time as well as finding a medication that works, so any tips and tricks that aren't the same thing I'd find with a simple google search? I'm desperate. Yoga, meditating, journaling, etc. have been helpful in the past but the anxiety is kind of out of control at the moment.

For example, I'll think that I locked the door, and know that I probably did because I always do, but a little part of me will still be freaking out about it and have to go all the way back up to my apartment to check on it. And when I write emails/texts to people I don't know I have to read them to one of my friends at least a couple of times to make sure that the email/text is alright. I know that this is ridiculous, but I still won't feel okay sending a message if someone else hasn't read over it for me. It's sort of weird, because sometimes I'll start getting into that loop of freaking out over something and can just snap out of it, but other times I'll have to sit there and go over it in my head for hours and talk it through a hundred times before I can relax. Also, more recently I think I may have been having some small panic attacks. When I'm alone at night time, I start feeling like my heart is beating way too fast, and then I feel like my lungs aren't taking in as much air as they should. I'll take my pulse and it'll just be around 80, but it still feels like it's getting faster and faster. I know that this is probably the best idea, but when I start feeling like that or am feeling too stressed about something and can't just talk through it or snap out of it, the only way I can bring myself back down is by drinking. I'm worried that this is going to lead to becoming dependent on alcohol, so I'm starting to consider going to a doctor and getting medication for my anxiety. I don't know where to go or how to go about getting diagnosed and medicated. The idea of going to a doctor for this at all really freaks me out, so I've been avoiding it for quite some time. Is it a bad idea to go to the Mental Health counseling center on campus or should I find someone else to go to? Is it okay for me to tell them I think I may have anxiety/OCD and think medicine may help, or will this make it look like I'm just drug seeking? Will this show up on insurance, or is there a way to avoid that (I don't want my parents knowing if possible)? The idea of talking over this stuff with someone I don't know makes me uncomfortable, would it be really bad to just type up everything in a Google doc or something and just let the doctor/psychiatrist read it? If anyone has any advice/tips/comments, please share! I would really appreciate any feedback.

I'm 31, married, one kid and another on the way. I have a good job, although it can be stressful at times, but not more stressful than the average job. So what brings me here?

I have always been a worrier, like a really bad worrier. I have always worried about anything and everything. I worry about my kid's health, my work, money, etc.. A few years ago I decided to talk to a doctor about it and they prescribed me an anti-depressant which I took for about 6 months. The medication made me very lethargic, made me gain weight, and made me feel emotionless. After 6 months I stopped taking it. But overall my symptoms got better. That was 2 years ago.

Over the last year or so I get these bouts that I go through where I feel overcome with irrational fear. For instance last night I got a completely innocent text message from my boss that asked me to bring my laptop to the office today. I was overcome with this strong and irrational fear that I was getting fired. 

*I just knew that the only reason he would tell me to do that is because he was going to fire me, there was no other reason, he'd never asked it before and I was sure I was losing my job.*

I worried about it all night and couldn't think of anything else. I knew it was irrational and I was telling myself that I was being crazy, but I could not control my anxiety. I didn't talk to my wife about it and stewed all night and was unable to fall asleep. Of course, I didn't get fired. He wanted to trade me laptops because mine was a couple of years old.

Anyways, I'm not sure what to do or who to talk to. I go through these bouts a couple of times a month and know that I need to do something about it, but I'm not sure who to talk to or how to describe this. Maybe it's nothing? Maybe this is just an exaggerated version of something we all go through?",['nsubj'],1

I can have ""scary"" thoughts that don't spiral into panic, I can make decisions based on logic and not on fear. I know I still have a long way to go because my triggers still scare me and I want to avoid them, but I think meds are working for me so far and getting me out of crisis mode of non-stop panic/depression. 

One month ago I thought I had gone crazy and would never get better.  I think this drug may have saved my life. Best of all, I really never noticed any side effects aside from hands trembling two times and weird dreams (which were actually fun.) 

I have stayed on klonopin throughout this process, which at first did little but stave off panic and prevent me from freaking out about imaginary side effects from the SSRI. I don't really even feel like I need it anymore. 

Good luck everyone! I am feeling hopeful today!",['nsubj'],1

I think I worry about their situation more than even they do. I'm always there for them when they need to talk but it actually just makes me even more anxious after the fact.

I've tried distracting myself: playing games, listening to music, exercising... nothing works. I can't even enjoy those things anymore. At this point I even worry about them in my dreams.

I have a Xanax prescription, but I only take it when I have full-on panic attacks, which isn't happening right now. I'll make it through tonight okay. But it is definitely affecting my quality of life at this point.

It's also worth noting that I guess you could say I'm in between therapists right now; the last one and I disagreed on some pretty fundamental things, but I'm working on getting a new one. I'm also planning on making another appointment with my psychiatrist to see if maybe any medications need to be changed as well.

Again, I'll make it through tonight okay, and I'm making sure to tell myself that as well. But I could really use some advice to work through this in general. I really don't know how much longer I can function in a constant state of obsessive worry like this.

Thank you to:

1) Anyone who responds.

2) Whoever put that note at the top that says ""Breathe. Everything's going to end up fine."" It sounds silly and trivial but it helped me type this post up coherently.

EDIT: I was wrong. I'm not making it through okay. I swear I can *feel* all the pain others go through. All the suffering I read about, all the pain my friends go through. And then I feel guilty because I know all these people are worse off than I am, which makes me feel even worse, and so on... I've posted here, r/depression, and other places and just... it doesn't get better. This won't go away. I can't keep doing this, I can't eat, I can't sleep. I'm a train wreck.",['nsubj'],1

I am a 23 year old male, who has suffered with general anxiety and OCD of varying degrees since I was 14. I am on Zoloft, and I stepped down from the 200 mg to 150 mg dosage a few months back (this medicine has been impact my memory to an extent, and I have been trying to scale it back to regain some of it).

I recently graduated with a degree in marketing, and I did well academically. I got accepted to honors societies, and I made the deans list multiple times. Since the economy is not in the best condition, I had to move back home and settle for a job to cover the bills. At the time I graduated, I kept my anxiety and OCD at bay for quite a while, and had done so for the previous years.

I took a full time job at a movie theatre to be a gap filler until I can find something else. I liked the job at first, but one of the coworkers seem to be throwing me off balance of me balancing my anxiety.

In this case, I have a manager who is quite a bit older than I am. She is a strict micromanager in the way she wants things done, and explodes when she does not see her demands performed to the exact 'T'. One day, I did not move some signage around to her exact liking, and she literally exploded. She began to scream at me (in the manner you would expect if you tossed a brick through someones window). At the time I didn't respond to her tirade. But for some reason it stuck with me.

For whatever reason, I could not shake the whole situation from my mind for at least 2-3 days. My stomach even started to turn and I no longer felt hungry. I also felt very chilly when others felt perfectly fine. The whole scenario seemed to replay in my mind even when I tried to stop it. I even believe it infiltrated my dreams, as I woke up with the whole situation directly in mind while being in a state of panic.

(** Side note: As odd as it sounds, I have been told that I have a deep seated desire to please and put everyone else's needs infront of mine. Im not sure how this plays into it. **)

After asking around, I learned that this is the standard treatment many employees receive from her, and it is considered the 'norm' of sorts. As far as going above her head to bring this matter to the attention of the owners, it is basically impossible. From what I gathered from coworkers, she is a longtime family friend and is unable to do much wrong in the owner's eyes.

I am not sure what to do next. I can try to bear this out when I find a new job in a field related to my degree, or I can try to move to another workplace for a 'gap filling' job (even though I have only been at the theatre 2.5 months and I am not sure how that will sit on a job application). I just don't want my years of progress with my OCD and anxiety symptoms to be unwound because of this (I could tie symptom upticks with impactful events in the past). I am going to try and integrate some relaxation techniques into my day in the meantime though. I really want to explore some alternatives to upping my medication, because it has really depleted my short term memory for some reason (it use to be airtight years ago, now I am forgetting things (I am not sure if it is anxiety/depression/OCD invisibly manifesting in the time prior to working at the theatre, or due to long term use of Zoloft)).

Any thoughts or comments are appreciated. Thanks for sticking with a long story :D","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1

I'm pretty terrible at explaining things, but I'll do my best.

Throughout the day I occasionally get these split second moments where everything starts feeling really weird. It's like, I for a super brief moment, exit the body look down on myself and then I'm back to ""normal"". There's also a feeling of light-headedness and confusion. Then there's the feeling where I'm perfectly calm, which is really rare for me cause I suffer from G.A.D so I'm always kinda nervous. It's really uncomfortable cause it happens so fast I can't get used to it.

I've asked several doctors and therapists about it but they never gave me a clear-cut answer. I've tried looking for an answer online but... I don't know how to shorten down this question so that Google understands me.

I'm kinda sure that it's anxiety related, which is why I'm asking you people if any of you have had such experiences. I'm also guessing it's related to medication as it's happened more often since I increased Lyrica with 25 mg.

So... any help? I'm really freaked out about what all this medication does to my brain. But I'm at a point where if you were to tell me to eat a pile of shit cause it MIGHT calm my anxiety, I would do it.","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1

But the 'walls' of life are starting to close in. I see people in this Subreddit all the time and I give my support when I'm feeling confident, but lately I've been making my life harder. 
  I have a history of drug addiction. I sobered up and stayed this way for over a year, but after the year I decided to dabble in alcohol again and I abuse it two or three times a week. On top of this, every few nights I take more than the recommended dose of Benadryl to sedate myself.  Please people don't tell me how horrible this is for me because I know. But typing it out is actually scaring me more when I think about what I'm doing to myself.
          Well even the sleep meds don't work because my sleep schedule is MESSED up now. I fall asleep at 8 AM and sleep til 4 and this is COMPLETELY unacceptable because of my living situation.
        I shoplifted some benadryl early because I couldn't sleep. I took it (of course 2X the normal dose) and now that I'm sitting here I'm starting to freak out. I'm freaking out because I am in a good spot in life and I'm abusing myself and it's scaring me. My brain keeps telling me I'm going to have a stroke or something horrible is going to happen to me.
     I did it for a YEAR, but now my brain is saying ""How can I go a day without putting some substance in me"". And this thought it self is causing me so much anxiety. 
    Please help me with some words of wisdom or encouragement guys. Because I know from your posts that my friends on this sub know what hard times are. I just feel like I've lost a lot of the strength I had. I question if I can even have fun now without being high on something. But then when I use the drug, the anxiety always follows.

I have been working for about a year now and my job is considered the best in my field out of college. Everyone I work with is very Type A; well-rounded, great workers. A lot of extroverts but even the introverts are very polished and communicate extremely well. I feel like I can hang my hat with them in terms of work-product, but I am just a babbling idiot when it comes to communicating. I get very intimidated by my boss and I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE public speaking. It's a miracle I've weaseled my way to my position without even being able to speak in a room of any more than 6-7 people and nobody has noticed. Well lately I've been getting challenged and the secret is starting to show. I know as I rise through this firm and take on more responsibility that my anxiety is going to cause a tragic fall.



 I can deal with the day-to-day but it's really the public speaking that is brutal. And it's not a public speaking thing, because most people are uncomfortable with it, but I legit get the worst anxiety attacks with it and i feel completely paralyzed. The other day the client's head VP of Finance wanted to have a call with me about a project I was working on and I absolutely tanked it. I just froze on the phone and couldn't speak; I don't even know what happened, I was just overcome with it and had the worst attack of my life and I couldn't do anything. I eventually was able to find a few words and finish the call without hanging up but he knew I blew it and was just like whatever. He was on the client's side luckily so nobody knew about it but eventually this is going to set me up for a painful fall in front of my peers in my firm.



So I need to get help because I literally can't do this any more on my own. I just don't know, I feel so out of control and upset and frustrated and exhausted and powerless. I have to speak at my brother's wedding in August, I'm pretty sure there's no way I can do it. I am going to have to tell him I can't do it for the sake of his wedding. I just can't risk embarrassing not only myself but also making his wedding horrible by blowing the best man's speech. Even if I get meds do you think that would be enough? I can't risk it.

I don't know what caused it (I had a perfect upbringing with a family who loved me) or what stirred the initial bout of it, All know is I lost 10 years of my life. It all started with for some reason, Me thinking I had testicular cancer when I was 12. I didn't at all, I mistook my normal bodily development for cancer, and for nigh on a year, I was convinced. I was terrified to say anything to my parents since I didn't want to go through the horrifying experience of being diagnosed with Cancer. However one day I finally said it to my mother, Who explained to me what the hell was going on, Relieved, I thought it was all behind me. However I was left scarred by the experience, I was now terrified of getting cancer. To the point where I would check every inch of myself for lumps and bumps every day and freak out at the sign of one. At this stage I am about 13 and have zero knowledge of the actual workings of cancer, I just thought ""Lump = Cancer"". While I had pretty bad Hypochondria at this point, It had not developed to full blown anxiety yet.

So while living with hypochondria for about 2 years (And not telling anybody) I begin smoking weed at about the age of 15. This was ok for a while, However weed lead to doing harder drugs (I am not saying weed is a gateway drug, It's just my personal experience) One night while doing Extacy and Speed, I did way to much and overdosed. I ended up in the ER with a pulse of 190-210 BPM. I recovered pretty quick once the drugs got out of my system, However my parents and family were shell shocked, Until now they had no idea I did any of this. How does this tie into anxiety? This is the point where I feel full on ""free-floating"" anxiety. Otherwise known as GAD, This however, Wasn't the scariest thing about it, The scariest thing about it was the Depersonalization, If you are reading this and have felt it, You know all too well what I am talking about, However if you haven't, I could only describe it as living in an outer-body experience 24/7. I would not wish it on my worst enemy.

So now, At about the age of 16, I have full blown GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder) and Depersonalization/Derealization. Again, Telling nobody. I told nobody because At the time, I had no idea what I had was actually Anxiety, I thought I was going literally insane, And I didn't want to be an insane person, So I tried to ignore it. Ignoring it however, Did not work, At all. Before I was 17 I dropped out of school because I couldn't take the daily panic attacks. I must stress this; Anxiety is bad, Anxiety is one of the most horrible emotional mental conditions one can come down with. However, What increases a persons suffering ten-fold, Is having to hide it from everyone else. Making sure nobody else knows you're ""insane"" becomes your daily goal, And it is just awful.

So I drop out of school right before I hit 17. For the next 2 years I sit in my bedroom, Playing video games and pretending to myself I am ok. Here's an interesting little thing about anxiety, and one thing that made it a million times worse for myself. When you are anxiety prone, your mind races, You can't focus on anything, Even on an unconscious level. Your mind is so worn out it doesn't even form short term memory, This can be absolutely terrifying. Imagining behind so inside your own head thinking about something that worries you, anything, Then getting up to go to the bathroom, Coming back to your desk, sitting down, and having zero recollection that you even got up, Having to ask yourself ""Fuck, Did I even get up at all?"" Now imagine this 24/7. Anyways; I sit in my room for 2 years going deeper and deeper inside my own head and wrapping myself up. Then I made one of the best decisions of my life.

I decided to go back to school. I finally said ""Nope"" to my anxiety and went back to school to do my final year exams (Equivalent of the SAT's). It was an amazing thing, I finally had something else to focus on other than anxiety, all was well, I did my exams, got a mediocre results and was delighted. But that's not the end of the story, Not by a long shot. At this stage I am about 19, Pretty much anxiety free (However I still have a lot of avoidance habits from things that trigger it). I worked up the courage to tell my parents I had suffered with anxiety for the past few years, pretty much since I was 12. They weren't exactly surprised, They knew something was wrong since I stayed in my room for 2 years, However they never thought it was anxiety. They then asked did I want to see a shrink, I agreed, Since I wanted to know what caused it all, However as I didn't really suffer from it anymore, I didn't put much effort into the sessions and stopped going, Bad mistake.

Que act 3; Just before hitting 20. To this day I still have no idea how or why it happened, But it happened. My hypochondria came back in the form of being terrified of going blind. I had a pain in my eye one night and was convinced I HAD to have glaucoma, And I was about to go blind. I was brought to the emergency room (by my parents at 4am) where they told me to GTFO. Major setback, This opened the floodgates to my anxiety again. With the hypochondria back I know had free floating anxiety (GAD) again, Soon after followed the Depersonalization and Derealization. It got worse and worse, I have no idea why it was so much worse than before, But Jesus Christ - It was so much worse than before. This time I couldn't hide it, Because now I had developed full blown panic disorder (Random panic attacks for absolutely no reason, Different to Free floating Anxiety) My parents knew everything, They brought me to the doctor who put me on medication (Zoloft) - Worst thing to ever have happened to me.

So I began taking the anti-depressants. However they did not work, At all. See, As I told in a mental hospital (Will get to this part of the story in a minute), Anti-depressants should be prescribed very very carefully to someone with hypochondria, As the extreme side-effects can make things worse, As can they very medication itself cause panic attacks to get worse. This is exactly what happened to me. I rang my doctor every day asking what the hell this medication was doing to me. I would get extreme headaches, Dilated pupils, Extreme dry mouth, Couldn't get it up, Zero appetite (I lost 20 pounds). I doubt any of those things were going to kill me, However that is the exact opposite of what I thought at the time. So while on the Zoloft, And not getting better, I kept going to the emergency room for things I was ""dying"" from. Heart problems, Cancer, Eye problems, Anything That was wrong and I Googled pretty much left me in the emergency room. My doctor, Seeing no improvement, Finally suggested being committed. I refused, So she prescribed me Xanax. Till this point she was reluctant to prescribe me Xanax because she knows the addictive values of it for someone like me. But she finally caved. I was given a small dosage of Xanax to take when I have a panic attack. I also refused to continue taking the SSRI's, Which my doctor took as a big ""Fuck you"" and pretty much just give me a prescription every week from then.

Still, Things got worse and worse. Everyday was a living nightmare. Wake up, Realize I still have anxiety, Tell myself not to have anxiety, Have a panic attack, Take xanax, Be a zombie for a few hours, Medication wares off, Have another panic attack, Get about 3 hours of non-refreshing sleep. Rinse and repeat.

When I started using a week's worth of Xanax in a day, Things finally hit a head. My doctor refused to give me any more. So I acquired Valium through illegal means. I became addicted to Valium. Not because it made me high, But because it made me 'normal'. One morning I took way too much Valium, Went for a walk to a nearby lake, Contemplated suicide, decided against it. I returned home after being missing for a few hours, My parents searching for me all day and assuming the worst, had already decided I was going to be committed.

I got into the best Mental hospital in the country, St. Patricks. The only condition was I went in voluntary, So I could leave whenever I wanted. From the second I entered I wanted to leave, While it was a brilliant hospital, and the doctors were magnificent, I hated it. I hated being in the same place as other people who I deemed to be ""insane"" I hated being one of those people. After 3 weeks I decided to leave. I decided rather, To go there as an outpatient. I would travel 3 hours 3 times a week by train to go there for 6 hours a day. I didn't really get anything out of it, It was all just group sessions of explaining ""Flight vs Flight"" thought by people who had never had a panic attack in their lives.

However, Things finally started looking good. I was put onto a new way of thinking by a book (I don't know reddit's advertisement policy, so I won't mention it or the author by name unless I am allowed) This book was written by a guy who had anxiety for 6 years. He explained it simple, lay-mans ground level terms of why anxiety sufferers (me) feel how they feel and why. It explained how it doesn't matter ""Why"" all that matters is ""Now"". This might all seem very camp and new-agey, But it wasn't like that at all, It was just a down to earth explanation of anxiety by a guy who experienced it himself and overcame it. The biggest thing I had learned was a lot of anxiety boils down to ""What if's""

""What if my anxiety never goes away?"" ""What if I am actually going insane?"" ""What if I actually have a brain tumour"" etc.. I learned not to put any thought behind worries than began with ""What if"". See, Anxiety feeds on itself, Anxiety is a circle of Fear. If you stop feeding your anxiety, your stop having...anxiety about your anxiety (I can't seem to come with anything better than that, sorry lol) You have to learn to stand up up to your fears and realize, What you're afraid can't kill you, The fear of cancer isn't going to give you cancer, or something to that effect. Put yourself in horrible situations that arise your panic, Sit with it, You will realize you have nothing to be afraid of.

Anyways; Once I began thinking like this, Things got better, so much better. It wasn't a quick transition, By any means, It took well over 2 years, But one day, I woke up and realized...""Wait a second..I am not worrying about anything"" That is when you have truly beaten anxiety, When you forget you even had it in the first place, When it becomes an afterthought.

So I have droned on long enough now I think, These days, I own my own (thankfully successful) retail business, I am 100% independent and if you talked to me you would never even know any of this even happened, In fact, Not one of my friends or even my closest friends have any idea this has ever happened, A few of them are probably reading this right now.

I know how many I had taken , I keep track of my meds.

I only have two left, this bottle was supposed to last me a couple months. 

Why the fuck would anyone take someone's anxiety meds?
Up till now I haven't had a reason to not trust my coworkers.

 I've already eliminated a couple of the people who work the same shifts I do, due to various reasons of one person already has his one PRN klonopin, and he knows that if he was out of his stuff that he could just ask me and I would give him one if he needed it.

The other two I eliminated from the list of possible suspects, are friends of mine that I know really well and they know that my meds is what keeps me from being a basket case.

That leaves three others, one of them has been suspected in the past of taking things.

Im gonna bring it up to my manager, I'm also going to go buy a lock and keep my locker secure.

I had a girlfriend of 2 and a half years, I loved her more than even my family. I wanted to marry her after college, even though I knew there were problems. Hell, I knew she has had plenty of boyfriends in high school and she left a 3 year relationship and immediately started dating me (that's a big red flag that if I could make her leave a relationship, why couldn't anyone else). She even told me at one point early in the relationship testing me if I was serious about dating her that she has had plenty of boyfriends, but only one long term one, and she has never been dumped. I still wanted to be with her. She used to date jerks and ""bad boys"" and I was the first real nice guy she ever dated. I had anxiety during the relationship as I have been hurt before (and I was still really hurt by one girl which made me really confused about my feelings for my current girlfriend and whether I was over my past, I had a bad tendency to repress things when I was younger), and deep down I knew there were things wrong and I was scared of getting hurt, but she was beautiful, nerdy, and cute and I just fell in love with her. She was sheltered and when she got a job at a sleazy bar with a lot of skanky coworkers, she changed a lot. She wanted to just party and go out to bars all the time and she really just changed. I don't care much for bars at all, I saw it as a waste of money and I have been working and going to school, and balancing a relationship for 2 years and I was saving up a ton of money to move out of my house and possibly bring her with me. I wanted to move out because I was a selfish brat to my parents.



She started distancing herself from me a bit (and I was too, I didn't like her new trends as much but I still loved her so much that I figured it was a phase and we could work through everything) but at first we thought it was our bad work schedules. We both took a semester off of college. We both went to the same community college, I got my AA but she was just failing, since I got my AA in the fall semester and I was so burned out juggling getting great grades, working, and maintaining a relationship, I decided to take a semester off and transfer to a really nice university next fall (which has just started a few weeks ago) and she wanted a semester off to collect what she really wanted to do. I was amazing at saving money, and she had no budgeting skills whatsoever. I worked my hands to the bone saving money for the dream of us moving out and she wanted to just party. When I sensed the distancing between us, we thought it was because we couldn't see each other often because out work schedules did not align well. So I started going to her house after working a double shift just to make up for this and her parents tell me I can't come this late at night because I'm waking everyone up. I tried to solve the distancing problem, she never tried. Eventually it was hard to text her, ever call her, hell even skype was hard to get ahold of her sometimes. I figured she hated her phone and that was it. Well she got a new phone and nothing improved. I told her one night when I was really quiet and she asked if anything was wrong and I told her I felt like there was distance between us and it was scaring me. She told me ""Oh Saine, it's just our work schedules and we're so busy. I love you more than anything, and I'll always be there with you"". A month later she told me she wanted a break in the relationship.

I was panicking, I didn't want to lose her but she assured me she wasn't breaking up with me, she just wanted a break to think about things (in hindsight, I remember how I managed to get her as my boyfriend because she started liking me when she was on break with her last boyfriend). We had a big talk and she told me that she has always resented me for my anxiety at the beginning of the relationship when I was a bit confused. This was a shock, more than 2 years later and she admits she still can't trust me over that, I know grudges like that are a bad sign in a relationship. She said I was too nice, I never fought back too much, I only tried to make her happy and never argued that much(I treated her like a fucking princess, I bought her amazing presents, I bought her a fucking computer with my tax return from my minimum wage job for her birthday on our 2nd year). I didn't like arguing because I was sensitive to yelling from my childhood, I hated being yelled at and my dad would take his stress out on me. And most of all, she was tired of dealing with me when I was depressed/anxious. She later told me it hurt her seeing me like that when she loved me, but I couldn't believe it. I was doing so well with my anxiety that it wasnt an issue for literally a year, I just occasionally fell into deep depressions for a few days at a time. I was mad because I never complained when she complained about her job (the sleazy bar) and she never told me of a good day there. I listened to her problems every fucking day. I told her things, she said things, but everything seemed ok till she told me that someone at her work asked her out and she said maybe. She told me she was interested in him, and that I was a nice enough guy where I deserved to know. We both came to the decision that she probably was interested because we haven't been able to see each other lately and she wanted attention (yes, that was desperation in my mind). She was thinking of a break for possibly months, and asked if she could try dating people. I told her firmly that I could not handle that, I loved her so much, the fact that she even wanted to try dating other people killed a part of me. She told me that our relationship was serious and we were still young, and she wants to make sure she is going to be ok this relationship or if she'll regret not partying, being young and wild, etc... I was crushed, I wanted to marry her in a couple years, maybe when I got out of college, I knew she was doing so shitty in college but I didn't care, I'm studying computer networking, security, etc... and I was willing to support us both. I told her though, I don't know if I could forgive her if she ever dated someone while on our break, and she agreed and she reassured me she wasn't breaking up with me.



So the break started and I was having panic attacks, one of the big issues we were having was that I used to live in my parents basement where it was huge, private, had a bed, couches, room for computers (she would bring her desktop and we would LAN)... it was awesome. But around 2 years in the relationship, my parents forced me to move back upstairs because of concerns over mold. I hated it. She hated it. Not nearly as private, only room for a tv, one computer, and a bed. And her house was noisy with 2 younger brothers, and parents that worked odd hours and that were super protective. So yeah it was hard to see each other. I was panicking so bad that I had to do stuff 24/7, I did not want to lose her. I realized that I treated my family like shit the past few years, being selfish, I took care mostly of myself so I didn't want to help them with anything and I apologized from the heart and told them ""I have been a selfish horrible brat, and I really want to make this up to you guys"". I then every moment I had when I was not at work cleaning the basement to the point where it was immaculate. I couldn't live down there but we could still make it a hangout place. I did a ton of things for us including seeing my doctor, getting my medication increased/adjusted, and scheduled to start seeing a therapist. 



Half way through our 2 week break, we talked and I told her of all the things I was doing for us and she was so happy and told me how great that was. She was having a blast hanging with friends even though I was still panicking. I lost 17 pounds in less than 2 weeks. Only a few days later she texted me that she was ready to talk, I told her I would be home in 10 minutes but she said she might be leaving for the bar with her friends. WTF. She KNEW I was scared, anxious, and maybe not panicking but she rather let me know she was ready and let me hang there dying to find out her answer. This was the cruelest thing I could imagine. I race home and I call her on skype and got ahold of her. She broke up with me. She told me she didn't want to settle down in a serious relationship and she wanted to be fun and wild. She broke up with someone she cared about because she wanted to live the life that you see people live on tv, or the people that just want to party. She told me she also was losing interest in me for months, so that thing a month ago about “I’ll always be with you” was a complete lie. I was and still am heartbroken. I was a mess for a while as expected, and ironically enough, my first therapist session was scheduled the day after she broke up with me. I finally learned to appreciate my family, but I decided I still wanted to try and move out for college.

It's been 3 months since the breakup and I've been living in my apartment in the city for a month and a half. I was great for the first month. I still had pain for her whenever I thought of her, getting my apartment was bittersweet because I was dreaming of getting my apartment with her, but I was proud of myself. 

Now it's the present, this last week with the pressure of all the school work (5 classes and I'm working 15-20 hours a week), I suddenly had a massive meltdown. My pain for losing her now has been worse than when it first happened. I've been depressed for weeks, and the past week I've had anxiety so bad from trying to get over her, school, working, and the loneliness of living by yourself that I can barely function. I lived at my parents house last weekend, crying for 3 days straight, I felt like I was drowning.

A long story short, I’ve always been a anxious person. I just thought it was normal. I’ve been scared of sleeping, social situations, school and other things since I was about 11 years old. Recently my anxiety took a turn for the worse. I dropped out of college because of it (long story, won’t get into it now), and I’m scared of being outside after dark. It probably sounds stupid (atleast I feel really stupid), but I’m scared of being attacked and raped. I have never experienced anything like that in my life, so I have no reason to be scared of it. At least not as much as I am. But being outside after 7-8 pm makes me so incredibly anxious. The rare times I am, I guess my brain is in fight or flight mode: my breathing changes, I begin to panic, and I feel so unsafe. I feel 100% sure I’m going to get raped. I have talked a lot about it with my partner, who says the statistics for it to happen is insanely low, we live in a safe neighborhood and it’s only a five minute walk from the bus stop to our house. But I’m so, so scared. I can’t meet my friends after 8 because I’m scared to be outside, and I can’t work late shifts at work because of it. Three years ago I walked home from parties and clubbing, at 3-4 in the morning without a problem. But now I feel stuck inside my house at night because I’m scared.

I feel really embarrassed about this. I’m hoping the meds will help me somewhat, and I’m waiting for an appointment with a psychiatrist. 

Can anyone else relate to this? Will it get better?",['nsubj'],1
4071,4071,0.2072681941567144,0.7927318058432615,0.069,0.845,0.086,"I decided to describe what it's like to be me, an insane man.
On the outside, I project an image to be seen by others... A front to avoid the conversations and judgments that would go along with being seen as who I am.  Who I am is hard to explain but I will do my best to paint an image.

Have you ever felt like you left the stove on, door unlocked or windows unlocked after you got 30 minutes away from home?  Well that is one of the many feelings I have.  I could be sitting at home and feel like the stove was on, so I have to check and wiggle the knob then after resuming my previous activity I feel that me wiggling the knob somehow turned it back on, or me locking the front door could have wiggled it just right that the latch came undone.  This process happens to me countless times EVERY single night.  Over and over and over.  There are countless other things that I do.  This is not an O.C.D. that has to do with numbers, it happens until my wife wakes up and I can finally rest for a few hours knowing that she is there to make sure everything is OK.  Even then there are times where I can't find the will to sleep which leads me to my next wonderful issue... Schizophrenia/Psychosis call it what you will.  

Close your eyes imagine being in a football stadium THOUSANDS of voices screaming.  Well it's sort of like that in my head, but take away the voices and words.  It's a very difficult thing to describe.  I hear voices and other things yes, but I don't hear them in the same sense, there is too much going on for me to be able to listen to any one individually.  It's almost deafening.  While this is happening I have images that I can't get out of my head, sometimes atrocious things that nobody should ever see, sometimes it's shadows absorbing what they are touching making the shadows grow, shadowy figures that just watch me.  There is a lot more to those that I just can't even form words to describe.

Then there is Bi-Polar, that should be obvious to anyone I have ever known and anyone reading this.  I get completely random mood swings depending on what my brain is doing at that time like the flip of a switch and then I don't remember  With the things above it gives me social phobia which leads to my agoraphobia.  
Leaving the house for me is one of the worst thoughts to me.  How can I leave my house unattended with nobody to check the stove?  What if there is a spark in an outlet that sets the house on fire what if me turning off the light switch to leave produced some sort of spark that would also lead to a fire and what if the doors or windows are unlatched and someone breaks in.  Regardless of how many times I've been told that it's illogical, it is logical to me.  If I told you 1+1 = 3, you wouldn't believe it, In my mind it's the same thing.  
Now with all of the above going on in my worthless mind, what do you think the last 2 issues i'm going to tell you about are?  If you guessed anxiety disorder with panic attacks you were in fact right.  Who wouldn't have consistent anxiety with everything above?  I think this is the most normal part about me but at the same time it makes me the craziest.  I can never stop shaking my hands are so used to it I've become numb to the feeling and don't notice it anymore.  All of these issues have been developing in me my whole life.  It was not caused by one specific event.  

So far, countless medications, therapy and psychiatry haven't been able to fix me.  I accept that this is me.  I'm a person living in a world that I feel would be better off without him.  Why is someone who can't do anything allowed to live when so many better people have passed away.  The only reason I was able to write this was because I started it.  My O.C.D. produces manic episodes that won't allow me to stop something once I've started, the only thing that pulls me away from this is to check the things listed above (quite frequently actually).  I feel that if i don't complete it, my heart will actually stop. 
 I understand I have issues in my head, I mean how many people are afraid of certain fabrics?  I'm not in the dark about my issues.  I can be open about them online at least, for a little at least until the anxiety settles in.

Why am I writing this all down?  The answer is....just because.

I cannot remember the dosage because the pharmacy kept the script but did not have the amount I was given in stock until tomorrow. Looking for anyone who has taken it and how it affected them.**

Some background information: 

I am a 22 year old female in her 5th year in college. I have dealt with major depression my entire life and, in hindsight, mild anxiety that never caused much issue, as well as inattentive-type ADHD. 

Last fall, my anxiety became completely unbearable. My depression was worst when I was in my junior and senior years of high school (ages 16-17) but backed off a bit once I moved away from home (my mother and I get along well enough, but make awful roommates and were always at each others' throats as well as sibling issues that are another story for another time.) However, I'm not sure what exactly clicked in my head to set off so much anxiety, though I can pinpoint quite a bit to financial reasons and being a ridiculously broke college student that hates asking to borrow money.

I finally sought treatment after several full blown panic attacks, as well as constantly feeling nauseated and having chest pain. I used campus health services because it was free for me to use and much more convenient. The nurse practitioner I have been seeing for the last year has been great and actually seems like she genuinely cares. 

The first medication she gave me was Celexa (citalopram) at 20mg for depression and anxiety at the same time. Once it kicked in, it was fantastic. However, I have had issues with health insurance for the last year so I ran out in mid-June, I did not fill my script for a while, thinking the meds would cost me quite a bit because one pharmacy said it would be more. It ended up being around $15 for the month and I wanted to literally punch myself in the face for causing myself such agony for nearly 2 months. 

Backtracking a bit, I believe it was mid-spring when I started getting ""Jittery,"" for lack of a better word, with my anxiety again. The light shaky feeling of unease and nervousness. She upped my dose to 40mg of citalopram. This caused problems. Apparently I cannot have that much or I experience a rather rare side effect that even my FNP had never heard of anyone having: vivid dreams. I have never had a medical professional Google something directly in front of me, but she had to. I don't mean ""vivid"" as it colorful and easy to remember, I mean I lucid dreamt, which I have had happen very rarely before just for no reason and I hate it. I don't feel like I have slept at all when I lucid dream. The dreams were also so vivid that literally every person, place, and thing looked exactly as it should (we all know dreams distorted visuals, but you just ""know"" what they are) tot he point of distinctly hearing voices of those I know and they wore clothes I knew they owned. Because of this, when I woke up, I wasn't able to tell if I had actually had conversations with these people or not and instead of remembering the dreams as a vague recollection like I usually do, I remembered them as a full memory so I would reference the things I did with these people while in their company and they thought I went off the deep end because I literally could not tell they were not real experiences. 

So we backed that off real fast and I went back to being pretty okay. This fall, I am on academic probation from past mistakes and just being a very mediocre student. I work two jobs to afford the things I own (I own two horses and had to buy a newer used car in 2011 when mine died. Not entirely wise financial decisions, no, but those were my choices) and I thoroughly enjoy my jobs more than schoolwork. But I don't have many credits left and just want to finish. I have to get my GPA up (it is currently 1.94. Needs to be 2.0. Tell me about it) but I have been panicky again.

I went back to my NP and talked to her about it. I also have a prescription for 10mg of adderall. I'm a pretty small person, so I don't actually need much to help me concentrate. I have been taking it because it also calms me down when I am anxious; however, it suppresses my appetite to the point of not eating for an entire day and I lose a lot of weight. 

She gave me a script for Vistaril, which is apparently supposed to be an antihistamine, but helps for anxiety, so we're trying it out. The pharmacy was out of my dosage level, so I'll pick it up tomorrow. Just wondering if anyone had experience with it.

Sorry for the rant. I took adderall to help me study. It kicked it shortly after starting this and another side effect I suffer from that is not being able to shut up once I start talking (or typing) for a little while, hence the very stream-of-consciousness style this was blurted out in.

I was on Wellbutrin 300mg and Celexa 40mg, pretty high doses of each, so yeah, things were not pretty. The past year has without a doubt been the worst of my life. I never really experienced anxiety until going off my meds. I thought I was stable enough that I no longer needed them and was on the outs with my therapist and psychiatrist. Within that year I moved to a new city, dated someone while I was in a very dark place and then had my heart shattered. Now it feels my life is in total shambles. With no real purpose it has been difficult to make any decisions and my anxiety has a reset button each morning waking me up with a boulder on my chest and paralyzing thoughts. I started therapy about two months ago, immediately after my break up, and today I saw a very compassionate psychiatrist. Needless to say, I left with a prescription. Only 5mg Lexapro and low dose Xanax for emergencies. Although this year has been total agony, I'm skeptical about returning to an everyday SSRI.

Been awhile since I posted here but long story short about 3 years ago had a giant breakdown and got put on celexa to ease my crushing anxiety. My anxiety manifests from health related stuff so if I have a headache or am the least bit nauseas my mind will spiral down into a panic attack where I'm terrified to throw up and terrified of becoming anxious (cycle).
     Anyways, I was on the meds for about 8 months or so and when I felt strong enough and talked to my doctor about it, I weaned off and have been off meds ever since. Everything was great except for the occasional bump in the road the last few years. But about 2 months ago I had a really bad headache which lead to my first panic attack in years. And it's been all down hill ever since.
     I basically live with constant anxiety all day and fear that I'm gonna have a panic attack. My chest is tight, nausea, constant fear. I decided to go back on celexa because I could no longer live this way again. I'm about a week and a half into taking the meds and I've only gotten worse. I know the side effects are amplified the first few weeks and it takes a minimum of 2 weeks-month for the meds to do their job but I'm at the point now where I can't sleep and can't eat without gagging. Like I feel hungry and my stomach is growling and then I try to eat and struggle with every bite. 
    Basically I just need some encouragement that the medicine takes time and to stick with it and I will get past this terrible in between period. I'm so afraid about not getting better. To make matters worse I just got engaged and have not even been able to properly enjoy it due to this disease. I also have a trip coming up to see my family 7 hours away, which I'm sure isn't helping my condition.

It has helped alleviate most of the issues, but I have gained almost 30 lbs, lost my sex drive, and feel generally apathetic about everything.  

Tired of being overwieght, sexless, and feeling like a zombie, I went to the doctor last week, I said:

""I'm interested in lowering my dose, or ADDING Wellbutrin, or slowly switching over to JUST Wellbutrin. I know that Wellbutrin works well alongside SSRI's, and its not so bad with the weight gain and sexual side effects.""

Doctor jumped on the ""Lets reduce the dose"" idea. Wanted me to cut the 20mg dose down to 10mg daily for two weeks to see how I feel, instead of just adding Wellbutrin. I get it. Its better to take less meds than to take more if theyre unnecessary.

I've been taking the 10mg dose for 4 days now.

Ive gotten progressively more argumentative, cranky, snappy, overly sensitive, and I cried at least 4 times today. Tonight I cannot sleep. Laying in bed flopping around trying to get comfortable, getting hot flashes and feel extremely restless. Craving Diet Coke like my life depends on it. I cried when I realised it was too late to go to the drive-thru for a fountain coke. Random snippets of Katy Perry lyrics are racing through my head. I feel the urge to throw things. I feel like my sanity is just crashing down and I want to escape my own mind for some peace.

Is this normal?! Is this withdrawal? Is 4 days long enough to determine if this is how I will feel for the next two weeks? 

How long should I wait before I go back to the Dr. and tell her ""NO WAY, please put me back on the 20mg!""

Any experience, suggestions, tips, or calming words are most appreciated. Thanks.

**TLDR:** Taken 20mg Celexa for 2 years. I've experienced weight gain, sexual side effects, and lethargy/apathy, so I went to the doctor to get my meds adjusted or to add Wellbutrin. Taken 10mg Celexa for 4 days as a trial period, and I'm already losing my mind. Racing thoughts, crying, mood swings, restless, anxious. Is this normal? Withdrawal? What gives??

So today I had to work at my part time job at a fast food restaurant from 5 - 10 today (one of the better ones). I hate my job first of all. Dreading going to work builds up my anxiety slowly throughout the day and when I get there I'm like panicky and shaky and just on edge. I'm super clumsy and make lots of dumb mistakes and get embarrassed easily during this stage. I literally have to go to the back of the store where no one is sometimes and just breathe deep + drink some water. After about 30 min - an hr max I get comfortable and it wears off. AT this point I'm fine. I still make mistakes and get some anxiety if I'm on the front register (I think it has to do with a bund of people looking at me) but I dont get as irritated. Has anyone else experienced this? It really brings me down. I feel like I have no confidence I trip over my words when talking to coworkers/friends and feel embarrassed and think about it for a long time. Normally I can let things go easily and laugh it off but lately it's gotten bad. Would something like anti-anxiety meds help this? Is this something that I can work out easily by myself?

I'm currently in grad school and about half way through my program. Last semester I failed 2 classes. Rather than outright failing me, the professors were nice enough to give me an ""incomplete""and let me re-take the exams. 


I had quit my job in November to be ready for my exams in December and but I ended up failing 2 classes anyways. I felt like shit. I retook the the exam from Mrs. E in early March and I failed again, even after studying a shit ton for it. Dr. T told me to see him at the beginning of the Spring semester. The semester is over in 3 weeks and I still haven't seen him. I so horribly afraid of failing a 2nd time and having my financial aid taken away.


During my first round of studies I felt the normal anxiety that comes with prepping for exams. After the failures, I started being afraid of failing, so anxiety starting building up whenever I sat in front of my books. My symptoms went from being uncomfortable to having full blown sobbing sessions with my body trembling something awful. 

I'd sit in front of my text book and begin reading. My heart would begin to race. I felt light headed. My hands would begin to tremble, then came the shortness of breath. And finally, tears would fall on the pages before me.

What used to be my joy, the thing that also kept my curiosity going, now had me retreating to the opposite end of the room. I've had anxiety before this was by far the worst because its affects were destroying my grades. I recently came off financial aid probation and here I was back at square one. What if they take away my only source
 to pay for school, not to mention living expenses? 



It seemed that my only choice was to use medication to treat my symptoms. But I wasn't looking forward to that option. I was on anti-depressants for a short while a few years ago but I stopped taking them because I just didn't ""feel right"", you know what I mean?

And then I remembered Chinese medicine. If needles and herbs had 
helped my physical aches and pains, why wouldn't  it be able to treat this?

My first treatment gave me some relief. I felt relaxed and able to get to my regular duties.

It was the second treatment that really made a difference. After he inserted the needles and left the room, weird stuff started happening. I got really, really cold even thought I had two heat lamps on me. My body got waves of goosebumps, then I started sobbing like a child. The acupuncture points were helping me have an emotional release I was 
unable to have on my own. After the tears dried up, I felt calm. 
After laying there for 30minutes, he returned to remove the needles and I told him of my experience. He said it was a good sign and decided to give me some ""homework"".  I was given some herbs to make a tea that I was to drink and hour before bed time. He also told me to massage my kidneys for a few minutes and massage the point [Kidney 1](http://yinyanghouse.com/acupuncturepoints/kd1) right before bed.


The tea and massage are to help me wind down enough to fall and stay asleep (yes, I suffered from insomnia and waking up frequently during the night). The tea didn't taste was bad as I thought it would. It was sweet with a hint of bitterness at the end. The massaging wasn't so bad either, though I will admit that I cried the first two nights I massaged Kid 1. I wasn't crying because it was painful, I was having emotional releases.


The next day, I had a two hour study session that just flew by. I took a 30 minute break and then went back into it for another hour and 45minutes. Not a single tear was shed! I felt fantastic. My fear was nearly gone. It was more of an annoying sound in the back of my mind instead of the blaring monster that was freaking me out.


I had my reservations about using acupuncture for emotional issues because of studies saying it's a sham or the placebo affect.
I am my own proof that it helps. I went to the 3rd treatment earlier this week and discussed my progress. I was sleeping better, I actually had energy throughout the day, and most importantly, I was getting work done.

I have another 3 sessions left to help finish clear up stuff. I was advised to go in for occasional ""tune up"" if symptoms returned.


Chinese medicine isn't a cure all, but then again, nothing really is. I preferred having my qi moved around by needles and herbs instead of pills altering my bio-chemistry. I understand and am fully aware that medication is  necessary for some people (I prefer you to be alive &amp; medicated than be all dead). If my symptoms weren't improved or if they worsened I definitively would have taken medication.

I wanted to share my story since I know a lot of us are apprehensive about taking medication.


TL;DR Acupuncture is currently helping my anxiety. Yes, I know some of you of skeptical. But this is my story, not yours.","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1

I can barely move, and my throat feels like it closes up. Since I freeze up, I can't get up and take my medication, or get a drink of water, or anything. 

So this means I'm either left to wait it out or try to call for help, if anyone is home. Unfortunately, I can't even manage to make any sounds past quiet squeaking. I'm even unlucky enough to be a quiet crier, so that doesn't help.

Today my mother was just upstairs, and I even tried as hard as I could to throw a pillow to make any other kind of sound. Buuuut since I was curled up in a ball and shaking, I only managed to get it a metre or so away, and it just hit the floor. She came down to get something what seems like forever later, and was able to help, but still.

I hate how I can't do anything when I panic. I hate when I freeze up. I hate how my throat just tightens up and I can't scream for help. My medication was in the SAME ROOM. I just couldn't even get up to grab it.

I am now a sophomore in high school. Last summer I didn't even contact anyone I know for a solid two months. I was doing very well in school for the entirety of my freshman year but that all changed. Once I got back in school my anxiety level skyrocketed. I've never experienced anything like it before. It went from zero anxiety to thinking I'm going to die anxiety in the span of 24 hours. For the first semester of this year, I did pretty well. I even made honor roll with a 4.1 GPA. This year it's a different story. I'm falling behind severely. I have an F in a class that I could easily have an A in but I just don't do anything in it. I don't understand anything that's going on in my math or chemistry classes and I have a D in chemistry. I feel like I have to choose between having decent grades and having a social life, because I can't handle both. Even now, I'm putting off doing something that I had 2 weeks to do. I'm so overcome with anxiety that I can barely make it through the whole school day. My meds seem to wear off as soon as I get home and I usually end up doing little to no homework. I know I can't blame anxiety for all my problems, and some of the blame has to rest on me. I've always been a chronic procrastinator and I think I'm just lazy. I know I could be doing well, but even if I was, I think I would just be alone all the time. Thankfully my dad is understanding of my situation, but not the severity of it. I don't know how to put into words what I'm going through, and I know it isn't as bad as I think it is, but right now I have no fucking idea where to go. I'm always worrying about the future because of my bad grades and bad decisions and the fact that I only have one friend. I could always try to get my grades up, but I don't know where to start. Should I tell my teachers about my problems or would they just shrug it off and tell me that I need to do my work. I'm not special, so why should I get special treatment. I feel like I physically cannot bring myself to do my homework, so I keep putting it off and putting it off until it's too late. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to turn. I try to cover all this up as best I can, because I'm actually a well liked person, and I don't want this to change the way people see me. I've always been ""that weird funny guy."" I rarely exercise because when my heart rate elevates I begin to have massive amounts of anxiety. All I ever do is watch TV, browse the internet, and masturbate because those are the only things I'm good at. I'm so disorganized and I often forget about very important things. I don't know how I'm going to make it in the real world if I can't even handle high school. I don't want this to be normal. I want to go back to the way it was. When I was happy.

Anyway, the point of this is that I have been going well lately. I have removed all stress and problems from my life to help recover. I still get the small symtoms of anxiety regularly and and social situations are really hard still. but i have felt that i've been making progress.

Today, i had my first major panic attack in awhile. i had an interview this afternoon and was prepared and ready to tackle it. About an hour before (without thinking about the interview and absolutely no conscious stress or worry), i began shaking and feeling light headed. i thought i might of eaten something bad because i feeling nauseous. then i became really hot and sweaty, my heart started beating violently and my head felt like it was going to explode. i thought i was having a heart attack.

Now, I've dealt with my anxiety all my life. Before I started getting treated, I just thought it was apart of my life and dealt with it. I'm not new to panic attacks and always knew it was the anxiety. But this time I was actually worried about my health. I told my mum and wanted to tell her i thought i should see a doctor/go to hospital, but didn't because i didn't want to freak her out and i know panic attacks aren't harmful. but this felt different. It was so intense. And the interview was just a rountine interview that I have no problem with. I don't know why this brought on an attack.

I took my meds to try and calm down and tried meditating/breathing/muscle relaxing exercises which helped while I was doing it. But as soon as I finished the exercises, it was straight back. The meds did nothing except maybe relieve the shaking a little.

When I came home I was so exhausted I literally passed out not long after getting home.

I'm feeling really low tonight because I feel like I haven't made any progress. If anything, I've gone backwards. I'm getting worse. I have done so much to try and recover. I'm seeing therapists. I've changed my diet. I've given up caffeine and cigarettes. I've been doing exposure therapy and CBT. I'm talking a lot about it with family and friends.

I'm curious to know if my story sounds familiar to anyone else? I don't know what else to do and I've put so much effort into getting better, I'm starting to get tired of trying. ",['nsubj'],1

My fear of illness, disease, and death is consuming me entirely. I've been having lower back pain, abdominal pain, pelvic pain for the past 5 days (initially only pelvic, but now abdominal and the lower back pain is chronic), and as I go about my day, by the evening I'm quite accepting of any symptoms that I have remaining, realizing they are likely benign. After sleeping, the pain is the worst in the morning, my mind just calculates all the possibilities of what the symptoms can be -- cancer, referent pain from my kidneys. 

I'd say this all stems from my kidney condition.. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease at 18 and although it was really bad for a year, I was put on meds and it stabilized and jumped right back to normal. I've been stable, and the condition has been very mild according to the doctors for the past 8 years (and my kidney function is within normal range as tested 1.5 months ago), but I cant help but feel like things can drop at any moment, and I know how influential negative thinking, stress, and anxiety are on disease prognosis (especially autoimmune conditions). I feel like nobody can relate to me, and sympathy (""oh that sucks"", ""that must be hard"") just makes it worse because it confirms that I'm abnormal and unhealthy. 

I'm under a ridiculous amount of stress right now, exam period after a nine course semester in a medical grad program (audiology), living independently on the other side of the country from my family and primary support system. Before April of this year I forgot what it was like to experience anxiety, and had a lot of interest in medicine. Now all I see is disease everywhere, constantly learning about disease and illness at a time where my health anxiety is at it's peak. I know more about my condition, what tests results mean, what side effects medications have, risk factors -- the knowledge has fueled the fire for my anxiety, and I can longer just be ignorant. I hate myself for it.

I'm leaving to Japan to see my girlfriend in one week for a month, and I'm hoping that provides me the relief I have been looking for in the past 3 months. As soon as I come home, I know I have to see the specialist, and address these physical symptoms I've been experiencing as well. 

I just want to cry. I want to break down, and just let all of it out. I'm constantly thinking about death, what it's like, what will happen when I'm gone. I can't fathom the idea of not existing anymore, it's the most frightening thing imaginable, aside from perhaps approaching it in a state of suffering from a terminal illness.

I don't know. Sometimes I just want to off myself so I can save myself the suffering and just get it over with. I can't believe I'm even saying that, and I know I'll never do it. But living right now is miserable. It's not just anxiety, its depression. 25 mg of Paxil is not working, and it decided to stop working in August when I upped the dose to 20 mg then 25 mg with no change. Ativan brings me back to a normal baseline, but the effects are transient, and the last thing I need is another drug to be dependant on.

Psychiatrists are booked up here in Vancouver, and I'm only here for another week. Meditation can help to relax me, and I've been really interested in the mind-over-body healing stuff, but the videos they have on youtube aren't always helpful - only because some of the terminology and descriptions they use just go against the science that I've learned. I'm looking more into faith, but I'm skeptic about everything (which is why I can't even acknowledge that I'm perfectly fine), so I dont know how I would ever wholeheartedly belief in a religion. I just want a cure, I want help. At least to put my mind at ease, to allow me to live a normal, fulfilling life like I did for the past 8 years. A stable mind is a stable body, I know that. But this anxiety just makes me stressed out every day and I feel like I'm just killing myself more and more because of it. And I cant even control it...

I've been on all sorts of medications, I'm no stranger to my doctor. At 30 years old this is literally crippling me. Sometimes I would rather just not be alive because dealing with this is nasty.

I've smoked cannabis for the past year, it was the only thing that worked after my meds stopped working. Previous to that I had Testicle Cancer. I became dependant on cannabis and smoke way too much. An unhealthy amount. I can spend £200+ a week on cannabis.

But it helped me. Now it doesn't.

I stopped smoking it today, for good. I had a joint earlier, but I am determined that was my last one. I have no money for no more, and I want to ride out this storm and get my head back to normal.

The past few months I have been housebound much of the time. Content smoking weed, sitting on the bed with the laptop. But this too caused problems.

I've lost weight. Non of my jeans fit me. I don't eat much when I smoke because I've had a fear of choking from birth. I feel sick a lot because anxiety causes me to suck my stomach in constantly.

Today I left the house to go for a walk. I didn't feel too good before leaving. I could feel that cement feeling in the pit of my stomach and my mind was racing thinking ""What if I need food on my walk, I have no money to buy any"". Or ""What if I dont feel good and I'm too far from the home"".

I done the walk, but under extreme anxiety. I had to go home towards the end, but my partner stayed with the dogs. It causes problems in my relationship because when I'm out I sometimes don't feel good and I need to ""escape"" the situation. The only place I feel ""safe"" is my home.

When I'm out the house it's horrible for me to deal with. I will almost always have an elevated heart rate, then the tiredness will kick in and progresses into a full panic attack. If it's hot outside then it's even harder because heat makes everything feel so much worse. I read something about the UV rays from the sun triggering attacks, the same as florescent lights in a supermarket (which are problematic for me).

I used to be able to hide attacks, but now they feel stronger and I can't cope with them when they happen. Except of course to go back to the house. 15 minutes after being in the house I'm normal again. Go figure :S

I've had enough of this. 12 years! I'm on ESA because I can't work. I can't even build a career in my area of expertise because I find it so hard with anxiety to do anything.

It feels like there is no hope. I'm sick of feeling tiered, and sick all the time. There's only so much I can take before it starts effected everything else in life. It always ends in some horrible bout of depression.

Please, I'm seeking advice. What can I do here? I feel alone, I feel like nobody truly understands what it feels like to be that scared of leaving your own home.

And I know it's going to be even harder these coming days because I've made a decision to stop smoking cannabis (and tobacco).

I want to enjoy the last 20 years of my life (I expect to live to 50, anything more is a bonus). I want to see the world, with my family. I want to get a job to support my family, and be the man of the house. It's degrading to be put in this position.

I never really understood why I felt like a ton of bricks were weighing down on my chest, but now that I'm older I realized I had anxiety attacks almost everyday when I was little. 

I don't know how it all started, all I knew is that I had to force myself to worry about something all the time or else I didn't feel right. I vividly remember having panic attacks where I felt like I was dying and then for about 6 years I didn't have them anymore. Now they are worse than ever! On average I'll have an anxiety attack 5 times a day, usually it's out of no where. I've been lying to myself saying I don't know what causes them, but I'm ready to admit that I have an intense fear of death and eternity. It freaks me the hell out and I really don't know why. 

I was raised Catholic, went to private school, church every Sunday. I remember having religion classes everyday and I never had a problem going to church, until they started talking about death. I remember thinking that at any given time I was going to die for no reason. I stopped sleeping because I thought I'd die in my sleep, I couldn't get a shower because I thought something was going to happen I had to start taking baths again. 

Now that I'm older and understand them more I can control my compulsions that I have, but I still can't control the attack. I have insomnia, ocd, paranoia, hypochondria, and an elevated heart rate all due to my anxiety. 

I'm afraid to do anything about because I'm afraid of being judged as having a mental disorder. I'm afraid to talk to family about it because I don't want to stand out. I already feel like everyone I meet can tell right away so I've become extremely introverted. I never really had social anxiety until recently. 

I'm tired of living in constant fear of the unknown, but I'm also afraid that getting prescribed a medication will change my personality. I don't want to feel doped up and spaced out, but I honestly can't handle this anxiety on my own. I need help and I'm too afraid to seek it.

I was reluctant to start on medication because I really want to try to use coping strategies to deal with my anxiety like exercising and eating healthy, focusing on positive thought processes, etc.  At any rate, I went to my doctor (PCP) to talk to him about what I've been trying to do and the frequent worrying and freaking out moments.  

The trigger seems to be a job that I'm stuck in--teaching high school--that I can't stand, but am committed to until mid-May.  I have a job interview scheduled for this Friday that has also added to the anxiety.  It is irritating because I know that some of what I'm worrying about is ridiculously irrational, but I can't stop it.  

So, that gets me to the Effexor XR.  My doctor has me taking 37.5mg for four days and then moving up to 75mg.  I go back in two weeks to meet with him. It is basically to help me get through the next 5 months of teaching. I took my second 37.5mg last night and this morning I woke up panicked and couldn't fall asleep.  I think my heart is beating a little faster than normal too.  When I am up and about, I feel a fuzziness--kinda hard to describe.  I'm slightly tired and just sort of--blah.  

At this point, I'm not sure what is the medication and what is the anxiety morphing into depression (typically the cycle for me).  Has anyone taken Effexor XR before?  Do these feelings go away if I stick with it or is it something I need to just deal with and it will be worth it?  I do know that getting off of the Effexor is basically hell, too.  

TL;DR I just started taking Effexor XR to help me deal with job related anxiety, does it take a while to actually adjust to it or is this something that I need to figure out how to deal with if I'm going to stay on it?    ",['nsubj'],1

It seems that in the past I've just managed it somehow, but the place I've been working at for a year now has made it impossible to ignore. At first I believed those close to me who told me it would be good for me and I would learn to adapt and be better off in the end, but after a year it's becoming clear that things are not getting better. In fact, they've gotten worse, and I feel more isolated at work.

My work's office is in a large open space (there's nothing resembling a cubicle). When I was interviewing for this job and when I first started I thought it looked nice and that it wouldn't bother me. I had no idea this environment would be incredibly draining, more so than grocery shopping (which was the previous worse for me), so at the end of the day I feel like I've worked three times as long as I have. If you don't have this type of anxiety it may be hard to understand, but it's like working in a server room full of loud fans and feeling the electricity and at the same time eyes watching you from everywhere, and what exhausts you is not just the tension but the intense effort to keep it together because you feel like everyone's watching or will be at a moment's notice. This feeling in particular is what I'm hoping medication can help with.

Also, my work is at a media/tech company, so it's very social. When I first started it was pretty welcoming and I had lunch with people and the whole atmosphere was fun. This is usually where I'd start managing my feelings. I would start to feel like I was part of a small group and gradually feel safe and open up. But the group never felt smaller even if I only talked to and had lunch with the same people. There are so many people there, and my position is such that I don't really work closely with anyone. So I just started to shut down to the point that lunches were stressful to me. I would think, Okay, is this the day I'll actually say more than a few sentences? Each day I didn't made things worse. I would especially feel horrible if the conversation moved to a topic that interested me and I could contribute to. For the last 4 months I've been eating lunch at my desk or going home to eat. I just couldn't take it anymore.

So basically I've had this ""deer caught in the headlights"" thing going for a year. I can work but I can't do much else. I don't even like talking too loud at my desk because I feel surrounded (as I described). In fact one of the worse things I can do has already happened. A co-worker asked me what I was doing as in what's up, and I just said I'm working, but I must have sounded annoyed or hostile because she just shook her head and has acted totally different with me ever since. I really was just trying to say, nothing only working, because it's hard to say anything else. I think she told others how she perceived I acted too. It's sad because she was one of my favorites there. I realize now that being guarded and even snapping at people is one of my go to moves to deal with anxiety.

Also, just this morning I was standing next to someone who was getting into the first-aid because she had a minor cut from the printer or copier and instead of helping her by saying she needed to clean it first, my mind went totally blank and I just left when I was done with my routine. It didn't help that she's ""the"" hot girl of the office, but I've actually said a few words to her before when I felt like less of a social failure there, and of course, it's not about that. It's just about friendly advice. So now this state I'm in is making me a bad person, or at least perceived as a bad person or someone who wants to be left alone when I don't.

So I'm asking about medication because it's all new to me. I grew up in sort of a blue collar background. Not only do I fear psychiatrists, but I don't visit doctors much in general. So at this point it's just unfamiliar territory. 

So it'd be great to hear from anyone with insight or experience, so I can begin to make the steps to talk with a professional about this. I realize medication is perhaps too easy a solution but I think with some of my issues it could be just the help I need.",['nsubj'],1

A while ago I wrote a post about how I finally gave in and started taking Citalopram. This my update after 8 weeks.

I take 20mg (one tablet) every morning. The phase of side effects was very managable. I got pretty much all common side effects but almost all have gone. The only thing remaining is the yawning all the time, sexual problems (I pretty much have no libido anymore) and I think I may have sleeping issues due to the meds.

Do the meds help? I'm not so sure. What I noticed is that it stabilized my mood. Even on days where everyone can kiss my ass and I sleep till 3pm, I get up but don't feel the usual self-hate, no feeling of ""god damnit another fucked up day"" anymore. I just don't give a shit, so even if things look grim, I'm not in a bad mood. That doesn't mean am happy-on-drugs and psyched, I just don't slip into the lows so much, which is a good thing.

Does it help with the anxiety? It should as Citalopram is anxiolytic meaning it should resolve/ease the anxiety. I'm not really sure it does. According to my therapist, this may be a sign it's not working as after 8 weeks you definitely should feel a change. As an example, it took all my willpower to go get a haircut two days ago. I only managed to get my hair cut because noone was there so I didn't have to wait and sit down, or else I would've bailed, so I guess it's not working as supposed. Going to the doc soon to see if I need to up my dosage or possibly switch medication (oh boy...).

Regarding the therapist:

I was incredibly lucky to find a therapist that does behavioural therapy as well as depth psychology (the classic  ""is your childhood responsible for all that"" basically). So far I have been in 4 or 5 sessions and while I think the guy may be solid, I didn't get any solid advice so far. Mostly, I talk about how I've been doing, then we talk about certain problems, but the feedback so far has been pretty much useless and for my taste way too much esoteric. I hate it. I want a solid plan on how to tackle my misguided thoughts, I don't want to ""feel the energy of the room"" or something like that, it won't help me buy bread and it won't help my manage 8 hours of work.

Luckily my boss is very considerate and I've been working half-days for a few weeks. It helps a lot, but it helps by removing stressful situations. I don't think I got any better, I just don't have to power through 8 hours now. I'm pretty sure working full days would easily result in the same issues I had when I worked full days.

So to summarize: The meds probably aren't working as intended, and I'm not sure my therapist is the right guy for me. Luckily, the meds seem to stabilize my mood or I'm pretty sure I'd be in another big low.

Thoughts and comments much appreciated!

I've always been quite an anxious person, but recent stresses have completely overwhelmed me to the point where I get panic attacks weekly.  I've always been good at putting on the happy face, even in the times when I am most stressed.  I've also always been a pretty private person, and hate talking with people about emotions because I don't want to be a burden or make anyone worried about something that doesn't need to bother them.  Over this past weekend, my emotions finally erupted when my boyfriend was with me, and I had the ultimate breakdown.  I explained how anxious I have been and how I try to be as happy as possible, but that I needed help to get back to the real me.  I made an appointment and got in to see someone today.  The appointment was completely overwhelming, and I left a wreck.  The doctor prescribed xanax and celexa to help me start to cope with my anxiety.  



My boyfriend came over tonight after the appointment and we talked about what happened.  I finally got to telling him that the doc prescribed me the meds, and that I was still trying to decide whether to fill them or not.  The first thing out of his mouth was ""Don't you dare!!"", which was closely followed by ""I think you are strong enough to deal with this without meds"".  His body language completely changed.  It was like he was judging me for entertaining the idea that I might need medicinal help for my problems.  We talked about it more, and eventually he explained that he has loved the person I have been throughout the relationship, and doesn't want that to change due to the meds.  Part of me thinks he is being selfish.  While I understand his concern, after the experience I had today (finally trying to open up to someone about my anxiety, crying in front of a stranger for the first time, being prescribed medication for a disorder I have actively tried to hide from everyone, etc, etc, etc) it was not what I wanted or needed to hear.  I just wanted him to tell me that he will support and love me no matter what decision I make.  Now I feel like if I fill the rx and start the meds, he will think I'm weak, or that I failed somehow, and eventually start to resent me.  
                                                                                                                                 
I just don't know what to do.  The one person in the world who I thought would fully support and love me no matter what is judging me for something that is supposed to help make me feel better.  Don't get me wrong, I have my own concerns about starting medication.  But at the same time, I live with this crushing anxiety constantly....something's gotta give eventually, and if the medication can help with that, what is the big deal?

So, what do I do?  I feel judged.  If the shoe was on the other foot, I would put my opinions aside and give myself 100% to him, whenever he needed it to help him through this hard time.  I don't mind that he wanted to share his opinion, but later on in the conversation I brought it back up and said that I was worried that he would think I wasn't strong enough if I decided to take the meds due to his prior comments.  I asked him if that was indeed what he meant, and his response was ""I don't know"".  

Please, r/anxiety, I need your help!

TL;DR:  Was prescribed xanax and celexa at counseling appointment, told boyfriend, he said if I take it, it means I'm not strong enough to fight this on my own and that he disapproves of it. I feel completely judged and even more alone. What do I do?

I woke up every morning with the fear of another attack and always felt right on the verge of one. I flew home to be with family and recover until the meds I was prescribed kicked in.

Unfortunately, whenever I start meds like this, they usually give me vivid dreams. I was on Cymbalta, but was allergic to something in it and when I started I did have a couple of odd dreams the first day. UNFORTUNATELY my Celexa dreams are dealing with my PTSD from doing drugs.

I woke up today in chills, afraid, thinking something bad was going to happen. I don't want to lose reality and I'm trying my hardest to ground myself and tell myself that that was then and this is now. It's exhausting to the point where I gave myself an extra 5 hour nap. 

I texted my therapist, hoping to be able to see her tomorrow but she's unavailable. She told me to hang on for an extra day and I will feel better. I did the crisis text like and it helped a little to talk to somebody instead of keeping it in. I wanted to tell my partner about it, but I didn't want to worry them. I took a 1/4th of a xanax pill, which made me take the nap, good thing was this nap had nothing too scary.

Do I continue taking my Celexa? Hopefully it'll get better?? I don't know. Has anybody else had problems like this?

I might go to my aunt's house and spend a couple of days there until the nightmares subside and my body gets used to the pill. My partner won't like it, but it's helped me feel safer in the past for a couple of reasons: if ANYTHING goes wrong for whatever reason, my aunt has a car. She's been on antidepressants before and knows how bad the first weeks can be. Prepared food, if my partner isn't home, my self care depletes and I end up barely eating for a couple of days, which makes me more anxious because I start getting concerned of my health. Only temporary until the meds kick in. Thoughts? I know, this isn't originally what I asked, but it's related.

Lots of headaches, some panic attacks, depression, and just over all chaos. That was a year ago, now I'm much better but still have anxiety left over. I'm more sensitive to things I used to be able to do with no problem. For example, sitting in class sometimes is hard cause my vision will blur and things in my view start to change shapes and in a sense I hallucinate. Its worth noting I took acid once too. Anyways, I also told him how I have an irrational fear of aliens since I was little, something that affects me daily and makes sleeping hard. 

Well after a year of trying to get better naturally, even seeing a psychiatrist, I decided to go to the doctor. He did basic motor skills tests and concluded that I was fine biologically, which is hard for me to believe but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. He then gave me an anxiety test and flat out said that I have anxiety disorder. He said he wanted to put me on Prozac, which I have no idea wtf that does and am scared of taking it and having it fucked something up. 

I never thought I'd be one of those ""people"" on pills which makes me feel pretty ashamed and embarrassed about it. Since I'm in college the doctor said the medicine is extremely cheap if I try it. I asked my psychiatrist about this and he was kinda mixed but asked me try it out. I honestly don't even now wtf to do or feel now. It's so stressful dealing with this, and I just want some people there and some feedback. Like what does prozac do? Can it hurt me biologically? What does it put me at risk for if I take it?

At the beginning of this school year, I realized that my stress issues with school went deeper than I previously thought when I fell into a pretty nasty depression. I couldn't do school work (or even attend school), hang out with friends, or go a full day without having to calm myself down from a panic attack. I was in a bad place. 

I tried my best to explain what I was feeling to my parents, and they were very understanding. My mother worked with me to drop band (which I was certain was causing most of my stress), took me to a doctor to get medicine, and helped set up therapy (first real session tomorrow). My calculus teacher has also been extremely kind. She's given me every opportunity to turn in work late at no grade deduction.

I've been on Zoloft since then (up to 100mg now) and my overall mood has gotten much better. However, I still find it nearly impossible to go to school or even do homework.

I've been off of work on paid leave for several weeks for a minor surgery. Before taking off work for this, I had really bad experiences at work that I'm afraid have catalyzed my constant low level of anxiety from before into a miserable condition.

A few months ago, there was a big meeting where many people showed up where I work as well as many higher level executives to watch a major company executive speak. For some reason I had this background anxiety building all day up until that point, though I was feeling fine for the most part. Then, in the middle of this meeting where I could have so easily sat through it passively and calmly, I started suffering the first panic attack of my life. I got really nervous about simply having to be composed in a room full of so many important people in the corporate environment (this is my first full time job out of school). This nervousness spiraled into a full heart-palpitating experience of de-realization where I feared people around me would notice something wrong with me, should they notice me sweating or my body trembling from the massive heart pumps. This feedback loop was awful, but despite feeling like reality was melting away in a way I can't truly describe, I managed with every ounce of will that I had to keep it together and not make a scene until I could eventually fade away.

More recently I found myself giving a presentation about a large project of mine to others in my department as well as members of management. I had always been able to shine in presentations before, but this time it felt different. Being put on the spot in a scenario where for the first time in my life I felt I HAD to perform for my very survival really got to me and I began suffering another major panic episode mid-presentation. All the signs of nervousness must have rang clear to everyone in the room, making it feel horrendously awkward. Somehow I managed through sheer will to keep somewhat composed and finish delivering the presentation. Strangely, I have had smaller meetings and conversations with everyone involved comfortably, but having to give a dry presentation to them all at once just couldn't go well for me.

Shortly after this I was off work, a leave I was looking forward to in a weird way as relief from this, and from the small world of the workplace rendered awkward now that my anxiety finally manifested itself to others. The weird thing is the thought of eventually going back to work was bothering almost the whole time off. Here I am now on my last day off, terrified of a situation that I know is all in my head. I have begun seeing a therapist for a couple of appointments now but I'm not sure if they are the right fit for me. At their recommendation I am seeing a psychiatrist relatively soon to hopefully get a prescription for a beta blocker. However I fear still having to face up to the same situations again until I can get my hands on some short-term relief, my anxiety having become more generalized to being at work in general. I also fear how medication might affect me as well as the social repercussions surrounding it.

Sorry for the huge rant, but typing this all out helps get a load off my chest for now. I would love to hear from anyone who has gone through something even remotely similar to this and offer any advice in return!",['nsubj'],1

Just a few questions 

1. Is the medication controlling in anyway, do you not feel your self after taking them, does it hold back your emotions?

2. Is it hard to come off of, like any withdrawal affects of not taking it after a while?

3. What are some good prescriptions ( I know different prescriptions work on different people but atleast I can have an idea on where to start)?

4. Would you recommend medicine or therapy?

I'm constantly afraid that the lady I love may just up and leave me (for no good reason). I concoct scenerios in my head which just are not realistic at all.

I work in a high stress job, providing help to the homeless, and being a case manager for those with mental disabilities. This is verys tressful, and I've done it for years without issue, but lately when I come home, it's like a pressure valve coming off and I freak out, get super anxious, and become paralyzed with fear. Like I can fake it through the day, but when I get home, to my safe spot, I have to freak out over every little thing... And beating myself up all the time.. Hating myself for the little things I screwed up, or the big things I cant face. Sounds pretty nuts :/

But, I decided to see a doctor, I dont want to lose my wonderful relationship, and I dont want to treat myself badly anymore..

Typical banter and jokes amongst friends and co-workers about being a plant from the NSA etc, I work in IT so that's all highly relevant. But I'm catching myself having thoughts along the lines of 'what if it's true and they're out to get me' and I sort of go into this spiral of what they're after and how they'll get me. After realizing what I'm thinking of I can rationalize the thought away by logical reasoning, but the brief feeling like there's some sort of conspiracy against me is quite real.

Almost every time when watching any movie I feel like there's some sort of indoctrination going on, like the movie has some sort of custom tailored message for me and it's trying to tell me something important. I've freaked out internally a couple of times, but not visibly to any of my friends and again can sort of reason my way back to sanity. There was one time when watching the season finale of Archer, Lana had said something to Archer and there was a ringing sound as the scene closed in on his face. Immediately after that he asks if he had just woken up from a coma after drowning, and at that point I was pretty sure I was having a full blown panic attack with hyperventilating and feeling really cold. I had to go to bed after that (playing it off as I'm just tired to my roommates). I was thinking that was somehow a metaphor for me actually being in a coma and was about to wake up from it.

This is probably the worst one and may even be the cause of all of this, but I had a bad acid trip about a year ago where I thought one of my friends was an alien/Illuminati/whatever and was trying to kill me. I was embarrassed that I thought this way but was so sure he was out to get me, so I just tried avoiding him the whole time. I just attributed this to the drugs afterwards and confided in him how I felt, but even afterwards there's just this weird lingering feeling of paranoia even if I can put it aside as completely absurd. 

I can't really tell if it's getting better or worse, sometimes I'll have good days and sometimes not so much and I'll have to just pokerface through it because I'm at work. I've thought about seeing professional help, but I'm really put off by the idea of paying someone to listen to me and it seems impersonal. Rx medicine also scares me just because I tend to be somewhat of a naturalist I guess. Don't get me wrong, it's great if it works for you. I'm just afraid of messing around with my brain chemistry after hearing so many horror stories of big pharma and shit, not to mention how awful the state of mental healthcare is at the moment. In thinking about it I guess it's fucked up that I would trust a mysterious drug on a tab of paper more than a doctor's prescription. But since then I haven't really messed with any hallucinogens out of fear of my mental state. I also have been smoking pot almost daily for the last 3.5 years, I had decided I need to cut that shit out thinking I'm just fucking up my dopamine receptors. It's only been a week since I've stopped but I think it's helping, I also want to quit caffeine and just do a ""restart"" with exogenous drugs overall. 

I guess I'm asking for anecdotes or just advice in general, if any of you have felt this way I'd just like to know I'm not alone.",['nsubj'],1

I'm a 22 year old male who has recently gotten off bed rest for a year due to some heart complications. (Nothing fatal, all is well now). During said bed rest I was unable to drive, work, or go to school. My SO was extremely supportive along with my family during this time. I've been off bed rest for about 6 months now and have went back to school and been putting in applications, etc. etc. However, whenever I drive I feel like I'm being pumped full of adrenaline. This also happens when I'm doing mundane things out in public such as waiting in line, grocery shopping, and other mundane things. My cardiologist assures me it isn't my heart and agrees that it's probably mild anxiety. It comes and goes because some days I can do whatever without worry but when the days are bad, I basically prefer staying inside, it acts up at home anyway sometimes. Unfortunately, this is affecting my SO and I's date life. She's still supportive but it's embarrassing and annoying for both of us. Does anybody have any tips on how to overcome this? It's getting better with time in steps, so I don't believe medication/therapy are necessary for me (NOT knocking either in any way!) Thanks very much!

My PCP has ruled out any physical issues and thinks it's related to my anxiety.  I have a prescription for Lexapro, but I've been too stubborn to start taking it.  Mostly, I'm afraid of the effect it will have on my social life since I will have to cut back on drinking alcohol. 

But I will randomly, and without warning, get extremely nauseous.  Seems to happen a few days per week.  Some days it's almost to the point where I think I'm going to vomit, but I never do.  It's distressing though, because I never know when it's going to happen. 

So what I guess I'm asking is - has anyone had nausea as their primary symptom from having anxiety?  Did meds work?

Heart was racing, and I *knew* I was dying. I knew I was having a panic attack from hell, but I also thought maybe this time it really was a heart attack. So I saw my husband, lit a cigarette and splashed cold water on my face, **took 1mg Ativan**, and paced while trying to tell him I was having a panic attack. While he was talking calmly to me, shit got worse: thought the cigarette had given me lung cancer, so I threw it in the sink and took a hit off the inhaler I got for pneumonia in May; then figured the lung problem had caused heart disease (of course) so I took an aspirin to thin my blood. Husband (who's used to this now) kept on with the, ""Calm yourself down, you'll be fine."" I tried, and by then 15 minutes had passed, I had an Ativan in me (and an aspirin to thin my blood), so I went outside with him for a walk, thinking to let the meds work.

* (You know if you can do all this stuff, you're not dying. I *knew* I wasn't. ...But it still felt like I was!) The outside heat got to me and I thought I'd drown in the humidity, so I made my way back in, panicking that I'd fall down before getting to the door (but ""trying to calm myself down"" — DID not work.) **Took another Ativan** at the half-hour mark because my heart racing hadn't slowed down at all but had actually gotten worse! Thanks Ativan for not working! (Aargh!)

* Five or ten minutes later, decided to do what I'd wanted to do all along: get to the ER quick before I died! So husband agreed (rather, resigned himself to another ER trip for panic) — again, I couldn't really speak well, much less articulate my thoughts, given the shortness of breath (which as soon as I realized I had shortness of breath, it made my panic even worse!).

* I've done this countless times before: just driving to the hospital helps. I figure it's because it's a 15 minute drive, and just the fact that I lived that 15 minutes shows I don't need to go in and spend hundreds of dollars for another Ativan. And usually just feeling like I going to get help helps; sitting outside the hospital ER helps. I rarely go in anymore; just relax while I'm parked outside, knowing I could get help in seconds if needed.

* So an HOUR into the hella panic attack, we pass the hospital and head by home [at my request]: my heart was *still* racing, but now more intermittently (not constant), and I was feeling better. I cursed the Ativan because 2mg did *nothing*?! —tolerance, I suppose. And maybe 2mg did *something*, since I'm sitting here now, an hour-and-a-half later, finally calming down.

I don't have these HUGE panic attacks that often anymore since I'm medicated (3x/day Ativan no matter what; plus 1mg as needed), but when I do, the panic attacks are doozies. The Ativan used to help. But now 2 Ativans didn't help, at least not for an hour.

I feel so screwed. Since when do benzos not help? (Or take an hour to help). I swear when I first started having panic attacks, they helped instantly with an ativan under the tongue. They had to updose me every year, but I got therapy and got released because I hadn't had any panic attacks in years (thanks to Ativan I guess), but therapist gave me ""tools"" (splashing water on my face; etc).

Btw, yes I asked for propanolol as someone here suggested, but pDoc said no because it causes depression (???), and I have an Rx waiting for me for Nadolol instead. My husband's picking it up now. This heart racing thing blows the big one.

TEMPTED to try Paxil or one of the ssris that don't make anxiety worse. ...no, what I'm really tempted to ask for is some straight-up sedatives. Note: I don't have ""anxiety"" unless I'm having a panic attack, but just to stop oncoming panic attacks would be nice.

An hour+ full-on panic attack is just no way to live. Especially when you don't know they're coming on (I used to get ""signs"", like numb hands, that told me to take the Ativan; now, it's just a big surprise with no warning.)

**EDIT:** Shrink put me on a beta blocker twice a day for the palpitations, which works, but I still have an overriding 'anxiety' that makes me lightheaded (and scared of another panic attack). Went to doctor and my heart/lungs checked out fine (aargh!), but he thought I'd developed a new ulcer and put me on a second ulcer med (pantoprazole or something). I'm going to ask shrink for xanax (instead of ativan) and maybe some prozacs or lexapros.",['nsubj'],1

Hubs was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis a couple of months ago. He has good days and bad days and I feel like tonight is not a good one. He has been up and down to the bathroom so many times. 


I can't stop worrying. He has to go to work today. What if he can't find a bathroom in time?  What if the medicine never works completely and this is his life?  Will we ever get back to normal?  And what if he keeps bleeding when he goes to the bathroom?  How can I let him leave the house if I don't know where the next bathroom will be?  One of the times he got up tonight I asked him how achy he was...his knees are hurting. Because it is an autoimmune disease it is a good indicator of how bad the next couple of days will be.  I thought we made the right food decisions this weekend, but we clearly didn't. 


The more I think and worry obviously, the worse the anxiety is. The worse the anxiety gets the longer it stays around because I can't find a time to relax enough where my level is at zero.   I feel like I'm starting every day at a level of four and then it only goes higher later. 


The more anxious I get the more I have issues with germs. I'm already scared of our smoke alarm going off and it makes me nervous if we cook something smokey, but today was SO bad I literally sat in the floor of the bedroom, crying and wishing he would be done cooking so the slight smoke would clear out.  


And of course, the more I'm anxious over this, the more I'm anxious over everything. What if he loses his new job?  What if his new job depletes his skills and he can't find another job. And on and on and on. 


I need help but can't go on traditional meds like Paxil. I did have a script for Xanax, but that ran out a few months ago. Generally that medicine helps get me down to a starting level of zero which lets me breathe and see things more calmly.  The Xanax script was for 30 pills and lasted me for two years. The majority of the time I do okay...but this is getting beyond me. I need to find a GP in our new area.

I have been spending the last 7 months seeing a GP about anxiety and depression issues. I've been diagnosed with GAD, SAD, and depression.  I've already gone through 4 medications and I have started a 5th a couple of weeks ago.  My GP has me start off on a starting dosage for each for 4 weeks and if there are no effects, up to a higher dosage for another 4 weeks, then change medication if that doesn't do anything. 

The thing is I am not feeling anything from any medication prescribed so far. I read about people getting nauseous or dizzy, tired or having trouble sleeping. I am feeling nothing. Even from stopping medicene and going from one to another has no effect on me.  I don't know if it is an actual lack of effect that the medication has on me, or my GP is prescribing placebos. If anything it is making me more anxious.  I live too far from a town to be able to make therapy group visits and I don't even think I could handle it in my current mental state anyway.

I have one more insurance covered visit until my next one resets in June. My parents' insurance company allocates 6 covered visits per year per person which rolls over once the day the first visit comes around. I am only paying 20.00 now, but once the insurance stops, I will pay 125.00.  My insurance does not cover specialist visits so I can not afford to visit a real psychiatrist right now. I am out of work because I get minor panic attacks when I have to work with more than a few people face to face.  I have quit three jobs now due to panic attacks. I take college classes online to be able to at least further my education for in the future.   I think my attacks are caused by over-analyzing every thing I say and others say. I simulate conversations before they even happen and eventually I just break.

I think my triggers are mainly environmental. I live my parents in a rural area of a Western US state where every thing is about an hour away. I am a very skilled person with computers, but there are no opportunities here for me. I want to get out, but my mental state is making it near impossible.

I am really not sure on what I should do now.  I want to be able to do stuff without feeling the way I do. I want to move out and get my own place where my skills can shine. I want to be social. ","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1

It blows my mind that psychiatrists, nurse practitioners and PCP's prescribe ~~extremely~~ addicting anti-anxiety drugs like benzodiazepines with little to no explanation of the dangers involved with taking them, and yet when you approach those same medical professionals and say that you'd like to wean off of the addicting drugs that they initially handed out like candy, it is ~~impossible~~ (at least in my experience) to get any sort of help.

Why on Earth is this allowed to go on? I can't be the only one who has dealt with this extremely frustrating issue. If you're on even small, therapeutic dosages of these types of drugs for longer than just a few weeks you ~~will~~ get addicted and unless you're extremely lucky you'll be left to fend for yourself. 

If I knew the dangers involved and the start of the medication carousel, I never would gave touched that first bottle of Ativan. I'll probably get negative responses for this but, to those of you thinking of taking Ativan/Xanax/Klonopin/Valium daily, don't. Believe me, I know how terrifying and crippling panic attacks can be, but do yourselves a huge favor and learn how to deal with them naturually (exercise, read up about what's physically going on in your head and to your body so you have a better understanding of what's going on, meditate, etc.) before medication becomes a crutch.

I've come to the personal conclusion that my anxiety is linked to an actual chemical imbalance and not just the horrible experiences I had as a child (which didn't help) and that I need medication to regulate my brain alongside my therapy. My therapist agrees and she's referred me to a psychiatrist, although there is a lengthy waiting list of about 6 months...I may get in earlier. 

Here's the thing: I'm 17 and I'm extremely studious(and passionate). My anxiety has limited me in many ways (sound sensitivity, fear of cars/driving, fear of men, checking behavior, anxiety attacks) but I've never faltered in my studies, both personal and in an academic setting. I'm actually starting college a year early next fall and I've tested into very advanced classes (I'm an engineering major; see how the fear of men would hinder me? It's not horrible, yet, but I want to keep the problem from escalating). The process of drug administration and calibration is a tedious one and I fear that I will crash and burn (for the very first time in my life) in my studies just when I need to start being even more serious. I feel like I don't have time to experiment with drugs that could make me fat, make me extremely fatigued, make me dumber, or make me numb. I have intellectual obligations. How can I approach fixing what my therapist, my family, and I myself see as a very serious issue without creating another very serious issue (failing college and becoming apathetic about my passions)? I love learning and studying so much now and I don't want to lose that, but I fear that anxiety could cause me to lose that all the same. 

Any recommendations? Is there anyone who's successfully messed with medications in college? My mother took prozac for three years and the only side effects she had were nausea in the beginning and low-libido, and I don't mind those that much. I can handle those. But I can't handle extreme fatigue, drowsiness, apathy, flattening, or weight gain (of anymore than 5-10 lbs...I understand water weight and I'm already a low weight so trivial weight gain is no big deal to me). I absolutely cannot. 

My therapist says that I have a beautiful mind. She thinks that I have great potential and wants me to see that, too, without being clouded by my anxiety. She thinks medication is a great idea. Why would she mislead me? I'm so afraid that she doesn't actually care if I become apathetic and fail in life, even though she says that she values my mind so much. I've heard so many horror stories...","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1

I felt like a new person, ready to take on the world.  A few months ago I was hit with a panic attack that sent me back to the emergency room thinking I was dying.  I am back in therapy and changed meds to paxil.  That did not work, side effects sucked.  I then went to 20mg of lexapro (now) and still being hit with attacks and symptoms so my next step is going to a psychiatrist to evaluate me for the right meds to get back to how I use to feel.  I feel like if I could get rid of the physical symptoms I would be fine, but they are so fucking overwhelming that it paralyzes me.  I have been to therapy, have tried to fight it with breathing, benzos (I didnt like the idea of them so I stopped that to try to fight it on my own), I tried to welcome it as a visitor and make room instead of trying to fight it but it has proven time after time that I can only go against it for so long before I am fully drained and give up back into my mental state of ""I cant beat this, I am weaker than it, I cannot take the feeling"".  So I now live day by day just preparing for my next attack which has made it hard to experience happiness since anything I am looking forward to is spent worrying about it being ruineded by an attack.  I am just really hoping to find the right meds to to put me back in that state of being I had just a few months ago....but of course, I worry of the side effects and another medication not working again.

I stopped drinking.  I'm more mature. I exercise now. I'm mindful. I stay off caffine and sugar.

I moved two years ago to Kansas City with my husband. He is going to school here.  However, I have yet to find a new shrink or therapist.

Its not that I don't want more help, its that getting help in the first place was fairly crippling and the medication I have been taking has been working well so far.  I just figured the boat didn't need shaking.

The point is that I have come to the realization that the medication has maybe not been working so well in the last few weeks.  I tried vacation from work, relaxation techniques, and all the distancing exercises my last therapist taught me. 

But I can't deny the increased panic attacks, nor the near constant crying.  What I guess I am getting at is that this is was it was like before I had to be medicated in the first place.

And now I'm going into the hospital for inital treatment before my first psych appointment, which is beyond terrifying.  I've had to reschedule the appointment like two or three times already due to panic attacks.

I feel a lot more carefree and able to relax, and less freaked out and shy. But lately I have been feeling kind of weird and it's starting to scare myself because I feel like doing a lot of things that I would normally not be okay with. For example, for the last couple of weeks I went to visit my family (I'm in college) and old friends, and I ended up going out and partying and getting drunk 3 times within 2 weeks. Normally I only drink once or twice a month maximum. I also feel really really outgoing, and I've been making a lot more friends. But it's weird though, because I feel more outgoing in a bad way. I am engaged, and one of the times I went to a party I got a little too drunk and started holding hands with one of my guy friends and then I ended up kissing him. I woke up the next day feeling incredibly stupid and guilty. A month ago I would never ever have ever thought of doing something like that. I love my fiance and realized I made a huge mistake. But I've been feeling really reckless and self-destructive lately. One of the other times I drank I was at the beach, and I drunk dialed my friend and told him I was going to jump into the ocean and kill myself. He had to drive out there before I could do anything too stupid. I honestly have never done anything like this in my life, I am usually a really careful person who does good in school and is a perfectionist, and I hate people who act the way like I've been acting. Do you think my medication could be making me feel like this?

I think this was due to having to make a major decision on going away to College and all the major changes that come with it.  Also during this time I was switching birth control from Depo Prevera to Lo loesterin FE.  During this time I would lay in bed some days and couldn't stop worrying or get certain issues off my mind.  This seemed to paralyze me and keep from my normally busy and active lifestyle  After a few months of this I was prescribed Setraline (Zoloft) and have been taking a 100 mg dosage after working my way up from 50 mg.  I also switched back to Depo Prevera for contraception.  I am happy to say after almost 6 months of being on the dosage of Setraline, I feel like my normal self and have almost successfully completed a semester of college away from home!  I am wondering now since I am in a good place if it is wise to ween myself off my medication, as I feel like I no longer need it.  I have read that this medication causes difficulty with orgasm which I believe I am experiancing, but I have nothing to compare it to since I lost my virginity in this time period- I know for a fact though I do not and never have had a low libido.  I also have frequent and vivid nightmares on the medication- sometimes I forget whether it is reality or not they are so life like.  Anyways besides these issues the meds are not effecting my life in anyway except positively- if at all.  I would love some advice!  Is it advisable to ween myself off of this medication?

I went to the doctor and mentioned the anxiety. He prescribed Lexapro 10mg. I'm here to see if anyone can relate some experience to taking anti-anxiety meds to combat such an issue.

On my first day, I woke up at 4 AM and had the worst anxiety attack I've ever experienced, complete with retching and screaming. It was horrifying. I've literally never been so scared in my life. I improved steadily on a daily basis until my seventh day. I went to bed feeling great, then woke up at 4 AM having another anxiety attack. Since that day (Wednesday) I've barely been able to force myself to eat. Part of it's the fear of retching or throwing up, and part of it's just that the meds kill my appetite. I haven't slept through an entire night in over a week. I've lost like 10 pounds. The good feelings I built up the first week are slowly being replaced by a cold, black curtain of anxiety like I've never experienced in my life. I spent Thursday in a hellish, sleepless haze, unable to eat or focus on anything besides my misery. Yesterday was better, but by the end of it I was panicking again and had to go home early from my boyfriend's house. Today I've decided to drop the meds. It's still very hard to eat and I'm still pretty anxious.     

I know it's normal to have to try more than one medication. But I just don't think I can do it, after this week. I don't think I can face down the possibility of new or worse side effects. If I actually vomited or hallucinated I think I'd lose it. The possibility of suicidal thoughts terrifies me. I've spent this entire week teetering on the edge and I'm still so scared. I'm honestly regretting that I ever tried.         

I think my anxiety and depression are largely situational. I was very depressed because I was living with my mother who I thought didn't understand my mental health issues. Over the past week, the best thing that's happened is that we've patched up. She understands now. I think that's why I was feeling so much better, so instantly, after that first hard day. Everything's out in the light. I'm not hiding and stumbling along anymore.    

I'm going to my first therapy session on Monday. I want to try just therapy alone and see where that gets me. I think that, despite thinking of myself as pretty savvy, I was desperate and looking for a magic cure to make everything go away, when this is something I could probably work through without meds. I think for someone like me, with the fears I have, they should remain a last resort.     

My greatest fear right now is that I've opened some sort of door and the anxiety attacks are here to stay. I'm looking for reassurance, from people who've maybe done the same thing. I'm relatively convinced the meds are causing the attacks, because again, I've *never* been this anxious in my entire life. No job interview, speech, or social situation has ever pushed me into the dark places that citalopram has.    

I think I'm on the right track again, I'm just scared.

I've been on Citalopram (20mg) for a little over a year now. I was first prescribed it last March, 2012. I haven't went up on my dose yet, though I think I'd benefit from it. I'm kind of nervous to. 

I'm not a drinker of alcohol at all. Back about two years ago, I'd drink some wine (like a glass) a few times a week. It makes my shoulders heavy (not all alcohol, but a lot of it), and my mom has a bad problem with alcohol so I try to stay away from it for the most part.

I'm going to Las Vegas for the first time this week with my boyfriend and best friend, and I want to drink at least one drink at the casinos or something. I do not have any plans to get shitfaced, out of my mind drunk, or even to the point where I'm stumbling. I just want to step outside my comfort zone a little and enjoy a few drinks.

Since I've never been a drinker, I've never consumed alcohol while on Citalopram. I've tasted my friend's margarita or something, but no actual drinking. My medicine has a big fat ""DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL WHILE TAKING THIS MEDICATION"" sticker on the side of the bottle. Why is this? From what I have understood, Citalopram just greatly intensifies the affects of alcohol - is this true, or is there actual harm in it? Am I most likely going to be safe with a drink or two, a few times a week while I'm there?

I'd totally ask my doctor this, but the ONE doctor I finally felt comfortable with (and who prescribed the citalopram) just moved away. I'm stuck in between right now trying to find another. :(",['nsubj'],1

I must say, I was a little disappointed when the doctor pulled me from the SSRI even though it had been 4 weeks.  So far though, this medicine seems to be doing the trick.

You guys and gals here probably read this thing a thousand times, but I'm really quite unsure about whether or not I have this anxiety, so feel free to read it and give your opinion, if not, have a nice day. 

So I'm 15 years old and I had some ""anxiety"" for the past couple of years. This includes an undying fear of talking in front of people (to the point where I ask my teachers if I can skip an oral presentation). To even think about doing an oral presentation makes my sick to my stomach, makes me shake, makes me try to avoid school or anybody else. But strangely enough, when I do perform these presentations, I am not terrible, though I think I get sort of numb (?) when I do these presentations. 

For the longest time, I've never been able to look people in the eye. Doing so feels so... wrong? I also cannot have people looking or reading things I've written down, and I despise when I am being watched while working (which teachers sometimes do). 

I've been to a psychiatrist who said I do in fact have social anxiety and put me on prozac. I don't feel like any medication is helping, but I also don't believe my doctor. I mean, I've read what people who suffer social anxiety are actually like, and I feel I do not meet the criteria. I can still physically talk to people, I have some friends, and I don't think I've had any panic attacks (?). I feel like social anxiety is just something that overly diagnosed and I was one of those people. 

I truly want to know if I do have anxiety or am just normal (which is to say, do not suffer from anxiety). It would be a huge weight off my shoulders if I can hear from people who do in fact have social anxiety, and are maybe willing to share their experiences with me? 

Thank you in advance. ",['nsubj'],1

In March I became very sick and would get very dizzy. This prevented me from driving as anytime I would drive I would start to get this feeling that I'm going to black out and would need to pull over. Fast forward to about April of this year and my sickness is mostly gone. Most of my issues were stomach problems and after speaking to my GI doctor should not have anything to do with me feeling dizzy while driving.

I can sometimes drive to and from work without any issues. Almost never have an issue while actually driving to work in the mornings. But a majority of the time when I leave to go home for the day on my drive home I'll start to get this same feeling again that I'm going to pass out which causes me to pull over and I usually have to have someone come pick me up as it won't usually go away for a few hours and makes me feel pretty nauseous.

At first I thought everything would go back to normal after my sickness was gone, but that doesn't appear to be the case. The only medication I'm on is Omeprazole which I have been told should not cause any issues. This has gotten me to thinking that it may be anxiety. I'm not sure why it doesn't usually (very rarely) effect me in my drives to work in the morning other than the fact that I may not be fully awake and thinking at the time. However, I would like to get over this and be able to drive myself. This past year having to depend on others for rides has been a hassle.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? If so does anyone have any tips on how to over come this? I keep trying to force myself to drive even when I feel sick thinking maybe I can power through it and it will go away. But that doesn't appear to be the case. 

Appreciate any advice.",['nsubj'],1

Those were awful, but luckily my medicine calmed them, and I haven't had one in a while. However, it's been replaced by my already existing fear of dying and amplified. I moved across the country about four months ago, and my anxiety and fears have increased.

I was comfortable where I lived before, and now I've been uprooted. I chose to come here, because my boyfriend lives here, and I wanted him, but I left everything even though it wasn't much. I have a mental health appointment coming up next month, but I feel like it's too strenuous to wait. I am on the verge of tears all the time. 

My anxiety cripples me. It's hard to do activities, because I fear my heart is gonna give out. I obsess. I check my pulse practically 100 times a day. Every feeling is a symptom of heart failure. It eats at me no matter how hard I try to talk myself into rationality. When I eat my brain interprets my fullness as danger and makes me feel like my heart is gonna give out. I'm 24 (basically; birthday in a week) and have no health problems or history of heart disease. I'm overweight, so this contributes to my phobia and fears. 

It's a struggle just to get through the day. Sometimes I do nothing because it makes me feel safe, but I force myself to clean the house, shower, and take care of myself because I just need to. I have to. I can't let it completely control me, but sometimes it wins. 

I don't want to die right now. Every single feeling is danger to me. Why? I just want this to stop.. I want this to go away. I was just trying to sleep, but I couldn't. I woke myself up and had to catch my breath because I was convinced I was dying. Someone tell me this is ""normal"" for people with anxiety. Someone give me something to relate to.

Even after 4 years of having not drawn form life I went in and blew people away, jaws dropped and compliments flew. People make the assumption that I think I am not good and that is why I don't make art... the truth is that is causes me EXTREME panic when I do (and their responses are not much help.) I almost started crying today! It is funny because I know and can feel that I enjoy making art. But then the sweep of excitement and distress fills me. It is delirium. My heart nearly pops out of my chest- and somehow I made it through 4 years of art school like that lol.

I am going to work on reinterpreting that feeling- I think that is my only option because meds have not worked- it destroys my ability to make art- and not making art has not worked either...

When I was about 13, I started harming myself. One day, my parents noticed blood soaking through my clothes, and I ended up in a mental hospital. I got prescribed meds that made me feel worse, and I decided that what I felt before was better than what the meds made me feel. I stopped taking them, and, eventually, I found the ability to be happy.

Then, earlier this year, the depression returned, and it was more intense than it had ever been before. I got a two month free trial for Fetzima, and it really, really worked. I felt amazing. There was just one issue: it was $10 a pill. Because of this, I had to find an alternative to dealing with my depression.

First up was a prescription for Cymbalta. I woke up, took it, and left for school. I take the lightrail(train) to school everyday. On the train, I started feeling extremely hot. Then my body started to get tingly. then I got dizzy, and then I felt like I was going to fucking puke. My chest hurt, and my throat felt like it was closing up. I didn't know what the fuck was going on. All i could do was sink in to my seat take sips of water. This feeling lasted for around 4-5 hours. It was scariest, most intense feeling I had ever felt. Then it happened again when I tried effexor a couple days later.

Since then, I have chest aches almost constantly. When I wake up my chest feel almost ""empty"" or ""airy"". My limbs are pretty much constantly warm and/or tingly(this also occasionally happens to my scalp), and my chest just feels tight a lot. My doctor chalked this to acid reflux(even though I don't even fucking regurgitate), and physical manifestations of anxiety. I usually don't feel anxious when these things happen, most of the time. They usually help get me there. 

I had a really sever issue with taking pills for a while, but I overcame that and took prilosec for a month to fix the acid reflux. It kinda helped. I've completely changed things around and cut a bunch of shit out of my diet. Still feel that way a lot.

I even get anxious about stupid shit now. Having allergy issues and headaches makes me feel like I have a fucking brain tumor, and I feel like I'm dying when I get sick. The chest aches I get from whatever the fuck causes them always, without fail, make me feel like I could be having a heart attack. 

Recently, my eye prescription changed on one eye, and I freaked out wondering what the fuck might have caused that. Then, the fact that one eye is more off than the other obviously fucked with my head. I freaked out because I had a hard time focusing, and I was kinda dizzy a lot because of it. I just need to get new glasses before I can stop worrying about this bullshit. If that doesn't fix it then i'll really freak the fuck out.

Today I was on a plane, and I started having physical symptoms of anxiety without even feeling consciously anxious. It's fucking crazy and it fucking sucks.

The whole thing just makes everyday life really hard. I'm doing okay, but holy shit, sometime it just smacks me right in the face.
Sorry for all of the language and any rambling/possible mistakes, I just got so stressed out writing this. I just don't know what to do, and i just wanted to rant to people that get the feeling. I never knew that the physical aspect of anxiety was so intense. Fuck.",['nsubj'],1

Then about ten minutes later I had a rush of dizziness and just a general ""weird"" feeling. Since my anxiety is mostly centered around fear of having a severe allergic reaction to medication / suffocating to death from inexplicable and magical causes, this freaked me the hell out.

I called my doctor's office but she was out, and the receptionist said she'd try to reach her and call me back. While I waited for a call, my boyfriend talked to me and tried to figure out if I was really having something medically bad happen, or if it was a panic attack. I started to calm down, stopped feeling weird, and we decided it was a panic attack. My doctor called back, I told her it was just a panic attack and she said the dizziness and weird feeling was normal, and that I should be okay in a few minutes.

**PART 1: BACKSTORY:** 

I've had anxiety problems since developing a phobia as a child but have always been scared to take medication. My symptoms are a giant laundry list, a little of every dumb coping mechanism and they started to get worse as I entered my 20s. 

Three months ago I finally went and saw a doctor, who prescribed me a low dose of Ativan to take when I was having panic attacks. The first time I took it it was incredible - I felt like there was a clenched fist inside of my chest that had suddenly released. At the time I was working a very stressful job, so I started taking a dose before particularly stressful shifts. 

After I'd taken the pills several times (throughout a few weeks) I started feeling a serious increase of anxiety. Not only that - weakness, and a feeling like I was going to faint at any moment. I went back to my doctor and he said I could take them a little more often if I needed them. I never thought that the pills had anything to do with it. 



**PART 2: PROBLEMS WITH PILLS**
 
I started taking them daily for the better part of two weeks. Still, just a single low dose - .5mg or 1mg. But things got worse and worse, and my anxiety level was insane. I ended up passing out at work one night, and then being sent home again a few days later because of a panic attack. Every time I went out of the house I would get severe episodes of depersonalization. I also started talking and walking around in my sleep, which I've never done before. I became hypersensitive to EVERYTHING - if I went out in the heat for anything longer than a few minutes I'd start getting heat exhaustion, any strong scents started to give me migraines. 

It was horrifying -- on top of that I started feeling increasingly depressed and started thinking about suicide more and more. All I did was go to work, come home and cry until I went to sleep. I was unable to function. I went out one night to catch a bus to visit my mother (who was worried about me) and let six buses pass me by before having a panic attack and having to go home. 



**PART 3: THE AFTERMATH**

So, I quit my job. I also stopped taking the pills - just trying to do a fresh start. For the first week I felt like I was recovering from a horrible flu - I was weak, dizzy, couldn't sleep for more than a few hours. Breathing was weirdly more difficult than usual.  But after a week I started feeling all the insane effects start to lessen - most noticeably the depersonalization. 

That was a month ago -- and since then I'm starting to feel a lot better, but I've had an incredibly hard time leaving my house, or doing much else. The last time I talked to my doctor he said I had very low blood pressure, which may have been made worse by the drugs -- but surely didn't cause all of the symptoms. 



**EPILOGUE: SO MANY QUESTIONS!**

Has anyone else dealt with side effects like this? If so, what other type of medication has worked for you? I honestly didn't suspect the medication was causing any of my problems, since I took it to stop those very issues. I know benzos are usually a godsend (if not, brief) for anxiety, and I've never heard of anyone reacting like I did to them. I'm scared to try any other medicine, but I think I probably need it at this point - at least as a stepping off point for improving this. 

Thank you for reading this, and for any thoughts or advice to the matter!

After several months of living with my anxiety under control, it appears as though things are going south. :( My depression suddenly flared up quite severely about a month ago, and hasn't gone away since. For me, the depression and anxiety go hand-in-hand, so this is very frustrating.

I currently take 100mg of Zoloft and 25mg (I think) of Ativan as needed. However, I'm beginning to think I need a change in meds. Zoloft never really worked the way I expected an antidepressent to work, if that makes sense. I didn't really expect it to instantly cure my troubles or anything, but the medication only really ever took the edge off.

Since everything's coming back with such force, I realized I need to get this under control once and for all. I don't want to even have to think about anxiety in public anymore. I'm willing to try whichever meds my psychiatrist recommends and will stick with whichever one helps me!

My friend passed away from cancer when I was a high school student. I began to think about life and death a lot. A lot. At first I denied anxiety when family would suggest it, and I honest to God did not believe I was being anxious about anything. 

I began feeling funny in class. I started shaking, feeling like something was different when I woke up. I couldn't shake off the feeling. My brother picked me up from school about 4 times because I called him and said I couldn't be at school anymore.

I was a health student so I started learning about diseases. I thought I had every single one of them. When I visited the doctor about my weird feeling, I said to him that I was sure I was anemic. The anemia test came back negative and he sent me home with anxiety medicine. At that point I came to the conclusion that I was suffering from a small anxiety phase, but I wasn't clinically diagnosed. However, since he didn't refer me to a psychologist or psychiatrist, I started to think I didn't have anxiety. The medicine made me sleepy and I felt better. But I didn't finish it because he said to take it as needed. 

The year went on and I felt better. My freshman year in college was great, until I broke up with my boyfriend. I lost all my motivation to do anything. Even when I stopped crying about him I didn't want to do my work. My grandpa died, and I started feeling bad again. I cried all the time about death and life. The anxiety I used to feel became worse. My boyfriend and I got back together and everything was a bit better. Especially because I learned to not be dependent on him and focused on myself for those few months apart. I did not tell my family about my constant breakdowns. I am now a sophomore in college. I worry all the time. About the people that I love dying. About what happens post death. I told my sister and she said to pray but I am agnostic so it did not really help. I think this is a lot bigger than a small plead to God. My parents/brothers have so much going and and I don't have insurance and cannot afford to talk to a psychiatrist/psychologist. 

I'm a girl. I cannot express my feelings easily. I tried talking to a helpline but all they said was ""its normal to worry"" but my worrying is out of hand. I worry every minute. I cannot go an hour or two hours without thinking something may go wrong. It's not healthy and it's killing me inside. I cry so much and I think that this, if it is anxiety, can lead to depression. I am a science major and don't have much time to be stress free. But I am on a scholarship and cannot afford to slack off or take a year off. 

I really don't know what to do. I need to tell my family but I don't know if they would understand. Some days it is really bad. Some days I wake up and things are okay. It's when my mind isn't busy that makes this feeling worse. 

When I was younger my brother said to me, ""do you know why that girl got kidnapped? Because she wasn't worried that that was going to happen!"" And so I always worry about worst case scenarios.

When I'm fully triggered my mind goes to mush. My intelligence diminishes to that of a mentally retarded person's. When I feel like that my anxiety increases to the point where I feel so overwhelmed and fucked up that I just can't take it. It genuinely feels unbearable.

What the fuck am I going to do? What if medication doesn't work? What if therapy doesn't work? I FUCKING HATE FEELING LIKE THIS!",['nsubj'],1

It was finals week and I was under a lot of stress. The same thing happened last semester. (Last semester was worse, actually.) Now I have a cough again. I don't really get sick too often so I'm a little worried now. Maybe it's an infection or something I need prescription medicine for? 

Anyway, I sent my mom a Facebook message. (Because despite living together, that's the only way I can reach her!) I asked her if there as something I could take. She told me to suck on a cough drop if allergy medication wasn't working. I told her I was wheezing and mucus was coming up when I coughed. I told her I think I needed something more than a cough drop. I also told her I was taking allergy medicine every day and I didn't think it would be allergies. She told me to call my doctor, make an appointment, and have my boyfriend come with me. 

Ugh. 

Okay, I'm not his responsibility. Yes, we're absolutely soul mates. Yes, we plan on getting married. Yes, I know he'd have absolutely no problem taking me. That isn't the point. It isn't his job yet. There's no ring on my finger. It pisses me off that as soon as there's a guy in my life she think they'll take care of me instead. 

Also, and this is the part that made me write this post, I HAVE ANXIETY!! I'm basically one step away from being scared of my own shadow. Does she understand how terrifying the thought of calling a doctor, making an appointment, and going to an appointment is?! I tried ordering Chinese food once and literally burst into tears on the phone. What if I mess up and say something stupid? What if I make the appointment for a bad time? What do I even do when I get there? I don't have any of my information. I don't even know what kind of insurance we have! 

I try to tell her this. I try to tell her how hard life is with anxiety. (And I have PTSD too on top of it!) You know what she says? ""Oh stop it. You'll be fine. You're not retarded."" I can't even begin to respond to that because there's so many things wrong with that statement. 

I get it, I'm going to be 21 years old soon. I'm in college. I'm talking about getting married. I *should* be able to make a doctors appointment and go myself. I'm well aware of that. Unfortunately, I was cursed with 2 mental illnesses and there's a lot of things I *should* be able to do but I *can't*. Well, not without embarrassing myself and feeling like I'm going to die. 

I don't want to be that ""special snowflake"" that thinks the world should cater to them. I know there's times when I have to fight through the anxiety and do things I think I can't do. I do those things every day. I don't think asking for little things like this is a big deal. She could always just acknowledge my anxiety and slowly help me to learn how to do this sort of thing myself. 

You can't just throw someone into a situation without telling them how it works. Why couldn't she have started when I was a little younger? Why couldn't she have said ""Sit here and watch how to call for an appointment!"" or showed me what paperwork was being exchanged and what information I needed to know? She wanted me to go to a mechanic and get a tire fixed once without having any knowledge of anything like that. That's such a dumb thing to do. 

My boyfriend would absolutely help me. I'm pretty sure he'd know what information we'd need. He could get it from my mom and make sure we have everything. But wouldn't it look weird having my boyfriend do what my mom should be doing? I mean, even though I'm almost 21 a lot of moms baby their kids. I'm assuming that to doctors and other people it just seems like she babies me. My boyfriend's mom offered to call and pretend to be my mom. But me, my boyfriend's mom, and my mom all use the same doctor so I'm pretty sure she'd know the difference. His mom has a slight Italian accent and my mom has a pretty strong Bronx accent. 

I know there's no reason my doctor shouldn't know about my anxiety. But I'm not ready to talk to a medical doctor about it yet. I was in therapy for like 10 years of my life. I have no problem talking to them about it. But I'm scared my doctor will just think I'm trying to get drugs or something. 

TL;DR: My mom doesn't want to acknowledge my anxiety so she tries to force me to jump into situations I don't want to jump into. She won't help me take baby steps. She things I'm my boyfriend's problem now.  ","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1

I've been eating healthy and exercising, yet I still have this feeling like my whole body is tense and I'm a big open nerve. The best way I can describe it is that feeling when you're sitting in a chair at your desk and you tip backward and almost fall but catch yourself. Only it's all the time.

I have a numb spot that comes and goes in the middle of my forehead, my chest feels unusually tight all the time, I've have had constant high blood pressure for about 6 months and was given medication. I'm 27. I wake up startled every morning, that's when the anxious feeling hits me the hardest but it never really dissipates, just kind of lessens a little through the day. I have acne on my face, chest, back. Sometimes I get these dizzy feelings like I'm going to pass out. I can't seem to hold my thoughts and my memory is terrible. I'm a bright person, and this depresses me greatly. I tend to hide away from people because of how just a tiny little bit of stress makes me hit the roof inside. I don't want to weird them out or make an ass of myself.

I'm not medicated with anti-depressants because nothing has seemed to help me, these last 6 years. Zoloft, Gabapentin, Lexapro, Paxil, Welbutrin, Xanax, Valium, Lithium, Prozac, etc. I feel like they're experimenting with me :/ These mental medications have just seemed make my emotions all wonky without lessening the feeling I have. And I have to hold a job, I support myself alone. I'm getting to a breaking point though.

I've had my thyroid levels checked and my T3 level is always just a tiny, tiny bit low. I had my kidneys ultrasounded for adrenal nodes and nothing came up. I had a 24 hr urine catch and my cortisol levels were just a tiny tiny bit elevated. None of these warranted any action by doctors. I was diagnosed with PCOS, and put on birth control. That really threw my body out of whack, and that's when I decided to start eating healthy and exercising.

I have normal stressors, but nothing that should make me feel like my life is constantly in danger.

Can anybody relate, or point me in any kind of direction? Has anybody here ever had constant, unrelenting anxiety?","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1

I have no clue what triggered my anxiety to be honest. Prior to junior year, I can say that I generally lived a happy life and I don't ever recall feeling the way I do now. Towards the second half of junior year, I began to develop serious anxiety. In class, I would always feel extremely anxious and nervous. I became very paranoid when I was surrounded by other students. I felt like people were constantly staring at me and judging me and this made me really anxious. As a result of this constant fear of people looking at me, I started having spontaneous tremors, cold and sweaty palms,stopped asking questions in class, became less social, started having difficulties making eye contact in certain situations, and it practically became impossible for me to concentrate in class. Also, I started developing strange habits in class in an effort to cope with the anxiety. I always felt like I had to have my hand touching my face in order to stop my self from having a full blown anxiety attack with tremors and to shield myself from other people's eyes. It's extremely difficult for me now to sit up straight in class without touching my face, especially when I'm sitting in an area of a classroom where I'm really visible to the students around me. My grades dropped severely as result of my anxiety and I started skipping school pretty much every other day in order to get away from my anxiety.  My anxiety pretty much destroyed my SAT grade when I first took it because I was so nervous. My Junior year was a constant struggle with social anxiety. It was pretty much on my mind 24/7.
  The summer after junior year I convinced myself that I'd find a way to do away with my social anxiety somehow before school started again. Unfortunately, I just got done with my second day of senior year and feel even more anxious now at school than I did junior year. I honestly have no fucking clue how I got through these last two days. My anxiety is so bad now that I make the people around me extremely uncomfortable. I can't even hide it anymore. It really bothers me that other people have to suffer as a result of my own internal struggle. When I walk into a class I can tell that the people who sit next to me are extremely reluctant to sit through an entire class period next to me because they feel nervous as hell as a result of the way I act. My actual friends at school are starting to feel the same way as my classmates when I approach them. I'm 100% sure that they all have noticed my strange behavior now. I feel anxious around them as well. The worst part about all of this, to me, is that I have so much potential to be more social but my anxiety is preventing me from doing so. A lot of girls think I'm attractive but they don't approach me because I always look distraught.All in all, I can't live life like this anymore. I don't mean that in a suicidal way, because never in my life have I seriously thought about it and I'm definitely smart enough to know that suicide solves nothing.  I'm tired of being depressed all the time and feeling anxious around people. I KNOW that other people's opinions about me do not matter AT ALL but it's like I can't convince my fight-or-flight system and my brain otherwise (Kind of contradictory, I know). How do I get rid of this anxiety and turn back into the old me that was happy? Do meds genuinely help? I feel like if I take meds I won't really be solving the problem at hand and instead I'd be taking the easy way out. I don't really like the idea of unnaturally altering my brain chemistry in order to deal with a problem I should be able to handle myself, but I feel like it's becoming more of a necessity now.

Put on a rainbow of medication, most recently zoloft. Stopped about 2 years ago (cold turkey) when I was 18. Everything was fine for a year until my parents got divorced and it all went downhill. 

This past year: Binge eating, gained 20 lbs. Extreme depression over weight gain, starved self. Now currently at a calorie deficit of 200-500 so my body can recover. In and out of the hospital for depression/anxiety/suicide related issues over the summer. Refused to take medication for fear of weight gain. Not bipolar, although the doctor wanted to put me on depakote. 

Now: Recently started back up at (new) school, unable to talk to anybody. Can't make friends, can't talk to professors, can't make eye contact with people I've known for years. In social situations I feel my heart race and my entire body burns. I was sent to meet with a therapist but I couldn't find her office so I began to shake and cry. I called her office for help, they ignored my calls for an hour or so. When they finally came back I told them to go fuck themselves. Also developing an overwhelming fear of death. Everything I do, I think I'm going to die. When I cross the street, in the back of my head that car is going to speed up and hit me then drive away while I bleed out. Last night, I tried to pop a pimple on my face but it didn't go anywhere so now I am convinced that the pus went into my blood stream and is now headed to my brain where it will infect my brain and I will die of an infection. Part of me tries to rationalize with myself, telling myself that I'm overreacting and it's not likely that I'm going to develop meningitis or any other infection from popping a pimple, but the slight chance is there and it's taking over any sliver of rationality I have left. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist next friday, but I'm scared the meds he gives me will make me gain weight.

I'm terrified, I'm spinning out of control. Right now as I'm typing this I can feel my pimple pussing into my brain. I'm having heart palpitations just thinking about it. I don't know what to do, it hasn't been this bad in ages.","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1

What are the symptoms of my anxiety?  My head/neck twitches, I get a headache, my muscles stiffen up, my heart pounds, diarrhea, stomach cramps, I cannot think straight, and I feel tense all over.  I usually do not get all of those symptoms at the same time, but I always get at least one of those to a severe degree.
When do I experience anxiety?  Anytime I leave my “room”.  Yeah, I am 36 and still only have a room.  I have a hard time just being around my parents.  I often have a hard time getting through a checkout line at the grocery store.  My muscles often stiffen up and I tremble.  In pretty much any situation where there are people, I have a lot of anxiety that always involves physical symptoms.   Xanax helps a little, but not much.
What has my life been like with severe social anxiety?  I have been mostly isolated in a room with a computer and t.v. for most of the 17 years.  I guess you can imagine what that might be like.  For awhile, I had a vehicle and got out a little, but my dad decided to sell it a few years ago, so he could afford another vacation.  My parents support me, but that is about it.  They do not care enough to help.  They do not want to spend time or money on me, so I can get better.  They just ignore me and go on with life, like nothing is wrong.  They go on vacations, etc. instead of paying money for therapy.  I have no friends and have never really had many.  Relatives do not care and ignore me or insult me.   I guess things could be worse though.  My parents could have let me go homeless, as my mother reminds me when I ask why they did not help me.  Some people sure have it worse, but my parents have/had the means to help and they did not.  That makes me really sad that they care more about going on vacations, etc. instead of helping their own son!  
Maybe it has always been up to me to help myself out, on my own.  I have tried, but it is pretty hard when your head twitches, your muscles freeze up, and you often cannot think straight, etc. around people!  A lot of people treat me like I have the power to help myself.  They do not believe my anxiety is bad and they think I am just “lazy.”
What treatments have I tried?  As far as medications go, I have tried almost all of the SSRIs and SNRIs, multiple times.  I have tried MAOIS and tricyclic antidepressants, multiple times.  I have tried many other drugs off-label: anti-psychotics, Gabapentin, etc. etc.  I have tried so many things and I cannot remember them all.  Doctors and myself gave up, awhile back.  I was told that I was in the “refractory group” and that the only thing that would work for me is “gene therapy”.  
As far as psychotherapy goes, I have tried a few things.  Mostly relaxation and biofeedback stuff, awhile back.  I think something like C.B.T. might work, but I cannot afford it, since I have no income or health insurance. 
What are the causes of my anxiety?  I am not sure, but I am guessing it is a combination of genetics and environment.  My father has bipolar disorder and some O.C.D.  My grandfather was somewhat of a hermit/loner and I suspect he may have had social anxiety.  Nobody really talked about it though and for many years, I did not think there was anything wrong with him. I had to experience S.A.D. first to figure it out.  He found a way to work around his anxiety though and self-treated with alcohol and cigarettes.  His life could have been much better though.  
A big problem with society is that many people do not talk about mental illnesses,  even today.  I guess it is better than it used to be, but mostly people just ignore people with mental illness and the problem itself.
I have always been a bit different.  Somewhat of a free spirit, I guess.  When I was growing up, I did not like sports and I just never fit in.  My father’s O.C.D. and control freak personality, meant that I could not have many toys.  He could not stand clutter, so I could not have toys out.  So, eventually I stopped getting toys and just got books.  He was too overprotective too.   I just did not get to do the same things other kids got to do.  I got glasses in 4th grade and my vision has progressively become worse and worse, since then.  It turns out that I have Keratoconus, a progressive eye disease.  So, my glasses kept getting thicker, I got braces, I was fat, and I was different.  All of that added up to getting bullied and ignored, up through Junior High.  In 8th grade, I got contacts, got my braces off, and slimmed down.  I fought back at bullies and won.  It did not matter though.  The damage was done.  I generally was ignored in High School.  I did get attention from girls starting at age 17, because I was good looking, but I just was too aloof and shy to get anywhere.  That happens why you are ignored and isolated.
When I was 19, it all hit me hard.  My neck started twitching at work and I started getting tension headaches.  I ended up being fired, and that is when my severe anxiety started.  
I tried college, but I was just too anxious to be able to stay in class for long.  My head and neck was always tense and twitched, I got diarrhea and cramps, and I was generally nervous.  I later went back to a Community College, starting in my late 20s, and I eventually got an Associates degree in Computer Science.  I had to be doped up on a lot of Xanax and Klonopin (benzos) to get through it though and it was tough.  I built up a tolerance to the benzos and so they do not really help anymore, and they are just bad drugs.  I eventually got off of them and I still in protracted withdrawal.
Why did I write all of this up?  I don’t know.  I have been really depressed lately.  It maybe part of protracted benzo withdrawal, as I have read that that is common.   I have been thinking about how much my anxiety has affected my life and I do not see much hope.  It is hard to have much hope in life when you are disabled and nobody cares about you, for so long.

Any advice?

After a month of taking the anti depressent I was having more problems staying asleep then normal, and my anxiety was really coming through and affecting me on a daily basis more frequently and intensely. I went to the doctor, explained all of this hoping he would give me something that would actually work (he did give me buspar a weak anxiety med that did nothing good for me, stopped taking them after three weeks under his guidance) this time. He said he wasnt going to give me anything more when he took me off the busprone, and i should try relaxation techniques and continued therapy. I am, and have been doing both religiously with little gain from either. The therapy does work more, and I am planning on continuing it for as long as it helps.

However I have known for a long time I have GAD and social anxiety. Both my dr and therapist agreed, and confirmed my diagnoses. I know medication cannot be the only answer, but I think I am in an extreme state of anxiety lately, and I feel Ive tried every non medicinal way I know of with no relief.
