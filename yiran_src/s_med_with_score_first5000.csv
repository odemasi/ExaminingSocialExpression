- Careful attention to diet (Low glycemic index foods, lots of vegetables)

- Heavy cardio exercise 3-5 times a week (3km runs and soccer)

- General blood tests (Vitamin and mineral levels, e.g - iron)

- Thyroid via blood test

- Testosterone levels via blood test

- A sleep study, to rule out sleep apnoea

- 3 years of seeing a psychologist (ACT I think, some CBT)

----

Yet to check:

- Adrenal function tests (Maybe that was already tested as part of blood tests, to be confirmed)

Anything else I should check before accepting the side effects I might get from medication?"

New symptoms not present before:
-Pain in left arm (only began today) and it went away after a few hours, has not returned
-the feeling of something stuck in my throat permanently 
-my limbs go numb really fast when I sleep on them (never used to)
-very constipated(I get enough fiber and drink lots of water)
-my throat feels incredibly dry all the time even after a healthy dose of water throughout the day 
Returning symptoms:
-the feeling of my heart dropping in my chest 
-churning stomach as If I were nervous all the time
-shortness of breath

Im in my first year of high school,and did not experience this until near the beginning of september.I wake up and feel nauseous,like having to throw up.I get shortness of breath and feel like I cant breathe.Ive tried to take deep breaths but this turned to be counter productive because it dried out my throat.There is constantly ""flem"" in my throat,presumably due to allergies as diagnosed by my doctor but allergy meds nevef worked,I simpy cope.This made me feel like I was choking on the flem bassically.Other symptoms include my fingertipz,feet,and teeth starting to go numb and burping.I have no conclusive link as to why it happened during the weekend,but I assume it is because I was in an area that reminded me of the school.I was in a store,and mainly it was the cold temlerature."
